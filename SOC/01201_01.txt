AItheugli there lias been somne damage to

that the returns to the husbandman will exceed those c-ecured in any previcus year.

The advantages that wouid resuit from a

view of the wonderful variety and extent; cf

opened for improved trade arrangements with

is, to many of us at this time, a most important and interesting event, the first
session of a new parliament under the
auspices of a new governent and un-der
the guidance of a new Governor General.
In the first place 1 have great pleasure
in reciproýating the kindly message of Hîs
Royal Highness the Duke of Cennaught,
the Governor General for our Dominion.
We have had, during the history of our
country, a succession of able men acting
as Governors General, but now, for the
first time in our history, we have a memiber of the royal family of Great Britain,
and in his person wie have not only a
meinber of the royal famnily and a son
of that distinguishied Queen whose naine
will unquestionably go -down to history as!
one of the greatest women who ever lived,
one who passed, during two generations,
across the greatest theatre of human affairs in ever -rowing dignity and spiendour, but wie recognize ini the Governor
who bas been sent to us a man of ability,
a man of administrative capacity, a soldier, and from whose presence amongst us
-ie ought to and ne doubt will derive inspiration and advantage. We are aise delighted with the presence in our midst of
Her Royal Highness the Duchess. It is
too soon, perhaps, te pronounce, and perhaps not very gracious to suggest coinpanisons, in any case, but it seems evident
to the people of Canada thaît the Duke of
Conziaught and His Royal Consort are
winning- a place in the affections of our
people already, and are regarded as eminently qurnlified to adorn the high station
in which they are placed, and to stimulate
the people of this countr~y to great and if
possible greater efforts Vo fill a -more important part in that great circle of nations
which some of us at least-I for onehope to see eventually round out inte
greater Britain. 1 hope te see the dreamn
of imperial federation coînpletely realized,
and I think, it is an ag-reeab]e indication
that just at this precise tîme we have had
sent te preside over our affairs here a
member of the royal fainily, who ha<I had
se distinguished a career. Although we
hear se much of peace nowadiys, it is undoubtedily borne in upen us that the true
way to preserve nnd maintain peace snd

ing from a small beginning to great development under conditions which did not
exist at any pîevious pcriod ef the world's
history. We have lived in Canada and
pursued our activities nearly eue hundred years without tear of invasion and
without the foot of any party hostile to
the pence and welfare of oui country
touching oui soul. In three years we will
have completed 100 years of peace. - We
owe that tact to the great empire of whicb
we are proud to formn a very important
part. Other countries have had to win
their way to civilization and wealth at
peioda during 'which at times ail the
accumulations of industry were wiped
eut. That has flot been the case with us.
We have held our 'wealth secure, and have
been able to devote ail oui attention to
dveloping our industries and creating and
incîeasing the wealth of oui country.
One matter mentioned in the spech from
the Thione is not quite se aatisfactoîy as
we wou]d like. Reference is made to the
census which bas been taken in the course
cf this year. I presume we ail teel more
or leas disappointed in the result of the
cenaus. We have been accustomed to flatter ourselves for a long time with the idea
that the exodus fiom Canada had ceased,
aud we had indulged in'the hope that we
were approaching a much liigher population than bas been revealed to us by the
census. When I looked over the figures
caîetully I discovered that we had made
an increase in *the teri years ef 1,786,000
seuls; but I discovered on -a little further
consideratien that our naturai increase in
that period of ten years, figured upon the
basis. et natural increase, which is 12-70
for the whole et oui country, should have
given us an increase of 722,000 souls. Immigration gave us 1,715,326 souls, and the
saine rate of natural increase applied te
the immigrants that we have applied ta
the native population in the country,
would give 113,000 more, se that there
should have been a total increase, includiug immigration and excess ef births of
2,551,000. Instead cf that, an increase cf
1,786,000 is repoîted. and, consequently, it
is evident that 774,000 peisons have fai]ed
ta flnd their place upon the census of 1911.
It is evident, under these circuinstances,

that there is stili a considerable movement of people from Canada to the United
States. The exodus is flot at an end. It
bas been checked to a certain extent, possibly, but it is stili going on and we regret very'much that we are stili doing s0
much to add to the material strength and
the population of the adjoining country.
For that I do flot think any administration
can be blamed. I believe that we are pursuing the right course in developing our
industries in order to keep our people at
home, because the movement of population
can be discovered in our country everywhere, not in one particular part but
everywhere. It seems to me there is a tendency to drift towards the towns fromn the
country-a tendency to abandon agriculTheref oie,
tural life for indus trial. life.
what is required is net to check the growth
of the industrialism of this country, not
to do anything at ail to interfere with the
attraction of people towards industrial pursuita, but the gover-mnent should endeavour
as far as possible to overcome the tendency
of our population to leave the country and
go in to the towns by making the country
life more attractive. If that could be done
it would be 9; great advantage. On the
other hand, if there exista an overpowering
desire on the part of the people to abandon
agricultural for industrial pursaits, then
it is evident that, we must make greater
efforts te attract to this country farm.
labourera or farmers, those who shaîl be
content to take possession of the faims,
many people do niet seem to rz
s ighly as perhaps they should. In that
connection it is gratifying to find that the
government of to-day, whîle flot making
a great many professions as to what it is
going to do at this time, bas still shown
that the agricultural interests are about to
receive particular attention at its hands.
The first great measure which is promised
in the speech, which must resuit in the
development of agriculture and have a tendency to keep people on the faims, is the
promise of assistance by the federal gevernment in the way ef highway construction. That is ahsolutely essential in order
to make lie on the faim comfortable and
profitable. It is, to a certain extent, 1

Our population lias been increasing, rapidly with a better class of emigrants than
came to our shores a few years ago, and
while complaints have been made as to the
correctness of the recent census in many
portions of the Dominion and disappointnient expressed. ut the returns in many of
our cities and towns, stili on the wbole theI
increase in population is fairly satisfactory, and the prospects in the future iii this
respect are of the brightest.
There ia possibly no measure that bas
been foresbadowed in the speech from the
Throne of greater importance to me, country
as a whole than that relating to the imiprovement of our highways. 'flic Dominion
governiment has assisted l'argely in the
building of three transcontinental railways
which are now eonstructed or under ' way of
construction and which have been, and w'ill
be o! great service to the Dominion of
Canada, but as the great proportion of the
products of the farmer have tirst to be

it not of first importance that the cost o!
this transportation be reduced to a minimum by the improvement of our higliways? 1 arn informed that in England it
costs eight cents per ton per mile to haul
produce over their country roads while iii
Canada it costs about 26 cents per ton per
mile. Would it be unreazsonable for me to
suggeat to the government the propriety o!
building a transcontinental highiway and
maintaining the saine; then arrauging with

substantial progress should be made within

Canada is largelv an agricultural country,
and when the agricultural industry is proslon. Mr. TAYLOR.

perous that prosperity will be reflected and
extended to ail other classes. It is thercfore gratifying to, know that it is. the intention of the government to further aid that
basic industry of the country, and thus encourage the young men to remain on the
farm, and to afford hlm every opportunity
to be educated along the lines of intensive and scientific farming which will bring
him better retuxns for bis labour and rendcr
his occupation one of greater attraction.
In accordance with the promise of the
Prime Minister madi when leader of the
cppcsition, it is the intention to appoint a
permanent tariNf commission to deal with
,-Il matters relating to, the tariff. This
action it is hoped will do away witli many
inequalities now existing, and after a careiul investigation of ail those features which
shorld be taken into consideration lu the
formation of the tariff, such as cost of production, wages, &c., we trust that greater
fairness to ail parties, producers and consumers alike, may result; greater stability,
a more scientific tariff that will encourage
home production with sufficient internai
competition to ensure fair prices to al
parties concerned.
Reference bas9 also been made to the
Hudson Bay raîlway, and it is only right
before entering upon this important work
that definite knowledge should be secured
as to the best route to, the bay, and the
best harbour at its terminal. The road will
prove a great benefit, especially to western
Canada, and when the route has been finally
decided upon it should be prosecuted wvith
energy, as with increasing population and
a greater area under cultivation year after
ycar, the transportation of our best l)ruducts will prove a great problem indeed.
The taking over of the terminal elevators
is another most important measure, which
is to be provided for by legîislation at this
session of parliament. Abuses have arisen
in connectian with the marketing of the
grain by which mixing bas taken place to
the consequent deterioration of its quality;
and after repeated experiments by legisiation to do away vuith those abuses, l-ut

is specious enough on the face of it, but
which requires a great deal of eareful consideration, that is the proposition to cooperate %vifh the several indivi-dial provinces for the purpose o! constructing

a section o! the flritishi people, not to understand how completcly ignorant these
people are of what they are ta]king about;
but I can tell themi this, that if they did
know anything of Caniadiani history they
would know that they had done thieir best
-their littie best it niay be-to depreciate
the one government that did s.ny respectable service to the empire within my time
and generation at least.
There are one or two points apart froni
these on which I desire te say a word, and
firat as to the attitude of the Senate itself.
I know I speak for my hion. friends beside
me when I say that my hion. friend opposite will meet with ne factious opposition or criticismn frem this side of the
House; but hie will do well to remember
that the present House of Commons can
hardly be considered more than a provisional House of Gemmons. The present
Mous o! Gommons is not in the proper
sense o! the terni a true and representative
body at aIl. At this moment the House of
Gommons contains a large proportion of
members frem the east, more than the east
is entitled to, and on the other hand this
present House of Commons hairlly allows
to the Northwest more than haif the representation it is properly entitled to, and
until that anomaly is removed, until the
House of Commons does fairly represent
the people o! Canada, it la hard]y entitled
to the sanie rights and privileges as migbt
be accorded to it under other circumstances. My hlà. friend himself on former
occasions complained-and I amn bound to
say not without reason-of tiP wVay il)
which the zovernment of the day used to
treat the Senate mn flot giving them due
time to consider important measures proposed to thiem. 1 cry 'peccavi,' although 1
tried my best to remedy the evil as a nieinber of that government, and I now foriinaîiy tender to my hion. friend on my om îî
part and on beliaif of my lion. fricnds beaide mie, our hiearty support in aiding hlmi
to bring his colleagues to a proper sense
o! tlieir dutv in that respect. I have no
doubt my hion. friend will do his best, and
I hiope and trust that with our aid hie xvi]]
succeed iii bring-ing about a better state
o! thing-s in the future than has prevailed

13

in the past. To himself I tender my congratulations. I arn extremely pleased that
hie should be leader of the Senate. During
the time I sat on the other side, I had
every reason to. be satisfied 'with the manîner in which my hion. friend conducted his
task as leader of the opposition, and I have
no doubt that the saine pleasant relations
will prevail between us in the future as in
the past. As to you, Mr. Speaker, I have not
the slightest doubt that you will worthily
fill the high office to which you have been
appointed; I amn sure you will be muci
missed from the floor of the House, and
I will pledge my word to you that so long
as you remain in the chair, no question
will be put to you frein this aide of the
House for which we will flot be able to
obtain en ample precedent in some of the
questions put by yourself from your former
place in this body.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED--I join with my
right hon. friend in congratulating the
mover and seconder of the address for the
very able and genial manner in which
they have performed the task placed in
their hands. A task of this nature in the
Senate possibly is flot so easy as it is in the
Commons. There is here an absence of
that spec.tacular influence which gives to a
speaker inspiration by which hie very frequently calls up oratorical powers which
in ail probability will lie latent -.
n
the absence of any special cause to
evoke them.
It is also very satisfactory to find that the four members
of this House that have been introduced into the Chamber duringý the
present session are old parliamentarians
fiom the House of Commonýs. Notxvithstanding the many attacks whichi from tixne
to time are made in that chamber upon the
Senate; notwithstanding the many unfriendly criticisms whieli are aidvanced not on1
by members of the Conimons but by the
press of the country w-ith reference to the
reformation o! this Chanmber, it is certainly
gratifying to flnd that ex-menibers of the
House of Commons are alvays found sufficiently courageous to take a seat in this
House- when tendered it. I hope this will
continue. I have always regarded the experience and judgment Nvhich hon. gentle

Hon. Mr. ROCHE-lt is reg-arded by
somte writers in the press- in Eng-land and
statenients hiave been made by somne Conservative parliamentarians and representatives that the reciprocity agreement was disloyal to the interests of the empire, and
contrary of the policy of the British government. Now I consider that any policy
which is approved of in the mother country cannot be disloyal. What are the facts?
Great Britain sends to the United States
two lhundred and seventy millions worth
and receives from the United States tive
hundred millions worth of their products
and the effort of their statesmen, of their
commercial men, of their negotiators. and
of ail those that represent British trade in
their diplomacy lias been to forward, to increase and to expand in every direction

friend, the leader of the government, tell
as that the effort that wvas made by the late
governiment to expand oui commercial relations with the United States wvas disloyal
or inimical to Great Britain herseif, or
could in any way tend to loosen the bond

that there is disloyalty in it, I will cast
it aside for ever, but I remember when
that reciprocity treaty was a great boon
to Canada. I remlemiber howv Nova Scotia
flourished under the ieciprocity treaty. I
remember how the decay that had heen
setting in was arrested, and by means o!
that treaty the trade of Nova Scotia started
on a new~ career, and farniers whose faris

can you tell mie that, our resources have

energy lias decreased? Cali you tell me
that the people of the United States are

good resuits would not accrue, and the experience of the past says to us there was 110
danger in adopting the reciprocity agreement.
It is not my puipose, and I ha-ve had
no intention to speak about these anatters,
or about ýanything which. would create controversy, but when a suggestion was throw-n
out which touches a very tender sentiment
in Oui hearts, one repels the insinuation
that there was any design to fali in with
any filibustering with the United States, or
any desire that the boundaries of thlat
country ehould be extended fîom the Gulf
of Mexico to the Arctic circle. We had
no participation in any such propaganda, but would stand upon oui uine and

Conservative Party, with the aid of the
Nationalists, succeeded in deceiving- the
people, especially of Ontario, and I regret
to say of some 15 or 20 counties in the province of Quebec. The Nationalists element
in Quebec were in deadly opposition tcs the
naval policy of both parties and they were
in favour of reciprocity. Not one of them
would have been elected in any of the
counities of Quebec, if the issues of reciprocity had been put fairly before them.
They were elected in Quebec because
1.hey were opposed to the naval policy and
the expenditure of Canadian money for
foreigu purposes. That is the reason of
their victory in flfteen or twentv counties
in Quebec. It was different in Ontario. In
this province I believe there is a large sentiment in favour of a naval policy but it
was flot the question of naval policy that
decided the election in Ontario. It was
flot even the question of reciprocity that
turned the vote in that province. It is just
as well to state frankly and b'luntly the
cause of the turnover in that bright, intellectual and progressive province of Ontario. The defeat is attributed, can be attributed, and 1 know is due to religious
feelings. The speeches of the Minister of
Militia, of Dr. Sproule, now Speaker of
the Commons, and others, inflamed the
public mind of Ontario irn regard to the
eucharistic congress and the Ne Temere decree in reference to the marriage law.
These were the dominatinir influence in
the judgment rendered by the province of
Ontario, and there was another influence.
There bas been in the corridors, on the
street corners, in parlours and elsew'hcre
the cry of ' It is time to get rid of French
domination. Now is our chance.' Thiese
are the three causres of the turnover in
Ontario, by which the Liberals lost over
thirty seats. I believe to-day that most
of them are beartily ashamed of the judgnient they rendered on the 21st September.
and the cry « We wil'l get rid of French
domination-

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-It liad a lot to do
with it. The people would not stand for
French domination and peace and good
will under the Laurier administration; but
thev- will stand for French -domination
under the Nationalist bunch. Thiere is the
differeŽnce. It shows that the Conservative
party in their declaration of loyalty and
imperîalism, and in their declarations
against friendly relations witb the Unitel
States were not sincere. The Conservative
party was not sincere in . making these
declarations, because the day after the victory they locked arms with the enemy of
these samne people, and the country is beginning to see and understand it, and the
ndinisterial explanations of their attitude
on this question, and of their manner of
treating anud adîninistering the affaira of
the country will flot be acceptcd, and I
have no hesitation in saying that if there
%vas an opportunity in the immediate
future to demand a fresh verdict from the
people, the decision that they gave on the
21st of September would be reversed. That
is the true state of the political. situation.
Thiere is no use in trying to blind onescîf
to it, and there is no use in trying to
hoodwink the people and make themi believe otherwise. The sooner we get down
to a basis of common sense, of common interest, without appeals to race and religious prejudice, the better for Canada,
the better for its people. Under the Liberal governament this country haà achiieved
a position remarkable in its auinais. When
the Liberal party took hold of the reins of
power in 1896 il found the country divided
along racial and religîous lines, but by
tbe influence of goodwill and conciliation,
mnanifestel by our honoured leader at the
time, bie brought the people to a standstill
e n their highway of division and dissension. H1e made themn understand by bis
conciliatory methods, bis offer of peace,
that Cana-da could get along better by tlie
people of the different races and different
creeds living in harmony and in union.
and what was the result? Up to the 21st

three mile limait the saine as they are now.
1 wouid have liked very much if the hon.
leader of the government in this House
had been honoured with a -portfolio, because, though able in bis present capacity,
he scarcely represents the government -iii
nny officiai capacity. I might ask him in
passing, are we going to have a navy? Is
the Borden gavernment gaing ta give us a
navy? I think public sentiment bas a rigbt
to know what the policy of the government
is ini this respect.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.-As the circumstances under which wu meet are very
peculiar, a new parliament, a new government, and opened by a son ai our late
revered Majesty Queen Victoria, I think it
is only rîght ta say a iew words on the subject before us. The speech that has been
delivered by bis Royal Highness daes not
cantain very many matters for discussion.
0f course we could flot expect that it would
be a very voluminaus speech, as everybody
knows the government bas anly been a
short time in power and could not be expected ta bring down any vury important
legisiation. The matters referred to in the
speech fram the Throne are of considerable
interest to the people af this country, and
I desire ta give expression to my views on
some ci those important questions. I arn
very much pleased ta see my aid friends
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Bell) and from
Leeds <Hon. .Mr.
Taylor) who were
colleagues ai mine in the bouse of
Gommons for many long years befare
occupying seats in this Hbouse, and I was
particularly pieased with the remarks delivered by thase lion. gentlemen in maving and seconding .the address. The lhon.
gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Bell)
has not been in public lite for some years,
and bas nat been in the hieat ai the political campaign, and we naturally would expect fromn him a speech sucn as hie bas delivered, but I was very agreeabiy surprised
ta find that the hon. gentleman from Leeds,
who bas always taken such an active part
in the House ai Gommons, and who w-as so
full of political matters whei lie came ta
this House ta second the address, did s0 in
a mild statesmanlike speech, ivithout referring ta any subjects ai caxtroversy at
ail. He confined himseif particularly, and
3

with a great deal ai discretian ta the
matters contaîned in the speech irom the
Throne.
I regret that the hon. leader ai this
House did not see fit ta accept a
portfolio and assume a position that I
think hie should have taken. It wouid also
add ta the dignity ai the House if we had a
full uedge minister in thse Chamber.
He is peculiarly fitted ta discharge the
duties ai any departmnent ai State, and I
arn sure it would have been a pleasure ta
every niember ai tbis House and ta the
people of this country if he had been
made Minister ai thse Interior, a position
which we ail expected he wouid assume.
I bave no doubt he could have had any
position hie desired in thse zovernment, but
for reasans best known ta him2elf hie h"is
declined ta assume any ai the arduous
duties af àdminist-ering a department. We
hope, however, that as a member without
portialio he will be able ta give us full information on ail the matters that pertain ta
thse gavernmýent and dischrarge the duties
as leader ai this bouse in the samne satisfactory manner that he did as leader of the
Opposition.
The speech from the Throne refera ta
two or three important minttors. One
la thse appointment ai a tariff commission.
That is
a subject
which.
bas been before the public for some
yeears. I was neyer particularly struck with
thse ides. ai a tariff commission. The members of the gavernment are responsîble ta
the people, and this project looks like shiit'ig
the responsibility tbat properly resta
with themselves ta a commission. I fear
that the commission wili be se partisan or
appoint-ed in such a way as ta repart
accarding to, the wishes ai the gavernment
ai the day, and I fear that the great mass
af the people, the warking classes and
farmers will not have thse representation
and influence an that Tariff Commission
that they should have. I hope the government wvill stay their hands and consider
the matter mare careiuily before shifting
tise respansibility that they ought ta
assume themselves ta a commission ai outsiders who are not respansible ta tise people
and wvho at t.he b-est can only collect evidence and materiai, a matter which tise

government can easily do themselves.
Therefore I do not favour t-he appointment
of a tariff commission.
Another niatter relerred to is the selection of a route for the Hudson Bay raîlway,
and I noticed that the Premier has stated
that the government propose to build and
operate that uine. For the best interests
of the people of this country I hope they
will think twice before carrying out such a
programme. I was neyer much in favour
of building the Hudson Bay raiiway, but
ît is a heritage from the late goverrament
who favoured its construction, and the peopie of the Northwest seem to be unanimously in favour of it. Therefore, I suppose the Hudson Bay railway %villhave to
be built, but -I hope the Lovernment %vili
neyer attempt to operate it. It will be
another Intercolonial railwxay, only a thousand times morse. The Intercolonial rail.
way runs throug-h a good country. A large
portion of it in Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick is weil settied. There are mnany
villag-es, townis and cities which afford
traffie for the road ; but on the line of this
Hudson Bay railway thiere is not a settler,
and there are no feeders to supply it withi
traffie. I venture to say if the governiment
operate the road they wvill have a deficit
oi many millions every year. It would be
much better to let a private company build
the road and give thern whatever as-sistance may be necessary ;but if the goverament build it, then they ouglit to mak-e
termas with some one of the three great
raiiway companies-the Canadian Pacific
raiiw'ay, the Grand Trunk Pacifie or the
Canadian Northerni railway-which have
rnany feed-ers to secure traffic for that road,

pride and satisfaction it is the fact that
for the fifteen years they guided the destiny
of Canada there has been tne greatest era
of prosperity that has ever falien to the lot
of any country in the world. I do flot
dlaim that the credit ail belongs t-o the late
government. The rain feul, and the sun
shone and the crops were bountiful, and
the people were industrious, contented and
happy; but I say this, and 1 think nobody
will gainsay it, that the policy euunciated
by the late government and carried into
execution contributed to a large extent to
the prosperity we have been enjoying.
Look at the record of the late g6vernment
from the time they took office in 1896 until
they ieft office in 1911-look at the measures
they introduced-the deepening of the
canais and harbours, the improvements of
transportation facilities between the east
and wcst, the building of the National
Transcontinental railway, the granting for
the first time in the history of this country
of a preference to old England, and other
measures introduced by theni to promote
trade and 'prosperity of the country. Can
you point to a single thing mnat any former
government every did which has contributed so much to the prosperity of Unis country
as the system of cold storage instituted by
the late Minister of AgricùIturer, 1 rememnber that before 1896 we could not ship our
perishable goods to the old country. They

them in cold storage

to expand the prasperity of the country.
I do flot know of anything else that hias
done so much to advance our prosperity as
the preference that we gave to England in
1897. It was 12i per cent at first. Then it
was increased to 25 per cent, and it bas
been for some years at 33? per cent. Tlhàt
is the preference that is given ta goods
manufactured in England when imported
into this country. The .result lias beexi tlîat
aur trade with England lias increased enarmously. In 1895 our inîiporis from England liad fallen to about ý;26,UOO,OO; last

It broughit about sucli a feeliiig of friend
ship for Canadians thiat aur products art

sold largely in the English markets and the
demand for them is increasing. I remember au iniatance which came under my owu
observation. As mutlers we had been sending a great deal of flour ta the old country,
lind it was usually stipulated that it should
be branded, 'made in America,' but after
the preferential tariff was put in force the
cates came acrass to us. ' brand your
floiur no longer made in America, but brand
it made in Canada.' The feeling towards
Canada was sa good that they wanted ail
our bagsansd -barrels branded that wey..
That feeling has contributed greatly to, increase aur trade with England. Another
thing- this goverrnment did for tnie first time
in the history of Canada: It sent men to,
South Africa ta help the old cauntry in
time of need. En-land was not ln such
distress that she required our mcn to figlit
lier batties, but Canada said, we will send
a contingent as an object lesson ta show
that we are ready to help you fight the
battles of the empire. That praduced a
warm, feeling ini England for Canada and
iA is ta the everlasting credit of the late
government that they were the first Canadian goverumnent that affered to contribute
such aid ta the imperial autflorities. The
imperial spirit hias grown of late years ta,
such an extent in this country that a
motion was passed two years aga unanimously in the House of Commons ta asssist
in the naval defence of the empire. The
motion was made by the present Minister
af Trade and Commerce, and it stated that
the time had now arrîved when this great
Dominion with ail hier wealth and passessions and hier great trade interests on the
sea coast shîould contribute something towards the support of the Britisli navy. That
motion was foilowed up by the government
wisely, I think, not rushing too extensively into. the matter but pravidîn.g the
nucleus of a navy. It bias been ridiculed
by thc opponents of the late goverument,
but it was, a start in the righit direction.

reciprocity introduced by the late administration, and I think the people of this

it. To the peple of the Northwest alone

yet you will find the difference in value
is -about ten cents per bushel the higher
price being paid in Minneapolis. Unfortunately for the farmers of the Northwest
they have a great deal of low g-rade wheat

those low grades and feed wheat cannot be
sold anywhere but in Ontario. You cannot ship it to the old country. The anly
place you can send it to is eastern Canada
to be used for feed, and when you take the

They did flot want our products entering

the persistent power and influence of the

reciprocity was adopted at a special session. The occasion lias pa.ssed ; yau could

products entering their market, the reduction 'wiil apply to the whole world. We

the sun will shirie, and the wvcr,'d will
move on under the present leadership. Il
the present government are only irise
enough to continue the good work carried on
by the 'late government for the last fifteen
years, if they ivill simply maintain the
tariff as it is and follow in the footsteps
of the late governrnent, they will bring
credit to themselves and the prosperity of'
the country will iindoubtedly continue. I
look to the future of this country with a
great deal of satisfaction. We have a
mighty strearn of immigration flowing frorn
the United States to our Canadian Northwest. The late governrnent are entitled to a
large portion of the credit for that hecause
of the systematic and businesslike way in
whicli they cncouraged immigration that is
now flowing in et an ever increasing rate.
This year there will be over 300,000 immigrants of the best kind from the the United
States and Europe, next year possibly 350,'000, and so on as time goes on. These peo-*
pie are bringing immense wealth into the
country. They are for the first year consumers and flot producers. They keep the
wheels of the country going to supply their
wants, and in that way the prospects of
trade are exceedingly bright, andIthn
the Conservative party ought to thank their
stars that they have fallen into office under
such happy circumstances.
If they continue in the footsteps and adopt the programme laid down by their predecessors
they will undoubtedly contribute to the succeas of this Dominion, and to their own
credit. For the present we will have to accept the meagre programme of business
that bas been presented to us, and do our
best as good citizens of this Dominion,
without any party bias, to give to those
measures when they corne before us, the
very hast consideration of which they are
capable.

have criticised the breach of the constituition, as lie said last session, committed by
the government in not having a member of
the Cabinet in this House, also a French
rninistex.
The hion. Speaker of this
House, when ha was simply a sanator,
on several occasions asked the lata governent the reason why nuo French
minister was appointed to this House and
inquired as to when one would be
appointed. I simply wish to point out
the injustice which lias hepn done to
the Senate in not having a minister with
1portfolio, and also in having uîu Frenchi
minister. It has always been thp custom
and, according to the contentions of the
hon. Speaker in the past, we ought to have
one. Now that he occupies such a prominent position, I amn sure he will do hîs very
best to see that the governrnent will very
soon honour this House, not only with a
minister with portfolio, but also with a
French minister.

had identified himself with the municipal
government of his province, who had been
a member of the legislature of Nova Scotia,
and afterwards of the executive council of
that province. He was appointed to the
Senate in 1907, and I have no doubt if
the late Mr. Comeau had been spared, 0wing to his havilig been one of the more
youthful members of this Chamber, lie
would have rendered us distinguished
services.
The late Senator Chevrier came from the
province of Quebec, and having great confidence in the development of our western
country from which many of us corne, he
emigrated to the province of Manitoba in
1871, served his province there with acceptability, and during his lifetirne liai the
pleasure of seeing a bleak unsettled stretch
of prairie blossom into one of the most
prosperous provinces in the Dominion He
had the pleasure of seeing the district in
which. lie settled, old Fort Garry, -develop
frorn a Hudson B-ay fort into a large and
prosperous city, one- which will probably
ernulate the grcatest cities of this Dominion in the no distant future. I arn sure
the Senate of Canada will place upon
record its regret and sympathy in the bereavement whîdh the families of these
tbree senators who have passed away have
suffered.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-flefore the orders
of the day are called, it is my sal
duty to direct the attention of the House
to the fact that we have lost tliree of our
members tlîrough deatli since the last ses-sion of this House. I refer to Sir John
Carling, Mr. Corneau and Mr. Chevrier.
With reference to the late Sir John Carling,
lie had endeared hirnself to all the mernbers of this House on botli sides. I doubt.
if there has been any rnan in public lufe
for generations, of the sarne geniality and
amiablTlity of temperarnent as our late confrere. Looking back over a short sketch
of his lufe, whîch will be found in the Parliarnentary Companion, I arn inclined to
say that there is no otlier man actively
eng-aged. in public life in Canada that '«as
-associated with the public affairs of the
Dominion so far back as the late Sir John.
He entered the old legisiature of Canada in
1857, and served therein until 1867. He
was Receiver General under the CartierMacdonald governrnent in 1863, and when
ccnfederation of tlie provinces of Canada
was carried into effect, '«e find hirn entering the governrnent of the late John Sandfield Macdonald, and serving therein, from

Commons ivas better liked on both sides
of the House than Sir John Carling, and
although of late bis infirmities may have
prevented him from taking as active a part
in the business of this House as hie would
otherwise have liked to do, there is ne
doubt whatever that on many matters
Sir John's judgment and long experience were calculated to be of great
value to the members of the various
committees ou which he served. My hon.
friend bas alluded to bis very great length
of service. He is quite right, I believe, in
saying that, so far at any rate as the province of Ontario is concernied, Sir John
Carling was the oldest iijember of either
House whe could look back te as early a
period of parliamentary service as hie did.
WVhen 1 was elected to parliament in 1863,
Sir John Carling had then been, I believe, a
member for some five or six years, anl I
think I arn correct in saying that lie and
myseif are the only nienibers from the prov-ince ef Ontario wbo were members ef the

my hion. friend bies observed, bad flot

Hou. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-Having
been associated in public lite for a p'oriod
of over fitty years witb the late Sir John
Car'ling, I feel that it iii due te hlm te
make a tew observations on this occasion.
I had the pleasure of sitting with hini lin

in the parliament elected in 1861. 1 was
with him for six years atter 'confederation
in the Ontario legisiature, and subsequently was with bim bere whien hie ivas -a

years, whethier we were politically allied or
sat on opposite sides et the House. our

Fitty
years ago hie was ene cf my dearest friends,
and supported me on very many important
questions. On the scheol question, which
we fought out betweeen 1860 and 1863, and
on the question ef the seat of government,
which was Up at that time, lie always
gave me bis support. While lu the Ontarie Heuse, our friendship was unbroken,
and se continued te the end. Sir John
Carlin., should be remembered for the important services lie rendered in this country. The man who succeeds in grewing
two blades ot grass where eue grew betore
is a benetactor te bis country. Sir John
Carling established the Dominion experimental farni, whichli as preved such a

and contentment. The Laurier government in appointing Mr. Comeau dil a
graceful act and I trust that my hion;
frienda on this side of the Senate will sa
their way to replacing Mr. Comeau by one
of his nationality, were it merely as a historical ethie that the nation that founded
the first colony in thia great confeleration,
which is stiil represented by large numbers, should have appropriate recognition
at the hiands of governxnents of either political party.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER-lt is indeed meet
and proper that the memory of those who
have lived amongst us should not be forgotten, but should be recalled at least on
the first occasion when this House meets
after their demise. Our turn will surely
corne and is fast approaching. We cannot
close our eyes to the fact that the grim
mower is constantly and eternally .ioing
his work, and is flot forgetting this Senate,
whose members certainly die proportionately in larger numbers than the members
of the other House. I agree in ail that
has been said concerning our departed colleagues, and more especially as te what
bas been said concerning Sir John Carling
and Mr. Comeau, whomn I happen to have
known better-I may say more intimately.
A curious co-incidence exists between these
two gentlemen. Sir John Carling entered
active political lufe possibly earlier than
any living member of either House. Mr.
Comeau haionged to the nation that wvas
first to colonize this part of North America
and implant the seeds of Christianity and
civilization. His appointment to the Senate
by the Liberal government was a graceful
act. He deserved the appointment on his
merits lie deserved to be appointed on accounit of the numerical importance and
other dlaims of the people hie more particuIarly represented. I do not mean to narrow
it down to sectionalism and say that a man
ought to be appoitited to this Hou-e because
hie happens to belong- to a certain nationality or a certain relizion but thiere is biarrnony in giving minorities representation.
It is conducive to good feelng- and shows
that the power that looks towards giving
minorities their due rights is proinpted by
motives that are conducive to harmony

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I do
not know that I can add anything to that
which. has already been said in reference to
our departed friends and colleagues. 1 rise

at the remarks that have been made, not

the city of London and knew our late colleague for so many years, flot only in his
politica] and bus-iness life, but what is of
infinitely more importance, his home Jife.
If any one wiahed to know in what appreciation Sir John Carling waa held in his own
of Coxnmona, hie scarcely ever rose to reply,
present in London during his funeral. In
my long acquaintance with Sir John Carling we were friends not only politically but
personally. I do not think there was a
more congenial companion to be found. He
was a colleague of mine -for many years.
Notwithstanding bis great business ability
in the management of bis official duties in
the offices wbich hie beld. bie was a very
timid man-so timid that wben hie was violently attacked, particu]larly in the House
of Commos, hie scarcely. ever rose to reply,
and if hie did reply it was in the most courteous and gentlemanly manner. Many a time
have I sat behind him when hie was violently attacked by bis opponents and have
urged him to retaliate, but on no occasion
have I ever known him to do~ s0 in the
spirit which I probably would have shown
undcr the circumstances. The experimental
farm in Ontario and the central experimental farm here, organized while hie was
a minister of the Crown, are the best monuments that could be erected to bis mem-

ory, better than anything that cou-i be
raised in marbie or brass. In reading the
history of this country, bis family will be
able to refer to these institutions, one established while he was a minister in the
Ontario goveroment, and the other while
he was a member of the Dominion Cabinet, as evidences of the services he rendered his country. Personally, altogether
apart from politics, I deeply regret the
demise of a gentleman whom I personally
held in such high esteem. I regret that
every session it is our paintul duty to have
to mourn the loss of some of our members.
As my hon. friend to my rîght bas intimated, we must aI] follow in the same way,
possibly some of us in the near future, and
when we do it will be well for us if we

Hon. Sir RICHARD 'SCOTT-An op:portune time is offered for the presentation of
some views which I hold on this subject,
pertainiing to the health of the community. No highier duty can he imposed on
parliament or on any leg-isiative body than
making laws that will extend the lives of
the people. In other words to cut off ail
those causes that bring about premature
death. That has been my view for a long
time; but the pafliament of Canada, believing that that duty devolved upon the
'provinces, has hithierto given a cold shoulder to the introduction of measures for
protecting the health of the people. The
late government took the stand that it
was the duty of the provinces, and former
governments ha-1 adopted the same principie. Now, in a matter of such importance as the health of the people,
surely we cannot brush asi-de a subject of such magnitude;
therefore 1
propose to submit to the House a few
figures showing that Canada ought to bie
the healthiest country in the world, whiere
we have the finest opportunities for pure
air, where we can have pure water, if my
hon. friendJ's B3il1 is carried out, and whiere
we have more than the ordinary sunshine
that is enjoyed by any country in the
world. I arn sorry to say that wvith ail
those facîlities for developing health, Canada stands very low '.own among the countries of the world in its mortalitv scale. I
amn unable to get very recent figures, as
the census of 1911 is not yet comiplote, but
I take the figures of the ceusus of 1901.
'Very few changes have taken place, however, in the last ten years, and relatively
to popuflation the mortality niay be considered on the saine scale. Those figures
lIisclose the following facts: 'lihe -tpopuliation in 1901 was 5,300,000. Tîje cleathi rate wvas
81,000 in a sing-le year, and of that numnLer 21,328 died in their first year, slaug-htered the year of their birth. In the next

47

four years 10,019 were slaughtered, making
a loss in the first five years of 31,347
chilclren no doubt healthily born, but sacrificed in the first five years of their existence. That is, three-eighths-nearly onebalf-that die through ignorance of the
proper way to bring up children. Froni
five to twenty-five'years the deaths were
12,248. That is, the deaths occurrîng up
to the age of 25 years were 43,595. Considerably more than one-half of the
deaths in Canada in one year occurred
before attaining the age oi 25. That is a
grievous reflection on the intelligence of
the people. Before the flood, men lived
for centuries. After the flood, we are told
by the Bible that people attained the age
of 125. Later on, the Psalmist speaks of
-people living up to three score and ten;
but we have knowiedge that 125 years is
reachied by some, showing that the natural
vitality leads up to the century mark at
anv rate. An animal that rcachies mnaturity in five years dies at the age of 25.
Man does not reach maturity unti n early
25 years, and therefore hoe ought to live to
cne hundred, yet we finid that haif the
deaths in Canada occurred before reaching
the age of 25. How cloes that compare
with other countries? Quoting froin the
table Telating te males, the deaths'of
females is somowhat less. <See Webb's
Dictionary Statistics, pp. 187.) In England
and Wales the mortalîty of every thousand
children born is 171 iii the first year. Iu
Denniark the nuinber is 146, iii Norway
105, in Austria 249, in Belgium, which is
a densely pupulateà country, very littie
larger than Nova Scotia, but withi a population of a little over eîghit miïllions, the
rnortality is 202. In Canada it is 260. WVe
head the list of alI those countries. Tien
of the numiber who die before reaching the
age of five years, the figtires are for England auj- Wales 273, Deninark 201, Norway
171. Norway does flot get anything like
the sunshine that Canada enjoys, and yet
life is Ion zer than bore. The rate in
Austria is 385, in Belgium 294, in Canada
.W0, just fire less than Austria.
The
difference in the death rate between
Canada and Norway shows that 209 more
children in every thousand are slnuzhtered
here than in Norway. Figures of that kind
ought to alarin people. I venture to say

were face to face with an epidemic of
typhoid fever, aniJ it seemed very opportune that the Bill of my hon. friend from
Ottawa was being considered by parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-I rea]ly introduced it the session before.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-It hal been
held over. Hon. gentlemen were somewha-.
impressed by the immense number of typhoid cases in the city of Ottawa. I think
they ran up to about a thousand last year.
Hon. Mr.

BELCOURT-Nearly

Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-That was
ail due to allowing the clear, wholesome,
:pure waters of the river that runs by our
*ioors to be polluted with human cxcreta.
Typhoid ia a disease you contract through
your stomacli. You niust eat or drink the'
germ, and you general'ly drink it. The typhoil bacilli will live in the colon. There
are other bacilli but strange to say bacteriologiats maintain that there are only
two bacilli that are really deadiy to mani,
cholera And typhoid bacilli, that the
human organism ia sufficiently powerful
to, throw the other bacilli off. My conviction is that if we live naturally we
would be absolutely immune to typhoid.
There were two thousand cases here last
year. The population of Ottawa was about
eighty thousand. I do not hesitate to say
that there were about twenty-five or thirty
thousand men end women who drank
from the tap during all that time and .lid
not contract typhoici. Why did they not
catch the disease? Sirnply because their
systems were immune to it. The organiza
tion of our cows and horses is certain,_,
îîot as strong as that of men, and yet they
did not contract typhoid because they
lived on natural food. That is the reason,
and it is a very easy explanation. Man
was the most complete creature in organiration that Ieft bis Makers hands-simply
perfect. Perhaps I should flot go into
that part of the story, he'ause we ail reco-nize that man's organîzation was perfect
and therefore absolutely immune from al
diseases. But, unfortunately, as a result
of the way people live they are susceptible
not only to typhoid, but fifty other dis4

49

eases. We have about eighty on the liat.
The typhoid epidemic of this year, as was
cleariy proved, resulted from persons beirýg
allowed to throw the excreta from typhoid
patients into the water. Doctors are usually called in in typhoid cases; at ail events
there shoul be a doctor in every district
wvhere there is typhoid, and a law should
be passed that not only the excreta, but
the fiuids, should be treatel with carboic
acid, or some other disinfectant, which
would destroy the germs and prevent any
evil consequences. To allow it to go into
the water and to be consuxned by people
who have to drink that water is simply
murder, and a law should be passed to prevent it, as is the case in other civiiized
countries. Why should we be s0 neglectfui of human life? I have in my hand a
table showing the average deat.h rate from
typhoid per 100,000. In the United Kingdom with sucli a large congested population, the death rate is onlly eleven per hundred thousand. That remincis me of a
very im"portant question which I see is
being discussed in the press in reference
to water that haa to be purified for domestic use. Sixty per cent of the people
of London-which wouid embrace -probably
four millions of the total population-are
supplied with water from the river Thames,
and yet only eleven cases of typhoid per
100,000 of the population occurrel in Eng.
land and Wales. Why? Because they have
strong iaws against the pollution of streama
and they purify the water by filtration.
The subi ect ia now being discussed in Ottawa, on the report of an exepert commission who recommend taking the water supply from a point fifteen or sixteen miles
away, although we have the finest water
in the worli at our own door, if we can
keep the poisons out of it and filter it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SCOTT-The deaths from
typhoid in the United Kingdom are eleven
per hundred thousand. In Beigium, where
the population is more crowded, it it eighFrance,

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Let us aIl go Lo

Hon. Mr. SCOTT-No, we have a better.
country in Canada. Ail we nave to do is
to act wisely, and take proper precaution.
In New South Wales the mortality from
typhoid ia 22; Victoria, 16; New Zealand,
8; Japan, 12; United States, 32; Ceylon,
142; Canada, .35, ail per 100,000. We are
aheal of the States, and we are seven
time a.head of Norway in the death rate.
Hon. Mi. BELCOURT-We are worse off
than the United States.
Hon. Mr. SCOTT-We are ahead in
mortality. We are seven trnes worse off
than Norway. Is it not a disgrace to the
legislation of the country that buctl a state
of affairs should be alloiwed to exist? We
get moire than double the amount of eunahine than Norway does, and typhoid is a
disease that does flot necessarily exist unlesa we chose to drink it, and the fiuid
that we use can be protected wit.hout any
trouble, if we chose to take steps to do so.
There should be no great dittlculty about
it. I hope public opinion will soon be
educated up to the necess:ty of acting on
the suggestions I have mnade. Certainly
the city of Ottawa bas a very good source
from which to obtain good water. The
capital is better situated for obtaining a
pure water supply than aiuy other city in
the world. The watershed of the river
that passes by comprises forty thousand
square miles. The preceding government
of the country-and I have no doubt this
governiment will follow them in that regard-adopted a principle of storage damns
at Temiskaming and a number of the leadin, 1oi-es trh'fa,-rv tn th<r 0ftPiwn.i ivlhrh

held back
would mean if it were
by dams in the lakes and gradually let
down to us at the rate oi, say forty thousand cubic feet per second. I have no
doubt the present government will follow
up that policy, because it ia a reaaonable
one, and at ail events in building the
Georgian Bay canal it will be necessary to,
provide necessaîy depths of water required
in the different streama in the stretches
between the lakes. The best section from,
which to obtain oui water supply wouli be
where there is the heavieat rainfaîl. The
Ottawa river flows with very considerable
rapidity. At various points there are falis
and rapids which help to aerate the water.
-But the principal advantage it has is that
the area, is Eo large for the rain and snowfaîl, which I think amounts to about forty
five inches. Nearly four feet of water
falis over that entire aiea every year,
fiowing away.
and it is constantly
The supply is faiîly constant fîom the
fact that there is this large drainage area. If we could get the water
fresh as it'cornes to us from the clouds we
would have pure distillel wvater. As it
falîs to the earth, it becomes contaminated
and polluted by man. A merciful Creator
sends it on to the ocean. It is there purified and raised again to the sky, and we
get it back again purifled and distilled,
and the process continues month by
month, year by year, and century by century, supplying us with pure water from
the heavens.
There is, therefore, no possible excuse
for the proposition to take the water from
any other locality than the Ottawa river.
The government of this country bave a
voice in this. The representatives of the
people are here for about six months in the
year. They want the best water Canada
can afford, and the best water we c.qn
bave is from the Ottawa river. A]low the
sediment to settie and then purify it by
filtration, a ýproces9 which is easily clone.
Some parties rnay say that the water is
turpid. Filtration would rprmove the turpidity. I have heard no objection to it on
that score; but even if it were turpid. the
remedy is easy. 1 trust this governuient

the provinces, becauàe the local authorities
are far better able to carry out a health
law than are the Dominion authorities.
I think we should leave to the provinces
the rights and privileges whicb have been
specially allotted to them. If this Bill

bie impossible to prevent the drainage from
farms from flowing through the ereeks into
the navigable streams, thereby polluting
those waters. I cannot see the abject in
passing a Bill which would flot accomplish
beneficial resuits. Even the power reserved
to the Dominion government to suspend the
law in various localities would not prevent
the polluting of navigable waters. I do not
think my hion. friend will pretend that it
would have that effect. Unless something
can bie accomplished, we should not interfere witb the jurisdiction of the provinces.
Let them alone and they will enact laws
to protect the health and lives of the peapie. I sympathize with the hion. knight

great loss of the childreju 'Who are being

Hon. Mr. WILSON-The hion, gentleman

not contain more or 'ess poison.
It is
true, the human system elirninates poison,
which if allowed to rernain ini the body

eliminates the poison that is constantly
going into it, the destruction of life would
lbe rapid and persistent. 1 cali upon the

views fully on this matter, and that there

Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS-I have the honour

Health for the Dominion, and have heen
interested in this question, flot cn'y Eince

1 have somne opinions about the pollution
of rivers that lead me very seriously to

I believe if the opinions of c .nweteiit

this great loss wure aEcer1aii.ed, it would
flot be foui.d to be a typlicid g-rmn which
was causing the mischief, but it woull Le
attîibuted to another cause altogether. 1
arn suie every medical man on tie Iloor

The consequence is,

Before a Bill oi this kînd is passed it

therefore we are starting from a falise

Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS-I arn speakiaig of

mortality amongat children it is a mistake.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-It is inerely onle element.
Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS-My argument is

Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS.-We might purify
ail the streams in the Dominion nf Canada,
great and small, and the moîtality that now
exists would not be rnodified to any great
extent. That ha whiat I firmly believe because I made it a subject of special study
for years and I have gone loto the whole

dence gives it the wherewithal to deal with
the food that ia given. I appeal to every
medical man present in the House to-day
if it is flot a fact that in their experience
that only the most robust and strongest
constitutions are ablIe to cope with the difficulties that the medical mnan is called upon
to deal with. The child survives, it may
be, because it has auperior strength of constitution and power to assimilate the food
that is given to it, it may be in kindness,
although it is really not so. You cannot
supplant the mother's mil< with the cow's
milk because it contains an element that
the child cannot deal with in its mastication and assimilation, the cheesemaking
t)roi rty, which lies upon the stomach as
an indigestables mass and trouble ensues.
It produces indigestion and it decomposes
in the bowels. Before you could convince
me that typhoid ensued from that cause you
wvoud have to show there v~as ulceration
of the bowel caused by the typhoid germ.
We never look for anything of that kind
in such cases because we do niot suppose
such an effect would be produced from
that cause. But we expect to find decayed
food in the bowels, and the consequence ia
the child dics day by day from actual starvatlon, or inability to assimilate the food
that is given to it and in my opinion-and
I have yet to see reasons why I should
change it-the purification of the streams
of itself will do very littie towards prolonging the life of our Canadian infants.
I do flot oppose the purification of streamns
of water in the slightest. Do ail you can
along- that line, but let us he intelLgent
and let us flot overlook that fact -that the
remedy we are going to apply will mean
an enornious expense, without any proof
that it will produce the resuits expected.
In my opinion the arresting of the progres
of dis 1ase anid death in înfancy should be
undertaken from an entirely different

The Motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read a second time.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-When this Bill w'as

Hon. Mr. POWER-My hion. friend

the Committee on Public Health.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG moved that the Bill
be referred te the Committee on Public
Heaith.
Hon. Mr. MeMULLIN-It is hardiy fair
to the promoter of the Bihl that we should
deal with it in this way without first allowing him to say what his wish wou]d lie. A
reference of the Bill to a Committee of the
Whole House was spoken of during the
discussion, and the prornuTer snou!d lie
given an opportunity to decide whetlier- it
would be better to have it deaît with in
that way or not. It woull lie better te
leave the Bill until hae eari deai with it

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE

would suggest to the lion. gentleman whIo

MOTION.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG moved:
That until differently ordered by the Senate,
the hour of meeting of the House on Fridiy
shall be haif past two o'clock in the afternoon.
Hon. Sir 'MACKENZIE BOWELL-I
think there is a provision that requires
certain notice to members of any proposed change in oui rules. I do nlot object
te the principle involved, but we should
adhere to the rules. Is this not in contravention of the rules of the House?
Hon. Mi. YOUNG-I wish to point out
this distinction: WVhen a change is nmade
in a rule of the House, and a newv rule is
proposed, it is absolutely necessary to
adopt a different piocedure. As the hon.
gentleman bas mentioned, the membeis
should, have special notice. But this
inerely makes a tcmporary sessional order
which may be changed at any time if the
Senate desires to revert to the old rule.
It is a procedure that lias been adopted
for many yeirs in the Senate-making
what is called a sessional order.

shou]d be changed and .that wve should
meet at two thirty instead of three o'clock
on Frilay?
Hon. Mi. CLORAN-The only reason is
one of comfort and ease for sena-tors who
reside in Montreal, Toronto, Kingston,
Belleville and other places, and who desire
to catch the afternoon trains on Fridays.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-It
does not affect Belleville or Toronto.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-It ia a matter of convenience simply, to meet on Friday at haif

that the mnembers to whom my hon. friend
refera should not be so hurried as they
were foimally. The House of Commons
meets 'at two o'clock on Wednesday for
convenience. We had this rule in operatien last yeaî and it was found to work
very well. There wcre nu objections to it.

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL-Would it not be
more seemly if the leader of the House
gave notice that when the Senate adjourns
on Thursday it stand adjourned till the
following Tuesday. It seems to me a farce
that for the sake of the convenience of
a few the rule should be changed as proposed. I think that would add te the dignity o! the House and the business of the
country wouli not suifer.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Then the Montreal
men would want to leave at hli past two
on Thursday.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I
Hon. Mr. POWEll-It seemas to me that
admit the correctness of the statement the hon. member from Killarney (Hon. Mr.
made by the hon. gentleman, but we have Young) is mistaken in has remembrance

shortly after threc. If lion, gentlemen do
flot wvislh to remain here and attend to the
business, they can put in an appearance at
prayer, %-hich they perhaps need somewhat, and then take the train to Montreal.
The members from Toronto and other
western places are flot affected by this
motion. If the members of this House
received ne indemnity for their services, I
could readily understand that we should be
justified in putting ourselves te as littie
inconvenience as practicahie; but we receive %ý-hat I consider a very handsomne indemnity, and the country expects us to be
hiere and to do our work just the samne ns
the Comnions do. It is highly discreditable te this House and calculated te Iew'er
the Senate iii the estimation of the public
that we should be continually a]tering

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-In corroboration
of the statement of the lien. member from

requirements cf the lion. gentlemen from
Montreal. They were able te make their

net a standing order, but a sessional erder,
und it may be moved on one day 's notice.
It dees net interfere withi the chanc-in- of

standing order.
The Senate divided on the motion, which
was rejected on the folloNwing vote.

waters were polluted years ago. The saw
dust thrown into the river has done more
to injure public health than ail the sewage that has been dumped into, if. If this
Bill is made applicable to 'every city Ini
the Dominion it will result in great inconvenience and unnecessary expenditure.

1 admuit there are streams into whicli sewage should flot be dumped, and there
should be a provision that even in large
navigable streams like the St. Lawrence
and other rivers in New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and British Columbia, the scu-age
shoul-J ruot be dumped within a mile of
the intake pipe, on the dlown grade and
not above it. In the Ottawva river the iiitake pipe is under the level of aIl the
sewage that cornes down from the upper
country. That is not the case in Montreal, Three Hivers, Sorei, Rirnouski or
Point Lévis, or any of the towus along- tli
St. Lawrence. The Bill, ulthou,,h good in
itself, mighit injuriously affect a large section of the Dominion.

THE ANNUITIES ACT.
H-on. Mr. ROSS (Haiiax)-3eforei the
orders of the day are called, I shiould like
to direct attention to a subject discussed
yesterday iu the othcer Chaniber-I mean
the Annuities Act introduced iii this House
by my righlt lion. friend (Sir Richard Cartwright) aud passel by-parlianient. That
Act lits flot been received iu the other
flouse with anything like favour, and I
regret to say that there is an idea that there
is no xteessity for such an Act in the Dominion of Canada. If we turn to New Zealand, a colony as prosperous as Canada,
-inl wIIose exports according to pop)ulation,
inin for mian, arc double those of Canada,
we fiiîd tiîat they have. passed an Act wvhch
is ceitb
to thinselves, andti ould bc
a credit to lis il wve copied it. I did not
apjîrove altog-ether of our Aniiuities Act,
because it did iiot go far enough.
r. Bastedo, in a lec-ture dclivered ini Toronto,
stated tlat the Adt covers evcry mnan,
wvoman and child in Canada. That statement is far from being correct. It inclules
only those whio are capable of paying a
certain sum every month or every quarter.
If there is any necessity for such legislation iii New Zealand, surely there mîust lie
aiecessity- for il. in Canada, Nvlerc there are
thousands of people who are incapable of
payinir any amnount at ail. Those people
are left out in the cdld; there is nothing
îirovidcd for thein in any shape or forni.
They could say -%vith Burns:
'Death, the poor mans dearest friead,
The kinde&t and the best,
Jlappy the hour may aged linibs
Are laid with thee at rest.'
I hope there is sufficient generosity of
feeling lu the other House to sec that the
Act
nilfot be thrown out altogether, but
that it will be aniended to conforin to thîe
New Zealand Act, which provides that a
inan of sixty-fivc years of age tliat lias been
twentv-five years in the colony, and against
whoin no charge ci crime or offence wvas
<'ver broughit, shaîl be entitledl to a pension. New Zealand lias been in advance
ia cverv kind o! sensible legisîstion, perialis more so thau Canada, and I hope that
somne o! the representatives lu the other
Iluge wvirl sec that our Annuities Act is

aniended to miake iA the saine as that of
New Zealand.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-- I arn nlot going to enter iiit aý discussion
withi my lion. friend behind me as to the
nierits or demerits of the Annuities Act,
or the New Zealand Act, but 1 take this
opportunity of calling the attention o! the
Seniate and of the other House to a very.
serions error wiih wvas mnade lu the discussion there hast Wednesday. I observe
that the minister wlio succeeded nie, tlie
present Miinister of Trade and Commerce,
mnade a miost misleading statenient, not latentional I presumne, but a most nmisleading statenient as to the nuinher of persons
who liad availed theinselves of that Act,
and I notice that several inecibers whlo discussed it afterwards followcd bis hend. He
sai,. that 314 annuities hacl been taken,
whereas the actual fact is there were inearhy
3,000-1 believe the exact number is 2,8w0,
or thereabouts-who hail entered into contract with the governuiient for purchasing
annuities. The underlying question wvhich
the hion. gentleman lias alluded to ia one of
very g-reat importance. I will merehy say
that it would be, in niy opinion, la the present condition of this country, a disgrace
to Canada if we introduced a mneasure for
granting old age pensions. It la not for us
to provide for a submnerged tenth, but to
see that there is no submcerged teubli in
Canada.

nient that in all probability would be
charged with ifs enforcement, and I shali
take the opportunity of referring it to that
departmnent, namely Inland Revenue. 1
presumne my hion. friend would expect this
measure to be enforced under the Sale and
Inspection Act. The difflculty which I see
in the way of this Bill, in looking over
it casually, is that no machinery is provided for its enforcement. If my hion.
friend wants it to be effective, iA seems to
me hie ahould give a littie more consideration towards providing machinery for the
proper administration of the Act. Qne
difficulty that faces us in connection with
the Bull as it appears before us, is that
nearly ail the provinces bave passed almost
siniilar lec-isiationi. It is copied, very nearly
word for word, from the Ontario Act, and
I understand there is an Act in force in
Quebec which has pracfical the saine
object as this Bill. I need not point out
tîtat it is very undesirable that legisiation
should be duplicated i the provincial and
federal parliainents. If legisiation of this
kind is placed upon our statute-book, and
sinilar legisiation is p]aced upon the statute-books of the provinces, then it becomes
niobody's- business to enforce the law. 1
shall take thle earliest opportunity of speaking to the nîinistcr in chlarge of this particular department in reg-ard to the Bill,
but would suggest in the meantime that
scrnie provision shouki be inserted in tlic
B3ill iookin.f f0 its enforceinent if if becornes lav.

lation of a similar character bas
Passed by the different provinces.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-What
statute in Quebecp

is

been
the

Hon. Mr. DAVID-There are many statUtes. The matter has been considered by
the legislatures of both provinces long ago.
There is a statute in Ontario authorizing
the municipaiity to pass by-]awa concerning the sale and weight of bread, enacted
about twenty ycars ago, and I may say that
the first year after coniederation some
provision ivas inserted in the statutes of
t he province of Quebec, and the municipalities ivere authorized f0 pass by-laws in
regard Io tlîis matter. One of the reasons
why I ask, that the Bill hie referred f0 the
Private Blls Committce is fo enable the
different governments whichi have passed
legilsiation on this subject to be heard, if
fhey déosire, and i have reason fa thinkz
fhat'fhe governiient of Quebec intend to be
heard. If they do flot appear before a comnmittce of this Chamber fbey will go before
the House of Commons. I think ive owe
if f0 the dignity and ftie good reputation
of flie Senate to -do what tlie House of Coimains wvill do, and to give this Bill ah fthc
consideration it deserves. A great many
parties iii the province of Quebec are interesf cd iniils rucasure. They desire f0
lie beard andi we should give thcm an opportunitv of placing thieir views before us.
Thiere arc f wri prinicipal objections whicli
cati le uru-d ag.ainst titis measure. In flhc
first place, I hiave great doubt-and I think,
the lion. gecntlenîîan froun Halifax cxpressed
a siniiar view-as to the constitufionalitv
of thisý Bill. It is very truc titat section
91 of flhe Britislî Northt Anierica Act includes %viit. and inensures in ftic hisf of
fthc articlez Nvliil corne under the jurisdiction (if tii,2 federai parliarnent, but w~hat
does flint mnz? I arni inelinied fa think,
that tlî e lausp <toes flot appîy to a matter
of titis lkind. but rathter applies f0 the instruments whlîii arc used to weigbh and
measure the different articles. It refers probab]y f0 the weigbt of wvheat and grain in
general, and perhaps to the weight of a
bag of potatoec; or of other proauce soid
for export. Alfbough I amn not ready to
alnit tht
ftc Bil- which we have

SENATE
passed on different. occasions wNere strictly constitutienal, I admit that articles
of trade and commerce exported to other
coitries, should be measured in the same
way, by the saine instruments, by the saine
îveighit an(l measure, because it is liu the
interest of trade and commerce and of the
whole country. But does that apply to
bread or caniy or foodstuiffs usually consumed in the locality in whichi thcy are
produced? 1 think it -wouid be going- too
far to say that it does. B3read is a matter
of private local and pirovincial character.
Clause 92 of the British North Amierica Act
provides that ail matters of a local and
provincial character are within the jurisdiction of the provinces. If lion. gentlemnen do not recognize thje strength of my
argument on the question of constitutionality, I think they will have no doubt on
the point I now malze. that even if it is
constitutional, it is ine.xpeiieîît and improper to pass such leigislation, because
sintiilar legisiation lias been cniacted by
other p)rovinces, especially Ontario and
Quebec, and the Governor in Council lias
neyer seen fit to disallow those Acts; therefore it is fair to presurne that the provinces
have jurisdiction in these matters. These
laws passed in Ontario and Quebec have
been iii existence for twcnty years. Whiat
reason lias been given why the federal parliament should intervene in suchi matters?
If the laws enacted by the leg-islatures are
not perfect, it is easy to have thini rectified, a-id it is only ncessary to apply to
those provinces to have the Acts arnended.
Is it proper for the Dominion to enact legislation wvhich wilI confliet -withiActs passed
by the local legislaturee 1 ani inclirued to
think thiat the l:îw of Qucbec is bettor
than thxis Bill.

The section aise l)1o\ides that the boaves
shaîl bear a label of three-quarters of an
iîîch square Nvith the baker's risme on theni.
In virtue of this provision, the city of
Montreal passed a by-lawv lu conformitv
with it. What more could we expect te
g-ive as a guarantee to the consumera of
bread? The Ontario statute g-ives to the
province the same right as bas been giveni
to the municipality of Quebec.

JANUARY 25, 1912
wjth it, aîîd 1 think it is our duty to Jo
so, because the evidence subiiiitted to the
House by the* lion. gentleman froin De
Lanaudière goes to show that gross wrong
and injustice are now perpetrated on the
people of Montréal, and the hion. gentlemnan
speaks with knowledge.
1 have no doubt that the saine condition
of things, exists in other provinces, and
as we are charged wvith the good government of the whole country it is our duty
to sec that this wrong and this injustice are,
if possible, remedied. It is true there have
beeni enactmients by the local leg-isiatures,
but it is clear froin the statements made,
and which are sustained by the evidence
subiinitted by the hon, gentleman ýwho introduced the Bill, that these enactinents hiavt,
not been operative, and that notwithstanding
the enactinents of the local legfisiatures. the
abuse and injustice continue. While I amn
a great believer la sticking- by the constitution, the mere fact that there is soine doubt
as to the constitutionality of a meacure
is flot a sufficient reason whiv ive should
not proceed with ih, if on further inquiry
we flnd that the Act is within the pow-er
of parliament. I, therefore, hope that the
House will not reject this Bill. The hion.
g-entleman from Mille Isies (Hon. 'Mr.
David) lias moved that .the Bill be referred
ho the Private Bills Coimittee. If that
motion had been made at an earlier stage
1 should not have been disposed to quarrel with ih, but, as a matter of fact, after
the second reading of this Bill the question
wvas discussed as to whether it should be
referred to a select commithee, or to a Comnînittee of the Whiole, and the House at
that time solemiily decided that the Bill
should be referred to a Cornmittee of the
WVhole. We cannot in the face of that order with any proper regard to the procedure of this House, undertake to reverse
our decision. and send it to the Conmmittee
on Private Bis. w-hich I do flot think is
the proper eoiniittee in any case. 1 should
niake this sugg--esztion to the hion, gentleman
wvho is iii charge of this Bill Hie has got
lus B3ill now iii a pretty forivrd position,
zand inisinuch ais the lion, leader of the
1-buse lias expressed a de-sire to consuit his
colleagues, and particularly that one of
lus colleag-ues whioze departmnent would be
charged wjth tlîe administration of the
Aet, as to whlut eliuinges or amiendmients

miglit be necessary, and as it should be
our desire to inake the nicasure as effecýtive and perfect as possible, the mover of
the Bill should allow ih to stand at its present stag«e until the hon, leader of the
House is in a position to report to us
the opinion of bis colleagues.
Hon. Mr. OWENS-I think the majority of this House will agree with the hon.
senator from Mille Isies that this Bill
slîould lie referred either to the Private
Buis Comnuihtee, or a select committea.
The promoter of the Bill ls in error iii
shating that the people of Montreal unaniînouslv favour tlîis measure. I would judge
ho the contrary fromn the different telephone
messages and letters I have received froin
Montreal opposing the Bill. Since this discussion arose, while the lion. meinber frorn
Mille Isles wvas speakiag, I received a telegrain from the city of Montreal that would
show that the people moet interested, the
bakers in Montreal, are unanimously opposed to the mca sure. The telegram is as
follows:

only witi regard bo four sizes of breadtitere are many sizes of bread, and different varieties of broad-hut lhey wvoul be
obliged to change ail titeir pans and
anachinery, agaîn involving great expense.
That is not fair. My object in speaking
is to second lthe motion made by lthe hon.
senator from Mille Iles that this Bill
sQhouid be referred either to the Private
Bis Commîttee, or to some olher committee of the House in order that people who
are opposed te it may be heard. If il goes
te a Committ-ee of the Whoie House they
eannot be heard.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Titere has been a
groat deai of unnecessary discussion over
t1tis inatter, especialhy 1from a constitutional point of view. The object o! the Bill
is as simple as possible-to secure 16 oz.
of bread te the pounI for the money you
pay. If broad is worti lthree, or four, or
five cents the pound, lot lthe baker give
the 16 oz. for his three, four or five cents.
The sole object of lthe Bill is to secure for
lthe consumer lthe protection of law againsl
lthe fraudulent seller.
Hon. Mr. DAVID-If that can lie socured
by provincial legislation, whv not do il
tat way?

hon. Mr. CLORAN-It sitould appeal 10
every member of parliament t protect thte
consumer. It would flot, papy me to loige
a complaint ag-ainst tite baker who giveS
me three pounds whien I pay him for four.
Titis Bill, as far as I understand it, prov'ides ag-ainst that. It does not prescribe
lthe shape or quality of the loaf; it Gimply
provides that when a man buys bread hie
gels sixteen ounces to lthe pound. The provincial logislature and tite municipalities
can dictate the forma and quality cf the
loaf if they see fit to do so, but parliamuent should demand that the baker give
lte fuli weight cf the bread hie selîs. That
is not done in Montreal or in Ottawa. I
cannot understand how the hon. gentleman
from Mille Isies opposes this measure on
constitutional grounds. Il does flot interfore with provincial leg-islation. .There
sluould be a criminal penalty for a breach
of Ihis measure. Thoro is no doubt te
poor man to-day is not goetting- witat ho is
paying for. Parliament bias taken precaulions 10 safeguard the consumer against
short weight in potaloes, wheat, oals and
maany other commodities. Why flot Eafeguard lthe consumer when hie is purchasing
bread which is practically the main article
consumed by very many families titrougout the country. I fail 10 see any groiinc

JANUARY 25, 1912
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-What is everybody's
business is nobody's business. It is not
%vorth while. for one inan to prosecute another for two cents. The object of the Bill
i s t.o require that if the consumer wants to
have his bread weighied, it mnust be weighed
in his presence. 1 should like to see the
lion, gentleman go to a store and buy butter without having it weighed, or purchase
tea without knowing lie was getting fu'll
weight. Would lie depend upon the clerk
pntting the scoop into the tea. chest and
taking out exactly the ainount lie wanto.i
ta purchase? The sarne way with bread.
There is no difflcuity in a baker carrying
a scales, and if lie is an lionest baker lie
wvill not need to use it. Once lis custorners have faith in his lsonestv they wili not
exact weighling the brend every day. Tlie
object of the Biii in that reLarl is to safeguard the riglits of cansuniers. An ardin.îry littie scales wifl do, and if a loaf weighs
on'iy fourteen ounces tlie consumer wiIl pay
for only fourteen ounces. Parliamnent ought
to protect the poor man, because to-day
he is robbed riglit and left.

lias not been disaliowed.' The goverrnent
biave twéive months within whicli ta disallow a provincial Act. That Act was assented ta on the 24tli of Mardi last, s0 the
goverrnlent of the Dominion lias nearly
three months within wliicli ta disallow the
Act if they think it is desirable ta do so.
Looking over section 91 of the British
North America Act wliich includes weights
and measures, 1 believe tlhat the Bill is
properiy presented ta this House; but in
view of the fact that the provinces have
legislated on tlie sarne su-bject, 1 think we
sliould suspend the Bili at least until Nv
liave the opinion of the leader of this
Hanse. He wilI consuit the Minister of
Iniand Revenue, who ý%%ilI doulit, conno
suit the LUinister of Justice. The Minister
of Justice will see wliether the iaw of the
Queloec legisiature shouid be disaillwed,
and we w-ill be in a. better position ta deai
with this rnatter than if we proceeded naw.
There is no special hurry ta pass the Bill.
It seerns ta nme there is a great danger in
having provincial and Dominion iaws which
are contradictory. or even ta the samne effeet
on any question, because they woul3 lie
inoperative. If anything arises under the
Dominion law which is covered also by a
provincial law, the Minister of Justice -%vili
not direct that crirninal praceedings be
taken, but Nvili refer the matter ta the province ta be deait with under the provincial
iaw. Again, if application is made ta the
Attorney General of the province, the Attorney General ivî-li say: ' Yau should go
ta Ottawa, because there is a Dominion
liw dealinz with the niatter.'
Thuz it
happens that bath laws are dead letterS.
Takethe Sabbath Observance Act as an illustration. We have local and Dominion
laws on the subject with the resuit that
nothing- lias been donc to enforce either.
Thougfl we have authority ta deal with
this Bill I .think vie aught ta refer it ta
the Private Bills Comrnittee. The clerk
of the cornnitte shouid be given instructions ta notify the provinces, and they can
lie represented hiere if they think'it necessary. They %N-ill lie in a position ta ask, on
what authoritv ve undertakze ta pass this
Bill, and vie iviii know iviere we are.

Hon. Mr. WILSON-I think it is a mistake to send this Bill to a select comniittee.
Thiere is a doubt among hon. gentlemen
w-hether this subject cornes within provincial .or federal jurisdiction, and if we send
it to a select commnittee the committee will
send bsck a favourable or unfavourable

either provincial or Dominion authority.
If it is a provincial matter w-e have no
riýzht to deal wîth it. 0f course we ail desire that the workingman shall receive justice, but will hie receive any more justice
f rom the Dominion than front the province? , We should be careful not to deprive
the local legislature of the right to leg-isiate

House should obtain the opinion of the
Minister of Justice as to -whether w-e hav-e

the bakers fairly. We cannot charge thiem
with being dishoneast. I do not look upon
the bakers of Montreal and Toronto as being dishonest men. I do flot say thev are
doing an injustice to the labouring man.
I believe bakers are as a rule honourable
men.. It is wrong to miake charges in this
way. I feel that it is hardly fair to submit this measure to the Private Buis Committee until we are in possession of further
information as to our powers in the matter.
Wt'e are daily encroaching upon the prerogatives of"the provinces and w-e should not

Hon. Mr. CLORAN rose to

Alfhough this question is in rny naine, I

to do so mivself. I mav be tol.d that the
Englishi speaking Protestant minority of
Quebec have a representative in the cabinet
in the person of Mr. Perley, but Mr. Perley
is not accepted as a Quebec representative.
He is an Ontario mani w-ho bas certain
lumiber interests in Argenteuil, and is elected thereby, but lie is not an active representative of the people. I know from
friends in Quebec that they feel ven, sore
over the matter, that their representation
bas been bast under the present government. These are soin( of the reasons why
I placed thîs inquiry on the order paper. I
think it is a legitimatp question and one
wvhich ougflit to ho answerecl and w-hidi the
people of the province of Quehec w-l expeet

the matter. I would do the samie thing for
ny own people if thev- were in the saine
position. I have undertaken the task, prohably not te the taste of some, but I have
undertaken it in the intereat of justice and
fair play to the minority in the province of
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I am sure the
minorîty in the province of Quebec wil
appreciate deeply the solicitude of my hion.
friend; but the government feel that the
rughts of the minority in Quebec can be
very safe]y entrusted to the present representation in the cabinet from that province.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-If that is all the satisfaction tluey will get it is not much.

SECOND REýADI'-NG.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading. of Bill (No. 31) An Act to anenid
thse Quehec Harbour Comissioners Act,
l899.
He said: This Bill proposes to reduce
the representation on thie Quebec Harbour
Board to three in numiber. For a numiber
of years, representations have been made
to the federal government that the Harbour
Commission of Quehec should be brought
in to line, se far as itý constitution is concerned, with the Harbour Commission in
M\ontreal. The boards of trade of the city
of Quebec and also of Levis have repeatedly
Hon. Mr. CLORA'N.

asked and pressed very st rong-ly upon the
governmient that this be done, entirely irrespective of the political composition Of
these boards of trade. I understand the
presenit board is comiposed of fine members.
It is needless to point out to lion. gentlemen that the efficiency of the board will
be improved by reducing it to three, inasmuch as those three w-ll be called upon to
give special attention to the duties pertaining to that particular office. Heretofore the dulies ýwere performed in a somewhiat indifferent way, and it was represented to the governiient that the provisions
incorporated in titis Bill would render the
commission a more efficient body.
Hon. Mr. POWNER--I think, the hion.

of this Bill would be. I do flot question
the policy of reducing the number of members of the Quebec H-arbour Board, but the
lion. gentleman forgot to tell us wlhether
or not that was the sole object of the Bil.
It wuuld be interesting to the House-I do

Honi. Mr. LOUGHEED -My lion. friend
could scarcely expeet the present goerniment to appoint, say three 'harbour
commissioners diametrically opposed to

out that the composition of the new

clear, iookîng at clause 9 of the Bill, whether tic archivist is tû lie a deputy hond
fronm every point of view. Tint cani be conisidered whcn the B3ill gees into conimitfee.
Clause 9 of tie Bill provi(les thaf:
The Dominion Archîivist shall be a dedputv
head of a deparfient iîti the niieaning cf
tie Canada Evideuice Act, and iviti respect
to any of the records or documents iinder bis

head of a department of governmeîît, and any

sudi certification, act or th.ing- sball have the
same force -and effect as if given or done by
such deputy head -of a dep.artmen.t.

SENATE

Just how thiat mnay be interpreted I do not
know, but I think there -is one point with respect to the Bill as to which this House is
entitled to a statement from the hon, leader
o! the government here. This Bill does not
say that the present archivist is to be a
Dominion archivist. Looking at the course
of the government with respect to some
other important offices, At may be that it
is their intention, whien the Bill goes
through, to dismiss Dr. Doughty and put
some good Conservative in his place. 1
thjnk at least there should be somne assurance from the leader of the government
tiiet that is not the intention.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I thought my
hon. f riend was going- f0 suggest that that
be put in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I should be w~illing to
takie the hon. gentleman's statement.
Honi. Mr. LOUGHEED-I think 1 can
assure the hion, gentleman that the goveruiment lias the public interest at hieart to a
very mucli greater extent than to introluce
a Bill for the purpose o! disnlissing the
present head of the archives. If there be
any sucli objeet as that, I know nothing of
it. The latter clause, Wo which my hion.
friend refers, is simply em 'bodied in the
ineasure to bring it within the Canada.
Evidence Act, not *for the purpose of establishing it as a department. With regard
to. what my riglit lion. friend hia-s said, 1
think it mav be urg-ed withi every sense of
justice, that thýe placing of the prescrit
gentleman whio ie at flic head o! the archives branch in the saine position as tliat
occupiel by a deputy hiead -would receive
the approval of both sides cf politics in
Canada. It can scarcely be exîected that

times a good deal of experience of that.
Sundry departments hiad certainly two, and
I think three deputy heads and it was found
to be decidedly inconvenient. If my memory serves me, a deputy head hias many
special privileges and they cannot be removed at pleasure, but only for cause, and
that must be communicated to parliament.
However, we can discuss this matter better
in committee. I do flot want to raise objections at this stage, but the question of
making new deputy heads requires a littie
consideration at the bands of the government and at our hands too.

this Chamber, say in the middle of the session, would be hiable to a charge of
$15 for every day of the session that hie was
tiot hiere-not every sitting day, but every
day of the session. The consequence was
that some bon. gentlemen in this Chamber
-I do flot know whether any members of
the House of Gommons suffered in the samne
way but it would be applicable to themn
also-found themselves serving the public
during the substantial part of the session
and yet flot entitled to any compensation;
not only not entitled to compensation but
becoîning indebted to the Crown in a penalty
of $15 a day, which, in sorne cases amnounted
to a rather substantial sum. For the pur.pose of preventitng a repetition of any such
difficulty, the governiment felt called upon
to amend the Act, and the purpose of the
present Bill is siinply to provide that the
deduction of $15 a dlay shiail be only mnade
to apply to the sitting. dars of the session.
Hon. Mr. FORGET-As one o! t.he unfortunate victims of the law as it stands today, if there is no objection on the part
of the leader of the governinent, I would
ask that the second reading of this Bill be
lef!. over for another day. We are considering whether it wvould not be possible to
introduce an amendment to this Bill with a
viewv to making it retroactive for at least
one year in order to cover three cases which
occurred last session. I believe those are
thec only cases which have arisen since
the enactmnent of the Iaw whicli affects so
injurionsiy the parties concerned. We find
that we are not only not entitlcd to any
indesnnity for the part ot last session we
were in attendance here, buit we are actually
indebted to the governinent for the privilege
of sitting in this House during the few days
that we -were iii this Chanîber last session.
Of course if thiat was the rule %vith regard

Banff (Hon. Mr. Forget) felt obliged to
put bis case before the House personally.
His colleagues here ought to have undertaken that task, and it was my intention to
have done 80, but hie rose to speak before
1 had an opportunity. It is not fair or
right, and I think it is not legal that par.
liament should collect a debt that hie doeq
not owe from any nman. These grentlemen
werp called to the Senate at the fag end of
the session, and we find the clerk of the
Senate charging thema up with a bill for
non-attendance. There is no sense in that.
We find themn not only receiving no indemnity but charged with indebtedness te, the
governiment. Parliament cannot stand for
a thing like that, and there should be no
hesitation to pass a special Bi11 if necessary to put tliem in a right position. The
goverament would be doing only the f air
thing if they were to say thsat the charges
against these members for non-attendance
shail be withdrawn. and that they be paid
their indemnity according to the time they
were here.

Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS-I arn not concerned

the difficulty could be got over in that way.
But there is another point to which I wish
particulae1y to direct the attention of tlic
leader of the House: Looking at tlîe way
in which this Bil1 is worded, it seems to
nie flot unlikely that a gentleman wvho during tlue course of the session was transferred

his attention fully directed to the fact, and
yet the late government ciid not consider it

Clianuber would flot have authority ta

hon. member from Halifax (Hon. Mr.

of luaving the difficulty reniedied would be
to place a sumn iii thie estimiates, andl I
would suggest to those hion. gentlemen %vlho

The civil status of a citizen

It is a1togetlîer a provincial matter. The
iact that the man lived in Hull or Ottawa

within provincial jurîsdiction. If this petitioner lives in Hull, clearly hie should apply

a Ne Temere. decree, take no riglits froin

Etatus. They sixnpiy affect the conscience
of the adiiereuts ai that church, and if
those adiscrents do nat w'isli to accpt the
decrees, they are ut liberty to retire froîn
the fdld and joitn another churehi, with
casier niethols of inarriage and easier
modes of dissolving marriage. But the
uselessniess of this discussion ou the Ne
Ternere decee is shown by tise fact that
the courts of Quebec upliold the miarriage
decrees of Roume. Tlsey have no option.

explanatien cf the first pecuiiarity, that is
cf persons dying at the mest vigereus period of life, is that they think at that time of

whatever, but eat and drink xvhat their

In alcehohic drinks to a greater extcnt than

because the marked difference cf nearly
300 in the number mentioned is se extraordinary that it requires some explanatien,
and the anc I have given will fit, and
should be accepted as the f act. The largcst
number cf cases have eccurred aleng aur

fact that sewage from aur towns and cities

tiiey are not easily got rid of, and can only
he stopped through a normal condition of
health.
This Bil11, for the sake of simplicity, is based on an Act already on the
statute-book. I may illustrate by this observation: If a man throwvs a poisonous
wveed into his neighbour's pasture and the
cattie eat this weed and die as a resuit,
there is no0 doubt that man is liable for the
consequences, and if a man throws typhoid
bacilli jnto his neighibour's drinking Nvater,
should hie flot also be punishied? This is
exactly a parallel case, and I propose
to attach this Bill to clause 222 of the
Criminal Code, which reads as follow~s:
'Every one is guilty of an indictable off ence
-and is liable to one year's iniprisonnment or a
fine w-ho c@mmits ekuy comirnon nuisance whir-h
tndaingers the lives, safety or health of the
pîublic, -or which occasions injury to the per-IL of any individual.'
The provision in this Bill will read:
Every one is gu.ilty of an indictable offence,
&c., who endaugers the lives or public health
by einptying or depositing any excreta, whethler solid or fluid, of any typhoid patient on
the banks of a river, &c.
The next clause provides that the miedical attendant, or whoever is looking after
the patient, must give notice to the head
of the municipality of thue existence of the
typhoid patient. He must take measures,
by the use of caxbolic acid, to destroy the
luicilli. The excreta must be dealt with in
the manner indicated in the Bill, and noV
ilirown into the water. A clause shouil be
inserted providing- for payaient~ of the
cost, but I presume that wirl be mort proîîerly done in the House of Commons. The
costs ought to be charged to the municipality, but in lthe meantime they niicht be
advanced by the government. I think' the
B3ill is so important tha.t the governinent
should take it up and put it titrougit as a
government measure. If it goets to the
House of Comînons, with the mnultiplicity
of private Bills which they Nvill have to
deal with, it will have very little opportunity to be put titrougit. It entails a very
slight charge on te public revenue, if any

upon lthe municipality %N-lire the typhoid
happens to prevail.
That municipality can be properly
charged wtili it, because the evil is due to
the carelessness, ignorante, or negligence of
the municipality iu which it occurred. The
Bill relatilig to te pollution of streams
evidently cannot be adopted for some years
in Canada. 1V has to get the support of
the provinces and of the Dominion before
1Vreally can become law. Take as an illustration the Ottawa river, whîch derives
its water from, streams on hoth sides, iii
Ontario and Quebec. If we passed a Bill
here preventing the pollution of the Ottawa it ivould have no effect as f ar as the
individual provinces are concerned, at ail
events until the sewage question is satisfactorily disposed of, and that wîll take
rive or six years in te various cities. You
could noV enforce a Bill of that kind. Under the circumstances, I trust that parlismient will adopt this measure and give iV
a trial as il enVails no expense whatever
on the public ts'easury.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bil11
was read the second time.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT moved that
te 13ill be referred to a Committee of the
Whole on Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. WILSON-Before procee-ding
with a Bill of titis kind we should have the
opinion of the Minister of Justice as to its
constitutionality. I would suggest, therefore, that my hion. friend let his order

fact that we are dealhng with this question,
and there are other questions which iy
hon. friend lias brougit, before this House
which are equally ol)jectionable, interfering with municipalities, and also with the
rights of different provinces and the powers
given to them under the Con federation Act.
It seems to me that it is quite time that
parliament adopted a system in dealing
with questions affecting the general publie
-that they should keep within their awn
powers and flot interfere îvith the riglits of
Per!ocal legisiatures or municipalities.
sonally I object to this kind of legisiation
altogether. It is no argument to say that
because trade unions inake a demand that
certain things shall be donc, that we nmust
comply. Many of the trades unions declare
that no0 person wîlio Joes flot belong te
the union shall be employed in any fac-tory or any industrial institution. Whiv
not go a littie furtlier to justify that, andl
introduce a Bill declaring that a by-law of
a union providing that no mnan shall be allowed to work un'less lie joins that union
and pays the fees, and adheres to the rules
and regulations of it, shall be the law of
the land? I think hie should go the fui]
length whîle hie is at it, which to my mind
is for no0 otlier purpose than to panier to
demands made by certain classes. Wliy
bas the employer not a little right in matters of this kind as w-el! as those wvlio are
employed? These are questions affecting
the individual riglits of the employer and
of the employees. The general law provides that if a man eînploys another te,
work for him that lie shall be paid, and
if lie does not pay the law steps in and
compels him to pay; but there are no laws
ulpon the statute-booka declaring how a
servant saal be pai], or w-bat amount lie
shial be paici. It seemis te me sucli matters
should be lef t entirely to the employer and
.employee, andi if there is any question af[ecting the civil riglits of thie employer and

the fact that we have a right to deal withi

dictate how and what amount employers

The statement just made by the hon. gexutiemian in regard to the Senate's action
this Bill last year is correct. It must
remembered-and I expected the mover o!
the Bill would have explained it-that
there were two sides interested in this Bill.
even between the workingmen themselves.
I think the report made by the Railway
Committee last year, to ,whorn the Bill Mas
referred, was largely based on the i eprc sentations made by the men xvho w cx1urnost affected.
Hou. Mr. \VILSON.-Will the hon. geiitieman tellinme whether tue representativeý

were two gentlemen, Mr. Hall anti M1

Hon. Mr. WATSON-I remember it. The
represelntatives, one the accredited reprsentative of the condluctOrs, and the other
of the engineers, both stated Bo far as theli
people were concerned they had no desiu
te have payments once every two weekýs,
and were Batisfied with monthly paynients,
and the explanation gîven to the conmmittee was that the only few people wlhu
nîight be affected by the B3ill was what
they termed the ' tramp army,' who worked only two or three daya or a week ut ;i
time; .that the men who worked stuauîlv
for a railway company preferred thieil
check once a month, knowing that the pa
was sure. Upon that evidence, the coin
mittee decided te report that the preamible
of the Bill ias not proven. I was influenecd by the representations made by
tixese influential representatives o! the
conductors and engineers on that occasion,
and with the representations also macle by
the raihway companies. It was stated by
the representatives of the railways that it
wvas practicalhy impossible, witheut an enormous expense, to pay the men every two
weeks. These railways are operating frons

thousand miles, with branch lines in al

think it was Mr. Creelman, on behalf (f
the Cs.uadian Pacifie railway, stated that
they would be willing to contribute the
cost of making that extra pay shieet to any
benevolent or insurance fund that the employees of the company might be interested
in rather than undertake what hie considiered the impossible task of paying the nie
every two weeks. Therefore, the House
having corne to that conclusion last session
after hearing ail the evidence, it seems t-.
me an unnecessary waste of time to rcfür
the Bill again to committee.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-One or two remarks
dropped by the hion. mnember frorn British
Columnbia (Hon. Mr. 'Macdonald) and also
[romi the hon. gentleman frorn Belleville
(Sir Mackenzie Bowell) in regard to organized labour should not pass unnoticed.
The hon. menîber said that the workingýmen would get aniything they wanted, if not by fair means then by fouI. I
do not like that expression. The working
classes are hionest, laborious and industrious, and they get very little by fou]
means. 1 call the attention of the House
to the fact, and on behaîf of a large section
of the country I repudiate the statement.
Then remarks iell from the lion. gentleman
from Belleville which are not altogether
fair. He says trades unions have rights
they should not have. They can prevent
a inan obtaining work in a factoryHoii. Mr. POWER-He did not say that.
Hie said they claimed the right.
Honi. Mr. CLORAN-Why does the hion.
senator frorn Halifax claim the right to
excinde everyboày froin the practice of the
legal profession, except himself, and those
who pay the fees?
Hon. Mr. POWER-I arn not under examinatioui.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I have aslied a question and the hion. gentleman lias not answered. Why does the inedical fraternity
prevent duly qualified medical practitioners
an.d graduates of universities of Engfland,
Europe, United States anl other countries,
from practising in Canada? If they do not
belong te the special trade union in a cer-

115

tain province or locality, they are prevented from earnîng their living. That is
not right. The engineering body is protected 011 the samne lines. Every professionai body is organîzed on the saine hune, and
Ho man, no matter how wvell qualified as
an attorney, notary, solicitor, medical practitioner, or engineer, can practise uînless hie
is a member of the union. Even the barbers have a guïld now. No man can shave
another unless hie pays lis fees into the
gu ild. So that when the hion. gentleman
from Belleville says that the trade unions
are overstepping the mark in this regard,
1 fail to see how they are doing- so. Their
example is taken from the highest branches
of society, and it is not fair to taunt labour
for organizing trades unions se as to safeguard their rîghts and înterests. We are
flot here to pass laws to dictate to the
employer what hie shall or shall net do.
We are here to enable the masses to mainta in their rights and secure their interests
aîgainst the few. We do flot walk into a
man's h.ouse and dictate to hlm what hie
shahl pay his servant girl. The Dominion
government, under the Lemieux Act, hias
been stepping in and settling disputes betiveen the employee and employer. I will
admit that it would be a great expense to
a large cornpany to prepare a pay-sheet
twice a month, but whiat is that expense
t.o a cornpany that is making a million a
year out of the country, compared to the
immense advantage which would accrue
thý the 75,000 cmtployees of having rnoney in
their pockets to spend as they pleased? It
is ail very we'ih to argue that there is a
division lu the ranks of labour on the
question, and tbat certain moun have ohtained from their guil 1, or union, a declaration againlst this proposition by a narrow
miajority. The man wvith ready money can
buxy ail his ccommodities on inspection:
go from one store to another and select

the butcher, tbe baker, and every seller of

accounts. There is absolutely nothine revolutionary in that, and I fail to sec why
s0 rnany hon. senators have so little sympattiy for the people fromn whoni iliby
sprang.
Hon. Mr. McMILLAN-1 regret that the
prornoter of this Bill bas not been able to
place rnore arguments before the House in
support of this resolution for its second
reading than hie lias presented. It is simiply forcing upon the House a reconsideration of arguments presented last sessionarguments that were taken up, fully considered, andi disposesi of. It is certainly a
left handed compliment to this Senate to
ask us to go over the same -round again
th-at we went over but a feu inonthis ago.
1 do think that, the conmmittee to w'biclb this

of the workingmen to pay these men to
agfitate and prornote certain changes. I
agree with the views expressed by the hion.

rights of the provinces. 1 think we should
f u.ly satisfy ourseives how far this Bill

lawyer, or the son of a lawyer, I arn rather
disposed to think that the subjects of property and civil rigahts a7r entirely under
the control of the local legislature, and this
Bill certainly is in the catalogue of civil
rights. I think we should know the view
cf the Minister of Justice %vith regard te
that. We should be certain before taking

that we are acting within the jurisdica

proper thing that they should be paid out
of the revenue of the particular fund whielh
they are administering.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Oh yes, that is airighit, but the point is that there is no
limitation to the revenue which they are
to receive. They may be paid out of the
revenue of the harbour such remumeration
for their services as the Governor in Council may determine.

Hon. Mr. POWER-Perhaps the lion.
gentleman will tell us what the provision
in the existing law is with reference to the
payment?
Hoii. Mr. LOUGHEED-Under the existing law, the president or the chiairman, was
entitled to an annual salary not exceeling
$2,000. Then the commissioners received
such renumeration for their services as the

corporation determined by by-iaw. What
that amounted to I really couid not say.
I understand that they received s0 mnuch
for every meeting.
The clauses were adopted.

at Quebec. Accorling to the railway Iaw
ail houses and buildings on property takerî
by the National Transcontinental Railway
Commission at Quebec for the purpose of
constructing a station belong to the governiment. Last summer they gave notice of
expropriation to aIl the proprietors, including these two gentlemen, whose properties
were required for the station, and offered
so much for the property as valued by experts. Mr. Turgeon has notified the governiment that he is willing to accept the
amount offered him, but Mr. Guniu bas refused. Both cases carne before the Exchequer Court, and proceedings are stili
pending. Later on, with the consent of the
governinent, notice was served on the parties that the proceeclings were suspended.

The lessees of the property do not know

the meantime no rent la being paid to the

are placed in a very awkward position. If
the governinent, for any reason, do net
want the property, they should notify tle
parties to that effect, and pay damnages for'
the injury done thein. On the other hand,
if the property is te he retaîned by the government they should pay the owvners for
it. I draw the attention of the leader of
the House to thc awkw-ard position in
wvhicli these people are placed, and thereý
are hundreda of others in the city of Quebec who are in the saie position. 1 hope

they complained. I have made a suggestion to my hon. friend frorn Prince Edward

resuit in some satisfaction being obtained.
In the meantime 1 move the second reading
of the Bill, and if it is the4 desire of those
who are interested that it should be further postponed, I have no objection.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWEtLL-This
Bill makes provision only for the future,
and does flot deai with cases such as those
referred to by the hon. leader of the House.
As I understand it, it does not remedy the
injustice that wvas done ta senators or meinbers of the House of Commons who were
appointed and took their seats at sa late a
period of the session that it rendered them
hiable ta penalties for having, accepted th)e
positions. I arn somewhat surprised that
the governrnent, when they were dealing
with this question, did flot make provision
for cases of that kind. Last year I called
the attention of the Senate to the case a!
a member from Prince Edward Island, who
inatead of receiving his travelling expenses
was indebted ta the country for a substantial amount on account of having accepted
a position in this House. Surelv that
should have been provided for. W7hen tIse
attention of the late goverament was called
to it, my right hon. friend., the then leader
of the House, not only admitted the injustice, but madle a tacit promise that it
should be -remedied. I arn glad that my
lion. frîend bas suggested that this niattcr
should. reinain upon the order paper until
the attention of the g-overnment -%as called
to the injustice, and ta the fact that no reinedy has been provided for it. I should have
preferred-and I think the general opinion o! the members of the Senate and the
House of Commons wio have considered
the provisions of the present Indemnity
Bill is similar ta mine-that the Act should
have been rernodelled froin thec first cIau-t
ta the îast. It is apparent to cvery one w'ho
bas studied the question, and considered
its application ta members of parliament
that there are injustices and incongruities
in it. 1 pointed out upon previous occasions that the most wealthy men in fuis
Dominion who are members of the Senate
could attend, under the law, and did atHoei. Mr. LOUGHEED.

tend but a very few days during a session
of three, four, five or six mnonths, and
drew an indemnity nearly ns large as
those w~ho were present every day the benate sat. Surely that is neither justice nor
equity, and I do not think the provision
should continue on the statute-book. The
saine incongruities and injustices exist in
reference ta the payrnent o! mileage of
members attending this Chamber. Take
the case of Sarnia and London. 'Wlen a
senator leaves Sarnia ta attend parliament,
he takes the saine train which brings the
senator froin London. The same time is
occupied and the samne expenses are incurred by bath senators. One receives six
or seven dollars, and the other receives
thirty. The law provides certain payments
for miembers of parhiament and senatars
who live 400 miles from the capital, while
tise payment of the member wha lives 399
miles is reduced ta the actual expenses of
lis puillman and meails en route. L3 there
any reason in thatP Abolish the travelling
allowance altogether if yau like. I arn
nat advocating an increase of payment for
mileage ta any o! us. Place every meinber on the saine basis and equity and justice will be done. I arn sure the hion. leader of this House realizes this fact, and
will eall the attention o! bis colleagues ta
these inequalities, incongruities and inj ustices ta members and senators which exist
sînder tise present law as administered. I

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I have had some experience in these matters, and I mighit tell my hion. friend thismy strcng conviction is that the Prime
Minister cf Canada has, and wvill continue
te have ail that hie cani possibiy attend te
in discharging what are known te be the
duties attached te his office, and that the
resuit cf this-while theoreticaily my hion.
friend is ail right-wiIi be that this matter
will bo left te a very great extent te the
permanent Under Secretary. The present

permanent Under Secretary is a

good offi-

cer, and will conduct it very %veIl, but hie
may net aiways be equally gocd. Whîle I
have no disposition te oppose tlie progress
cf the Bill, I think my hion. friend wvili
ftnd that in this country, which is a federai repubiic in a sense, the Prime Minister
is obiiged te be absent frequently for very
considerable spaces cf tirne from the centre of affairs; and 1 can conceive a considerable number cf cases in which the fact
that hie is the formai head cf this department might cause considerabie incenvenience and considerabie delay.
However '
the hion. gentleman's gevernment is responsibie, and they must do as they please.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I shouid be
very giail té let the third readingc stand
after the committee rises, and I shahl direct
the attention cf the Prime Minister te the
remarks which my rigbt hion. friend has
made. They may appeai te him se strongiy ns té iead te the insertion cf a provisien that, upon an eider in counicil-. this
office may be attached to any other departmnent cf the gevernment.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER-I be&ieve that the
direction cf this office reguiarly appertains
te the Premier. If my marnery serves me
right, in former times, before we had representative government in the shape we
have it now, the foreign affairs were under the direction of the Secretary cf State,
who, at that time, wvas Prime M-\inister;
hae was, I believe, a Stuart under the Bourbons. Mutatis mutandis, taling the change
reverting
cf the name, the office acttual
tri the Premier is what it wvas in the ha-

Hon. Mr. POWER-I realize the fact that
there is a good deal of force ini the objection taken by the right lion. leader cf the
opposition, but I cannot say that I have
been convinced by what hie has said that
this Bill needs amendment in this particular. The external correspondence cf
the country must, as a matter of course,
corne before the Prime Minister; and it is
tibove ail things desirabie that the correspondence should be, as far as practicabie,
confidentiai. Now, under the system which
has been in operation during the last two
years or so, this correspondence had to
pass through three or four biauds after leaving the Prime Minister's office. That wvas
robjectionabie, and I arn glad that this Bill
proposes to do away with that objection.
As te the case cf absence of the Prime Minister, I thin]k it is the universal practice
that when the Prime Minister is absent
fromn the capital some éther hion. gentiemaan aots as Prime Miniister, and cf course
hie would be the acting Prime Min ister
with respect te this department ýas well as
thle department which the Prime Minister
for the time being occupies. Then, while
it is ne deubt true that the duties of the
Prime Minister are ncw more engrossing
than they were some years ago, stili 1 do
net. think that, ccnsidering that hie has te
see this correspondence, this Bill is gbing
to impose any very great additional burden
on him. And we find this, lion. gentlemen,
that in a great many cases the Prime Minister cf Canada bas occupied the position
cf head cf an important department. I
remember that at one time Sir John Macdonald wvas Minister cf the Interior, and
at another time hie was Minister cf Railways. The hion. gentleman frcm Hastingas
was Minister cf Militia, I think, when lie

However, 1 do flot rise to discuss the position that the railway employees took. We
are now dealing- w~ith the principle of the
Bill. I hiad occasion to say last year that
1 could not comprehiend on whiat lines this
Bill was framed; but the hon. gentleman
from Ottawa (Hon. iNr. Belcourt) lias just
drawn attention to the fact that the division
seenis to be very clear indeed. This seems
te be governing railways whicl had been'
subsidizel by the government of Canada. I
wonder wiîy my lion. friend lias not drafted
this Bill to cover the railways that have
been incorporated by the Dominion, because they fail under the jurisdiction of
parliament. It does not mean thât lte
principle of the Bill would not be adhercd

The question iii titis appeal is as to the

Honi. Mr. POIRIER-I have rnad.. a
particular study o! this Bill, because 1
arn somewhiat interested in tihe matter of
archives. The gavernment has made a
gond move in trans!erring the archives
frorn tie Agarîcultural Department to thsat
cf the Prime Minister. But this clause
sornewhiat. puzzles me; it changes to a con-

exactly the salary drawn by Dr. Doughlty,
whichi prima facie shows equality- at least
of salary. Equality of salary in this case
pretty well indicates an equalîty of status.

tutder this clause, is going- to become o!this gentleman?

ment is Dr. Doughty.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER-What I wanted to
know was whother any provision wvas made
for thisi gentleman, w~ho at the time of bis
appointment occupied a position as regards
salary and status, exactly on a iévei with
Dr. Doughty, except as to title.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I arn entirely
unaware of an conteifflated interference
with the present omployces of the department. My hon. frieîîd ivili have to rely
on the Prime Minister, who ivil ho the
head of that department, Eeeing that ju-tice
is extcnded to ail the employees.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER-I arn g[ad to hear
that. I miay raise the matter later on, but
I certainly rely on my leaders, the Premier
and the leader in this House.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-There cannot bo
two deputy heads of a simail department.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER-Thie lion, leader of
this House says there cannot be two deputy heads. I crave permission to contradict him. There cani ho, and thero are
at times, in certain places, two deputy
heads; witness the librsry liere, wliere lMr.
Deceiles is librarian and Mr. Griffin is also
librarian, Mr. Decelles holding precedence.
The position of archivist is as important to
this House and to the country as that of
librarian. An Enrzlishimsn once ssid: 'Give
me the making of a nation's songs snd I
will give you the r.naking of its laws.'
Gentlemen give me the making of the
hîstory of a country, and I wili pretty wvell
shape its standing or its good name in
history. Iii this particular case I liave
personiaily ail confidence ini the actual lucumbent o! the place, but it is most important that our archives be well looked
siter. I wili give anotmer instance to my
lion. leader where two deputy heads are
ernployed-I refer to the Civil Service Comnîissioners, Mr. La Rochelle and Mr. Short.
It is still more important in the case of
the Arelhives that the departmcent should
have e.t its head one wvhose partîcular
attention should bc devoted te the Englisli
end, and whio slîould ho Archîivist with
precedence. Dr. Douglîty slîould have that.
But another one, as was intended by thie
lion. Mr. LOUGUER~D.

Liberal government, should hold a situation equal to that of Dr. Doughty in order
to look after what constitutes the great
bulk of our archives, that part of it which
is more difficuit of access and more difficuit of understandingý, because it is-remote
and goes down to the foundations of our
country. Although trusting to, the wvisdom
of my lion. leader-and nîo one trusts him
mrnoe iniplicity-I say that on the face of
thiis Bill there is apparently a dropping of
one of those two gentlemen. Now, 1 %vould
not hiave Dr. Roy appointed chief archivi.st; Dr. Doughty should have that titie;
but I would have Dr. Roy continued in
the status given hlm by the other government. 1 have reasoni to ask for that. In
Nova Scotia there was a commission
appoiiuted by the government at Halifax, and Dr. Atkins wvas appointed
withi the objeet of gathering documents and preparinz a docuinentary
book wvhicli would serve for historians.
He did that. and what is the cons-equenice?
To-day we have proof s that a larrge nuniber of documents favourrole to the French
Acadians, justifyiaig thern as it were, have
d-isappeareid-iand it lias been ý;u.gelt-ed
by wxriters of authority that their disappearance wvas -not 'accidientai. Whiat is flie
consequence to-day? Historiansz take the
compilation of Dr. Atkins, and every tirne
condemn the Freich Acadiens in the iiatter of their deportation and justify thoFe
who deportel theni. li the French m-ere
gnil
and deserved to be deported, let
history say so; lot the trutli be toid:,
but there should be no garbling of documonts upon whichi the history, and honour
of a nation, or a people is based. 0f
course nothing of this sort can happen with
suclh mon as Dr. Doughity or Dr. Roy; but
ocs very

I arn giving- an instance

I arn taking hore, and that has been taken

Hon. Mnr. POIRIER-I desire to ask what
lias beceome of a certain order in council,
dated April 17, 1908, which appointed a
commission to act with the Dominion Archivist in collecting documents?
The members of the commission were foremost historians from Ontario and Quebec. Dr Roy
was among them. The commission found
favour with the public and the newspapers
on both sides. I will read to the House
rom a report of the Committee of the Privy
Counci!. The memorandum is dated April
t', 1907, and is a- follows:
1. That there shal.1 he e-tblihed an Ilistorial Manuscripts Coiinission for Canada,
which shall act to the Mtiister of Agricultire in an advisory capacity.
2. That the members of the said commission shall be historical scholars of recognized attainments, whom the minister may
deem it advisable to invite to take part in
the task of shaping and of executing a systematic plan for the prosecution of ail those
activities that aie carried on under the
auspices of the Archives Branci.
.3. That the main function of the said conumission shall be to co-operate with the
Dominion Archivist in ceollecting, arranging
and rendering accessible,
those original
sources from which alone an adequate knowldge of Canadian history eau be gained.
t. That in addition to such other duties as
frum time to time may be assigned to the
mmmission by your Excellency in Couieil,
it shall:ta) Take steps to examine, and revise, if
iccessary, the translation in the official reiorfs of
the Archives Branci,
already
published, and to consider whbat means should
be adopted to supplement and improve the
existing calendars, with a view of makinîg

a may be appropriated by parliament for
carrying on the work of the Archives Branch,
aund to make their recommendation accordingly to the minister.
6. That the chairman of the said commis'on shall be the Minister of Agriculture, or
in his absence, the Deputy Minster.
That meetings shall be held at the call of
the chairman.
That the members of the commission shall
be invited to serve without remuneration,
their expenses in attending such meetings,
wever, shall be paid by the government.
That the Dominion Archivist shall be, exofficio, a member of the commission.
That the members of the commission shall
not exceed nine, including the chairman
and the Dominion Archivist.
I see nothing of the commission in this
Bill. That commission is a very important
and useful one in obtaining material for
making history. To my knowledge they
1'ave performed very useful advisory and
otier work. Why has it been dropped?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-This Bill in no

disturbs
vay any organization, ifthere-be

ani organization such as my hon.

friend

refers to. The intention is to bring out of
the confusion which exists at present in
thie Archives, some system of organization.
The idea is to assemble the Archives under
<>ne central control or administration. At
the present time, the Archives of Canada
are distributed over the whole Dominion.
There is no organization, no method, no
system; everything is confusion, and, so
far as the existence of this commission is
concerned, the order in council does not
tecessarily fall by reason of the passage of
this Bill.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER-But, in order to better attain the very desirable object the hon.
leader mentions, I should like to see a

of their having acted in this matter; but I
must also say that this is a most~ marvellous

certain sections of Canada in refusing to

must further point out to hon. gentlemen,
end I hope tliey will bear it in mind, that
any men wvho may suppose that reciprocity
is a dead issue will very shortly find, s0
far as the Northwest at any rate is conccrned, that reciprocity between the United
States and Canada, or at any rate mucli
freer interchange of products between
those two countries, wvill be a dead issue
-when Canada is an island in the middle of

the way the present governiment, is going to

are mnatters that are pulilicl\ discussed.
WVhen menîhers on this side of the House
ask questions which eall for direct answers,
we are entitled to the information we seek,
and the sooner the government. knows it
the better.
Honi. -Mr. DOUGLAS-I have not so much
to say in reference to what the government
lias done or not done; I think that the rebellous spirit shown in this debate iz
largely against the clerk of the weather.
If you corne down to the facts, it ivas the
rainy season that contributed largely to
the bass sustained in the Northwest. It is
quite true that we had a banner season,
and if it had continued after the grain
was ripe we would not have had this loss.
I have a feeling, right or wrong, that perhaps there is a good deal of exaggeration
in the newspapers ini regard to the bass
the public have sustained. I arn speaking
for the province of Saskatchewan, the grain
grawing province par-excellence. Sa far as
I arn personally concerned, I neyer had a
better or more frisful season. We were
able tu, harvest the crop in proper tirne,
and put it on the market, and realized 96,,
cents per bushel, and liad the moaey in
the bank before ail this calinitv befel
the country. 1 suppose the sanie rniight
be donc almost any year. It depends a
good deal upon the activity of the people,
and a gýood deal on their hiaving- knowledg-e of the po-ssibiiitiesz of that elimate.
Many pour people have entered the western country in the past two or three years
ta engage in cultivating the land. They
liad a beautiful crop 'juist within their
reach, but they werc flot able ta avail
theniselves of the facilities for hiandling
it, and having- i threshied in the proper
season. The great want this seasan lias

%vas produced. For that the people are
thenisÈ!xea largely ta blane-. They niight
have ciubbed tagether and purchased
threshing outfits and acconîplished the
work before the rainy seaacon really set in.
Thiere is a considerable quantity of grain
in aur district stili ta be handled. W'ben
%we
hiad aot through with aur own work we
sent aur threshing outfit ta help our neighbours, and continued ta help them as lonz
as the work would pay; but when the grain
and straw gat damp it was necessary ta get
morc heip than the business would pay for,
ant we found that we liad ta haul in our
outfit. Sa ta, help thein out of their difficulty wvc sold out to aur near neighbours,
and they went on as long as the weather
would permit. I think the fault la perhaps
iii Providence giving us a large arnaunt af
moisture at a tirne of the year whien wve
have not, been accustonied ta receive it.
fhiat iact must bie kept in view. Anotlier
g-reat fault, ta, my mmnd, is the iack on the
part af the railway aystems of rolling stock.
I have flot much sympathy with the Canadian Pacific railway when it telils the couintry that it should not expect the railways ta
keep enough rolling stock ta move the entire crop out in two or three mionth-s. They
argue that we shauld bave patience, that
we should put up buildings and protect aur
awn grain and give the railway companies
tirne to mave it as fast as they can. The
three railway cornpanies have f ailed ini
getting as muoh work done as they haopeil
ta do. That is an aid stary. It is not a
thing which hias came an the railway coinpanies because ai the pecuiliarities ai onc
scason. They have been struggling with
this difflculty as long as I know anything
af that country, and I have been there
thirty-two years. I knaw somet.hing ai the
asthmatic enginea that wvould not worli
in December or January, and many that
would break down hiall way ta the market.
I have in nmemory a statement made by the
bite Mr. Drinkwatcr, and I mention hi.
naine with ail credit ta hlmi for his activity.
He tald us in ail confidence in his office,
shartly before lic died, that ail that they,
could expeet ai any anc car iii tbeir ralling stock was three loads in the season,
judging by the record ai the past. Thev
had the figures ta make the statement gaod,
that a car could on]y take irom a point, say

FLI3RUARY 7, 1912

Brandon, to the head of the lakes
three loads of grain in the season.
1 said to hirn: ' Why do you not
take off these engaines and put on oxen?
They can do better than that.' It is a
known fact that there are men eno2aged in the freighting business at the town
of Brandon who haul loads of dry goods
and groceries, just such work, as the Canadian Pacifie railway ought to do, to the
south hy teais, and make iinoney alongý-îde the Canadian Pacifie railway that does
îiot do More than make its line pay. Their
jîoverty hinders them from getting a larger
iîuniber of cars and eng-ines, such as should
be on the road to serve the business
rif the country. No one ean rea(l the reports
tiiat have appeared in the 'Winnipeg Free
Press ' without feeling that the coinpany
liîa not exerùiztJ itself to îneet the neces-,tioý of the occasSion, and do what they
-iiould have douie in Dàeember and Januar-. The fau]t is ]ar- ]y climatic, to begin
with. The inexperience of the nie" settiers
and the înadequacy of the rol]ing stock
jiossessed by the raiiway comp8nies to do
thue work demanded of thein is another
cause. When they have been spending s0
nuch money in xrnproving their roads, why
have they not also increased their roling
-stock to meet the requirenuents of the country? It was N. opinion years ago that the
Caia.dian Pacifie railivav would neyer move
the crop if the output increased. In tlue
îuext four or five years they %vould find
themselves sw-arped by the amiouii, of
business recjuired of them. That is the
case now. Then there is the hiehi price we
have to pay for labour in harvest time.
Farnuiers who are alive to their business
are to-day seeking ways and means Io redunce the cost of produeing grain, so that
ilhere mav be some margin left for thern-'i1ves and their families. They cannot go
on paying the rate of wages that thev are
iio\ paving. It is very good of the people
iii the lo'ver provinces and other eastern
points, in our need, to send us help; but
"e find lals who xiever hiad a razor on their
face~s, and perhaps neyer turned a sheaf of
urain wvith a fork demanding wages of $3
a day and the best of board, and ive have
thierefore to think of nen- ways of cultivation that wvill reduce the cost and miake it
inore profitable to continue farniig.

Hon. 'Mr. THOMPSON-How would reciprocity have fitted in?
Hou. Mr. DOUGLAS-If we had reciprocity whepn the grain wvas eut, the wvheat
would not have been frozen. If we hai had
the rolling stock necessary to move the
grain, there wvould be no cry frorn that
land to-day, and no noise whatever about
the millions of bushels of grain being lost.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL-Dîd I understand
the hon. gentleman to say that it was the
bad weather wvhieh led the government to
change their poilicy aud divert the traffie

lack of rolling stock, the inerease of population and of production called for reciproeity. It %wouidhave corne like a shower of

wlhere lie ouglît to bie, it is a poor and
cheap subterfuge for hon, gentlemen to
throw the blame on the railway corporations or the government, and to suggest the
absolutely untried and the hopeless policy
of reciprocity, which presented itself to the
rua jority of the people of this country as
a dangerous experiment. The failure to
adopt the reciprocity pac.t is not tUhe thing to
wvhich is to lie attributed the present teruporary and passing-misfortune of the people
of the west. The people of the west are
not saying a great deal. Our hon. friend
hiere lias said, and 1 have no doulit at al
that he is perfectly justified and ivarranted
in saN ing it, that it will be found in this
case, as in Tnost other cases, that the predictions of loss to the farmiers are' bcing
grosslv magnified, and that probably in the
next ilhree or four monilis. wvitb the advent
of g-oodl weathier and the activit, of the
Canadian Pacifie railway, they il get ail
this surplus crop to the market in good condition and we shall hear no more about
it; the dark clouds wvill disperse and our
frienda will retire again under the old reciprocity banner.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-In replying to the
lion, gentleman, 1 would desig-,nate hini as
a sinall Canadian, and 1 would draw bis
attention to the inquiry that is niow on tlie
order paper as to wliy immizrants do not
go to the eastern provinces. 1 do not wý\onder why they refuse to stay in the easterii
provinces. I think this is the first occaý
sion I have heard an lion. niember say that
the western provinces are producinga ton
mucli xheat. I think the banks, the imn
plement manufacturers, and other manufacturers would hold up both hands if there
were more people in the west, for the openmeil up and settiement of the w'cst is the
makin,, of Canada. TIlierL is iln place iii

per cent. I think, of them, the largeat wheat
producing cpmmunity in Canada, voted for
reciprocity, and voted that way regardless
of party. Alberta voted the same wvay.
Tlîey voted for a market, and they were so
sure that reciprocity would carry that the
grain buyers, shrewd business mien, were
paying ten cents to fifteen cents a bushel
more for barley thian the market prîce viarranted because they expected to -et it into
the [7nited States nmarket free of duty after
the election. So far they are being retarded by thc action of our friends in eastern
Caniada. 1 ask, my lion. friend vihere the
miarket is to be found? He says, iti some
country that m-iIl furnishi us sonethiîig that

Vwecannot ourzei produce. Is there any
niarliet iii the wuý-rld that wiii net, furnislb
ourselves produce? Recins with, vhat mwu
iorocity- dici not Aitit off tire other markets,
but it gave us free access to that other
nmarket for our products. We must have
the United States market for our wheat;
there is no other place to which we can
ship it and find a market. My hion. friend
suggested Liverpool. A great many people
are under the impression that vie can keep
on1 Lrowiig viheat and market it in Liverpool. The British Isies are trying to reduce the population, and a great niany people are spendinc. ilnoney to assist that polie'v. Last year we shipped some forty-two
Million bushels of Nviieat to the British
Isles. and my information is that we shahl
niever again ship more than fifty million
bushels there, for the reason that the miller
in Britain buys wheat. that suits bis trada,
aruJ a great deal of the flour there is made
fromî w'heat, being used by people who
do0 nct know Ille strength o! flour. The
Britiýzh Isle2- have a popirlationi of forty

Onitario are being educated to eat liard

is increasing, as bias been stated. and il.
is quite possible that inside of five
years the Northwest will have fixe hunidred million bushels of wheat for exp)ort. My lion. friend %virl say that tlîat is
'l calainity. I wonder what the bankers and
iiianufacturers %vill say about it? They wvill
say it is a good thing for Canada and for
their business, for if it wvas iot for the
wheat production of the Northwest the
money could not he spent with the manufacturers of casteriu Canada that now makes
thc'ni prosperous. WVe grow the wheat for
theni, and vie are able to pay for the groods
they produce. We -should not listen'to a
small Canadian's remark that it is not wise
to produce unless vie are looking for a
market. The people of the west are not in
that position, because tlîev did look, for a
mnarket, and they wirl get it; end the wealth
of Canada depends on the opening up rai the
great Northwest and the production of %vieat
-that staple article whichi we ean produce
I)etter than anv other countrv in the world.
As an apoiogist for tire railroads, my lion.
friend is probh1l?. a success. He b;as told
us aIl the good things they have done. But
in referring to railways, this inatter of conjestion is not one of only recent date. MWhy,
Iris leader, or recognized leader in the other
House, (Mr. Ilordon) when the late government sugg-ested huildincr the Grand

policy of purchasing the portion of the

Lake Superior, to give us one road less
rather titan one more, and niake it a governinent road. That was bis policy-to restrict the construction of railroads to carry
our wbeat cast and west. Now, as hias been
stated by the hion. member for Prince Albert, the railwvay companies are up against
a rohJem this year that thex- cannot solve,
and they bave to admit. it. One reason,

which bias net been referred te bere, is the

the trains. These thing-s are beund te
occur; but are Nve te ho told that w-e sbould

Surely net. I say we are te go on. I believe the imigration policy of the late geverrnnent will be continued by the present

thqt iii the tlîree luower province..tlere lias
been practica]ly no increase of population.-

In the province of Nova Scotia, if one excepts the cities of Halifax, Sydney andi
Glace Bay, there has been, I. think, an
actual falling off of population. In the
province of New Brunswick there lias been
a slight increase, but in the province of
Prince Edward Island, which has been
very properly called the g-arden of the guli,
oixe of the nîost fertile portions of the whole
cauntry, timere has beeni a very considerable
decreaýse iii the population during tlic last
ten years. Take the great province of Onitario, wlule there lias been some increase
in the aggregate population of the province,
%vlienuce citle to examne a little carefully,

is only reasonable and proper that it should
'je made in tlîis Hue inasinucli as it cannot~ just now be made in the other. It is
stateil iii this resolution that the committee bc autlîorized to expend a sumn fot exceedingm in the whole $500. It will bie rernerbered that when the Committee on
Publie Health were authorized to make an
investigation two years ago, 1 think it
was, they were given power to spend the
saine amount of money, and I do flot think
that they spent ail the money which was
appropriated. I have no reason to suppose
,that the comrnittee which 1 ar n oving for,
if appointed, ivill spend anything like the
$500, but 1 put it at that amoulit in order
to 'be safe. 1 do not t.hînk, it necessary ta

whieli I fin particularly well acquainted,
as 1 ]lave the honour o! representing- the
whle, o! tliem, or parts o! thlem, according
to the' way in which they were gerrymandered frim timie to time. Now, in those constituencies-and hce was riglit in saying that
thoy are among the most fertile in ail Ontario , and I might say in ail Canadathere lias been a very steady, and a very
formiidable deerease o! population within
the last twenty or thirty years. I believe
I ain right in saying that flot merely lias
thiere been a decrease, as hie stated, o! some
9,000 in the three riding1s within the last
ten years, but that since 1891 the decrease
has amounted to fully 20,000. The sane
thing lias taken place in a greatmnany other
Constitueuicies. I believe that out of tlue 86
constituencies into which Ontario is divideil, scarcely sxteen of those, alinost iiivariably citv constitueucies, or constituencies in whiehi there are large tow'ns, have
grown considerably at the expense of the
rost of the comnîunity. There are of the
86, scarcely more than 16, I believe, th&t
show a positive increase, and a very great
number that ehow a downright decrease.
No doubt the general resulta. o! the census
were satisfactory. The population of Caliada. lad increased by soniething- like 1,750,000 within al space off ten years,, a most
gratifyiug exhibit conipared with the increaqe that liad taken place the preceding
eleven years, and quite equal to the increase whîieli took place iin the Unîited
States, wh&nh their population was about
the saie as ours was in 1901. Nevertheless,
1 think my hion. friend's comndttee will do
a considerable service if they investigate
and report to us the reasons, so far as they
cani ascertain them, whv in sucb a country
as Canada-, more particular]y in such a
province as Ontario, sud I might add Prince
Edward Island-Hon. Mr. POWER-And Nova Scotia.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWVRIGHT
-Nova Scotia, I amn inclinied to think, is
more a maritime than an agricultural province. But in any case I tiak that my hon.
friend caninot employ bis spare limie better
than.in endeavouring to obtain information,
from wliatever quarter he ean, as to wvhal.

v-ery unfortunate circumstances-,- that is, the positive loss whieh lias occurred in so nîany
fertile rural constituencies and tlîe drift
%vbielî lias taken place, froin various causes
and reasons, towards the eiies and towns
in their vicinity.

Hou. Mr. LOUGHEED-I quite agret as
to the desirability o! appointing- a select

I think, however, that such a comnîittee
will liot discover causes witli which wtc are
iiot farniliar at the present tiîne, but miay
in :111 prohability be better able le direct

geuîeratiouis past lias been westward. Tiue
ientive to aiy nman is te reaeli soine place
whcere there are greater possibilities btiore
iii titan in soine comînunity which lias
practically been developed. The United
States have passed through the saine difficulties-at least the New England Stateb
have-from which the maritime provinces
suifer. When the western prairies o! tbe
United States wvere opened up, the 'New
England states became to some extent depopulated. When our western provinces
were opened up, the sanie effeet wvas found
in the eastern provinces o! Canada. That
is bunuan nature. It is owing to well recoguized econonjiie conditions. Yen cannot expect young men, %%,ho are battling their -%ayi

in no ])ait o! the civi]ized world are there
suehi favourable conditions a'vaitiLg ilue

Hon. Mi-. CLORAN-This B3ill does not

passed very often without due consideration of their possible effect, and very often
ai' bout regard ta the responsibility o! the

crimnil offence, punishable by fine or irnprisonmient. The vast niajority of fainilies

f;:ct of depositing sewage in running streams
clts not appeal to me as a cause of the
spreading of typhoid lever. This Bill is
much in the same line as that relating to
the pollution of streams. If that measure
is going to pss, whiat ivill happen? The
saine thing that will happen under this. It
is utterly impracticable, and at the same
time undesirahle. Sewage should be discharged into running rivers. Take the St.
Lawrence. Ail the way down you have a
current of six to ten miles an hiour, and at
Quebec sweeping tides. No amount of sewage discharged into that river will affect
the public health. Take oui- lakes and
streams throughout this v'nst Dominion,
where there ar-e but few resideiices along the
banks. What is going ta happen if you prevent people f rom duauiping- rulibisli sucli
as emipty ciins-because we know that
eaaajty cans are poisanous.
The people
along the ishores of Jakes and rivers
dump botties and cans and rubbish
of al1
kinds
into the
river, and
under this Bill that would be a criminal act. There is no sense in that. We
know that in Canada, where the rush of
waters is so violent in the spring, the river
channels are washed out. I can understand
that the discharging of Eewage, or dumping o! refuse into a river at or near the
ilead of an intake pipe mig-lit prove disastrous to the people who have to use the
water; but in a case of thet kind it is up
to the health officer of the district to Eee
that nothing of the kind is doue. During
the past fifty years the Ottawa river has
been filled wîth the worst kind of sewage
and sawdust, but it did not destroy the
health of the people living along the shores
of the Ottawa, or o! the people in the city
of Ottawa. 0f course I understand the
abject of the Bill is a very humane one, but
it is a difficuit nieasure to put in practice;
it opens thé way for a lot o! vindictive
lerosecution betwecn iieiglibouirs. A man
îvithi i grudge against his neiglibour, seeing
lais servant girl dumping a pail of liarmless
miaterial into the ctrearn miglit inform on
him and have Iiim fina'd or sent to prison.

Hon. Sur RICHARD SCOTT-The health
officer naust make provision.
Hon. Mr-. CLORAN-I arn tired af heainz about the health officer. The vast majority of the people live in amail houses

ho lias prepnred the Bill %ith the idea that
he was <laing a service to his country; but
1 cannot concur in the clause because 1
tbink il zoes tDo Jar. The oniy feature of it
vdhicl givis juris.diction to this House in
the matter is the fact that it makes a violation of this law a criminal offence;because the bon. meniber will admit that
if that clause wcre flot insertcd in the Bill,
this is a inatter which is essentiaily of a
local and provincial character.
Haon. Mr. CLORAN-H-ear, bear.
Hon. -Mr. DAVID-So that in order ta
,-ive jurisdiction to this House it was necest;ary to insert the clause, making a violation of the provisions of this law a crummnal offence. To bring a publie work under
the jurisdiction of the Federal Parliarnent,
it wvas necessary ta declare that such workz
was in the general intereFts of Canada. 1
hiave alwnys ieid. tlint it was a very dangerous clause and should nlways be considered withi a great deal of care.
So il is
in this case; although it is truc that we
Iuay, %vith such a clause, make a crîminal
offence iii the case of a violation of this
law, still we inust nal abuse that power,
which is given to the federal parliament
when we mlust admit thiat there is concurrentf jurisdliction with flie province and the
Dominion the saine as in the case of the
-manufncture and sale of bread. I contend that in this case there is no
re-ason strong- enough to induce nie
to tbink thiat the federal parlianient
shou'ld interfere.
Il is flot the iact
that the provincial legisiatures of fthe provinces of thua country have a rigbit f0 do
everythinit w'hich is contained in this Bill?
Nobody can deny thiat the legislatures hiave

This Bill is C0J)ied froni that particlar

!iecessity for it. On the second rcading of
tlie Bill I gave the figures and showed fiit
typhoid liaà been inereasing for the fn=ff

the factsz that it prevailed in maîiy parts of
Canada-in Qîmebec, in Sorel, ini Montreal,
ini Toronto, iii Hamnilton, Ottawa, and mn
ail parts of Canada. The law that my hon.

could stop it by imitating what other countries are doing. I pointed out that iii the
state of New York a. similar law prevails,
and that in the last edition of the most
scientiflo book we have, the Encyclopedia
Britannica, published only hast year, disinfection is shown f0 be the only possible
mieans cf checking and getting rid of it.
Otherwîse it is sure te spread. I should
regret if the Senate throws out this Bill.
It is, at ail events, an effort to save human

wvas rather favourable to the priliciple of
the Bill. I think we are ail ag-reed that
every possible means should bc taken toi
prevent contagious diseases. But on a careîui examination of this Bill I have corne
to the conclusion that it is altogether unworkab'le, for the reason stated by the bion.
inember fruni Mille Iles. You will notice
that under clause 1 of the Bill, which is
now under consideration, it is miado an
offence if anybody does the thingas that are
mnentioned in that clause, 'whicb, endan,-ers the lives or healthi of the public liy
ernptying or depositing any excreta, whletImer solid or li(juid, from a typhoid fever
suchi and such things, expatient 'inito
(ept that it be at 300 yards; it niust le at

300 yards.

Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-The bon.
gentleman hias the riglit to speak.
Hofn. Mr. BEIQUE-I may say that it
u~ould be encumbent upon the persons wvho
had the typhoid patient under their control to do ail the thin-s thiat are mnentioned in that clause. Ini the last paragraph of it, we find the words, ' By making
any other disposition of such excreta, except as hereinafter specifled.' Now we have
lereinafter specito look to see how~ it is h
fied.' Whiat do we find in the Bill? We
lînd that it is the rnunicipality whose duty
it is to dispose of these things, aîîd if the
mullicil)ality does not do0 it, the owner of
the bouse %%ho has the paitient on his premises, will be fiable to go to jail, becauqe
there rnay be no possible provision for the
disposal of the excreta. Therefore, I contend that the Bill is altog-ether unworkable.
The lion. gentlemaen from Halifax lias
sug-gested a proper Nvay of amending the
firet clause in order to protect, in a certain
measure, innocent parties who anay be
tîffected by the Bill. But there is a mucli
larger objection to the Bill in the fact that
il is flot workable, from the nature of
things. In large cities it would be îipossible where there are drains everywhere
to find places where excreta of that kilid
could be buried 300 Y'ards fromi a sewer, or
a certain depthi in the ground. Thousauds,
and thousands of inhabitants would. lavP

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELL-The measure is for the
the difficulty
overcorning
of
purpose
in compIying witlî the provision that the
patentees shall commence the manufacture
of the article in two years. In this case
the patent is for tise manufacture of canis.
It is impossible at present to manufacture
these cans in Canada because the company
cannot put them on tise ma*rket. They do
not know what size or shape of cans to
make, and any expensc they ivent to now
would be lost to the coînpany. They de!iire
to have this clause susperided iu that respect.
Hon. M-ýr. KERR-The policy of the House
lias been absolutely adverse to this practice. Having regard to the importa'nce of
patent rights, there lias been altog"ether too
iuuch ilaxity ils regard ta rcucýwals. Proviouslv, if any person or corporation presented a Bihl asking.c for relief, they obtained
it, and whien the attention of the House
w~as called to the frequent evasions of the
law by means of these applications, a different view was taken by the Senate with
regard to such measures. There is a very
large number of patents to whicli this very
explanation which bas been given to-day
-would apply, but the department absolutely refused to grant extensions. Wheu
these people apply to the department for
an extension and it is refused, tiseir patents practically lapse, because of non-nsanufacture in the Dominion, aîsd it is open
for aniyboiv ta manufacture the article.
I do not say that I object to the second
reading of the Bill, but when the matter
comes before the eomimittee for consideration it should be tlioroughly investigated.
If ans extension is justice iii this case, we
hsave denied justice ta a great nsany peopsle.
Hou. Mr. BELL-I wilh
furnlisx a full explauatioxi

esideavour to
wh'en the Bill

be furtiser extended merely to prevent peopie in Canada from manufacturing the article. I hsave beau opposed ta granting these
extensionss unless good reason is shown. It
occurs too oft-en. People from the United
States secure a patent froin Canada, and
they ahlow it ta run until it lapses, owing
to the fact that there lias been no particular market for tise article ils Canada during
tdie tissie the patent bas been in existence.
Then, when an opportuuity arises to comnmence the manufacture of suds articles,
they apply for a renewal of tise patent, in
order ta eut out any Canadianl industry
that nsight uîsdertake its manufacture.
There nay 'be good reasons 'why the manufacture of this article hias not been proceeded with, but until the Senate is furnishied
with a reason I do not thinik we should
deal toa leniently xvitl tise application for
this i-enewal, particularhv as the policy in
the United States is of a much more rigid
cîsaracter than tisat whicls prevails here.
The moment a. patent 'lapses in the United
States owing to tise non-fulfilmnent of the
provisions of the law, they refuse pointedly
ta grant any concessions or renewals. They
have pursued a similar course in England.
A short time ago the British goverient
annulled a large nusnber of patents t.hat
liad been granted, which. createl, I admit,
u great deal of opposition and discontent
in foreign countries, tIse patents lsaving
been obtained by foreigners who failed ta
carry out the provisions of the British law.
Tise British governinent took a very strong
stand upon that question. The result was
the introduction of these umanufactures inta
Great Britain, establishied -with foreign
capital by the hiolders of tise patents. Unsls
good and sufficient reasons are given in
each case for renesvais 1 think it is about
time Canada put a stop ta all reuiewals of
foreirni patents.

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Before the or- question at ail. I arrn nerehy anxieus te

the attention of the lion. leader of this true or net? This ceones officially froin the

in Ottaw'a and M-Nontreal papers. I hoid in aisd before geing on svitls sucls an inspertrny hand a cepy o! the 'Montreal 'Star' of ant Bill, I wishi te know whetlser the gevthe 9th instant in whichi it is said:
ernment has decided net te let nie go on
Senator Lougheed, leader of the governrnent
in the Senate, stated that before the Bill
cornes up for a second reading it wiIl be considered by the cabinet. He expressed the per.
ffonal opinion, however, that the governinent
could -not cons;ent to a private meimber initiating a measure affecting oe of the iargest
,questions of public policy before the counstry.
It is unlikely that any strong el'înent will
rally to support of Senator Choquette, while
it wouid elso seema very improbable that the
Naval Art will be repealed until the government has lsad turne te fully consider en alternative policy.

The Bill referred te is the one wvhiei I
diad the honour to introduice, the Navy R"peai Bill. I think I rnay be permîtted to
ask the lion. tise leader of this House if
this interview is correct, and if it is true
that the governrnent is neithier xilling to
leave this question to a private member nor
ready to go on with il?

Hon. Mr. DAVID-Has the aniendment
which wvas proposed been made in the Bill.
Hon. 'Mr. POWER-Ye..
Hon. Mr CLORAN-The third reading ot
this Bill involves a piece ot legisiation that
aff&cêts a great many persons insîde as wel
as outside of this chamber, and should
not be put on the statute-book, notwithstanding its very humane and sanitary
object
It covers; -round which it wili be very
biard feor the leJeral authîority to supervise. Lt endeavours to prevent thing-s
which. should not be done, and so far as it
gocs in that direction it is riglit; but there
are rnany things that tlie Bill wvi1 prevent
which can cause no contagion, and yet
wvhich will, if donc, leave thie individual or
corporation doing thcm liable te heavy
fines and punishments. I have every symipathy with the object the promoter . t
the Bill lias in view, but this is a class of
legislation yen- difficuit of enfrcement,
and whichi, whien entorced, creates much
trouble. Under this Bill any inidividual,
or corporation, on the shore of a lakie or

stream, or even of the xvide St. Lawre~nce,
who empties a paiu of swill or any refuse
or excreta inte the water. even where the
currents are swift, is liable under this ineasure 'to prosecution. Now, in a country like
Canada, with its vast territories and naine-rous streams andi bodies of water, such
legisiation oughit îîot to bic introduced at
the present stage of our existence. We have
rivers and lakes large eneugli to contain
ail the refuse that the inhabitants of the
country could discharge into them, without
danger of contaion to the people. Take
the St. Law'rence, for exemple: it passes
Threc Rivers, dowvn te Lake St. Peter, past
Batiscan, Quebec, and uthier centres of
population along the shlores of the river.
These placez, witli their îîrezent systin et

it cannot contarnnte the watcr. The curThere is a tide ef

from eighteen te twenty-twvo feet ruaning at from six te aine miles an
heur, and the river is; fluslied twice everv
day. Furthermore, after yen pass Quebec,
et the island et New Orleans, yen strike
saIt water w-hich cannet be used as a beverage. Now, under this Bill, all the towns
iyiîng on tie shores ùf the St. Lawrence w 111
be affected and hiable to prosecntion. Then
the nmeans taken bv the promoter et the
Bill te put it inito operatien is objectionable. .Alaw should be law~irrespective et

net put the publication of a proclamation

evading the law. Let the Act be et "eneral
application, or net at ail. If you are going
to niake e law~ applicabile te some and flot
te others, vou make if invidieus, and therefore tyrannical. This Bill is based on taise
principles: first, et admini ration, by a]lowing if te go inte force only on tlic proclanmation et the Goveixier General. Whiat

SENATE

doos that meani? It mieans he gots a report
from one or two officers of the department,
and thereupon ho sigîis the proclamiation.
That ii tbe rule. Takze our iinland lakos,
-orne o! which are almost seas: the dumping of sewage into those great bodies of
water cannot cause contamination to any
extent, certainly net te any dangereus extent. Take our fishing-lakes. Very few
people dwell on the shores of thoso lakos,
otten net five inhabitants around a lake
miles in extent. They are froquent-ed by
fishing and sporting clubs, and hiundreds
of families spend the sumînor mionths at
such lakes ail througli the country. Their
bouses are necessarily built on the rocks,
There is actually ne soil, lie earth anywvhere in tho ncighbourhood. Whore are
they going te put their refuse and excreta
-where it will net ho carried into the water?
They are net geing te place it opposite
their front or kitchon door. Any crne wbo
is acqu.ainted with lite on the lakos knows
that the guardian fils the boat with refuse
and takes it out in the lake and dumps
it. Under the law, that man is hiable te
prosecution.
That is an altogether unnecessary precaution. Some o! these lakes
are 150 te 200 feet deep, three or five or six
muiles long, and somoetimos just as wide.
We know that the cans which contain proserved goods are sometinios poisoned, and
ail this is dumped inito the lake, and the
people who dump thîem are liable to prosecution. I eontend that this wvill be placing a hardship on ail people wbo go te the
lakes te spend a few days flshing or hunting. The clause of the Bill uses the expression 'dumping any refuse 'of any kind
into any wator running into any navigable estreams.' That provision places this
enactment outsido the jurisdiction of parliament. We-lbave ne more riglit te intertere with the littlo strtans, ne matter
whether thoy teriîîiate in the St. Lawrence, the Ottawa or any other large river,
noon. It is ultral
t.han the mii in tlhe m
vires. Fhuere cannot ho the slightost doul>t
that that clause interfere2 wuth provincial
rizhts. T-ien another hiardsbip) will arisc,
from the passions o! mon, j«alousy, envy
and veng-eance. Talke the case of a farmer
who has a mi or miaid servant te whom
be has given instructions te tbrow ne refuse into a stream, navig-able or net; porHon. Mr. CLORAN2,.

haps that servant does it. .He bas a neighbour who is jealous of ie, and that neighbour informs the health officer that sucli a
thing is being done, and the innocent
farmer is fined, and 1 understand that under the law lie cannot even k-now the
naine of the informer, who is net supposed
te appear at the trial. That is one of the
incidents that will arise under the ordinary condition of things. On the whole,
this Bill is useless from one point of view.
It is unnecessary and creates bardships.
XVhat are you going to do in the case of
our littie streams wlicre pleasure yachts
and launclies are running, or our large
rivers on whichi the steamers run, on
board o! which there may be twvo or three
thîousand souls? Are you goin.- to force
those steamships to carry ail their refuse
to say Qîîebec and dump it on the bill of
the citadel, or hring it up to M'%ontreal? [t
is said that sucb a case cau be provided for under this Bill. If se it would
be invidious. Why should 4.000 Poles and
Russians travelling up the river from Montreal have the right te dump their refuse
into the river, and the farîners who are
paying taxes to the province be prollibited
from throwing a bucket full of refuse into
the river? That is tyrannical. It strikes
nie that if this legisiation passes there is
a big thing in it for somebody. If I hal a few
hundred thousand dollars it would net
be long before I had a company established to take charge cd ail the drains and
sewers, &c., in.the Dominion of Canada,
and I would bo a miuti-millionairo in a
few months.
I would have influence
enough to have as niany districts proclaimed as I desired. Is thore anything la
that suggestion9 Is thore a company in
readiness to take over the drainage systemi
of Montreal and croate a riew plant? If
there is nothing of that kind behind flic
Bil1 just now, there wvill bo. I sec dangzer,
hardship and usoless precautioîa- on overy
side. The Bill iiighit have properly pievi'dc-d that ne niiunicipality or corporation
shiould allow the dumping of a drainage
system at the hiead et a wator service iutake pipe. The outgo of a sewer systein
shiould not be toleratod within thiree or
four or fivo miles froin the head o! an intake pipe. That would be a proper procaution and would be suifficient for pre-

FEBRUARY 13, 191227
sent purposes. I regret that the promofer
of the Bill is not present. He made a
statement the other day that impressed me
very much. He said that if this House
passed the Bill, the Dominion government
would most likely take it up and make it
a public matter. I should like to asz bila
a straightforward question. I doubt very
*much il tthe present governrnent, under the
circumstances, would have given him a
guarantee or any kind of promise thaf
such would be done. I amn very sorry that
1 have te take this course, but I fhink if
is my duty, on behaîf of the various interesf s I have mentioned, to move thaf the
Bill be not now iread a third.- time, but
that it bc reagl a third time this day six
months.
Hon. «Mr. WILSON-I second the motion.
1 have no doubt the rnajority of senators
present know vIicli way I arn Hable t.o
-vote on this measure. While I have cvery
respect for the prornoter of the Bill in his
desire to benefif the general public, I amn
apprehensive that the Bill would cause
more friction and more injury than exista
at the present time. We have no desire f0
injure any one and are desirous of doing
what is for the general benefit of the public; but this Bll would not resuit in any
benefit.
Can you enforce this lavr if if is enact ai?
Ia there a possibility of making this law
,effective? I do flot imagine that you can,
nor do I think the gevM-nment of the d ay
iF Teady to place such a law upon the
statute-books. I do not think the leader of
flie House %vould say he is in favour of
this Bill passing parliament now. Should
it be placed upon the statute-book Af would
ir.terfere very miaterially with an important
section of this commurntv. Can we place
:a law of this kind upon the statute-book
iiithout interfering with the success of the
farîners? I suppose that one of the most
important objects of the farmers is f0 keep
their lands iii a fertile condition, in order
that they may rcalize as large crops as
possible. 1 do not see that they have not
the right f0 enrich their lands by the use
of any fertilizer that fhey may have within
their control. But this Bill would prevent
if, because it says thaf ne one shahl throw
anything on lands thaf would affect sfrearns

207

running into navigable waters. If it is in
any way polluting navigable waters then if
is a crime, punishable by law. Are we prepared for thaf? Do hon. gentlemen feel
thaf fhey would be justified in .striking so
severe a blow as thaf at the farming cernrnunify? We know that all wealth and ail
prosperity come fromn the farmers and minCrs of the country; and this Bill would
prevent the farmers from producing as large
crops as they posaibly can and benefiting
fhemselvea and the country. The resources
cf the farm are the greatest sources of prosperity of the Dominion. Some may ask:
'How the Bui will aff ect it?' If matters net
how small a drain is, when the rains corne
they wash ioto fhe creeka, and from the
larger streams into the navigable streams.
You cannot place any ferfilizer on the hand
that will nef directly or indirectly affect the
waters cf the navigable streams cf the country. If we could adopt any method te prevent that we rnight feel thaf if wvas the
proper fhing te do, but fhis is an impessibility. If is true thaf there are diseases,
b~nd if is aIse true that there will be discases se long as the worl-d lasts. Go wherever you mnay you wihl find diseases exisfing, typhoid fevers and diseases of various
kinda, coming from the impurities of the
vvater, from impurîfies of the atmosphere,
and from other causes. If Bis of this kind
are allowed to pass, we will neif have some
one tryîng te purify fhe atmosphere-fhe
air that we breathe, hecause disease may
te inhaled by the inhalation of flic bacilli,
or the microbes floating in the air. If ia
a fad. There is really flot any benefit te
be derived frein a law of this kind. I bielieve there wvas an amendnient made in
Committee of fhe Whole that the Bill
should nef go into eperatien until a proclamation ivas issuei by the government.
Wihl that benefit the public? AVill thaf prevent injustice beiii-- done? \Vilh thaf prevent innocent men from being charged wvith
a crime and beinz severely or heavily punishied? I sav no. On leeking at the Bill
to-day, I find the aniendmnent has nof been
incorporated in if. The amendmenf proposed left if entirehy in the handa of the
goveroment of the day te put the Acf in
force. But does the mover of that amendment provide that if if is once put in force

SENATE
the provision may be repealed? I could not
find that if it came into force there are
means provided whereby it can be repealed
whenever it was feit that it was no longer
required. The senior member for Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Power) had control of that amnendment, and I would like to know fromn
him if there is *a clause providing mneans
whereby, if the Bill becomes the Iaw of
the land, it can be repealed? As far as I
can understanzl, once it becomes law it remains there unless the whole Act is repealed. It is true there was contamination
of the waters of the Ottawa; we have contamination of the waters at Te.ronto and
some other places, and the typheid fever
was imputed to that cause. We will have
typhoid fever s0 long- as there is animal
matter in the -water or in the land. The
cause of typhoid is the deposit in water of
vegetable and animal matter. You will
have animal matter constantlv in the
ground; you will have angleworrns and
other impurities, and on the prairies, I understand, yeu will have any amount of de.
caying animal matter in the wells and
other places there. That being the case,
how are you te prevent it? Can you prevent a man, from dicging a well and throwing- the excavation from the well upon the
greund around him, because the ramn wihl
wash it into the strearn? I amn very much
afraid indeed that the promoter dil
flot consider all the difficulties raised
by this Bill. Further, what are you
«oing to do in reference to the navigation of
our Great Lakes? Boats are plying every day
during the season from one end of thern to
the other, and no doubt the water becomes
more or 'less containinated along1 their
course. Will yen interfere with trade and
navigaation in their case? Yen wvill have to
do it if yen interfere with the righit of the
citizens to throw weste niatter into the
water. Ihen, as to our riglît te legisiate
upon this matter, it is contendcd by somne
that we have jurisdiction. I reallv do net
know. I understand that civil rights corne
directly within the power cf the local legislatures, and they are the bodies te enact
laws in reference to such matters. Have
they net already enacted laws te protect the
hea'lth of the citizens? Take, for instance,
Toronto. There they have typhoid fever
Hon. Mr. WILSON.

insputed te the pollution in the lake; the
intake was tee near the shore, and it caused
that difficulty. Did they legislate? Yes.
Provinces have laws upon their statutebooks te prevent the spread cf such diseases, and they are the authority te look
aiter it; their officers are employed for that
purpose; and if yeu have tee many officiais
appointed ta look after violations cf the law
yen find that the law will be very poorly
enforced.
What oight has parliament te interfere in the proper jurisdiction cf the local
legialature? We are intruding tee much
on the prerogatives and rights cf the -local
legislatures and 1 feel that we are net as
cempetent te look aftoer local interesta as
the provincial authorities are. That being
tIse case, we sheuld hesitate before multiphying crimes by enactments cf this kind.
There are enoughI crimes already; if we
go on increasing the number we will reacli
a peint where innocent people will be
af raid ta do anything lest they violate some
law. Moreover, I do net see how we are te
carry eut this hegisiation in cases where
there is joint jurisdiction. Take the great
hakes for instance; on one side the jurisdiction is under the law~s cf the United
States, on the other under Canadian lamvs.
Can we compel the people cf the neighbouring country te ob-serve our laws? They
have their own state laws desig-ned te protect the hiealth cf the people, and se long
as we are net fullyosaiisfied that this miatter coûmes under our juriadiction we should
hesitate before passing a law cf this description. 1 feel very strongly that it is
net in the intereat cf the general publie
that this measuire should be placed on the
statute-book. I feel that it should be held
over until we are thoroughhy satisfled that
it is within our jurisdictien, and I aun
therefore oppesed te the third reading- of
the Bilh.
Hon. Mr. POW%ýER It is laid down in
our rules, and cf course it is the universah
practice in parhiamentary bodies, that ob
jection te the principle of a measure shal
be taken at the second reading. The speeches
nmade by the hion. member from the Victoria
division (Hon. Mr. Cloran) and the hon.
nieimber from St. Thomas (Hon. Mr. WVilson) would have been quite apprepriate

FEI&RUARY 13, 1912

if directed against t.he Bill at its second
reading, but I do not think they are altogethier ln place ait this stage. The Bill as
introduced in this House first, was, if I
miay be aiiowed to say so, just a littie bit
crude. It %-as a Biil that did not seem
to provide the nsachinery for bringing its
provisions into operation in a satisfactory
way, lbut the Biil was amended in Committee of the Whole, and I shahl now as]. my
hon. friend from St. Thomas to listen to
the amendments thezi made.
8. Sections 0, and 3 of this Act shall not
corne into operation as tO any area, district
or iocality, sîntil a date to be appoinited by
the Governor in Couiieil by proclamation publiQzhed in the 'Canada Gazette' and in suçh
other wav as na be deemed advi&able. Such
proclamation shahl elso describe ciearly &uch
area, district or iocaiity.
That is to providc that no action can be
taken under this Bill until the Governor in
Council sees fit to take action. It is not at
ail probable that the Governor in Council
w-ili take hiasty action. We ail know that
goveruments are influenced by a strong
desire to meet thse views of their oonstituents, a.nd if there is any strong sentiment
in any district against being brought under the provisions of this measure, we are
perfectiy sale in saying that the Governor
General w-ill not bring the Act into operatien as to that district. That is the first
point. Then the second subelause goes on:
2. The Govprnor in Couvcil may freim time
to time as he deems advisabie issue prociamations publishied es aforesaid bringing such
sections 2 and $ into operation as to additional areas, districts or localibies.
It jiist provides for tJie modus operandi
of the Bill that is, as one district alter
another is satisfied to put thîs law in operation, tise Governor in Council will publii a proclamation and the lasv wîi go
into operation. I wish particularly to direct the attention of the lion. member frein
St. Thomas to the third subelause:
3. Any proclamation issued under this Act
may be revoked or amended from time to
time, slicl revocation or amendment to b.
made known by proclamation pubiehed ag
aforesaid.
The lion. g-entleman stated that there was
no means afforded of getting rid of the Act
alter it camîe inito operation. I think it is
a pity the lion, gentl emani had not read the

209

amexîdment made whien the Bill wvas in
Conmittee of the Whiole. I arn reading
from last Friday's ' Minutes.' I did not rise
to repiy to these two lion. gentlemen, but
si:npiy to call the attention of the House,
a% tltere are' some members present who
%% n4.it here on Friday, to the exact wordere
ing of the Bill as it ie now before us. It
cati (Io no harmi whatever now.
Hon. MT. De VEBER-I did not think any
argument was necessary to show the House
the necessity for such legisiation. This is
the third year we have had practically the
same Bill before us. Three years ago, the
Bill wvas introduced by tihe hon. gentleman
from Ottawa, (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). It
passed the second reading. It was referred
to the Commiittee on Public Heaith and Inspection of Food, of which 1 happened to
be chairman, and on oui- recommendation
was referred to tise Conservation Commission. Theyv considered its provisions and
were favourably impressed with it, and last
session the Biil was reintroduced by the
lion. gentleman, passed this House, and
owing to the way it was retarded in thet
Senate it reached the other House too late
to have any action taken upon it. I
wish to take note of one or two arguments
that have been made, which show the total
ignorance of some people in speaking on
questions sncbi as this-arguments that
might have been effective fifty years ago,
are nowý advanced against this Bill. My
hon. friend lays great stress upon the hardship there will be on the few people who
go out for the summer and camp, or have
boat-houses upon the lakes, who wish to
keep their lawns dlean and free from rubbiish, who throw cans and every rubbish
into the lake. He says At wiil not do any
harm. Let me illustrate in the case of New
York. Some years ago, New York deterinined upon having a pure water systern.
They bought the Croton Lakes a.nd very
nearly ail the watershed in connection
therewith. They got a beautiful suppiy of
perfectly pure water. I may say that in
New York, and ail the large cities, tihe
water is tested almost every day to see if
it is being contaminated. They fouii'd after
a few years that the water in New York
was contaminated, They found that some
of these people who were camping on Cro-

SENATE

210

ton Lakze ivere throwinug refuse inito the
water. The resuit wvas, the people of New
York had to sjpend a few millions more
to acquire the whole watershed of the
streams emptying into the lake. My hon.
friend lays stress upon the fact that under
this Bill the names of informers are not
known. 1 happen to be the health officer
in the city in which I live, and 1 -%welco-me
anyboly who gives me information, whether ha gives me his naine or not. If any
man, woman or child tells me that he
thinks there is scarlet fever or diphtheria in auch a house, not reportel,
I do not care wvhat his name is, I
go at once and find out, and if I find
that the disease exists, have the people
fined for breaking the law. Instead of
being a hardship upon people, I think the
informer should be encouraged in every
way to lay information before the proper
officer that the laws are being broken. Upon
the information being furnished, the proper
officer visits the place to see if the law is
broken. 0f course if the law is flot being
broken, the man is not disturbed; but if
the law is being vio]lated, hie is brought
before the proper official. The hion. gentleman speaks of the large steamers carrying
thousands of people upon the great lakes.
Surely the companies which own the ?irge
steamers, who are making lots of money
and declaring large dividends, ean provide
il rcniedy? Western Canada is known as
the wild and wooily xest, but I can assure
my hon. friend that years ago, before we
had any such thing as sewers, many people
in the west, in preference to having outside
privies, had crernatories put in their bouses,
and once a week burned ail refuse on the
premises. Surely the large companies paying big dividends can have crematories that
would burn the refuse every twenty-four
Ixours? My hon. friend says the waters of
Canada are so large, and the country so
vast that there is no necessity for such
legisiation. Surely tilie hon. gentleman
could not find a g-reater amount of wvater
corning down any river, or any other river
titat atforded such a fine exaniple of aera-

been able to get a sample out of that river
that was not full of bacilli.' Another hion.
g-entleman mnakes the statement that the
cause of typhoid fever is decomposed animal and vegetable inatter. I daresay that
that statement xnighlt bave been accepted
forty or fifty years ago; but I do flot think
it will hold good to-day, because if typhoid
fever does flot coule frcrn decomposed animal and vegetable inatter, you can have
water that is so putrid and so unpleasant
to the senses tliat you could flot drink it
and yet be perfectiy free from typhoid,
which is caused by the typhoid bacilli and
nothing else. Its favourite habitation is in
the intestines of the human being, and
from the exereta of the human being these
bacilli increasing by the million, are
enittted and coýnsequent1y get into t>he
streama, and people swallow tbemi in dr«inking water and get typhoid fever. As to the
constitutionality of the B3ill, although every
province in Canada has laws on this subject, some of them very strong, and some
of them flot quite so strong, the trouble
is they are not enforced. By placing this
law upon the statute-book: it will as At were
back the provinces up, and perhaps push
them for'ward in carrying out their own
laws as they should.
The amendment was loat.
The motion for the third reading of the
Bill was carried, and the Bill was read a
third time and passed.

'Hon. Mr. KERR-What 1 ha'd in mind
-was this: in the first place, no report should

-orly of making bis owvn statement, but o!
substantiating that by evidence hie rnay

1hat, it involves an explanation. Well, the
.Act as it stands at present does net authorize or preýscribe that there shall be an opportunity given him to make that explanalion; and in justice to any person who may
be accused, or whose conduct may be investiguated, I think it is riglit that he should
have an opportunity and reasonable notice
so that he might produce evidence if bie

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-If there be any
doubt about the matter, I ai quite satislied that there should be flie fullest recognition of the princiffle, whiclh we quite
readily accede to, that any person wvhose

opportunitv to be properly representedl before the commission, no mnatter what comnmission it may be, and if it is the opinion

'involved, I have no hesitation in vie lding
4to the suggestion of my hion. frierid.
An hion. SENATOR. Hear, hiear.
-Ron. Mr. POWER.

The motion was agreed to, and the,
amendment was incorporated as subsectioîî
B ' of clause 12.
Hon. Mr. KERR-I would now propose
as another subsection that:
Every commissioner whether appoiiuted under part I or under part Il of this Act, and
every persoln engaged as acceunitant, engineer,
techinol adviser or other exipert under the
provisions of this Act, shali be incapable of
bei.ng a.ppointed to or holding office, place or
employment in the nomination, gif t or control of the Crown or of the Governor Geiîeral
o! Canada until alter the expiration of five
yeare alter this report of sucli cominis-ioner
shall have Wen made.
The object of this, as wvill be seen, is
to provide that the tribunal is an absoIutely impartial one. It may net be within the power cf the government to kno,
in appoînting a ccmmissioner, whiether hie
is or is not either then or subsequently to
beoome an applicant for a position under
the Crown. That would be a matter perhaps in the mind of the commissioners
alone; but 1 think it would be a monstrous
tbing that men should assume this duty
and undertake the investigation of the cenduct cf efficers under the Crown, deing se
at the same time with a view cf preparing
tbemselves for occupying perhaps the position cf a person whose conduct they are
investig-ating, or any other position cf
honour or trust under the Crown. Men
3hould not be appointed for tbis duty who
are appli'3ants for positions. Men should
net accept these appointmerts w'ho are
going to be applicar-ts for positions. They
should net, i other words, be showing- their
qualification by discovering andi reporting
witb reference te the conduet cf those
whose places they want te fill. No confidence can be placed in a commission -unless
it is free. Now, here are a number of ipersons who may bo appointed, thie original
cominissioners; after that those original
commîissioners mnay appoint ac.countants,
eingîneors, tochnical adviser_ý or oiher ex:perts, and t.hose gentlemen are clothed
wvith the samne authority as the commissioners 'thernselves, and mav, therefore,
have the power of investigating, of drawvingÎ and reporting on their ewn conclusions
-in other words cf creating the ground

abuses may corne wvithin the jurisdiction

Now, what is the object of my hion. friend
in movirig this amendiisent? It is to destroy the machinery of this commission. I

no such suggestion, or no suds principie,

I say that on grounds of the ig.hest public

it is extremply desirabie that ail parties

and that they should be represented by

ulterly and entirely unfair that partisans
should be appointed.
My hon. friend, or his friends -- do flot

t.hat if the various comimissions that are
being appointed are all set to, work in full
blast, that the sala-ries and expenses-not
to speak of the contingent of sub-eomîis-sioners that appear likely to be appointed
under this Bill-will run t-o two or tîhree
hundred tlhoua-and a year, judging by the
expense we have seen incurred in similtar
cases. That is their idea of economy. in

most of them wiIla be ýnothiag else-tîey
wviil flot hesitate to spend two or three hondred thousand dollars. I doubt myseli extremetly whether these commissions slîouid

grant that, to a certain extent what mny

have nio w-isli and no desire that it should

I contend that the prineipia
is a sound ofle, that men whlo are appointed

be particularly put above sus.picion of expecting, or being likeiv to receive, further
rewards in addition to the s'ums that the

FEB1IUARY 14, 1912

the e-t.iînateE w-hichi w-e have hefore u4s
which niake-. provision for a new service
ah a cc-t of $1,2W0 ta provide a private secretary for the represntatîve of the gaverfiment iii this Chamber. WVhile I ar n ot
appose<l in any sense in providing- clerical
assistance for the leader of the government,
I amn personally af the opinion that it
should nat be a charge that ought
ta be placed under the head of civil
governmnent; ad
eor
wecencur in
the estimahes for the dishursemnent of
the money irom the appropriation of
$108,000 odil whicli is handed over ta us,
've ought at least ta express an opinion in
regard ta this matter, as well as in relation
Ia the other increases wbich are suggested
in tis estirnate. There has been ne change
iii respect ta the financial si-de and the responsibility aide of the question in respect
af mnnys that the Senate gets frein the
revenue of Canada by sny Act oi parliament.
There bias been a change with
respect te the recommendations under
the Civil Service Act.
We have changed
the mode by whieh certain officiais and
certain members of the staff ai the
Senate shall corne under the attention
and notice ai the Senate; but the
Act does net in any sense interfere with
the respansibilîty ai the Senate in respect
to the disbursement ai the money, unless
we think it praper ta do away with the
Financial Comrnithee ai this Hanse. I wauld
Like, if haon. gentlemen will permit me, ta
rend the nature and responsihility ai that
camrnittee as stated in l3ourinot, page 270,
oi the thiri edition. edihed bv T. B. Flint:
'Wiienever it is necessary ha appoint any
eflicer. clerk or messenger, the subject is
referred ta the Committee on InternaI
Econoiny and Contingent Accounts, who report as ho the necessity fer such office and the
salai-y that ought te be given.'
That iii ne way interferes with the application or the provisions ai the Civil Service
Act, w-hich changes the modus operandi ai
appointment or recommendation Ie the Senate, but leaves it clear that bath in relation
ta the position and the salary t-le matter,
as Bourinot puts it, should be refenred ta
the Conunihtee of InternaI Ecanornv and
Contingaent Accounts.
Bourinot continues:

227

'Ail appaintnients and salaries exoept the
appoîntmaent of Crown Offioers. as well as tu'
mîotions and recommendatians .- for, -supera nnuation, or a leave afi absence, *are praotically regulated by this commiittee. In tact,
it supervises ail the ordinary expenses of the
Senate, apart fromn the members indemanity
and ather expenditures authorized by statute.
its members have always jealously resented
ail attempts ta interfere with the contrai of
matters which it &s the practice ta refer ta
them. Ail petitians and papers referrnng
to salaries and expenses af the Hanse are
iawardly. submnitted ta the coeisideration of
this caminittee befare any definite conclusion
is arrived at an the subjeet./
1 think that is entirely a justification for
iny asking that the Senate reter the estimîates, or the dishursemenits ai the amaunits
n! money placed ta the credit of the Senate
(d Canada to this committee, that they rnay
report ta the House in respect of matters
-ontained in it.
Han. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I should
like ta ask the han. gentleman whether the
Civil Service Act, as it stands upan the
stat-ue-bobik to-day, at ail interferes with
the principles laid down by BourinotP In
many cases where the powers that wvere
exercised under the law and by practice
were remnoved tram the Internal Econamy
Cammittee altagether, and placed in the
hands of the Speaker and Deputy Head,
(the Clerk) it placed thern in the position
af deputy heads of departrnents. I have
nat laoked inta the point myself, but I
presumne iy lian. friend bas, and perhaps
lie cauld explain ta the Senate whether the
principles laid dlown by Bouriîîot have been
interfered with ait ail?
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I do nat thinkz
the Civil SeŽrvice Act at il] interferes with
the principles as laid down by I3aurinot,
for this reazon : thiat Ac-t doe-z liot give te
the Spealier, actiaîg as tlî<' iaiaister for th(,
time being, or the deputy, uxîy otiier power
than the rnakiiig of recomniendations which
were forinerly initiated by the Internai
Econamy Committee. and refcrred ta the
House. Having made these recommendations they have discharged ail the duty that
is assigned te them under the Civil Service Act, and ',he Senate bas ta deal with
these recommendations in the way that
have always deait with thien. as Tinarinnt

Hon. 'Mr. LOUGHEED-Sectioii 22 of the
Act, in my judgment, Jill bear the oppostie interpretation to that which the hon.
gentleman lias placed uponi it, because it
designates who shall be the hends of the.
department, and, o! course. I assume that
the heads of the department %vill work in
harrnony %vith the Senate; but it seems to
me that the Sonate and mot the committee
should act in these matters and should
proiounce iipon the various reports.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-The lion, gentleman said, as 1 understood him, that those
estiniates had been prepared by the proper
officers, and laid before parliamrent?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I ain issuming
that, because they wvere fijrwn.rded Io the
governiment.
Hon. 'Mr. THOM.\PSON I would like to
ask the hion. zeiitlînaii there, in thie consitution of the Senate, thiere are ans' officers
appointed in respect to makinz these estimates unless it would be by a reference to
the Internai Economy Committee? In the
Act the only reference to the Senate will
be found in chapter 43, and section 44 of
that chaiter, wliieli says:

,the Speaker for his ap1.roval: subzequent-ly
they go to the Fittiuw MîNîiii-tr iur 1approval before tbey beconre part of the
estimates to be prese.nted to parliamient.
The constitution of ths branch-I don't
know for wvhet reason-has iniad-e the Senate
so absolutely an independent branch in
respect of ils expenditure and other matýers, that has no connection w-ith any
department or writh thre Finance Depart-ment and is not required to have any ot-her
approt-al than the Senate itself.
While we %vouldflot interfere with what

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Thie original Act says:.

grain in his elevator ôr warebouse is heated
and that in order to preserve the sanie it
is necessary to ship ouch heated- grain to

v'here it iE. But this is going outside of
elevators. This amends the Act by allowin" the grain commissioner to permit a
car to be loaded out of a wheat field, if
you like. There is grain in the fields, and
the commissioner can direct the railwavs
to send a car there to pick, it up. I agree
wvith the hon, gentleman from Killarney
(Hon. Nfr. Young). WVhen you attempt to
save grain which lias been heated, 1 do
flot know what possible treatment you cau

wheat at the present moment is in such a
condition that if hiandled within the next

considerable extent. My only regret is that
the governinent did iîot discover the necessity for thi-z weeks ago. I arn surprised

BOWELI-Oh,

SENATE
who are suffering with daniaged grain wvill
have an epportunity to save it from utter
ruin.

Hon. Mr. WVATSON-I trust that this
House will not delay the Bill for one hour.
My friend from Saskatchewan seerns solicitous as to the grain growers' suggestions,
but if lie had watched the proceedings connected with this Bill hce would find that
the House of Commens passed it under suspension of rules, at every stage, I think, for
the purpose of providing for the emergency.
So f ar as I arn concernied personally as a
member of this Senate, having some knowledge of the Northw'est, I do flot purpose
waiting until any section of men, grain
2-rowers or othcrwise, suggest legisiation to
be passed, if it is hii the interests of that
country. I thiink we should be sufficiently
wveII informed, and my friend from Prince
Albert is sufficiently -%vel1 informed about
this legisiation, without waiting for the
grain growers or anybody else; but I cannot understand why lie should suggest that
the Bill be delayed for two or three weeks
for the purpose of hearing from some person
in the west. This legisiation provides for
only two things in emergency cases. They
have to do certain things under the Grain
Act; that is, when au elevator is liable to
break down the commissioner can make a
special order to relieve the situation by
providing a certain number of cars to take
care of the produce in that elevator, or
when grain ia heated. In this particular
case, the grain that is damaged and hiable
to become worthless is not heated grain,
and is not in an ehevator that is breaking
down, but is in a warehouse, in the fax-mers' granary. in bina on the fild, in sacks
piled up at the stations on the plet.forms.
That is the grain that is provided for in
this Bill, and witheut sucli legislatien the
commissioners would have no power te
miakie a specia] order te direct the miovemfent of cars for relieving that situation.
This is special hegfishation provided for that
purpose, and I say that the legislation is
right. I regret it is breuglt -down se late.
If it had been passed a month ago and the
commission had used discretion placing
cars and making speeial orders, I have ne
doubt thousands of bushels of grain would
have been saved, because it is onlv a few

weeks whten the weather becomes warm
that this wheat will be destroyed. and once
it is heated in the bin it is of no use for
milling purposes and has very mucli det-eriorated for feeding purposes. I know the fear
suggested by some of those grain growersa fear that was expressed by sorte people
during the distribution of cars in connection with the car order book. A man who
had -some influence with the railway coinpanies exercised that influence by directing
the distribution of cars to lis frienda;
but I think: that is pretty well over now,
because where the companies have been
prosecuted for not delivering cars accorling to the order book, they have been very
careful flot to allow anybody to interfere
with the distribution of cars. The commissioner will have a great responsibuhity
throxvn on him when this legishation passes.
Hie niay make mistakes; lie may not scnd
the cars in the right direction at ail times.
because it will be impossible for him te*
make the investigation. I think the situation is so 'wefl known and manifest amongthe grain men of the west and to the coinmissioners that hie will know where the
greatest need is for cars for immediate relief. I believe the railway companies wvill
honest]y try to relieve the situation to the
utmost of their ability; but they have not
got the cars, and if they have the cars they
have not the motive power to move them;
consequently there is a blockade. However
this Bill is in the riglit direction and shouli
relieve the situation to quite an extent; I
trust there will be ne delay in passing the
legaishation, in order that the country shah]
get the benefit of it, by enabling the commissieners te direct the cars in the right
direction for the relief of the situation.
Honi. Mr. DAVIS-My lion. friend is net

and knocked him down, for lie knows that

departure entireiy from the general Act,

to the directors to vote by proxy. It is
made very offensive-if I may use the expression-in this case, because it wouid
arlow one director to give three votes, bis

s1istziiied these lasses, and it shows
h1ave *
that one lias lost $445. another $470, another $485, anather $490, and one farmer
bias lost $580 in three years. In many
cases, af course, these lasses fall on women.
These figures are startling. I need scarcely
tell lion, g«entlemen that an ordinary farmier
cndeavourinz to make a living on a handred acre larin in eastern Canada is absotutely i.ncapable of standing Ut) against such
a loss, ani is ruined. My reverend correspondent tells me, that this is becoming a
very serious question, that people are beginning to loze hope and are abandoning
their farms. I feel that the Senate is the
place in which a matter of this kind sliould
be taken ui, and discussed. We are in a
p~osition to devote some time to the subject, anîd we are, particularly at this time,
disposed to give attention to agricultural
questionis, because we know it is the policy
of the l)reýzeIt government, to devote special
attention ta agriculture and make it a matter of more importance to assist the farmer.

Hou. -Mr. BELL-I will deat witit ttîat in

,w're conducted by the Veterinary Department, as a result of which the official in
charge decided that this was net a contagious disease, and therefore the government cannot deal with it, under the Contagious Diseases Act, and they have done
nothing more.
What I want to cail attention to is that
this disease is infiicting losses upon the
people of that locality to an extent greater
than they can bear. It is depopulating the
place, and there is no particular reason
to believe that it will flot extend further.
So far as I know, it has not reached the
eastern counties of the province in Cape
Breton, but it is very near there, and if it
should pass into those counties I have no
doubt its ravages would be just as severe,
as on the mainland of Nova Scotia. If -that
shouid be the case, it would force tliose

believe it would be perfectly justifiable on
the part of the government to, consider the
inatter, and either furnish a remedv or
give relief to those people who are being
driven from their farms and practically out
of localities where they have been broughit
up, by what is, as far as we can see, a
visitation of Providence. In early years
not much precaution was taken against
contagion; but now diseased animais are
buried or destroyed se as to prevent contagion, and the farmers are doing everything they can to stamp it out. It is quite
easy for hon. gentlemen to understand the
1position in which a poor farmer finds himnself when he bas to bear a loss of $400 to

FEBRUARY 15, 1912

by the departulert near Antigonish ia the
Y-ears 1903-4-5-£, (see report on Pictau Cattle
djisease, issued 1907> that the disease vas due
to the Ingýestion o! the weed known as Ragwort, or 'Stinking Willie' (Senecico Jacoboea)
and was therefore not of a contagious nature, it has not been possible for the department ta take eny action in connection with
it, under the Animal Contagious Diseases
Aet. The control of noxions weeds la, lu any
case, a matter usually dealt with by provincial autharities.
Schoals and other local institutions have
taken active stops towards the eradication of
r g-ort in many districts.
Copy of report forwarded herewitb.
There is attiched also te the answer a
special report prepared by the Departmenti
of Agriculture in 1906, touchiing this particular matter. 1 shaîl therefore lay on
the table the auswer whicb. bas been sent
me, and nly lion. f riend can peruse the
report, and perliaps it will throw light on
the subjoct.
Hon. Mr. POWER-The matter to îvhich
the bion. gentleman from New Glasgow
lias called attention is a very important
one, and I wish ta direct the attention of
tho leader of this House, in the hope that
hie may direct the attention of bis colleague
the Minister o! Railways, to the fact that
tbe railway bias been the ineans cf disseminating this perniciaus weed through other
parts of the province.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-ihe central cf ohnoxious weeds is a matter dealt with
As it arises
by provincial authorities.
frorn this particular cause pointed out
by my lion. frieiid, it would appear that
a grave responsibility is thrown on
the provincial governiment, Nvlio should
take active stops te stamp eut the disease.
The Federal government have done the
hest they could within such authority as
they can exorcise, but that dees net absolve the provincial authoritios from tnking
evcry possible mieans te prevent the destruction of live stock by this w-ced.
Hon. Mr. POWER-And that the railway
sheuld not distributo the disease.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I amn net aware
of that fact.

t hoe geverniinent pay a considerable portion
0if the cost of the destruction of its cause?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I do not know
t hat it can be regarded as a contagyious
disease. It is apparently a local disease
arising- from 'local conditions. I doubt if
it would corne under the Contagious Diseases Act.
Hon. Mr. BELL-For a long time the
government controlled this matter by appointing inspectors, and when it was determined that an animal was suffering from
the disease it wvas ordered to be slaughtered,
and a third of the value of the animal was
paid to the owner. That was in 1906, when
Sir Richard Cartwright was a member of
the goverumont; but from the time the departmental experts decided that the disease
was not contagions, the government thought
they were not justifiod in continuing to exercise supervision and they have abandoned
it.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-I do flot think a
lengthy speech on a subject of this kind
ahould go unanswered. This is no refiection on the governiment, and they are flot
justified in paying for these cattle. It bas
been determined that the disease is not
contagious, and bias notbing to do with the
adminstration of the Department of Agriculture. The statoment made to-day is that
in that particular locality certain weeds
grow which poison the horses and cattle
that feed on it. If a man takes up a section of country in the Northwest and finds
that hie cannot raise horses on it ho drops
the venture and tries to raise something
else. It is like the Irisbman who was try-.
ing to raise chick-ens. The wator came into
bis cellar and drowned them, and bis friond
said to hlm, ' Why don't you raise ducks.'
The governmont woull be going out of itz
way to pay losses to people who are trying to
raise something in any part of the Dominion wbvich is not profitable and cannot
be raîsed. There are only two things for
those people to do; stop raising stock or
get rid of the weed. Why should the public ho taxed for the losses of those farmers
whien the disoase la not contag-ious?

thoughlt it but right, before the third reading of the Bill, ta change the naine in the
way 1 have indicated, or adopt sorte other
naine that would bie a littie different froin
that of the company we incorporated last
year.
I amn- froni the p>rovince ai Ontario, and this is a Bill relatinLy to the
province ai Saskatchewan.
It doos nat
make anv difference ta me particularly
what the Bill is called, but as the promoters desire that the original naine be
retained, I do not wîant ta press the amendment. I leave tlue responsibility with the
promoters af the Bi. If they insist an
retaining the namne, they will have ta take
t-he xespons*bilit.y. I be.g, therefore, to
wit.hdraw the uimendment of whichi I gava
notice.
Hon. -Mr. GIBSON-Thiere is no difflculty
about the Bill, and no responsibility attaching ta thec promoters ai the Bill. When
it was in cÔmnuiittee it passed. unauimousiy.
Surely the men who atteuded the meeting
ai the committee knew what they were doing. The abjection which the hon. gentlemani mentions was taken at that time, but
there is sa much difference between the Alberta and Saskatchewan and thie Saskatchewvan Lufe, that we could see no danger af
confusion. When the attention of the Departinent ai Insurance was called ta the
matter. the superintendent could see ne
sumilarity iui the naines, and thought the
namne given this cornpany was a very apprapriate one.

Growers' Association; Messrs. Hopkins and
Green, who, I understand, are the duly accredited officiais of the Saskatchewan Grain
Growers' Association, aud Messrs. McKenzie and Henders, the duly accredited representrtives of the Manitoba Grain Growers,

by my lion. friend fromn Prince Albert.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR- Let us look at this
matter from the consuon-sense standpoint
for a few moments, and not -%aste the whole
day in discussing something whichi is not
affected by the Bill. This is an arnendnment to tise Manitoba Grain Act of 1906. If
we pass this Bill to-day, the Governor
givei it bis assent. to-merrew, and it goes
into effect. The Bill before tise House of
Gomions is a consolidation of ail the
Grain Acts, and as soon as it ia passed by
tise Gominons and Senate, and assented to
liv tise Governor General it repeais the
Mlanitobia Grain Act, the Manitoba Grain
Inspection Act, and tbe Inspection and
Sales Act. Therofore, as soon as wce pass
tlsat Bill, the MNaibiobki Grain Act cf
1Iý1bis repealed.

Bill was priniarily intended for the purtlie serious situation ini

the governaient to make up the proceeds of the
first mortgage bonde, ta their nominal or par
value wjthout recourse to the company? The
Supreme Court was of opinion that the
liability on the uart of the government contemplated by paragraph 5 was a scondary
liability only as guarantors. that the primary
liability must fali upon the company, and
that it rested with the oompany ta issue additional bonds which the goverament wes to
guarantee.
With the utmost deference their Lordships
are unable ta accept the interpretation placed
by the Supreme Court on paragraph 5. Lt
seeme to their Lordships that there is nothing in paragrapli 5 imparting that any further liabîlity iras ta be imposed on the coinpany in respect of the first xnortgage bonds,
and that lt fals upon the goverament to implement their fguarantee sa as ta maie the
proceeds of those 'bonds issued and ta be
issued equal to their par or nominal value.
Lt would be a breacli of f aith with the Grand
Trunk CampauY ta let in any further charge
in praiyta their cecurity. and as it appears
to their Lordship the company lias no poiver
ta issue bonds other than those authorized by
the original contract.

Canada was responsible sirnply for the

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I do
not see any nccessity for discussing what
should have been done in the past, or what
rnay be donc in the future. We have to
face the facts as they are presented to
us. The Bill which we are now passing involves an expenditure-if the Finance Ministcr's calculations bc correct, and I presume thcy are-of five or six millions at
once, and possibiy an equal amount in thc
future. The honour of Canada is involved
in this transaction, and whatcver our opinion may have been of the legisiation of the
past, it is incumbent upon us now to maintain the honour of Canada and comply with
the findings of the Privy Council in this
case. It is ail very well for us to comment
upon the decisions of our own Supreme
Court and of the Privy Council. Many important suits in the past have been decided
by the Suprerne Court of Canada, and their
decisions have been reversed by the Privy
Council, while in other cases equally important their decisions have been upI could refer to two or threc very
held.
important cascs, but that is not at al
necessary. The whole trouble involved in
this instance is in the construction of one
simple word ' impiementing ' a certain
guarantee. The Supreme Court of Canada
put one construction upon it, the Privy
Council in Eng-land put another. Whien the
Bill of 1904 was introduced to amend the
law of 1903, giving a further guarantee to
the Grand Trunk railway, it was pointcd
out in the other House by Mr. Barker, of
Hamilton, that this difficulty might arise.
Mr. Barker is an authority on railway
legisiation, lie having been the lawyer
who negaotiated the whole of the transactions in connection with the amalgamation or purchase by the Grand Trunk railway of the Great Western railway. The
ability which lie displayed in the settlement of the dispute bctween those two coinpanies when that amalg-amation took place
gave bis opinion on questions of this kind
special value. He broughit the whole matter out of the involved condition in which
lie found it, and in a very short time settied ahl the difficulties. Mr. Barker, when
the Bihl of 1904 was under discussion in
the House of Gominons pointed out what
hie thought might bie the result of using
that word ' implementing ' in the contract.
His uvarning wvas disregarded, for the rea184

son, I presume, that the lawyers, and
those who had the matter in hand at the
time did nlot regard his objections as of
any consequence. However, if the decision
it
of the Privy Council be right
proves that Mr. Barker's opinion was
correct. 1 have no symipathy with those
who cry out against the reversai of decisions. 1 remember that I took a fi.rm stand
on a very important question some tirne
ago, and the Supremie Court of Canada
unanimously held that the view of the government of that day was ri.ght. Their

fortunate, financially speaking, that the
warnings that were given by Mr. Barker in
the House of Gommons were not listened
to at the ti!Jle. Lt is too much a habit of
govei¶nments when thcy introduce -messures to parliament, to maintain tiiat they
are right in every particular. If parlismient had in the past, and would in the
future pay a littie more attention te the
opinions expressed by men of cominon
sense, we might be relieved of difflculties
r-uch as have a.risen in this instance. There
is no doubt that when these bonds were
guaranteed -not only the government, but
every une, supposed that 3 per cent bonds
guaranteed by the Dominion of Canada,
would bring par in the Englishl market;
l)ut for some ressont which. it is nlot my
province to just now enter into, thcy were

from. Hastings (Sir Mackenzie Bowell)
touching the dpsirabi'1ity of seeing that their
measures are very clear, and the pessibility
cf their being mistaken occasionaly. In that
1l entirely agree with him; but as to the
question mainlv at issue, -ne doubt the
present position is an unfortunate one.
When the contract was entered into, there
was reasonable ground for expecting thal
the 3 per cent guarantee would be sufficient
to float the bonds within a mere trifle of
par; but every hon. gentleman who has
paid attention to the progress of events
in the finaîîcial world must be aware that
since the tinie whcn those bonds were first
issued there lias been an enormnous depreciation in what is called gilt*-edged securities aIl over the world, and particularly
in England. Thie fall in 3 per cent guar.
anteed bonds is not, if my mienory serves:
me corre.ctly, niuch more than the faîl iii
consols. As regards another point, to the
best of my recollection-I arn speaking subject to correction-the governinent must be
consulted on all occasions before those debentures are sold or issued. I think they
have a kind of veto power on the time and
al1so the figure at which thev are placed
on the market. Unfortunately, the Privy
Council took a different view of the situation from our own Superior Court. Speaking as a layman, I think the common sense
of the question -as on the side of our
Supreme Court. The leg-al points, I date

Pacifie and the Privy Council. At ariy

&nd they cannot have exhausted the thirty
irillion surplus we lef t behind us, they
sliiulci take sorne action in that respect.
If the government have flot the power to
purchase the bonds, there will be ne difficulty whatever about getting legisiative
authority to do ao. The course of the English market is very peculiar. 1 remember
one *occasion whiere 1 ivas myseif concerned I found that Canadian bonds guaranteed by the British governrnent thernselves could flot be sold at anything like
the price that English consuls commanded,
simply because they were a smaller security- and flot rnuch known in the market;
and 1 know also that these guarantees are
flot favoured in the English mnarket.
I
beliei-e we could borrow money at greater
advantag-e and meet the liabilities incurred.
My hion. friend would be glad I arn sure
te see the loss to the country minimized
as far as possible. and I think it could be
done that way.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-If the
suggestion -were carried out it would be
adding twenty-five million dollars to the
debit side of the country to save only a
small per cent on the whole transaction.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I do not see that at all. We have issued.
a guarantee to pay three per cent on these
bonds. We will be none the poorer if we
pay it direct to the English holder or indirectiy througb the company.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-Are there any
more of these bonds likely to be issued?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes, there wvill
be sufficient issued by the railway coinpany to compiete the undertaking. This

Aste hion. memiber for Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) pointed out a few moments ago,
the coritract provides that the government
niiit first be consulted tvitli reference to

FEBRUARY 22, 1912
t.he sale of the bonds; but as to carrying
out the suggestion of my right hon. iriend,
as the government o! Canada is and must
necessarily be a borrower in the European
inoney market, it ail cornes down to a question of supply and demand for money,
that is to say if they retired or bought
those particular bonds of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Railway Company, guaranteed by
themselves, it would involve their securing the money from some source to take
them up, and the question is if they go
on the money market for that amounit how
much will it cost. Looking at it in a very
general way, it seems to me the bonds of
the Grand Trunk Pacific Company guaranteed by the government of Canada would
realize substantially as much-.
Rt. Hou. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-1 think rny hon. friend will find, and I
think the Finance Minister wvould admit,
that for reasons peculiar to the English
market the bonds of the Grand Trunk Pacifie, guaranteed by Canada to pay three per
cent, will not fetch anything like as good
a figure as a three per cent Canada loan.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-When this contract was entered into between the parties
in 1903, the views of the government and
also o! the railway company must have
been very optimistic, because apparently
they did count upon these three per cent
bonds realizing par. The government of
Canada in 1903 was not securing its money
for anythin~g less than three per cent. My
recollection' is that when criticisms were
being made on the Bill in 1903, in the government of Canada undertaking to charge
an interest rate of three per cent to the
Grand Trunk Pacific, the government
themselves were at the saine time paying
three and a half per cent for money. My
rigbt hon. friend will doubtless recail that.
The criticism was made in 1903, when the
governuiient o! Canada entered into a contract wvith the Grand Trunk Pacifie to
charge only a rate of three per cent as
rentai for the eastern division and also
upon the arreara8 of interest which might
arise upon both divisions that we were at
the samne time paying three and a half per
cent for money we were borrowing.

277

Hon. Mr. LOrJGHEED-It was a fraction over three per cent, and therefore it
would look as if ail parties had considered
that the Grand Trunk Pacifie could get
better ternis. However, that has not turned out to be the case.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I don't think any thiee and a haif per
cents were issued until after 1905, but that
is a matter of detail. it is. a curious, fact,
however,-and 1 just mention it for my
bon. friend's information-that while ordinary persons would say that the credit of
the Grand Trunk Railway, plus the credit
of Canada, was better than the credit of
Canada alone, in the London market it is
not so ]ooked upon. The credit o! Canada
alone without the Grand Trunk railway
,%ould fetch a bigger figure.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN--I puit the question
to the bon. leader of the government, whether he would undertake to bave the government use precaution that the same condition o! things shall fot occur again.
Under the judginent o! the Privy Council,
the Grand Trunk Pacifie, without respectîng the provisions whieh necessîtates consulting the government, can go into a
foreign or the home market and sell their
bonds at any figure, knowing that the Dominion government wil1 be responsible for
the difference. The Grand Trunk need not
care what the bonds sell for, whether forty,
ififty, seventy or eighty cents, knowing that
the Canadian peop]e will make up the difference. Now, what is to prevent capitalists from selling the bonds at from sixty
to seventy, knowing that the thirty per
cent is going to be paid by us? That would
create a serious condition of things, and
the government should provide against it.
It would only be fair to themnselves; in
fact it would be a feather in their cap if
they did. If the present statute does not
give power to do so, I would ask the leader
of the House to see that precaution
is taken, by legislation if necessary, to
protect the country in the issue o! ail new
bonds. I put that to the bon. leader of the
House. If hie carnies out such a policy
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT his party will not suifer, and the country
certainly will not.
-I think not quite so much.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Tlie suggestion
will be kept in vîew.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-Tlîe lion. member
from Hastings made a statement, no doubt
with perfect good faith, that at the time
this legisiation ivas passed in 1904 the
member from Hamilton, Mr. Barker, had
drawn tlîe attention of the governiment to
the fact that the legislation might oblige the
government to pay in cash the amount
necessary to implemient the guarantee of
the government. I have taken tlîe trouble
to refer to the debate on thiat date, which
is to be found in the Commons ' Hansard,'
page 2428, and following, and I fail to find
anything of the kind. Mr. Barker discusses
the question that it îvill be open to the govertument to discliarge that obligation ini
three several wavs; first, by paying in
cash; second, by purchasing bonds at par;
or, third, by guaranteeing- the initial
amount of bonds; and it m-as taken for
gTanted both by TMi.. Barker, aîid by the
then leader of the opposition, and by ail
the members of the House, the Minister of
Finance, and the Prime Minister of the
time, that it would be open to the government to discliarge its. obligation by guaranteeing an additional aniounit of bonds,
and therefore the grovernment at the time,
in perfect good faith, acted on the advice of counsel.
When the question came
up two or three years later, I tlîink in
1908 wlhen the ques tion wvas first raised, the
governinent had the opinion of the Minister of Justice and the Deputy Minister of
Jlustice, and of Mtr. Shepley, an eminent
counsel, and they ail reported to the government that there could be no question
àbout the matter, tlîat it was not oýpen,to
two different constructions, but that it was
open to the governiment to discharge its liability by guarantef-inzr the initial amount
of bonds. Now, in the course of events, we
have the Supreme Court of Canada maintaining unanimously the contention of the
government, but the Privy Council, in a
very short judgment deciding otherwise.
We have to abide by the decision of the
Privy Councîl as being the law~ on the
matter, and diseharge the obligation as it
is; but I make these reîîîarks to act fairly
to ail parties concerned, and put the matter
before the country in the way in whichi
lIon. Mr. CLORAN

it should be put-lot that the attention of
the government had been called to the
danger, but that ail parties concerned dealt
with the matter in hand in 1)erfect good
faith.
HIon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I
based rny reniarks on the debate in the
House of Commons when the Bill was before that body, and 1 find no contradiction
miade to the statement whicli had been
made by Mr. Barker upon that question.
There may have been other reasons than
the ones to which my lion. friend has referred. 1 ar n ot aware whiat Jegal authority was invoked at that tinie. Ail I can
say is that if lie will refer to that debate
hie will find that Mr. Germian, the member for Welland, stated that tliey consuited only common lawyers. 1 do flot know
who thecy inay be, but that is the statenient made in the House witlîout any
contradiction.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-Thie lion. mnember
fromi Hastings is quite correct. I followed
the debate in the House of Cominons on
that question, and the present leader of
the opposition seemed to have admitted
that Mr. Barker had ca!led attention at
the time to the matter, and that is the
0f
reason I looked up the debate.
course I speak subject to correction, but
the part of the debate that I examined
bears on the very clause in question, and
the report of the remarks made by Mr.
Barker is not susceptible of tlîat constructier at ail, but the other îvay, and 1 could
f.nd nowhere the attention of the governmient being called by any member to the
danger which has cropped up.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I would point
out to my lion. friend that Sir Wilfrid
Laurier made this statement:
1 know that rny honourable friend f rom
Hamiltom (Mr. Barker) did inake a statenient to that effect; but the Prjvy Couuicil
unidei'stood the clause in one sense, our own
Supreme Court and our own council understood it differently. It was a case of disagreement between iawyers, and the final
iudgment is an favour of the contention of
rni honourable friend frorn Hamilton.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-As the goverfiment considered the advisability of introducing legislation for the piurpose of construing the Act of 1903, it seems to me they

FEBRUARY 22, 1912
did flot intend to niake thernselves liable
for more than guaranteeing the bonds, and
gt!aranteeing additional issues of bonds if
that were required.
We would have
escaped the liability an the interest, because it is lioped the interest in tme ivili
be paid. But it is quite clear, in the light
of the judgment of the Privy Council, that
whilst the Grand Trank Railway Company
understood one thirig, thc country, represented by parliament, understood another.
1 can realize that as far as the bonds that
have been issued are concernied, there is
nothing elsc for us to do but pay; but in
reference to bonds that are to be issued in
the future, should not the position of parlianient as it ivas intended to be in 1903
be defined properly by leg-isiation ta be
introduced now? I arn not prepared ta say
that that should be done; at ail events it
is a matter whichi 1 thinkl the government
oughit to consider-whether the country
fins flot the riglit to say nowv what it intended to be liable for at the tume this
legisiation ivas passed. 1 do not know
whlether the subject bas received the attention of the government, if flot I respectiully submait that it should.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Th answer to the
hon, gentleman from Ottawa, that could
scarcely have been in contemplation at the
time, because legislation was passed by
parliament ia 1903 authorizing the Grand
Trunk, Pacifie to issue a second series of
bonds to the Grand Trunk Companîy.
Therefore it î%vould be impossible for
the railway comnpany to issue bonds
that wauld take priority to the Grand
Trunk railway bonds, and imxiediately follow or be on a parity with the bond issue
already mnade, gu'aranteed by this govern.
nient. So that the most that could have
been done assumning that the compaxiy had
it in contemplation ivas the issuance of a
series of bonds by the Grand Trunk Pacific
railway, subsidiary to the Grand Trunk
railway bonds, which would be a third
series of bonds. 1 need scancely point out
ta my hion. friend that that issue of bonds,
coming after the first and second issue, and
occupying the position of a third issue,
would not be as saleable as the first issueHon. Mr. BELCOURT-My lion. friend
considers that wouid be a breach of the
agreement if attempted.

279

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The language
of the Privy Council is as follows:
It would be a breacli of fajth with the
Grand Trunk Railway Conipaily ta let in any
firrther charge in priority to their security,
as it appears ta their Lord6hips the company
bas no power to issue bonds other than those
aut horized by the original contract.
So that is the reason upon which the
Privy Council proceeded, and whien one
familiarizes himself with the facts, there is
very mucli to support it.
The motion was a.greed toanmud the Bill
ivas read a second time.
HOUSE 0F COMMUONS ACT AMENDMENT BILL.
1REFUSED SECOND IEFADING.
The order of the day bein- called:
Second reading Bill (C) intituled: 'An Act
to amend the Senate and House of Common8
Act.'-Hon. Mr. Domville.
The SPEAKER-A point of order has
been raised in regard to this Bill, on the
ground that, being a nioney Bill, it cainot originate in th. Senate.
What is a money Bill?
Its best definition is to be found inm c
resolution agreed ta in August, 1857, by the
elective Legislative Council of South Australia in its famaus quarrel with the House
of Assenîbly on the*subject of money Bis,
and embodied in the compact of 1857 between those two representative bodies, and
wvhich reads as fol]ows:
III. That this council further declares
its opinion that ail Bis, the object of
which slhail be to raise nmoney, whether by
way of loan or otherwise, or to warrant
the expendit ure of any portion o! the same,
shall be held ta be inoney Bills.' (Vide
Edwin Gardon Blacmxmare's nianual of
practice, procedure and usage of the Legislative Cou-ncil of the province o! South
Australia, pages 137 and 182.)
This definition lias been accepted by al
the parlianîentary authorities on the subject.
Tcodd's ' Parliamentary Government Ïn
England,' second edition, page 815, says:

SENATE

'We will not proceed to consider the subject o! money Bis, which are o! three
kinda, viz.: tax Bills, Bills of supply, and
Bis of appropriation.
Tax Buis, for raising revenues to be applied towards the services o! the current
year, are founded upofl resolutions of the
Committee of Ways and Means.
In like maniner, Buis o! supply, or rather
of ways and means, authorizing an advance out of the consoliciated fund, or the
issue o! excliequer Bills, towards making
good supplies w-hich hiave been voted by
the House o! Commons for the service of
the year, emanate from the Committee of
Ways and Means, in the way which lias
been already described.
Wlien the Conîmittees of Supply and
Ways and Means have flnished their aittinga, a Bi'l is introduced, which enumerates every grant that lias been nmade
during the session, appropriates the several sius, as voted by the Committee o!
Supply, which s-hall be issued and applied
to each separate service, and directs that
the said supplies shahl not be used for any
other than the purpose mentioned in the
said Act. This is known as the Consolidat.
ed Fund Bill, or, more generally, as the
Appropriation Bill. By this Act, whicb
completes the financial proceedings o! the
session, the supply votes, originally passed
by the Gommons only, receive full legislative sanction.
In another work <Parliamentary Government ix' the Colonies, 2nd edition, page
709) Todd says: ' The relative righit of both
flouses in matters of aid and supp*ly must
be determined, in every British colony, by
the ascertained ruhes o! British constitutional practice. The local Acta upon the
subject must be construed in conformity
with that practice wherever the imperial
polity ia the accepted guide. A dlaim on
the part of a colonial upper chamber to the
possession of equal rights with the assembly to amend a money Bill wouild be inconsistent with the ancient and undeniable
control which is exercised by the Imperial
House of Gommons over ahl financial measures.'
At page 705 o! the saine work, we read:
The Victoria Constitution Act, 1855, sec.
56, and the British North America Act, 1867,
The SPEAKER.

' Bills for
appropriating any part of the public revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost
shall originate in the assembly or House
of Gommons.' No further definition of the
relative powers of the two Houses is ordinarily made by any statute; but constitutional practice goes much further than this.
It justifies the dlaim of the Imperial House
of Gommons (and by parity of reasoning of
ail representative chambers framed after
the model of that House) to a general control over public revenue and expenditure,
a control which lias been authoritatively
defined in the followîng words: ' XMl aids
and supplies, and aids to His Majesty in
parliainent. are the sole gift of the Coinmons to direct, lirnit and appoint in such
Bills, the ends, purposes, considerations,
conditions, limitations and qualifications
of such grants, whichi ought not to be
rhanzed or altered by the Flouse of Loris.
«This parliamentary principle, moreover,
lias been generally if flot universally, admitted in ahl self-governing British colonies
by the adoption in both legislative chamnbers o! standing orders which refer to the
rules, forma, usages, and practices of the
imperial parliament as the guide to each
flouse in cases unprovided for by local
regulations.'
' Whenever,' says Bourinot, in his ' Parliamentary Procedure,' 3rd edition, page
626, public Bills grant supplies of any kind,
or involve directly or îndirectly the levying or appropriation of any tax upon the
people, they must be initiated in the proper branch, in accordance with law and
constitutional practice. Section 53 of the
British North America Act, 1867, expressly
provides:
«Bills for appropriating any part of the
public revenue or for imposing any tax or
impost shall originate in the House of
Couinons.
And a standing order (rule 78) of the
House of Gommons declares explicitly:
'Ail aida and supplies granted to ber
Majesty by the parliament of Canada are
the sole gift of the flouse of Gommons, and
ail Bills for granting auch aids and supplies ought to begin with the House, as it
is the undoubted right of the House to direct, limit and appoint in ail such Bills

sce. 53, severally Jeclares that

A Bill granting a pension ia a Biii ' appropriating a part ai the public revenue '
it is equally «an aid granted ta Her
Majesty by the parliament' and can, in na
possible way, be amended by the Senate.
May is explicit on the subject.
«By the practice, says May, <page 574 ai
Parliament Practice,' third edition) the
Lards are excluded. not only from the
power ai initiating or amending Bis deaiing with public expenditure or -revenue,
but also fram initiating publie Bis which
-%ould create a charge upcn the people by
the impasition ai local and other rates, or
which deal with the administration or
employment ai those charges.
It flion-s nccordingly that the Lords
rnay not amend the provisions in Bis
wvhich they receive irom the Gommons
dealing with the above mentioned subjects,
so as ta alter, whether by increase or reduction, the amount ai a rate, or charge,
-its duration, mode ai assessinent, levy,
collection, appropriation or management;
or the persans who pay, receive, manage or
contrai it; or the limits within which it is
leviable. Other forma ai amendinent by
thc Lards have also been held to infinge
on the privileges ai the Gommons, such as
the addition ai a clause providing that
payments into and out ai the consalidated
iund should be made under the samne regulations as were'applicable by law ta other
similar payments; of provisions for the
payment ai salaries ta officers af the Court
af Chancery out ai the suitor's iund, and
alteration in a clause prescribing the order in which charges on the revenue af a
caiony should be paid.'
Reierring non- ta the Biil before us, let
us find out in its constructure what is the
element whicli makes it a money Bill.
The Diii reads as folaws:
BILL C.
An Aot ta axnend the Senate end Bouse of
Gommons Act.
Ris Majesty, by and with the advice and
consent ai the Senate and Blouse of Gommons
ai Canada. enacts eas ohows1. Subsection 2 ai section 35 ai the Senate
and nouse of Gommons Aet, chapter 10 af
the Revised Statutes ai Canada, is hereby

281

amended by adding theretc, at the end thereof
the foi'lowing word:-' -or in event of serions
illnesr. preventing him being present at Ottaw-a or of serions jllness necessitating hie returning to hie home, on advice of his medical
attendant.!
In adding the foiiowing words to subsection 2, section 35, of chapter 10 af the
Revised Statutes, viz.: ' Or in event ci serious illness preventing him being present
at Ottawa, or of serious jllness necessitating his returning to his home, on advice of his medicai attendant' the Bill imposes the obligation to pay over ta a member of parliament who finds himself in the
specific conditions determined by this new
piece of legisiation, a sum ai money ta
which actually hie is not entitled under the
exist.ing ian-s. The Bill consequently brings
out of the consolidated fund of Canada the
necessary money for the payment of a certain number of days of attendance at a session during which n rneinber is absent, and
for wliich absence, under the enactmnents
of the present iaw, he would not be paid.
It is then by itself a Bill appropriating the
public funds, and, at the saine time, a Bill
changing the conditions, limitations and
qualifications ai certain clauses af a previous money Bill, now the law of the land.
One muet flot also forget that the rules
ai the Senate af Canada contain the following clause 70: «The Senate will not
proceed upon a Bill apprapriating public
maney, that shall nat within the knowledge af the Senate, have been recommended by the King's representative.'
This sinigle rule ai ours wauld suffice ta
put a stop ta any further procedure on
Bili (C), but, considering the gravity ai
the question, as ta the stand which suggests itseli ta the Senate an maney Bis,
I thought it would be convenient for this
House ta be acquainted with the sources
from wvhich the opinions ai the authorîties
on the subject are ta be collected, and I
have seized this opportunity ta lay the
whole question before the Senate.
Taking inta consideration the nature of
this Bill which appropriates public funds
in a mnanner different irom the one determined by the existing iaw, and taking also
into consideration the well known doctrine

rules ai this Hanse, and by the accepted

that a member should. fot be absent for
fifteen days, or any number o! days, would
hie be in order? This Bill refera to a fund
which ia already appropriated and votel
by both Houses of parliament.
Mr. SPEAKER-My answer covers that
ground. The fund must be paid. in the way
the iaw prescribes. This is to amend the
law and make a larger payment.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Has the Senate the
rig-ht to make its own regulations in regard
to attendance?
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Not against the iaw
of the land.
Hon. Mr. POWELI-After hearing the
very full, satisfactory and I think aiso

Speaker, I think it is the duty o! the hon.
gentleman in charge o! the Bill to move
that the order of the day be dîscharged.

SECOND READING.
Hon. Mr. DE VEBER nioved the second
reading of Bill (X ) An Act to incorporate
the Canadian Pubhic Health Association.
Hie said: I think this Bill will meet wîth
the full approbation of the House. The
object is the development and diffusion of
the knowledge o! sanitation and ail other
matters connected therewith, or pertaining thereto. This association is the outcorne of legisiation of this House. You
can remember some three years ago certain
miatters were referred by this House to
the Conservation Commission aaking them
to take some action. They took, action
and called together representatives from all
the provinces, and at that meeting this association was practically formed. The association contains in its rnembership gentlemen in ail waiks of life, united together
with the one airo, the conservation of wvhat
shouid be cons-idered in every country its
greatest asset, namely the public health.
The list is headed by the Governor General. Its honorary officers include Lord
Strathcona, the Premier, ex-Premier, and
the Premiers o! every province of Canada.
The executive takes in ail the health officers of the different provinces and anybody who reada the naines on the application liat wvill see, as I have stated, that it
contains people of ail degrees and walks in
liee in every part o! Canada.

Hon. Mr. WATSON-I suppose that is
the moat effective way to retreat, and I

There are five directors. To enable the

there must be at least three directors on

the statute contains a provision that they.

a very meagre provision. These capitalists
can rig the market and have the bonds sold

that the people of Canada will flot like to

(In Cornmittee.)
Hon. Mr. POWER-Although my notice
of amendment stands on the notice paper
after that given by the hon. gentleman
from Toronto, inasinuch as it affects the
earlier part of the Bill, I hope the committee will net object te taking it up niow. If
niy (hon. friand frein Toronto hais ne objetion I move to amend this Bill is follow6:
Line 14-Before 'qualifled ' insert 'other'
Line 15-After « nt ' strike out ' and
report to the cormissioners upon ';and
Line 22-After ' inquiry ' insert 'and
such persons shall report the evidence and
their finding-s (if any> thereon bo the coinmissioners '
If the conmittee Nvi1l hear wibh me f r
a minute, I shall explain why these amend1ments arc proposcd. Take Uine 14 of the
Bill: it reads ' Enzineers, technical advisers or otiier experts, or any qualified
persen. Nov: the word ' other ' is inserted so as to provide that the qualifled persons shall be persons of soîne standing of
the same class, as accountants, engineers,
or other experts. And further, if we did not
put in the word ' other ' there, when you
corne down to ' such persons 'in line 17, il
might be held that the powVj to do the
things, which power is given to them to
do, could be done only by the persons, not
by the accountants, engineers, technical
officers, &c. In order to remove any doubt
I propose to put in the wvord ' other ' hefore ' person ' and to make the other
changes. Now in line 1.5, &fter 'miei', etrike
out ' and report to the commissioners appeinted. Thýe reason for striking out these
words is that they aie brought in more
properly at the end of the clause. Then at
the end, after ' inquiry ' insert ' and euch
persons shall report the evidence, and their
findings, if any, thereon to the commissioner .' The object of this one, I have no
doubt, wvill commend itself to the House
generally; because, where an accountant,
or engineer, or bechuical adviser, is selected by the commissioners te ta.ke evidence, it
is very desirable and necessary that the
evidence should ha preserved, and that the
parties interested, and the public should
have an opporbunity of seeing upon what
evidence these inferier officers have proceeded.
I think that inust strilze ever v

one as being a desirable thing, and therefore this amendment Proposes that the subcommissioners, if one may cali themn se
shall report the evidence, and their findingýs, if any, to the commission; obherwise
we might have reports made as to the Propriety of which, we should neyer be in a
position to judge.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-There is no objection to, it so long as it goes in properly.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. KERR-I desire to qualhify the
amendment of which I have given notice,
and 10 make it read as follows:
Every commissioner appointed under part
Il of thîs Act, and every person engaged as
acceuntant, engineer, technical -adviser or
other expert under the provisions of this
Act, shall be incapable of being appointed to
o- holding any office, place or employmient in
the nomination, gif t or control of the Crown
or of the Governor General of Canada until
if-et the expiration of twe years after the
report of such commissioner shall have been
made.
I hope with that qualification and alteration the hon. gentleman will be able te
see his way to, accept the amendment.
At the timne I gave the notice of the
amendment, my hon. friend, on behaif of
the government, was not willing to accept
it, and suggested that the Bill would be
withdrawn if my amendment were adopbed.
I have no desire to embarrass the g-overnment in the matter, or to attempt to impose upon the statute an unreasonable or
uinsatisfactory provision. It appeared te
me that sû far from. this beinz objectionable te the government, they would have
emibraced the opporbunity to accept it, because it would have relieved themn fromn a
good deal of responsibility with reference
te the persons who might becomne appointees of persons who are net their nominees,
but are appointees of the comimissioners
appointed by the government, in other
words the sub-commiesioners, if one may
use that name, although they are clothed
with the same full authority that is given
te the commissioner& -While the comkmissioners may find it convenient te delegabe
their powers to what we may call the suhcermL-,eimers, âor the purpose of describine them,-to experts in various lines,-hut
who will ha clothed with authority, it did

FEBRUARY 27, 1912
seem to me that it would bc a relief to the
g-overn'ment, il, in appointing thesn, they
were appointed, not from political exigency, flot because of some party service
they may have rendered the government for
some empioyment, but that the commissioners vould apDoint themn by reason of
some special qualification which these per,
sons would have for the purpoze of investig-iting more thoroughly andi eoipletely th3
particulars than the commissioners themselves could do. In otherwords, supposing
the comrnissioner vrere a professional nxanX
appointed by the government, lie might
have no knowledrc or intimacy with the
keeping of accDunts, andl it inight put hlm
in such an emibarrassing position that he
would be unablc to appreciate, or o-rasp, the
special dealing-vith
this particular account
of which it was importint that lie 'should
have somE know]edce, and, therefore, he
would delezato the sarne to a stib-coiynissiorier for invecstigation, or it mnight be to
an engineer, if it became a question -%vhere
special engineering skîll -%vas necessary.
Now, neither one of the three commissioners appointed to do that work rnight be
able to grapple wit h the difficulty, and it
appeared to me it would relieve the government very much if these people selected
as sub-commissioners were persons who
were flot looking for or pressing upon the
government dlaims by way of reward beyond the compensation paid to then lor
the work. It would erntirely relieve the
government of responsibility which might
be imposed upon them by the commissioners who were appointed by them-and for
wbose wvork, in fact, the governinent must
assume the responsibility-if these subcomimisioners are to be selected by the. commissioners from amongst a group of applicants for govern.ment situations. If there
is one thing more prominent than another
in the British mind-and I incan by that
to include the Canadian inind-it is the
desire to see fairplay and just treatment
meted out to everybody. I think it is the
duty of the government to see that nothing
is done wvhich miay, in fact, be foui play
instead of fair-play, or which nuty be unjust, and which xnay be done by persons
because of over-zea] or a desire to gratify

their own anirnosity. Under those circumstances, it appears to me thiat, on consideration, the government will find that if thcy
are relieved from responsibilitv in respect to
the suh-commissioners, they wvîll be in a
better position.
The sub-commissioners
ought to be people who ivili understand
they are not working for another man's
office, that they are flot endeavouring to
create a vacancy in order that they might
themselves be appointed. They are not appointees of the governrnent, but the
appointees of the commissioners.
If they are known to be pressing dlaims
or seeking positions, or looking for public
appointrnent, or pressing- upon the party,
or public, that they should receive patronage in some way, and are appointed, the
public wvill at once view~ that inquiry .Nithi
alarni, and say, 'This is not B3ritish justice.
and the ministers oughit not to countenance
such a thinz'; but 'with this amcendment the
answ-er will be. 'These men are disiiiterested applicants, but by virtue of their
acceptance *of this position they become disqualified for appointment to another position. I arn not going- to take the responsibility as to what shall be done in this
matter. The responsihility is with the government.
They corne here and say, 'We
want amendments to the Inciuiry Act. We
desire to be in a position to prosecute this
matter to the hilt, and therefore we want
the power to appoint experts, and ever «v
assistance to the comimissioners, and clothe
them with ail the authority of commissioners-not that we appoint them, but we wil
enable our cornmissioners to appoint them.
and give them the same powers.' It will
relieve them very much if thev say when
these men are employed. 'At the same time
you understand that by accepting this Position vou are doing it with a disqualification for future appointiment for a termn o!
two yeara.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Columbia)-Does the hon, gentleman stick to the
five years?
Hon. Mr. KERR-That may be too long
a term. I have proposed to shorten it, and
provide that they shahl not be eligible for

iii tis inatter was the course w'hich was
takien by my friend Mr. Huntingdon in
respect to Sir John Macdonald inany years
ago, which vas taken by Mr. Tarte in respect to Sir Hector Langevin, and that
wvas taken by inyself with respect to Mr.
J1. C. Rykert, and in that, I think, I was
supported by îny hon. friend from Hastings
<Hon. Sir Mackenzie Bowell). If my hon.
frîend desires to impeach, the better way is
flot to send out a fishing- commission, wlîich
somie of these comimissic>ners appear to be;
the proper wziy is to impeach directly in
open court. If tlîey cannot face parlianment with a sufficient amount of evidence,
or face the courts, I do not think they ought
to set to work 10 manufacture evidence. I
trust that niy hion. friend, on consideration,
ivili see hiS way 1.0 accept the anîcnidinnt
offered by my lion. friend from Toironto.
Hu ou 21t to see for himself
that it is ini the int4ereLst of the governinent, Ithat the mien th5at the-y appoint should be mien wioare above suspicion. Otherwise the reports that they
may bring forward ivili be of ne particular value. Unless lie appoints men such
as I have indîcated, either judges or nien
approved by both Houses of parliament, he
cannot expect that their reports ivili be received with any degree of respect or favour,
even by his own supporters in the country.
It appears to me that the lion, gentlemen
arm doing a thing %rhich,
-parhaps, they hiad
not fully %veighed, and wlîich is likely to
lead to very great injury to the state.
They have appointed some fifty conmmissioîîers at an average of $20 a day. $15 sal.
ary end $5 living alloivance. Tliese men,
in ail human probability, will not give up
so good a job in a hurry. I noticed that
in the post office alone some nineteen of
these gentlenmen are to be appointed. For
what purpose? To investigate aIl charges
that have been made against little petty
country postmasters lîaving an annual ineurnie of thirty or forty dollars -a veair. WlIiy,
these nineteen men, in the course of a
single week, îvould wvaste, taking inito account the probable cost o! the wit.nesses
they will examine, twice as nîuch as the
total income of the parties on wlîom they
are sitting in judgment. That is only
one specinien of the various matters which
the lion. gentle'man lias brought down in

the return that I have jusi spoken of, judgin." froma what I see of the 1parties wlio have
been appointed commissioners. The hon.
gentleman may perhaps do well to reniember that the Senate is a cc-ordinabe
branch of the legislature; that this Senate hias powers quite equal to those of the
other chamber except in money mabters,
and if these gentlemen proceed, as I fear
they will proceed, under the circumstances, it may become the duty of the Senate
to iîîvestîgate the investigators. and to give
them the sensation of being hunted as well
as being hunters. I hope At will not come
bo that; but I give a fair notice bo mny lion.
friend that the Senate will certainvy feel
it it's duty to keep a careful eye on the
fifty gentlemen whom his colleagaues have
chosen to appoint on these several commissionsz. As for myself, as nîy hion. friend
bas said, the governnment have power to
do very neariv as inuch under th(e olU Act
as they bav-e under the present Bill. and
therefore, if the goveraiiant r.efuse, to Gecept the amendmeat, I see îîothing- for il
but to allow the Bill to go th-rough.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Do I understand
my hion. iriend is going to insist upon his
motion? 0f course we are in the hands of
the- House; but under no consideration
would the government accept an am-endment of this character, to, cut down the present Act, a law that has been on the statube for several years. It would only resuIt, I xnight say to my lion. friend, in
placing the Senate in a riitber hiniliating
position, for this reason: I have no doubt
that if the malter wvere put to a division at
the present tinie, the Senate nîiglit possibly
aînend this Bill iii accordance %vith the
views expres.ýed by the lion, gentlemian

It seems to me that we are tying up the
trade of this country to a very great extent by the constant renewal of patents,
whcre people lhave neglected to commence
the manufacture under them. Tihe moment
they fail to comply wvith the provisions
of the làw as to manufacture, the article
should be open freely to the whole market.
There should be good reasons shown -why
such measures should be introduced in
this House, wvhere parties have treated the
law with contempt, tili they found it to
their advantag-e to obtain an extension.

SECOND

READING.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of Bill (No. 105) An Act to amend
the Post Officf' Act. He said: This Bill
proposes a slight departure fromu the present law, so far as the exercise of the Civil
%Service Comîmi ssion is cocncerned.
Tli e
Civil Service Commission is somewhat inflexible as to the appointaient of mail
clerlis. and it is utteri.v impJossible for the
Post Office Department to secure that clazs
of employees necessary to do the cheaper
clasa of work, because provision is omi.
made for the employmeut of temporary
mail clerks at $500 a year. At the present
time, the Postmaster General hias been
compelled to employ several men as labourers, where it is now proposed that power
should be given to the Postmaster Generai
to temporarily appoint railway imi civ
paying them the limited salary mentioned
in file Bill, wvit-h a viev 'to their afterw-asds
passing a preliminary examination, ali
then subsequeut to that a qualifyi.g examination, and in that way rendering
somewhat more flexible the examinations
required by the Civil Service Act.

Hon. Mr. WATSON-I arn in entire sympathy with the lion. gentleman's remarks
as to not protecting the patentee if he does
not manufacture. I have no brief in connection with this Bill; ýbut on looking over
it I observe thiat it is more in connection
with the titie of the Bill than the patent.
I think the provision in the last clause to
which the hon. zenitleman from Belleville
(Honi. Sir Mackenzie Bowell) takes exception is ail right, because it provides that
any person who lias started manufacture
after the expiry of the patent shail have
the right to proceed, but any person who
attempted to manufacture before the expiry of the patent shall not have that right.
It seems to me that is perfectly clear. A
reference was made to another Bill which
stood in my name. As far as that Bill is
concerned, the people who are manufacturing are simply applying for an extension of the patent Tfley have been mnanuThe motion wvas agreed to, and the Bill

RATES ON THE INTERCOI.LNIAl,
RAILWAY.
MOTION.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN moved:
That in -the opinion of this House the rates
on the Intercolonial railway ehould, like those
of other railways, be subjeot to the contrai
of the Railway Board.
He said: This motion may carry us back
to the time whon the Railwray Comanission.
wvas establishesi, eight years ago, and if
there is one thing for which the former
Lgoverriment should be commended, it is for
creating- that board, which has certainly
given general satisfaction throughout the
leng-th and breadth of the land. There la
no dou-ibt the work of the Comnnission h.as
been well done. The public has been satisfied, and although the great railway coinpallies had very strong apprehiensions at
first, and regarded wlth a jealous eye the
fact that their operations would be iunder
the contrai of mnen altogether outside of
their own authority, they recognize to-day
that the Railway Commission is doing- gooJ
work, and that its jurisdiction shoulidetend througahout the whole o! Canada, and
should include ail the railways iii tHe Doniiniion. The late government shoufld bo coinmiended an account of the very good men
%rho have been appainted. The flrst appointee, the father of the Railway Board,
Hon. A. G. Blair, ivas certainly a maii of
marked ability, and was recognized as an
authority on railway matters. He was
-succeeded by onj o! no less ability. the

late Judge Killamn, who was really the genitleman who put the system into operation.
It may be within the recollection of lion.
centlemen of this House that the Hon. Mr.
Blair vma. not othairmaan of the Comnimnision
very long, and Judge Killam, whio followed
him, managed, wîth inifinite tact, to conciliate the various interests and to bring
the Railway Board into such working order
as to give satisfaction to the public generally. Wheni Judge KliIlam was removed
by death, hie was succeeded by Judge Ma'oee, who is a1so doing remarkably good

iii eng.ineeriliz, but ail other departmrenits.
The engineering departnient lias nothing to do with the rates: the phiyskýal
condition oi the road lias been carefully
looked after. The chie! engineer of the
Railway Board, Mr. G. A. 'Mountain, is a
irery capable engineer, a practical marn,
and all the reports which he hias made to
the board, as far as 1 kîîow, have flot anly
been approved of by the board, but also
have been found just and equitable to the
varions conipanies. Lt is a very imnportant matter to decide, the final location
of railways, the crossing of one railway by
another, the crossing of highways. and so
on. All this hias been decided by the engfineeriag staff o! the Railway Board. However, that doesc nat appertain ta the subject
we are dealing with ta-day. What we are
after now is to sea whether it wvould flot

the Railway Board bas given satisfaction

and only one man in that district manufactiuring éhimgles, tbey say, ' any onie else
mnaking shingles at that place can obtain
the same rates.' But the fact remains that
there is only one person at that place enjoying the special rate. This is a question
of very great importance, not only to the
-,overnment and thîe rai'lway management,
but also the public generally, axid if tlîis
House would take into consideration the
advisability of placing these rates under
the control of the Railwvay Board, by voting
ýn favour of thi motion, it would not only
do justice to itself, but render a public
service to this country.
Hon. Mr. DOIMVILLE-I have heard the
reiarks of niy hon. friend, and really I do
not understand w-bat he is driving at. We
in Newv Brunswvick and Nova Scotia are not
kicking about what the railways are doing
in Ontario; they are kicking- about what
%%-e doing-. I arn willing to ag-ree with
are
him that a very large question could be
opened up. There is nothing personal or
political in this for or againat either government. The only trouble with the Intercolonial railway is that there are gentlemen managing it wvho think they oîvn the
railway, and can do uvbat tbey like with
it. That is the whole point. I do not
know wlîether we can remedy that by putting the road under the Railway Commis.'îon; we niigbt or might flot. I will give,
in illustration, my own experience. I live
on that line o! railway, and they- charge
nie $2 a cord to haul wood thirty miles,
and I have absolutely no redress. There
are men on thiat mnanagemient wvhom I respect very higbly, and I think- they are
-loin.- tlîeir duty, or trying to, but there
are others wbo think they own the whole
ron)d, and from such men one can have no
redresa. In îny absence, tlîrough illuess,
1 asked a friend to put a question about
thie ea.rnings cf the rail.way at Rotihesay,
quite a considerable place. Tbey throw our
mail bag-s off the train into the snow. The
other day one wvas cut open, the letters
were scattered, and we are getting tbem
l)iecemeal-damaged and wet. WVe are not
-- ing to blame the Conservative government
o
ior that. I do not %ý-ant to quarrel with

313

them; there is no object in it just now; we
must give them fair play. The point is that
the g«overnment must bring to task those
nien who hold up everybody down there.
If you appeal to the Postmaster General,
or to the local postmaster, they secin to
be afraid of the Intercolonial, and
the Intercolonial
officer
says:
1I
arn boss here. I willV do what I like.'
That man was probably appointed bo office
by political influence and thinks he can
do just what he pleases, but that is not the
fault of the government or the commission;
it is the fault of the autocrat who thinks
lie owns the railway. That road has been
siniply a football for politicians for the
last thirty years; no one government lias
been responsible for that. As to the ques-tion of thrugh freight rates, railvay men
must determine thern. As to what my hon.
friend has saici about furthering trade and
benefiting the commierce of the country,
Ontario gets the benefit of it. We need.
the flour fromn Ontario and have bo take it
and pay the price- no matter what the
freight rate is; bût parliarnent is not going
bo say arbitrarily that the railways must
take empty cars back at the same rate.
My lien. .friend (Mr. Oasgrain) bar. maide
a ve-ry eiaboiate speeohi-I did not hear al
of it---but I lagre-e with him that it is*
neoessary to call the attention of the government to the 2dvispabidiity of looking ia1to
the manbagemnent of the Intercolonia1 railway. 1 arn not coin., to say whetiier it
shou.ld go uinder tdie Board of Railway
Comiissioners or not. The government
should neytify the present management of
the rairlway thaît they do not own the couitry. T.'hey will not stop their trains at
Rothesay. I asked Mr. Brady why, and lie
infornied m-e that i. was too -unimportant
a station. Mr. B'n9dy-'lias his private car
and tak-es Iiis chil'drcn and 'lus cook to

of the remarks of the hon, gentleman frorn
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power) and Rothesay

have the rates raised on traffic frorn east

that the provinces of Quebee and Ontario

ation, 1 would just like to quote the position tak-en by the leaders of the governmient in both Houses. WVhen the leader
of the lest government brought up the
Naval Bill, the leader of the present governnient said, sud tru]y said, that the governiment 'had ne authority to pass that
Bill. In reading over the amendnient moved
in the other House by .the present Prime
Minister I find that it is as fellows:

adopted, and such a measure should net
be passed without consulting the people,
net by a plebiscite, but at the general election. It was my intention te move
suchi an amendment, but the then leader
of the opposition epened fire and said, in a
long and clever speech, that te his mind
this meâsure was ene of the most important introduced into parliament since confederation. He said:

That the said proposais while neesaitating
heavy outlay for construction and maintenance will give noe immediate, or effective
aid te the empire, a.nd ne adequate or satisféotory resuits to Canada.
.That no permanent policy should be entered
upon inrelving a large future expenditure of
this characéer until i-t has been submaitted to
the people and bas received their approval.

It involves Canada stepping out fromi its
local statue and eatering the liste of naval
powers, assuming enormous expenditure and
national obligations snob. as two years ego,

That was part of the axnendment to the
Bill iioved by the( present leader of the
House.

He continued:
I presaume we may attribute the genesis of
thiis Bill te German scare.

No navy, no dreadnoughts. No contribution. Nothiug unless the people of the

popular cry found an echo in this Chamber.

speeches of the hion. members wvere cîted,
and published and praised lu ail the Conservative and Natioi papers of the counitry, and thev were proclainmed the only
independent Liberal nieinbers of the Senate. Their speeches were used in the Èlection, and it ivas repeated everywhere that
the firat move which would be made, as
soon as the House of Gommons met, would
bc to asic for the repeal of tbe Naval law.
It was said that Mr. Bourassa -wou]d have
only to raise bis hand, and the Canadian
navy would vanish in one year. The election took place, and the government were
defeated. The House of Gommons met;
cne monthi elapsed; tvo months elapsed;
three months elapsed, and nothing hias
been done. Nothiug to abrogate that infernal, infamous law 'as it was called in
the province of Qucbec. In about three
inonths a resolution wvas moved in the
other Chamber, but it ivas moved whien it
was too ]ate to be tiken int conusideration
during this session of parliameut. It was
a resolution whî,Iich mer ut nothing at ail.
The onily way for the Natîonalist party or
the Gonsprvative party to shQà%, their sinicerity and to give practical effeet to their
resolution, was to do exactly what the hion.

cord witli thoso who were talking of the
rneans necessary in order to switch the
question, they decided to move, as the hion.
member for Grandville lias doue, for the
repeal of the law. They naturally had reason to believe that they had the support
of the governmemnt. They most naturally
thought the government of the day, who
had profited by the action whi-ch had been
taken and by the speeches wvhiclh had been
made, and by the agitation whîch w-as the
resuit of the position taken by the hion.
members of the Senate, would naturally
do their duty towards them, and recognize what they had done for Vhem,
and show their gratitude by taking advantage of this motion made by the hion. mem*

of the law. After the speech made by the

made by the hon. meuibers of this Huse,
hie lias a right to beliexe that the hion.
leader of the Senate, and bis friends, the
members of.the Con!!ervative or Nationalist
party will vote to repeal the law. I do
not see how they can do otherwise, in
order to justifY the declarations and promises which wvere made to the electors of
the country, and especially to the electors
of the province of Quebec. I do not see
how the leader of this House and bis
friends can refuse to take advantage of the

XVe must net be surprised if hoe fails te

the governiiient have none. The French
niembers of Quebec have strangied your

Mr. LOUGHEED-Mv lion. fricxid
Hon.
fromn Grandville has introduced a Bill intitled an Act to repeal the Naval Service
Act, and which reads as follows: ' Chap.
43 of the Statutes of 1910, entitled an Act
respecting the Naval Service of Canada is
There hereby repealed.' He now moves the se-

FEBRUARY 28, 1912
cond reading of the Bill to repeal the Act
passed in May, 1910. At that session the
late government broug.ht down to parliament a policy for the organization of a
separate navy.
The attitude of the then
Oonservative opposition was, that, if Canada committed itself to a naval programme,
it should be along lines of approximately
united action with and the centre of controti in tJluý inîipirial navy. The view of
the government of tbat day prevailed, and
in pursuance thereof they brought down
such a Bill, and the present Naval Service
Act was passed. It's scope is very wide,
and with the indulgence of the House, inasmuch as my lion. friend bas moved for
the repeal of that Act, I should like to intuîîatc to this Chainher its comprehiensive
character.
The Act provides for the organization of the Department of the Naval
Service, which department is entrusted with
the administration of the following- services, Naval branch, Fisheries Protection,
Wireless Telegrapli, Hydrographie Survey,
and Tidal Service. A department bas been
organized under this Act and is now administering these various branches. As hon.
gentlemen whcj have looked into the Act,
will know, it makes provision for a new
branch of the public service, for a department complete in every respect, and coinprehensive to the extent which I have mentioned.
The Naval Service branch itself comprises
the maintaining of two ships, the ' Niobe '
and the 'Rainbow,' bouglit froin the iniperial governmcnt and used chieiiy
as
training ships.
The dockyards at Halifax and Esquiimaît, Nvere trs.nsferred from
the imperial governmient to the Dominion
government on condition that they should
be he]d for naval purposes, and maintained in an efficient condition. Under the
Naval Service Act, these dockyards are
maintained and adrninistered by the De.partment of the Naval Service. There are
in the employ o! the government iii these
dockyards at Halifax, 182 persons, and at
E~quînaî
ei.Jîepn
It lias also enlisted a certain number of men and boys for
the naval service, and these recruits are being trained on the two ships, which 1 have
already mentioned.
A naval college has
also, been started at Halifax for the education of cadets who propose to becoîne officers in the Canadian navy.
22ý

Then there is the fishery protection fleet
branch of the service, i«hich comprises
eight vessels and 180 men.
The vessels
are occupied in protecting the off-shore fisheries of Canada.
Then there is the hydrograiphic survey,
which has seven vessels in commission surveying the coast of Canada. The crew emnployed on these vessels number 186, and
the survey staff comprises sixteen.
The wireless branch operates the government wireless station along the coast at
British Columbia, the operation o! the government owned stations between Montreal
and the ses, which are operated under contract by the Marconi company.
Then there is the tidal service, whichi issues tlic tidal prediction and tide tables for
the Canadian ports. That service bas oee
vessel with a crew of thirty-one and some
fourteen observers, and a technical staff of
six. A sunimary of the employees of the
naval service at the present tintýe is ais
foilows: Naval service, 967; fishery protection service, 178; hydrographic survey,
202; wireless, 30; tidal service, 50. Clerical
staff at Ottawa, 41; a total of 1,462. The repeal of the Naval Service Act, without its
being replaced by some other Act, would
mean that ail these services would be suspended, and would create chaos among the
tiien who have been employed. So much
for a short survev of the service rendered
bw this particular department. In October
1911 the present government came into office.
Upon coming into office they found this
branch of the public service, which had
recently been org-anized, in full operation
te the extent, whicli 1 have mentioned.
Tlîey, therefore, came into office with an
ixherited obligation-. Now, I need flot say
to hon, gentlemen that although the prescrit
geverfiment came inte office in 1911, yet we
recogcnize, under our governmental I)elicy
that different gevernments are not in reality diflerent entities; the King's government
always goes on, it is a continuous organization. Because one group, representing a
political party, may succeed a group reprcsenting another political party, it does
not necessarilv follow that the public service of the country must become disiocated by reason of any difference of opinion
in these two groups. There are responsibi-

SENATE

lities to be borne, there are obligations to
be met, there are public duties to be discharged, and it becomes the duty of one
group succeeding another group, though of
different political complexion, to perform
these public duties, and to discharge the
public obligations to the same extent
as if thuat change had not taken place,
this, of course, consistent with the
adoption of a policy which will not
create disruption of public affairs, and
which would not create a paralysis, so
to speak, of the body politic. My hon.
friend from Grandville surely would not
suppose that immediately the present government took office in October, 1911, and
met parliament a few weeks after, they at
one fell swoop, notwithstanding the opinions which they may have had upon the
navy, and the divergence of opinion which
they expressed as to the policy of the
late government, should imrnediately have
broughît down a Bill wipinîg out without any
provision this very important branch of the
public service, and thus dislocating the
public business which necessarily appertains to this branch of government.
As indicative of the opinions which the
preserit government enter tain as to this
particular policy, they did see their way
elear, without in any way interfering with
the public service, without in any way repudi'ating obligations which had been
properly assumed, to cancel -a proposed contract for the construction of six vessels
which would have approximately cost, if
completed, in the vicinity of twenty millions of dollars. If my hon. friend should
ask for evidence of good faith as to the
present governiment
carrying out the
opinions of their party expressed whuile in
opposition, I might point to that particular act of the present government as indicating that action dealing wth this subject will be taken and full responsibility
assumed by the governiment for whatever
that action may be. There have been obliga.
tions entered into hy the governanent of
Oanada witi reference to this navy. Very
great responsibilities have been assuied,
and this government recognizes, quite as
fully as the late governmeint, that the credit
of Canada hias to be maintained notwithstanding
cthe
divergence in views w¶hich
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED.

may be entertained respecting this great
public question. My hon. friend has referred to the necessity of something being
done at once. He has rebuked the government for not at an early date bringing
down a Bill to repeal this Act. He has referred to the enormous cost whici the
building and the operating of this navy
wilil involve. My hon. friend has fixed it
at a sum, I think, approximating a hundred millions of dollars. If that be the case,
then the greater necessity exists for deliberate and wise action being tali
by the
governiment of the day as to the policy
which they will pursue in revising ow reforrming the policy to which the late govermnent commnitted the country. The more
important this question appears, the more
important it is that the most deliberate
action should be taken upon it. Permit me
to say, with -all due respect to my hon.
friend, that the government of the day
would be recreant to its duty, would be
recreant to the responsibility which rests
upon its shoulders, if it were to stand idly
by and permit a private member to assume
the responsibility of introducing and of
carrying through parliainent a Bill repealing and abolishing an important branh of
the public service such as I have mentioned.
Some hon. MEMBERS-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That view of the
case must have already presented itself to
my hon. friend. Under no consideration
could the gôvemnment relieve itself of the
responsibility which attaches to il.
At
least, if that were done, my hon. friend
must realize full well that it would lead
to chaos and confusion. It would lead tO
a repudiation of ail the oblagations and
responsibilities upon which the goveunient
of Canada has entered. The intention of
the govermnent is to give, during the approac'hing recess, full consideration to
these questions. It vidi probably consult
with the admiralty authorities in Great
Britain as to how this branch of the public service can be made cf most value, not
andly to Canada but to the empire; and
adter due deliberation, I have no doubt
that efore the nex-t session of parliament
the government will in the meantime have
been able to give their very best considera-

of the British admiralty.
My hion. friend
says that the government will probably
consult the admiralty -as to the policy of
be followed, as expressed by hima in his
opening remarks, which is to work in dloser
union with the mother country in the defence of Canada and o! the empire. I anm
surprised to hear my hion. friend state that
the admiralty will be consulted to that end,
because the admiralty has already been
consulted, flot very long ago-just two years
ago, and lias in no uncertain sound declared its desires. I have heard iV sta.ted,
und 1 have rend in the Nationa]ist organ
in Montreal, that since 1896 the Britishi
authorities liad noV expressed any decided
opinion as Vo what the Dominions beyond
the seas should do for the defence of the
tnpire, and as Vo the role that those dominions ehou.ld.play. It seenms to me that the
mnemorandum o! the admiraltv, whicli wns
the basis upon which the whole discussion
took place at the naval conferenace of lOOti,
is quite clear and precise as to the wishes
o! the Britishi admiralty. We find in that
miemorandum that on Mardi 18, 1909, statements were made as Vo the growving
strength of foreign nations, by the Prime
Minister of Great BnVtain, and the* First
Lord of the admiralty, on the introduction
of the navy estimate for 1909-10; that followving the statemenf of the Prime Miniister and the First Lord o! the admiralty,
the dominions beyond the seas thought it
their duty Vo answer the cali. The memiorandumn proceeds to state what the domiiniions Vhought fit Vo do in answer Vo the
statement made by the British ministers,
and proceed Vo state what the admiralty
thought desirable in the intérest of the emipire as a whole. The first proposition laid
down by tie admiralty vws the following:

H1on. Mr. DANDURAND-The hion. gen.
tleman has stated that the opposition, dur.
ing the last parliament, propounded a
policy which tended to have Canada, in
the matter of naval defence, work, in dloser
co-operation with the mother country. He
has noV gîven any specifie resolution or
statement upon which to base that affirmation. We know that the policy of the
then leader of the opposition wvas to offer
some dreadnoughts to the adsniralty, and
to consult the people -o! Canada upon the
policy of building a Canadian navy. The
latter part of the policy expressed by the
then leader o! the opposition was in absolute contradiction of the resolution of
Mardi 29, 1909, which was unanimously
adopted by the House.. The lion. gentleman has flot stated in what particular the
naval policy of the laVe govemnment i-s
Vo be modified by the present governmnent;
but wve ail know that the principal attack
of the opposition. led by the now premier,
was urged against clause 23 of the Act,
which reads as follows:

\Vlien was that?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-This was at the
Naval Conference cf 1909, in which ail the
dominions beyond the seas i-ere represented. This resolution of the 29th oi March,
1909, excluding- the contribution wvhich w-as
being asked or suggested in the memnorandunu whiclh I have just cited, the admiralty proceedeil ta make the alternative proposition as foilows:
Wlhile onl nav ai strategical consideratioiis,
it was thouiglt that a fleet unit on the
Pacifie, as ontlinied hY the Admniraity, mîight
iii future form 'an acceptable systemi of nav-al

dcfence, it wazý recognized that Canada's daouhie seaboard rendered the provision of sucbi
aq fleet unit uisuitable for the present.
Sa that we have here the second alternative proposition of the admiraity, which
was that Canada should maintain a ccrnpiete fleet unit on the Pacifie. This, being
objected to In- Canada. tlic- :dmiiralt v then,
recog-nizing. that we had those tw'o seaboards ta defend, and recog-nizing mloreover that we could onîy enter int a certain expenditure, suggested that certain
ships be huilt and maintained on the PaciThe adjniraltv
fie and on the Atlantic.
suggested the building- of ships, accordin'g
ta the anîcunt that Canada was readv ta
,,pend for the begininiiig of aur naval' defence. We have, in the papers which wereý

Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND

Eniglaind, thic poiey suggest-ed by the admiralty. Lt is openl t.o tuie present government, as it was open to the preceding one,
to kniow exactly the wishes of the admiralty. They are contained in the report 1
have just cited. The late governmelit
thought that Canada should begin the defence of its own coast and ports by the
building of its own navy in its own shipyards. Lt wvas a desire shared ini by the
opposition on the 29th of Marcli, 1909, and
it is the policy which was accepted by hoth
branches of parliament ia 1910. 1 find
that my hion. friend stili declares that the
present government wiil stand by the policv that it propounded in opposition, and
wvill consuit the adiniraity as to the best
Ilitinls of dlevelopingi. the Canadianl defence
and helping the British Empire. This is
perhiaps the third opinion w'hich wvas expressed by the theil leader of the opposition. I see-and my hion. friend may correct me if I ana wrong-that the adrniralty
may probabiy be consulted according, ta
its own stateinent, and probabiy ajot, but
lie lias failed ta te'll us if, after the adnuiralty is consulted, the people wili be consulted by referendum ? I should like, to
ask him now if the government which hie
represents s0 ably in this House intexîds
ta lay before the people the proposition
which the governiment may draft for a submission ta the people of Canada by a referendum or plebiscite. aiter having conI suppose
suted or not the adiniraltv?
that my hon. friend has no opinion to give
Iust now upon this question.
Hon. Mr. LOUGI-EED-As I have cýaid,
the government does not propose at the
prescrit session of parliament, to say wvhat
course they wiil pursue upon this very important queýt ion. They will give every
consideration ta it during the recess, and
next session of parliament wiii be able ta
bring down a pronounicement upon it.
Honi. Mr. DANDURAND-But there is no
doubt in the mind of my lion. friend at ail
events-and I ama perhaps repeating his
own xvords-that the presenit government
intends to stand by the poiicy laid down
by the leader of the opposition, during the
last parliamient upon this question?

Mion. Mr. DANDURAND-Apparently the
gove'rnment mas- formied without a poloy being fgreed upon by t.he diverse componentis
of that cabinet. We went to the people on
the 2lst September %vithreciprocity as the
main question. A section of the present
cabinet tried to pushi backward that question in order to put in the forefront t.he
niaval policy of the late governiment. This
effort was made specially iii the province
of Quebec. In tact, rnany of the most brulliant supporters of the opposition at the
Somne of the
tîme favoured reciprocity.
present cabinet ministers hiad doubtful
views on the question of reciprocity, but
the opposition, represented then by the
thiree French representatives of the present
cabinet, had no undf-cided view on the
unaval policy whiclî should be followed by
Canada. Their view wvas diametrically opposed tu that of the then leader of the opp~osition, now Prime M.%inister of Canada.
It was s0 absolutely opposed that flot one
of the three gentlemeni w~ho now represent
the province of Quebec in thé cabinet was
willing to go on the platforni with their
now present leader, the right hion. the
Prime Minister of Canada. Thiat lion, gentleman camne into the province of Quebec
and held a series of meetings, but neyer

lia at bis aide any of the three gentlemen
who now adora bis cabinet as representatives ofthe province of Quebec. While the
lion, gentleman wvas hiolding meetings in
the city of Montreal in a certain part of the
city. sonue of his present colleagues were
holding meetings elsewhere and de-nouncing
not only the naval policy of the late government, but the vicws held by the then
leader of the opposition, now the Prime
Minister of Canada-denouncing

day of February, 1912, after four or five
nionthis of joint administration and deliberation by those two groups, that no policy

mean? It means tlîat two questions were
laid before the people on the 2lst of September. One of theni, that of reciprocity,
was absolutely wiped off the board, because
no further action needed to be taken by
the parliament of Canada upon it. The
people of Canada, on the 2lst of September,
sett.led for the time heing, for this parliament at aIl events, the question of re-ciprocit.y. There remained but one important
question, which loomed larger in the eyes
and in tlîe mninds of the representatives of
the Province of Quebec in the present cabinet than that of reciprocity; it was the
naval policy of Canada.
And yet we are told to-day officially, that
a cabinet tw-pr formed in October ta whiclh
the present Prime Minister invited three
representat ives of the province of Quebec,
and that these ,,e.it.,iiieli entered the cabinet knowing that thiere was but one important question upon which action wouW&

I arn convinced that there are but fewv
counities wliere perhaps a few hundred
electors were influenccd by this naval
question in the province of Quebec.
We of the Liberal party here stand, I thinkl
iogically, by the principle which we aimed
to establish, that of the unity of the emipire based upon the aatonomiy of the Domiinion, whule we have reason to believ'o that

Hon. Mr. KERR-We learned this afternoon from the hon. senator irom Victoria

in the province of Quebec, and it was su-gested that the hion, gentleman wlio introduced this Bill was probably introducing it
in the hope that we would have the support
of some of the factions whio have been dealing witli the naval question. 1 xvouid like

If a log is drifting down the St. Lawrence

lion. Mr. POWER.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-From a criiiniial
point et view, I look on this as a one-sided
question. Legs that are net marked may
dIrift down the river, and niay be lodged on
uny property. Such a thing lias occurred
for sixteon years along a mile, or threequarters et a mile, of river shore on1 the
Ottawa. The legs drift upon the rocks,
and what law is geing to force me te take
a team et herses and drag- thorn back te
the wator se that they may float? If they
remain on my preperty and I take them I
will he held hiable. They have ne right
on my property at all, and it is up te the
lumiber firms, and net the individual te
sec that they fleat dewn the stream. The
penalty is ail in faveur et the luruberman
and against the individual owner of lots
along the shores et lakes and rivers. TIhis
law, as far as it gees, inay bo correct, but
it dees net go far enough, because it dees
net proteet the righlts ef the individual ewnors of lots along the shores ef lakes and
rivera. It is net fair to cempel priva te in(ividuals, wvhether they be farmers, cottagers er sportsmnen, whie ewn property on the
shores et lakes or rivers, te haul legs frein
thueir shore àuîd dumip thern back into the
lakeý or river; yet if they keep themi thiere
they are hiable, under this Act, to prosecutien. That is net a fair proposition. The
hion, leader ef the House will understaud
what I mean. There is ne authority Vo
compel an individual te durnp back logs
that have drifted on his land. The legs
corne down and in some cases romain on
thue land all summer, and hocomne dry and

FEBIIUARY 29, 1912
rotted wood. If the owner of the land uses
theim, lie is liable to prosecution, and to
ilhree years ini the penit.entiary. Truc, the
hion, leader of the buise says that a marn
convicted under such circurnstances will
not get three years. It is in the discretion
of tlhe court; but Ille lion, leader of the
House, as a lawyer, knows that judges
frequently give the extreme penalty of the.
law without any reason. That thing- does
happen, especially in murder cases. Not
la'ter than last autumn, in one of the colinties on the St. Lawvrence river, a verdict of
inurder was broughit in against a mani, and
the jury made a strong recommendation to
mercjy, expecting tîtat tlue prisoner would
iret oxie or two years, but wlîat happened?
'l'lie judge on tîne bench ig-nored the recoinniendation of the jury, and sentenced the
IJoor old mant, the reevc of the county, to
penitentiarv for t1e baiance of his life.
Tîtese are tlîings that parliamnent shou]d
provide against, tind 1 insist again tîtat the
law should be mtade so c:ear, and zo precisc, that the judg-es on the benchi shall
have no riglit to iîîterpret what parliament
means. Let parliament sav what it wants
te say. WVe have lîad the case I have just
referred to, and it is a standing outrage on
justice to see that old man, a reeve of his
county, 75 or 80 years of age, condencnd to
penitentiary for life, %when
the jury said he
.,hould have aIl the clenîency the Crown
could exercise. Corning back to the subjeet under discussion, I arn not g-oing to
find fault 'witli the provisions on behialf
of the lumberman, but the Bill should contain a clause to protect individual rights.
Tîne leader of the House, as a mnan hiaving
a leg-al inid, and a nuan who is familiar
with the criminal. courts of this country,
knows that somethînes an offender cati get

and make the laws clear, but 6o long. as
there are two nien on this globe there will

the law as it stands to-day. The provisions
of the Bill have in contemplation an extension of the law%,as it stands to-day, to
the waters of harbours and sounds and
streains such, for instance, as the local
conditions present on the long coast of
British Columbia. The present law, as
weIl as the law invohved in this Bill,
only refers to legs that are found adrift
or cast ashore, and so the law would
not apply to sunken logs. It seems to me
we could very much more advantageoulsy
discuss this in committee, and I shouhd
be very glad to have the fullest discussionr
of the mneasure in Commîttee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-I think this Bill
would apply, without question, to sunken
logs, but it could not apply in any sense
to unmarkcd logs. No lumiberman would
dlaim an unmarked Io"; it is the property
of whoevcr gets hiold of it; there is no
question about that.
Honi. Mr. DANDURAND-Of course this

A man living along the bank of a river

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I would like to ask
the hon. mnember from Russell (Hon. Mr.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-While the statement made is quite truc, pcrhaps, as applied to thc St. Jolin river, 1 know that on

as lumbermen's operations are conccrrned,
te allow these hogs te go into the booms
and they are separated and ecd humberman gets his share of the unmarked logs.
1 would likc to ask thîls question: if an
unmarked Iog, cbould go into possession of
such an individual as bas been mentioned,
wbo couhd take the action against the individual liolding an unmnarked log? No
onc couhd dlaim that it was bis; therefore,
how could any one take action? It would
be absohutehy impossible. Wbat is beld on
the Ottawa river is that if a humberman
ovcrlooks niarking a Iog bie cannot dlaimi
the property, because lie cannot designate
it as being- bis property.

l'EBLRUARY 29, 1912
Hon. Mr. D A VIS-lil piissing 1e.-islation
of this kind thiat niust be interpreted by
magistrates, who are generally flot lawyers. it is xvise to make the language
as plain as possible. We are nowv legislating for the whole Dominion, iîot for the
Ottawa river, where some of our hon.
friends have limits. I have in my mind
a st.ream on which two. parties are doing
business. One party brands his logs; the
other does not. Now, unless there is something speeified in the Act. we do not know
whether it covers unimarked logs or flot.
It is very easy to add the word marked;'
make it plain, and then the magistrale
will have rio diffictnlty in interpreting the
Iaw.

iîoticed that tiiere i-as a gciod deal of Jiscussion, though 1 did not read the officiai

Hon. Mr. POWER-I do flot see whiy thcy

highest point te which a private secretary
shouhd be promoted when hie ceases to be a
private secretary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-Could miot the

the advisability of- naking a shilding scaheP
0f course, I realize that tlîis Bill is on the
saine lines as tlue present law. But since
you are puttimîg these private secretaries
into a higlier class, could not thîis Bill be
niodifled se as to put the private secretarv
into the chass te whicilm ie would belonnow, under the old lam-, if hie were but oee

higlier chass if lie had served thirce or four

prescrits itself to inv mmid is as to the way
it can be carried out. 0f course the experience of ministers who have hald to do
with private secretaries, and who have been
confronted wit.hi the difficulty of gettingefficient men, would have a great deal to do
with the solution of the difficulty. For instance, the late Prime Minister, in referring te this Bill, said that: 'The object of
the ineasure wvas siiply to -ive the private
secretaries of ministers rank and status
whicli thev cannot have at present under

the Bill.
The SPEAKER-Certainly hie bas a right
to speak to this motion.
Hon. Mr. WILSON-I want to know why
this special prîvilege is ta be granted ta a
miinister of the Crown. To nie, as a private
member, it seems very unreasonable that
this should be ailowed. The country pays
the salary of the minister's private secretary. It cornes out of the pockets of the people, and the people bave a perfect right to
inquire into an-d to' see that the ministers'
private secretaries are w-hat they ought to
be. If the -overnment of the day act as
tbey do very frequentiy, tbey wiil take the
Iieads off of every one. If there is a private secretary whio does not comply with
the wishes of the mninister iii charge and
contrai, hie will be dismissed. W'bat I want
ta know is w-by tbis special privilege is to
be granted to a minister ta select a man
ta put into the service without passing any
examinatian? He may be fift.een, twenty,
or seventy-five years af age, if the minister,
through kindness, should happen ta take
h.im. If the minister paid the salai-y, I
could understand that lie -wauid have the
right ta take any ane lie liked; but I caniflot see wby lie should bave the riglit ta
unload hirn on the country after he gets
tbrough with him. That seems ta be an unreasanabie proposition. W~hile I do flot desire ta detain the House, or ta be liai-h,
ai- hasty, I feel that I cannot justify myself in supporting a measure aof tbis kind,
because I think it is wrong. The country
lias a perfect riglit ta insist an the employnment af qualified men who have passed an
examination far the position. As the riglit
lion. meniber from Kingston bias we]1 said,
it wii1 create jeaiousy sinon.- the servants
of the «overnment. Men wlio have passed
the examination, and who occupy positions
wviil not be satisfied ta have others piaced
over them without any examination, or
without regard ta their age or other qualification. I, therefore, feel that I shouid
vote against this pi-oposition. It is not
treating the country faii-ly. If I ,bad been
given an oppartunity to vote I would have
voted against the second reading of the
Bill.

'NATIONAL TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY ACT AMENDMENT BILL.
SECOND READING.
Hon. Mi-. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading ai Bill (No. 76) An Act ta amend
the National Transcontinental Railway
Act.
He said: This Bill proposes supei-ceding
the late commission charged with the
building of the National Transcontinental
railway, and appointing one commissioncita perlai-m the' duties formeriy discharged
hy the entire commission. I do not think
it admits of any other expianation. I hope

economy in the proper direction. The pi-esent cammissioner, or the gentleman who

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-The tide has absolutely nothing ta do with the floating

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-That is the reason I asked the question.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-The tides have ahsolutely nothing ta do with it. He is quite
right about the tides in the graving dock,
for advantage is taken of the high tide to
let ships in at Levis, %vhere the tide rises
eig-htoen feet, and iii a northwest, or northerly wind over twventy feet. Advantage
is taken of that highi tide; w heii it is highi

Does the hion, gentleman wvho leads thîs
House not consider that a flat contradiction
by the responsibie minister ta his awn
statement? What does ail this mean? How
is the governrnent run? How does the cabinet forinulate its policy? le it the judgment of parliament, as voiced by the hon.
leader of this House and voiced by many
members in another place, or is it formulated and based on the dictates of a certain faction coming fromn a certain province? That is whet the country has ta face.
If the Conservative party had an open
poiicy on thie question, I would be prepared
ta debate it on its menite, but we know and
feel, without their saying it, that their
policy is decided by a very smaîl faction
in anc province cf this Dominion. Is that
a condition of things that is ta be toierated
by t.he country and sinile.d at by the honourable Senate? The lion. geiit'einan is able to

within the past three days? The hon.
leader o! this House soicmnly declared to
parliament on WVednesday last that. thîs
govcrnment had no new policy to announce
in regard to the naval question. The House
accepted that, and I regret very much that
lie had streng-th and power enough ta entice ai] the Liberals in the House, except
two, ta vote with him. That is the big
miistake my Liheral friends made in voting
withi the leader of the government on that
question, and they must have had their
cy es opelned bY this time.

Hon. Mr. OLORAN-Of course I am right.
What do we find? In the face of that
solemn declaration of the leader of the gevernment we have had a declaration by the
responsible minister of the departmcent in
the other Chamber, that, after due inquiry
and consideration into the naval policy,
and aiter they had studied the situation in
order to satisfy themselves, they would
necessarily have to introduce a Bill which
would repeal the present Act.

su. 1 was caSting reflection on myseif and
the hion. member for Grandville (Hon. Mr.

is not an urgent matter. If a navy on the
rocks that hias got te be pulled off is not
an urgent matter, then I do not know what
is urgent. 1 think it is urgent that the

te your ruling, that when the 'leader of the
gevernment says one thing, and another
miember of the -cabinet says another thing,
it hecemes an urgent matter for the ceunt.ry te know which is right. I think it is

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I regret that this

consideration hiaving been given to it by
the Committee on Railwvays, Telegraphs
and Harbours, to whomn it was referred,
and by whom it apparently was passed
without !uliy considering the effect of the
measure, in view of certain facts xîot then
being before the committee. I wsa-s not in
the committee at the time the Bill ivas
passed, inasmuch as I was called away

before it was considercd. But hion, gentlemen wiil observe, looking at the Bill,
that it permits the comnpany to make an
issue of debenture stock representing $25,000,000. It wvas proposed that that stock
.Qhould be placed upon a parity with the
issue made some time ago by the saine
company of a like amount. The fourth
clause in the Bill is somewhat invo]ved iii
language, but the proinoters of the Bili,
when before the cornmittee, moved a
change, which will be found on page 358
of the Minutes, which makes decidedly
clear the object ot the company that this
second issue of $25,000,000 of debenture
stock should rank pari passu with the issue
mnade some time ago. This should not be
donc. *There is no protection afforded in
the Bill to the present liolders of the debenture stock alrcady issued, or for whicli
provision has been made, and lion. gentiemien ivili very clearly sce that to inake
another issue of $25,000,000 of debenture
stock would degrade the first issue.
It would dilute the stock to the extent of
the second issue, and surely the investing
public must be protected to the extent of
having security proportionate to what they
have already obtained, and which undoubtédlv would be a factor in the purchase of
the stock. Not only was that done, lion.
gentlemen, but it is permitteà by this
legisîstion which passed the committec to
give priority to an issue of debenture stock,
o! ten million dollars of bonds now in the
vauits of the government, held as security
for a boan of ten milion dollars made to
the same company, and yet we propose te
empower the company to issue $25,000,000
cf debenture stock and to make that rank
ptini passu wvith the issue already made.
and give it priority to an issue of theten
million dollars of debeiitures held in security by the governiment of Canada for
a loan made to the compa.ny. 0f course, I
need flot point out to the House that this
must have been unwittingiy d'one by the
committee. The information was not before
the committee which would permit them
giving proper consideration to the subject.

but to proteet the i.nvesting public, as 1
have already pointed out, it wvould be supposed that the promoters of the Bill would
have consuilted withi the g-overnment of the
day with reference to this legisiation beingadopted, but such lias not been donc. Now,
it xvil] be obvious to the House that this
Bill must be taken up betw'een the promoters and the goverrrnenit before it can
reach another stage. I would simply point
eut to the House the desirability, in the
future, of our giving dloser consideration
te these Bis which conme hefore our coinmittees. Unfortunately, on that particular
day a surfeit of work xvas throwvn before

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN I raised that very
point in tlie comiiittne., not about the feu
million in security lield lix the gevernment, but a'lloNving this new debenture
stock to rank pdri passu wifh the other
issues. The matter -was discussed in the
committee, and an amendment proposed by
the solicitor of tbe company was carried.
I drew the attention of the committee f0
the point, and it xvas not overlooked by
the committec, as the leader of this House
is inclined to believe. Wlheiiever anything
about dcbentures cornes up in this coinnîittee, I always look particularly after it,
because I have biai experieuce in such
matters, and wheîî it xvas decided that
these new debentures should rank pari
passu with the other ones, I asked if consent had been obtained fromn those -xvlo
beld the first debentures. 1 think we were
informed in the conrnittee that there were
rio debentures issued at the time, and
therefore no hiarm couli corne to ans' one.
No allusion xvas nmade to the debentures
held by the governiment. 1 tlîink the proper thing- f0 do woull be te send the Bih
back f0 the comrnittec.

enou.uhe The important point raised by
the leader of the Blouse was partially discussed in the Senate when the Bill was before it. Would if not be better to leave it
over for a longer tîme?
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-The matter was very
fully discussed in the comniittee, in the
presence of the representatives of the coinpany. and the committee were satisfied
with the explanations given, that no liarm
xwoul be done to any one. 1 would &uggest
that the order ha discharged and placed on
the oTder paper tiil to-morrow. Iu the
meantime, communication can ba held with
the Grand Trunk railway people, and thev

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I would point
eut to my lion. friend tlîat the attention of
the pronioters of the Bill bas been directed to tlîis difficulty. It wili involve the
prornoters of the Bill having an interview
wif h the goveramnent as to their gctting
legisiafion of this character tlîat gives priority to securitiiis held by the governirecnt
of Canada. That cannot be settled in a few
minutes; consequently, it would be very
much more desirabie te postpone the order
long enough te permit a proper conference

expenses to December 31, 1911, were
placed at $7,681,700, from December 31,
1911 to Decenîber 31, 1913, $3,850,300. A
road within 13 per cent of completion as
to grading and 23 per cent as to track, and
within two years of being fin ally handed
over, should flot cost liaif as much for
engineering during thesc twvo years as in
the preceding six years of construction.
That, it seems to me, is a thing that is
plain on the face of if. The amount estirnated and spent by the late governrnent
for terminais at Quebec was balf a million,
and the present governrnent propose to now
spent over nine millions on termninais at
Quebec. The item cf beadquarters' salaries and expenses is also a remarkable one.
Three-quarters of a million had been spent
by the late goveronent from 1905 te 1911,
and the present governiment proposes
to spend one and three-quarter millions
in two years. Up to the 31st December,
1911, a total of $114,000,000 has been expended, and even nccepting the very exaggerated estimate of the Minister of Railways, the expenditure alleged to be required to complete would be $58,000,000. That
brings the whole cost o! the road to completion up f0 $172,000,000. That is a considerable distance short of $258,000,000. That
vast. dîfference between $ 172,000,000 and
$258,000,000 is nmade up largely of bonuses
and interest and things of that sort, which
would be largely met by the rental from
the Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway Company. I am not very much given te

figures and I shiall not go into that.
cornes te this in the end, that of the total
estimnated expenditure of $172,000,000, tw'othirds was spermt hy the late governinent
in seven years and one-thiird is to be spent

the governmehxt when this Bill was introduced in the Commons wvas this: They
claimed there was no necessity for having
four commissioners to do the work, that the
one competent man they had secured was
quite capable o! doing if ahl. If that statement had been correct there would have
been something in if, but we find that alrnost irnmediately upon the appointment of
the new chairman who, inasmucli as he represented the government, could exercise a
wholesorne control over his colleagaues on
the commission, this gentleman, who was,
according to the statement of the government, able to do aIl the work that the four
commissioners had been doing, an-d te, do it
better, selected an assistant at a salary of
$7,500 a year. That is more than the individual commissioners were each receiving
and does not indicate very much econAnd, further, the gentleman, Mr.
omy.
Leonard, is a very experîenced contracfor and engineer, and if does not seem
to me that if was necessary to appoint any
more engineers. The late commissioners
had a comparatively full and capable staff
of engcineers, and there was no necessity
for Mr. Leonard taking one of that staff
and rnaking him an assistant commissioner.
Hon. Mr. MeSWEENEY-Who

is that?

Hon. Mr. POWER-Macpherson. It was
not alleged that Mr. Grant, who was then
engineer of the commission, was not a capable nian, and was not discharging bis duty
faithfully.- Furtiier, there is very little
work for engineers, certainly not for high
priced eng-ineers, to do in connection with
this work, now. If lias ahl been laid down.
The road bas been located from one end to
the other. The only engineering wvork which
is really necessary is the work o! the district engineers, undor the supervision of the
chie! eng-ineer. I fhink that Mr. Grant,
supervised by Mr. Leonard, would have
been quite capable of seeing tbat t.hiose district engineers did their duty properly.
People talk in a loose way about engineers
being the rigbt men to superinf'rnd work of
this kind.
Take any -great railway-the Canadian
Pacific railway, the Canadian Northern railwvay, or the Grand Trunk railway-tbe engineers are not at the hecad o! the enter-

MARCH 5, 1912
prise. They are not the people who superintend the furnishing of supplies and the
financîng cf the undertaking. They act under the direction of the gentlemen who are
appointed directors of the company; and
while the Transcontinental Commissioners may not have been very skilful engineers, they were, I think, lairly good
business men, and itlhas mlot been shown
that they failed in any way in trainsacting
their business. No doubt the road has cost
a good deal, but it is such a road as has
neyer been built in Canada before, anld
although the first cost may be considerable,
the resuit cf the method in which it hias
been censtructed will be that the future
expenditure on the road will be comparatively amaîl. We have net reached the end
cf the inconsistency, if oe ni ay use the
expression, cf the government yet. They
dismissed the railway conimissioners, and
then, aiter they liad been condemned, appointed a commission te investigate their
conduct. I find, in the return laid on the
table of this House on the 22nd cf February, a provision with respect te carrying
on this work. At page 297 cf the Senate
Debates " I find the following:
Appointment cf P. P. Gutelius, C.B., of
Montreal, and George Lynchi Staunton, K .C.,
of Hamilton, who shaîl be chairinan cf the
commission, comissinners te inake investigation in respect of the construction of the
Transcontinental railway between Monc>ton
and Wnnipeg, covering- ai matters bearing
on the actual construction of the railway,
the expenditure thieron, whether direct or
indirect, the systemi adopted for sucli con*struction, and the management of 'the undertaking generally.
Mr. Gutelius is an engineer, but, as 1
eaid hefore, it does net seem te me there
was any necessity for more engineers. I
think Mr. Leonard, and the staff under
him, would be quite capable cf making amy
inquiry that was necessary te be made
frem the eng-ineering point of view. Mr.
Staunton is a lawyer, and thie government
have taken the ground that, in a work
cf this kind, lawyers and business men
are net the right people te deal with.
Looking at the psy that is provided for
Messrs. Morine, Ducharme and Lake, I amn
satisfied that these gentlemen will be paid
net less than $40 a day each. Morine is te
be paid $40 a day, and bis twe assistant
commissioners are te be paid $30 a dav.

3

in addition to their incidentai expenses.
Mr. Guteius is a gentleman who stands
very high, I understand, in the engineering world, and Mr. Staunton is a ge'ntleman who certainly wvould naturally expect. being a leader of the bar in Ontario,
to be paid rather more than Mr. Morine,
who has not had, in the recent past, a
very large practice. So that wve are safe in
saying that these two comnmissioners will
draw, sit any rate, something like $100 a
day ibetween them; and the amount of work
that is set out for them by the commission will take them probably two years.
Where the econemy cornes in, arising from
the dismissal of the presen-t commissioners
and the appointmnent of Mr. Leonard, with
an assistant who is paid more than one of
the present commissioners, and the appointment of those two coinmissioners to
investigate for a couple of years, at a considerably higlier fig-ure than the present
commissioners are gyetting, does not seem
clear.
I think what happened was this: there
were some rather strenuous followers of
the gove.rnient, who eaw that there were
thzee or four Liberals who were drawing
respectable salaries, who were flot protected by statute, and who could be got
rid of, and -they decided to get rid of
them, and, ini so doing, provide a mneans
of furnishing comfortable pay for a
considerable time for some gentlemen
whose politics were of a different stamp, 1
ar n ot given to using, strong laiiguage, I
hope, and I think elso, that I arn capable
cf looking with a reasonable amount of
fairneas ait the acts of the government, but
I must say that I think, in this particular
matter, the action that lias been taken is
not creditable to t.he government.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN- If I understood the
Iast speaker correctly, lie said the railway
commissioners were dismissed.
I have
most positive information, from the highest sources in the land, that such is net
the case, that these very railway commissioners sent in their resignation, and consequently, were net dismissed. 1 should

Germany irom that day, taking bier cue
froin that great King, lias st.rictly protected
lier birds; and when I corne f0 tell you
tliat the crop alone of Germany to-day as

you one instance of the enorinous growth
of agriculture in that country. Now~, to
corne down to recent mieetings, thie last anaical meeting w-as called ina May, 1911.
Aanongst flic întercsfing questions tlien

as f0 say, insurancie against bail storms;
anad on1e lias to go to those mneetings to
rem1iz'ý tlie importance of sucli ant insurance. Certain counitries ina Etirope suifer
very severely froni disastrous liail storms.
In England alune three counties are severel y affected--Lancash ire, Hertford and
Norfolk. In the nortlîern part of France,
experiments have been going on in tbe
last four or five years, subsidized by the
federal governiment, to discover some means
of destroying the clouds that produce hail
stormis. 'Mortars liave been vers- successfully aîsed et over 600 different stations, but
unfortunately, as in the case of ai new
ventures, opinions are divided. It lias been
proven so far, lîow-ever, tîtat Llie firing of

w-as to be reported upon. The question was
Ieft to the good will of each nmunicipality,
and is ini a fair way of being solved. Another very interesting question that w-as
very thoroughly studied at the institute
%-as the question of dry farming.
Mr. Carnpbell's systein, which took root
ini Nebraska, is now gradually spreàding.
flot only througli the desert of Sahara, but
lias reached Europe, and is very successfully used in the dry parts of north Europe.
Vie que~stion wvas t.horoughly studied and
explained by experts. It lias a great foothiold ini South Airica, and is in a fair way
t0 bec-otie successful. My question is more

within the last year it has been found that

are so accurate that they are being quoted
on the Liverpool Corn Exchange, and Berlin Corn Exebiange, and la severai large

Europe. So far so good for tHie institute.
The 4vQrld institute requires to go stili
further. The institute lias publislied these
statistics, concernirig whcat, oats, barley,

Vo point out that, owing Vo defective punctuation, the notice does noV satisfactorily
express the object, %vhich is Vo obtain infornmation respecting the arnout expended

to draw the attention of the hion. leader
of the House to an urgent unatter. The

about saime properties in Quebec that had
been expropriat-ed by the goveriumient and
not paid for. The last letter lu the report,
from Mr. Leoliard, the new chairruan of

been done, and we have learned nothing
about it. Mr. Doucet says lie luows nothing about it. I would be very glad if my
lion. friend would ask the chairman of
the commission if they are goiug to take
these properties. Il so tlîey should pay for
tlîem; if not they should restore the properties so that ive can do souietingl with thein,
because my hion. frieud can vasily understand that it is now uearing the Ist of

MARCH 7, 1912
Thoughi withi some of the Liberal party
there niay be no sympathy with it, yet it
is to be generally concluded that we have
to make provision for the retention of
our tariff walls. The question arises as
to how this can be done most efficiently,
with the greatest possible justice to trie
greatest number of the public, and yet consistent wvith the promotion of ail the public interests of the country. There has
been, for a great number of years, a very
strong demand, both expressed and otherwise, that the tariff should be taken so far
as possible out of politics, and I think
every hon. gentleman in this House wl
concede the wisdom of that proposition, so
far as it can be carried out.
H-on. 'Mr. GILLMOR-Are you going to
do it?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I am n ot prepared to say that the tariff cail be wholly
taken out of polities. I do not think it
can, but steps may be taken to remnove, as
far as possible, from political pressure the
framing of the tariff, or the amendments
that may be made from time to time to
the tariff, so that we may have a tariff of
the most scientiflc nature that we can
reach. I need flot point out to the hion.
gentleman that a tariff is very largely
evolved from the different sources of pressure that are brought to bear upon the
governiment in niaking that tariff, mo matter wvhat that tariff may be, whether high
or low.
Hon. Mr. GILLMOR-The commission
does not propose taking the tariff down I
understand?
Hon. Mi. LOUGHEEfl-It is desirable to
eliiiinate as far as we possibly can, in the
building up of our tariff, ail the sympathetic pressure that can be brouglit to bear
upon the franiing of tariffs. It is very desirable that the tariff slîould be made in
lic publie interest, wit.hi the view of promoting the best interests of the public, due
regard being had to ail the necessary interests that aie involved therein, and to remnove it, as far as we Possibly can-which I
say cannot be done altogether-from
the sphere of political influence. Now,
I need not say to lion. gçntlernen
that, for the purpose of intelligently
nîialiie- a tariff, it is nec"Ssary t'O secure

REVISED

that information from those reliable sources, from which alone we can promulgate
a proper tariff. This can only be dorie
through human agencies, and the closer
we can approximate such agencies to those
of a disinterested charact-er,
the more
favourable that tariff will be in the public
interest and the more eliminated wvill be

its promulgation. Now, it is proposed, instead o! the government niaking in.quiries
into aIl these tacts, which must be elicitcd
for the purpose of shapin- a tariff, that
these tacts shail be ascertained by a commission that will be removed fromn the
sphere of pnlitical influence, just to the
saine extent as the other commissions thit
are expected to carry out, or administer
such public trusts as nmay be assigned to
them by statute. It is proposed that three
commissioners shall be appointed. The
gcovernment of the day must necessarily be
responsible for the character of the men
so to be appointed. It will be manifestly
in the interest of the government of the
day to appoint the most efficient and coinpetent men that can be secured for that
purpose. I think I arn safe in saying that
the government of the day does not profit
by reason of being able to hold within its
hand the power of patronage, to assist its
friends, and to be coerced or induced, as
the case nlay be, to grant these favours
which fromn time to time are sought from.
the dominant. party governing the affairs of
the country for the time being. This commission will have the scope assigned to
it under this Act. Hon. gentlemen wvhc.
have perused the contents of the Bill 1
think will ag-ree with me that it is as 'comnprehensive as it can be fairly made, and
covers a scope o! inquiry which, if properly exercised, will go far towards placing
the governni.ent in possession of tacts by
which a more scîentiflc tariff may be
tramed. It w-ill certainly be more satisfactory to the public than the experimenting through which we have passed in the
building up of our tariffs. The government
o! the day wil be responsible for the character o! the nien who make this inquiry,
and it will be manifestly to their advantare that that iinquiry be made in as disEDITION

SENATE

intci-mnted a way as it is possible to makze
it; that it shall be as free from political
pressure and political influence as it is
possible for the commissioners to conduct
their inquiry into the various spheres of
investigation outlined in the Act. Sa far
as public security and publicity cari be
given, that has been provided for; the re.ports of the commission wvill be brought
down from time ta tixne and placed on the
Table of parliament. Thora is nothing of
a concealed nature, except, these confidential investigations which are providel for
in the Bill and as ta which, hion. gentle-_
men I think wîhh agree that that confidence
should be maintained.

is required is a f air and equitabce tariff,
based upen scicntific principles, and that
can only be had after a thorough investigation, such an investigation as is indicated in the Bill. That investigation must
be as te the cost of an article from the
production of the raw material until it is
manufactured. Take iron -as an illustration. It requires considerable study to
decide what duty should be adopted.

in a new country that is being developed,
thea that tariff should be properly and
scientifically arranged. If we are to judge
from the resuits of the different elections,
and from the policy of the late government as caried out from the time they
assurned office until tise 2ist of last September, when they lost office, that principie of
moderate protection, or extreme protection,
is one which is held by the vast majority
of the people of Canada. It will continue
to be se until Canada becomes sufficiently
wealthy to enable it to act, as England
has done in the past, and abandon protection. We are told that in ail protective

in administering the custoins duties, I arn
net se enamoured ef the preposed commission as others are, but if they confine themselves, as I take it for granted they will,
te the duties imposed upon them by the
Bill itself, it will enable the government
te adopt a tariff which will be equitable
in its character. It will justify the gevernment in dealing with each article on its
merits. The very tact that the raw material eut o! which an article is made may
change se greatly in price and value as te
render it necessary te make changes te
keep up an equitable tariff, is an argument
in faveur et t.his Bill. I arn somewhat ef
tise opinion that the duties which are te
be imposed on this commission are those
which have been in the past exercised by
the minister, althoughi they wvill be under
his control. It has been said that this comnmission is te regaulate the tariff. Nothing
of tic kind; there is nethîng in the Bill
te justify any such v-iew. They are siniply
te inquire and to report te the ministry o!
the day, and that report will be the basis
of the tariff. They can, therefore, be et

of its original Production until it enters
the manufacture of any particular thing.
fI is true, as the right hon, gentleman has
said, that a duty which protected one manufacturer may be a tax on the raw material
of another manufacturer; hence the necessity of knowing exactly what it costs to
produce the one article as well as the other,
so as to protect both manufacturing industries, and the consumer. I fiave neyer
been able to arrive at the economical conclusions which my rigyht hon. friend bas
reached. We know that when Cobden desired to remove the duty f rom breadstuffs
in England, one of his principle arguments
was that the freight wvhich wvould be paid
for carrying the wheàt f rom the wheat4
producing countries to the people of England would be a sufficient protection to the ;
home grower. Cobden at that time little
thougýht that wheat would be carried from
Canada to Eng-land at 3 or 4 or 5 cents a
bushel. It used to cost about two shillings
and six pence per quarter. The protection
which. he anticipated would continue no
longer exists, and that applies to almost
every article. It requires constant study
and thought in order to so regulate the
tariff as to make it equitable in character.
protecting the industries of the country and
at the same time not imposing too great a
burden upon the consumer. îhe elections
during the last fifteen or twenty yeara have
proved to us that the people of Canada approve of the principle embodie.d in what
;s.known.as the National Poiicy, and unless 1 arn very much mistaken it will continue to do so for a long time to corne.
There are certain sections of the country
where free trade in certain articles, I admit, would be of advantage. In adopting
a tariff in a country like Canada, where
the eastern interests are different from those
of the west, there must be a compromise
in some way. I do not share, I repeat, the
sentiment that has heen expressed over and
over «gain that this commission is for the
purpose of bols'tering up and hecorning a
tool in the h.ards of the manufacturer-.
That is impossible if the government bats
anything to say in the matter. The commission will not regulate the tariff; they will
merely report on the facts which are presented to them as to the cost of Producing

certain articles. It bas been urged that
their reports should be published to the
world. This proposition is absurd.
That would destroy the benefits which
,are expected to be derived from the appointment of the commission. The commissioners should flot be haînpered in the
discharge of their duties. If it is found
that it has the effect, even inclirectly, pi-edict-ed by those opposing the commission,
and which has been so plain1y indicated
to-day by my riglit hon. friend in his
speech, the country will soon put an end
to thern, or I arn very much mistaken in
the good sense and judgment of the people
of Canada.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I should like to correct one statement
my hon. friend bas made; probably he is
not as well aware of what was done in 1897
il.s I arn. The average increase on certain
articles w-as two and a haîf per cent as
against a total reduction of thirty-three
per cent. If the hon. gentleman wants to
know how the thing bas worked out, I
see in the very last custom returns that on
eighty-two million eight hundred and
ninety thousand dollar-s worth of goods
imported under the preferential tariff, the
duty was on]y seventeen millions, which
is a x-ery small trifle over twenty per cent,
while on those imported under the general
tariff the duty was nearly thirty per cent.
Hon. 'Mi. DAVIS-I ar n ot going to discuss this measure from any partiaaLn standpoint, but froin the standpoint of the part
o! the country' from which I corne, the
western country. It la safe to say that 90
per cent of the people in western Ca.nada
are in favour of no tariff at all. and perlîaps 10 per cent are in favour of some
kcind of a tarifi. That being the case, when
anything is done by way of introducing
any new legislation of this kind our people
naturally become suspiciolla, and they are
suspicions of this measure that is before
us to-day. We know that the only people
who have asked for a tariff commission in
this country are the members of the Manufacturers' Association. We are quite well
aware that iii the election re-cently lield,
this was made a plank in the platform of
the Conservative party, and that they trav-

elled through the country advocating Vhe
appointment of a tariff commission. I
want to caîl my hion. friend's attention
to the fact that there were several other
things whidh they advocated that they are
not so anxious to carry out. But people
were naturally suspicious from the fact
that the assistance which the Conservative
party received at the l1ast election that
enabled tliem. to carry the country, was
given themn by the manufacturera of this
country. If it had not been for that assistance my hion. friends would noV be in
the position they occupy at the present
time. If they are in the saddle they can
thank the manufacturers for it, and, that
being the case, we mnay assume that these
gentlemen are prepared now to demand

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE
flot assume too much.

BOWELL-Do

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-We know the facts of
the case. The manufacturers have done a
great deal tu put the present government in
power, and they are now in a position to
demand that the government deliver the
goods.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR-How does the hion.
gentleman know that?
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-We know as a matter
of fact that the majority of the gentlemen
described as manufacturers in this country
were going around parading their loyalty
last year, and that these gentlemen wer e
ton sensible to believe in the clap-trap they
talked themseJves. They were quite willing to take advantage of the spirit of loyalty to the empire which prevailed in this
country, whidli enabled them to obtain an
advantage wliereby they would be in a position to feather their own nests. WVho lias

stated that this commission will protect the

Hon. Mr. WATSON-Sure.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR-No.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-They dlaim. that they
are going tu protect the artisan, the labourer, and the agriculturist. How can they
protect the labouring man? He lias to sell
his -labour in a free market.
We
have an immigration policy which brings
people fromn ail parts of the earth, and our
labouring man competes with a man who
is selling in an open market. The only
thing you can do for a labourer, or artisan,
is to enable him to buy the commodities hie
has to consume as cheaply as lie can possibly purchase thcm. With reference to the
agricuiturist, I amn quite willing to admit
that pe*rhaps in sonie places in Ontario, and
possibly in some isolated districts in Quebec, a few farmers residing close to a manufacturing towni may derive some benefit
from the so-called honme market which the
mnanufacturers talk so much about. The
farmer may seil a fewv carrots, beans or
eggs, but the price hie receives for the
greater portion of the products produced
on his farmn is fixed abroad, and it makes
no difference whether lie sells his produce
here or outside, hie receives the saine price.
ThÉ home market for the agriculturist is
simply a myth. I do not think anybody,
in this House or out of it, would for a moment dlaim, by the greatest stretch. of the
imagination, that there is any such thing
as a home market for the people of the
wvest. We have a large surplus wbichlihas
to be exported. It muakes no difference to
our people whether their products are consumed in Ontario, Quebec or any other
province, the price that they receive for
them is fixed by the export prîce abroad,
and they receive no benefit from it. Therefore the home mnarket is simply a myth,
and as far as the people of the west are
concerned, every tiniie they purchase a,
dollar's worth of goods they put their hand
in their pocket and take out a dollar to
,pay for the goods, they hand 20 cents Vo

A certain class of men in Ontario had the

in force up to 1896, and they kept the test
of the country as a milch cow for their
benefit. Up to 1896 very nearly ail the
rnanufacturing in this country was done in
Ontario. They had a protective tariff of
thirty per cent and over. There wvas a wall

many places in the world because of that;
but if you are going to take it out of the
government's hands and put it in thie hands
of other persons, you have no remedy at

as that. The people of Our courgry, ne

leval. Those men who have taken the oath
of' nlleiance te the British Crown want
te iive under the British flag. They came
te this country because they preferred
our system, and our iaws to those
of the United States and other ceuntries, and they come here te make their
nomes and bring up their families here as
good -Canadian citizens, and 1 say that
there is ne annexation sentiment. The sugestion is thrown out that because a great
mass of people have come from the United
States the sentiment of annexation exists
in this ceuntry; but I say there is ne truth
in that statement.
1 never heard it expressed at the election,
hefore the election, or since tlbe election.
\Ve want te stay in this: great confederatien, but we want a square deal. I want te
point eut te you gentlemen down here the
grent growth o! population and the great
growth o! wealth that is taking place in the
western country. History is repeating itself. The United States started with thirteen littie colonies en the rockbound coast
of the Atlantic ocean, and frem that came
the settlement of the iniddle and western
state-, until you travel right through te the
Pacific ocean. To-day the grcatest influence
o! the United States is in the western and
miiddie states. The same thing is geing te
takie place here, because wve have the soil
and cliniate and we can produce the wealth.

market for that wheat. We cannot allow it

my hon. friend whio represents the governnient in this House, that it is their duty
when they bring people into the country, to
provide means for the transportation for
their product, and the next thing they
should do is to provîde a market for that
produce. The late government has gone a
long distance in providing transportation
facilities 'but they are not sufficient. 1 amn
glad to see that this government is going on
with the Hudson bay road. We must corne
back to the fact that we have to provide a
market for our grain, and in order to secure
that market, ve mnust seil the grain to anybody who cornes aiong to buy it, and our
beat market ia in the United States. I say
our people are satisfied, that we have a
great confederation, and every man la that
country wants to take part in building up
this cou ntry, but we want a fair deal, we
want a faix show. It is ail riglit to canvass the men around the milis who înay'
have their own houses and tell them that if
a certain thing cornes in force it will mean
that their property will become of no value
and the miii must he closed. It la ail very
well to tell a farrner wlio sella a little truck
to the manufacturing towns that it la going to ruin him. It might do these people
a littie harm, I do not believe that it
would, but suppoaing that it dîd. This la
a great big country. Look at the stretch of
land and rock that we have between eastern
and western Canada. Look, at that
stretch of country. If anything la done
in this great country it must bie as a matter of compromise; you must give and take.
If the manufacturers imagine that they can
go on taxing our people 20 cents on the doliar-and the duties are up to that-for
every doliar's worth of goods we buy, and
if these manufacturera also wish to interfere with our right to selI, then they w-ill

The province of Ontario considers it desirable 40oextend its etate owned railway to a

rcspecting Agricultural Fertilizers.' I arn
not making a- motion with a view te castin- slurs on the department, the goverilment or anybody else, but in the interests
cf the trade generally. It ié merely a business matter. It is very late this session
te introduce a Bill te axnend the Act, but
between now and next session the goverfi.
ment might very easily look inte the matter, and if they are cf the same opinion
as those interested in the trade, possibly
they will comply with the request of this
conpany. I have a letter from the AngleCanadian Chemical Company, cf the 29th
February, calling attention te a mistake in
a bulletin on 'fertilizer ' pages 8 and 9. This
ia froru an Eng"lish concern oper8ting- ln
St. John, N. B. The letter reads:
lit reference te the nîiistake in Bulletin on

This is entirely wrong, ais our special odeurless potato phosphate should be No. 142, with
a guarantee of 7 per cent phesphorio aoid, 7
per cent petash, 2 Ver cent nitrogen.
We called attention te the errer, and the
re-,n1t of the corwespondence is sumnimed up in

The trade of the manufacturers of these
fertilizers depends on the character of the
ferti'lizer. which should be up.te stnndard,
and the departrnent should publish such
repoYrts us weould place them on a proper

because it occurred before they came into
power, but the mistake should be rectified.
Th-e letter continueseiuh
We Vhink that a bulletin ontaining
incorrect and damaginig statements, sh ud be
suppressed, and publioity gýivein the correction
for which we and our English house are in
no way whatever to blame. This mieledig
staternent can be used by every fertilizer
agent in Canada as a strong canvaes aga'inst
tiese geods, and backed up by a bullekiin issued by the govern.ment, warranting the assertion that we are pl.acing goods on the 'inarket net up to guarantee in one ingredient,
and by imrnplication also that this fer-tiidzer
(tocs nlot contain eny itregen whatever.
Now~ the department under date of 14th
oi February, 1912, wrote to the Anglo-Caitadian Ohernical Comnpany, of St. John, N.B.,
as follows:
Dear Sir,-I arn in receipt of your further
let-ter cf the 7th instant respecting an errer
made in Bulletin No. 9-27 'Fert;iizers 1911.'
In reply I quote the following from the report thereon of the Chief AnalystIn the first place the fertilizer -bearing regigtration No.. 51, is guaranteed to contain 12
per cent of phospherie acid and 5 per cent
of potash. Fertilizer regietered as No. 142
is guaranteed to conta-in nitrogen 2; phosIt muet be rephonoc acid 7; potash 7.
nection 7 of ýthe
membered that under
Fertilizers Act, the registration number constitutes an identification of -the brand. On
the Sth of May last, Mr. Inspector Ferguson
sent in a sample (45486) stated to be registered as 51, which was analysed, find-ing
total pheasphorio acid 8.45 per cent, potash
7.12 per cent. These resulte are published in
Bulletin 2927, page 9. Naturally comparison
was made .with the dlaimts of registered fertilizer No. 51 , and a deficiency of 3.5 per cent
phosphoric acid noted. This is the report
published in Bulletin 227. Later correspondence shows that Mfr. Inspecter Ferguson wa6
incorrect in reporting thîs samiple 4546 as
registered under No. 51. He should have
given the registration nu.mber as numiber
1-42. in this case the results of our analysis
show -th-at, as far as phosphorie acid and
potash are concerned, the sam-ple fullY meete
requiirements. I ghall, of course, make necessary correction fii our next published
Bulletin.
You will note bY the concluding sentence
of Mfr. McGill's report to the departrnent
that the necessary correction re6pecting this

Hon. Mr. IPOWER-I think this is the
lifth Bill whichi has been intraduced this
session in tliis House ivith the sanie title
-' Ant Act to amend the Civil Service Act.'
Thiat is a practice whicli may lead to confusion, and there shauld be something in
the titie af the Bill ta indicate its special
subject, sa that, whenl we refer to an Act
ta ainend the Civil Service Act we have
sottie idea af whiat we are looking for.
Honi. Mr. LOUGHEED-I mighit suggest
ta mny lion. friend that when these Bis

facilitate ready reference ta the statute, we
migbht insert something indicative of the
particîîiar Act
hi
it is proposed ta

The member for Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Davis) warned titis flouse and parliament
that the object of this tariff commission
is purely and simply to increase the difficulties of the Northwest, by inýcreasing the
taxation oyi what they need on their farms,
and by blockingc their access to foreigua markets. Mon. sirs, I put you on your guard
here to-day. The vast majority in this
House are of the Liberal party. Many of

means f0 strangle the Liberal party for the

from the shoulders of the government. If
it is not a blind, fhev wvould accept my proposition, '%vlichl is a very simple one.
if
they want a commission to secure information, let them have if. I believe such information is very offen necessary, and a
commission would be a useful means whereby f0 obfa:n it, but the majorify of this
parliament should not allow them to estaiblish a commission of three protectionists-I -,vont cali thetu Tories, because we
have Liberal protectionists in our ranks,
unfortunafely one or two, or a haif dozen.

would devolve upon him to make his selection and choice and give the programme

as they propose to do under this Bill, is
simply for the Liberals to walk into a
nest of-I w-on't, cail themn traitors, we have

given to understand in this honourabie
flouse that the manufacturer is a producer
of wealth. I say he is not a producer of
wealfh, not by any means. The manufacturer, f0 mv mind, is a man who takes
from the country and gives littie back. My
proof is t1his The national trcasury is tnot
filied by the contributions of the manufacturer. It iS the consumer alone who paya
into the national treasury and who furnishes the fifty, sixty or seventy million of
dollars of custom duties. The importer is
the collecting- aient of the consumer. The
manufacturer is the robng agent of the
consumer, and how? Here is Smith who
is a manufacturer in Toronto; he produces
and manufactures an article wbich costs
him $10. Take for instance a plough. It
is worth $10. Across the line, in Buffalo
or Detroit. this same man Smith bas a
friend who manufactures identicaliv the
same article costing the same prico. WVhat

selLa his plough for $10. What does the
manufacturer in Canada do? Hie souls it
for about $l1.50 or $13, according f0 the
duty, whether it bo 25 or 30 per cent. Ho
raises the price against the Canadian consumer and takos from him $2.50 or $3,
wbich. ho puts into his own pocket. Hie

three do1larý extra w-ould go into tho national treazury, and the importer who

froin the consumer. To my mind that is
plain as A, B, C. This high grade protection, even with the new name they are giving it to-day, is a fraud o~n the people. In
the old days, in the .red chamiber days,
when the manufacturer contributed his
thousands, and when thie policy of the Liberal party was strangled in that red chamber by the force of money obtained throughi
fraudulent, robbing legislation, tbey fc.und
one fine day that the people were awzkening-, and the people got, the promise from
the then Prime Minister of the day that the
mouldering branches would be eut off. His
Minister of Finance at that time, however,
did flot allow him to cut off many of the
niouldering branches. They dlung-; and
they stili dling to the protection trec. Then
they fou.nd another terra with which to
biind the people, and that wvas adequate
protection. It is se easy to go amnxg a
lot of people who corne from the old countries of Europe and Asia, and even from
the states of America, who do flot know
excatly what *'adequate' means, or what
'mouldering ' means-not for ws'nt of inteliligence, but because in ear]y lite they
had net received sufficient school education to understand the whole dictionary.
WVell, tbey played their game with those
words for a niumber of years, and now they
want te êtart the game over again with
another fine word, 'scientific.' With that
word they will go into the back concessions, and over the counitry, and through
the platforxns of this land, and sing out te
the people, 'Oh, we are going to give you
scientific protection.' They expect to blind
the people with that word. WVell, they rnay
succeed for a few years, but 1 arn afraid
that scientific protection will need an aeroplane to scale its dizzy heights if the Conmmission ever get it working. *Scientific protection is flot meant te bring dovn the
tariff, or te chop off moifidering branches,
or te reduce the protection given Vo the
manufacturer as against the consumer and
the farmer-anci I use the wvoTd 'consumer'
as a general terni to ixîclude overybody,
lawyers, doctors, and dcntists, fariîiers, grocers and ail those people wlio consume and

govemnment are sincere and desire information, let themi appoint good men in
whom the country lias confidence, and the
the leader of the g-overniment will flot be
able to say te the people, ' Oh, the tariff
is high because our scientifie investigators
found it necessary te increase it.' I would
net give them the opportunity te advance
such an argument. They abused their
privileges between 1878 and 1896, when they

160 acres without charge, and yet, after
daing ail] thaf. Nwe are now charged with
treating themn unfairly and un.justly.
That is something which the older provinces do not deserve. It is true that this
year the settiers have been unfortunate
wifb their crops. They -had a frost which
larg-ely injured a considerable portion of
their wbeat. It appears to be the habit
of incamers in the Northwest ta try and
break up large sections of the prairie, sow
it in wheat, get reapers, take it off and
stool, and thresb it, and then they begin
ta yell ioudly for cars ta take it awvay.
The railwa *s endeavour ta supply ail the
accommodation tbev passibly cao. I do
not think there is a raiiroad an the contineiit of Anicrica which bas done more

Pacific railway. They have furnished an
immense quantit «y ai cars for the purpose
of remaving the crops ai that country,
and -tbey are increasinz their accommodation fromn year ta year. They cannot, in
five or six weeks, suppiy ail the cars
necessary to carry away the immense
crop of wheat produced in the w-est. The
difficulty this ,vear bas been that if was
neither wisc nor prudent ta send tbax
wvlleaf ta elevators. I know w-bat frozeii
wheat is. WVe had experience ai if in Ontario
bO or 60 years ago. I can remember in the
province af Ontario when we had ta bring
in corn meal from the United States ta feed
aur people. Txe «v did nof groi- and save

These conditions have been overco'nie.
The people cf the Nortlwest are having

wiil have to provide storage accommoicdation, as they should do, far ftie crop when

By and by they bezan to realize that they
had ta build larger barns and Lyranaries in order to provide the necessary
storagae
to save
their
crops.
The Northwest wvill
have
to adopt
a similar course. They cannot expect that
every year the railways wili be able to supruly within a few weeks the eomu
quantity of rolling stock necessary to transport the wvheat of that wvhole district. They
niight have obtained a better price for their
frozen wbea-t by sending it ta the United
States, or grinding it up and feeding it to
the cattie, but you cannot put that wheat
into storehouses. If you do -it wlll forri a
so1id cake, and yau %-ould have to chop it
out. It is better outside. They might have
obtained a better price for it this year, if
they could have shipped if to the States.
The hon, gentleman from Prince Albert
(Hon. Mr. Davis) spoke about the price of
barley, and pointed out that if wvas thirty
cents e bushel more in the United States
than in Canada, but the United States is
a proteeted country as far as barley is concerned. Is the price af, which bawiey is
quoted in the United States the world-wide
value of barleyP It is not. My hon. friend
would like very much-and I do flot blame
him--to sell his Canadian barley in a protective country, where he could obtain
thirty cents a bushel more for it, and then,
wheni he got the money, he would like ta
buy in a free tra-de market what hie requires for bis ever-.-dav use. He is %vise in
his day and generafiari, but that condition
of things cannot be realized. If Canada is
ever to become a great, country we must
aimi at deveiopîng along at least five uines
-a.aricultture. miaiii facfuring, lumber, mnining arnd fishiwr. The several lines of industry must as.sist encli other like partners,
and one must contribute to the welfare of
the other. 'Ne have to the south a country whicb bas grown ta enormous proportions in wealth and population, under a
protective tariff. They have ani average

Han. Mr. CAMPBELL

MARCH 12, 1912
The whole tendency of legisiatiün in the
United States is te lower the tariff. For
the iast few years we in Canada have had
a very fair tariff. It rnay be too high in
sorne things and low in others. It is impossible Wohave a perfect tariff. The tarif[
we have had in Canada for -the last fifteen
years bas been a f air and reasonable one.
It la enorrnously increased the prosperity
of the courntry and that: is one ci the best
evidences of its reasonableneas. It is a
tariff that has increased our fereign trade
enormnouély, has built up our manufacturing estiablishments all over the country,
and has brought prosperity Wothe farmer.
In the province of Ontario the f armera
are iun a fairly prosperous condition 'but
they are not making anything like the profit that they ought to make. They are not
rnakingc any such profits as the manufacturers are making, but they are certainly
making, fair profits and better profits than
they did under the National Policy that
existed from 1878 up Wo1896.
Now, that being the case, one great thing
jabout the late government is this, that they
âid net tinker and tinker, and tmnker with
the tariff. There was a certain amounit of
stability about their tariff, and that, I
think, above ail, is what the pèople of
this country want. I remember that from
1878 Wo1896 every cingle year the Finance
Miniater brought down changes in the
tariff, and owing to this uncertainty manufacturera did nrot know what they might
<'ipeet, and it unsettled business, and
caused a certain amiount of discontent,
because they were a'fraid te expand and
grow as they should. The Liberal goverfiment revis-ed the tariff in 1897, and did not
Wiuch it again for ten years: hence the
manufacturers knew during those ten years
that there was a certainty that the tariff
was .fixed, and although it did bear
heavily on cerne, and probably too lightly
on others, it was better to bear the icl we
knew of than Liefly Woothers we did not
know. That tariff was in existence for ten
>ears, and was one of the greatest features
of the Liberal gevernment. It contrîbuted
to a greater extent than anything I know
of Woproduce the great prosperity that existed in -this country. Now 'we find these
conditions-a country enjoying tremendous
prosperity, and rnaking more progress in

the last fifteen years than any country inl
the wide world, with everybody &ettled and
satisfied, the manufacturers sending their
goods to ail foreign cou.ntries and increasing and expan.ding fheir businesses, the
people and the farmers fairly well satisfied
-and this government now propose to
make what? A radical departure from that
policy. They are creating a new department. Under the pretense of seeking information as to what ir, required, they are
appointing a vast departmnent composed of
three men with salaries equai to thoSe of
cabinet minist-era, with secretaries, and
adepts, with ail the clIerks and paraphernalia of a departenent, which I arn satisfied
will cost the people of this country at
least $75,0O0 a year. These men are appointed for life-for five years, and are
eligible for reappointment-what for? To
tinker with the tariff again; to tinker next
revise it the second
year with the tariff, Wo
year, to revise it again the third year; unsettling business, creating dissatisfaction
in the minds of people, and unhinging affairs generally. And o what end? For the
cake of providing a new department and
three officers. I know that the Prime Minister, before the elections, spoke about a
tariff commission, but I a'm satisfied that
very few, flot even himself, eonceived the
idea of appointing such a vast concern as
this is to be. One man could get ail the
information just as well as three. They
have îlcnty of men in the departments that
can get ail the information that is required. We have the experience of fifteen
years of remarkable prosperity and wonderful.progress without a tariff commission,
and during thue time of the Gonservatives,
under the National Policy, they did not
want a tariff commission to encourage that
which led to the National Policy, according
to the hon. member for Hastings-nor dici
they want a tariff commission ai'I &longthe
line for the eighteen years that they guided
the destinies of this country, although
they were revising and tinkering with the
tariff every yea)r. The recent government
went about this matter in a businesslike
way; they consulted flot oniy the manufacturers, but the consumers and the producers as well, and found out what was in
the interests of the country, and, without
any tariff commission, they brought down

SENATE

a tariff which, as 1 hive said, and everybody admits, created the greatest area of
prosperity in Canada that has ever existed
in any country in the world. With these
facts before them I think our government
should have hesitated to load upon this
country the enormous expense ths:t this
tariff commission wvill involve.
If it were to be appointed for one or two
years it woul not be so bad, but the term
is five years, and the appointments may be
renewed, which. neans that the commissioners will be in office for ife. I venture
to say that the tariff comnmission will cost
this country $75,000 per year. We have
not only the salaries of the commissioners,
but we have rcnts, and .payments to clerks,
stenographers and experts in the different
trades. Ail these peopie wiil have to be

tîte -consent of the Finance 'Minister, can
travel the worid over. If will be necessary
for theîîi to go to Europe, to Germany, to
the United States if they want to get the
information whichi they specify in this Bill.
Therefore, I say thaf a roving commission,
such as this, travelling aîl over the worid
wvill cost $75,00M, if not a good deal more.
TIùs tariff couniission is totally unnecessary. AIl the information whiclî is sought
to be obtained could have been secured by-

one or two of the numerous officiais of the
Finance Department, and I regret that the
governmnent lias seen fit to introduce such
a drastic measure as this. With regard to

the production of their books to ascertain
what they pay for the raw material, what
the labour costs them, and wlhat they receive for the manufactured goods. This information is supposed to be confidential,
but how can it be kept confidential wlien
tweive or flfteen people must necessarîly
know ail about the commission and the
evidence submitted to them? I venture to
Say the tariff commission Nvill Yet be a
very unpopular thing with the manufacturers throughiout Canada. I behieve the
tariff commission is to be appoi(nted first
for giving jobs to some faithful men in the
party, and, secondly, for the purpose of
securing such evidence that the government
may be able to raise the duty on certain
so demanufactured articles if they
sire. I do not be-lieve they will venture upon that. The people of this
country wîil nlot tolerate a further raise
of the tariff, hecause they are in favour of
low'ering the tariff, if anything. The prîces
of the necessaries of lufe, and the cost of
living in the great cîties have been greatly
increased, and there are thousands of men
in the city of Toronto, and 1 venture to say
in the cities of Montreal and Ottawa, who
are finding- it very difficuit to niake both

produets were reduced from 171 to 15 per

nil. The treaty enabled our consumers and
producers to sel] their raw products in the
best possible market. We have at present
two markets for our goods, the home mark-et
and the free market across the ocean. This
agreement would not have closed one market, while it opened another door to thet
markets of the United States, and if prices
were better tlîere than in England, we
would send our goods across the border. If
they wvere not any better, we would send
our goods to England. 1 think this Bill is
unnecessary, useless and highly expensive,
and that it will produce no good to the
country. The govertiment have always ohtained this information through the departmnenit, and I do not Vhink this Bill is at
aIl necessary.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-Taking my eue from
the hon. gentleman from Hastings, who.
speaking on this motion last Thursday, said
that lie was not enamoured with the measure presented to the House, we on this
side, following hîs argument, are not enanuoured uith the Bill. Following further
the argument of my hion. friend v;ho, being

in this country free trade is impossible,

the eleotion of 1896 .1reineiiber well the cry
that was sent forth throughout, the length
and breadth of the coun.try, that, if the

would be closed. In iny own constituency
large posters were displayed, warning 600
and 800 men that if the Liberals were returiied to power this factory %voul be

thaît we had no idea of destroying industries i this country, but, on the contrary.

îîewspapers, that he was going to havTe the
Jargest surplus of any year in the history
of the Canadian governiment. Is that not
the best sign of the prescut prosperity of
Canada? Our oppontents in late years always sa.id, that oui surpluses were fictitious.
We have not seen this year a single word,
in the Tory press, about this enormous
surplus of $35,000,00 being fictitious9. Nor
bas the late Liberal goverrument been given
credit for this enormous surplus. Taking
the figure of $35,000,000 as the surplus for
the fiscal year ending on the 3lst of this
month, is it flot time that the country
should be relicved froini a certain amount
of taxation, and that the governinent should
apV1y itself to, t.he task of cheapening the
cost of living tbroughout Canada? It is a
faoct that, whilst in 1906 the cost (f living
was $77 per head, it bas since risen to
$100.50 per head of population. Is it flot,
therefore, the duty of every governiment,
in view of this state of aiffairs, to endeavour
to relieve the people of Canada from a
certain amount of taxation? The industries could well stand it. When we look
east and west, north and south, andi oberethe number of manufacturera that

told that three such commîssioners are going to be appointed. How will they be
selected? Will they be chosen from the
governing classes of this country? Will
the friends of the party now in power be
requested to furnish the necessary number
of commissioners? For instance, will the
banking class andi the manufacturing class

wvill the consumera and the working classes
of Canada be requested te appoint another

of their number as a third commissioner.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER-I have reason to
believe that the Bill vas modified to meet
Sir Wilfrid La'urier's own views, to do justice to the secretaries of the old ministers.
Hon. Mr. IOUGHEED-Why my hon.
friend, who usually exercises very great
exactitude in what lie says upon subjects
of this kind, should say that the design
of this Bill is to place the civil service
in po:itics, or to take the civil service outside of the scope of the commiission, I
really cannot appreciate. It siiiply proposes giving permission to the ministers to
advance their private secretaries from subdivision ' B ' of the second division to subdivision ' A' of the second division, or
subdivision ' B ' of the first division.
-Hon. Mr. POWER-That is quite a lift.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-My hon. friend
seems to assume that the private secretaries will receive the maximum salary.
That does not necessariIy follow. 1 might
point out to the lion. gentleman that there
are very important departinents of the public service that require private secretaries
of a hig-her standing-, and of greater ability,
than the private secretaries of wlîat I
might termi the miner departinents. I
further say, with the greatest possible confidence, that it would be utterly impossible for business and financial men to
secure the services of such men as are
required to perform the duties of private
secretaries, even at the advanced salary
proposed by this Bill. My li. friend!
compares a private secretary enjoying a
maximum sala.ry, which this wo-uld afford,
with a deputy minister 'before the passage
of the Civil Service Act. I say a private
.secretary of a minister perforins much
more important duties, very frequently
than the deputy minister, and it is utterly
impossible to secure the service of such
men without reasonable compensation. It
is not in the public interest that inferior

445

men should be selected for the performance of very important and highi-class
duties. My hon. friend lias said this could
be deferred for a year. The late government met the same difficulty as this government is experiencing, and it is unreasonable to suppose that private secretaries can be secured, who oftent times have
to sacrifice very good positions to enter
upon an uncertain tenure of office. There
must -be a certainty before you can secure
men who will sacrifice good positions te
become servants of the government. As
to this becoming the subject of abuse, I
quite confess that it could be. There is
a possibility of its -being subject to abuse
precisely the saine as the lawv whichi is at
prez.ent a.pon the statute-book. Tt does
net follow, and it cannot lie reasoned out
logically, that it wvill be the subject of
g«reater abuse than any other legislation
upon the statute-books.
There is not a*
law within the four corners- of the statutebooks that cannot be the su-bject of abuse.
We must place a fair amount of confidence
in the administration of public affairs hy
ministers of the Crown charged with the
performance of these duties. It certainly
would be a very paltry thing to suppose that a minister of the Crown,

simply rose to say that I feel soniewhat

leader of the governmient when he states
that this is a Bill wbich couid flot be
amended by this Hanse. I wouid not be
disposed ta concur in the arnendrnent of
the hon. inember from Halifax, because I
stili dling te the idea 1 sug-gested the other
day on the second reading, that the one
year mentioned in the Bill is toa short, and
my intention was te-niove ta replace the
word 'one' by the word 'three,' as the
minimum time which a secretary wvould
have te serve before he wouid be entited
to get that very higb saiary which la now
mentioned in the Biii. It is because ai a
conviction that we can deai with this Bill
in committee and amend it if we desire,
that 1 intend te act an the suggestion of
the hon. gentleman from Ottawa, who dedines ta vote that the conimittee rise.
Hon. Mr. CROQUETTE-I do flot wish
ta go on record as admitting the position
of the leader of this Hanse that this is a
money Bill and that we cannot touch it.
If we cannot touch it, what la proposed by
my hon. friend from De Lorimier coud not
be put either, because in nearly every Bill
there is a question of maney invoived, and,
therefare, it would be useleas ta ask us ta
study this Bill. 1 have in rny banda a
Bill which is ta corne before us in refer

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I think the hon.
leader of the government in this House
shouid reconsider his, opinion witb regard
to this being a money Bill. If this is a
money Bili, the Civil Service Adt wouid be
a money Bill. It is a Bill to amend the
Civil Service Adt, .and surely this House
was competent to deal witb that Act when
it was presented, and to amend it, and I
think this House did exercise its power in
that respect in dealing with the Civil Serxice Act. The money part Of it is. a mere
incident te the Bili itseîf, which is intended ta deal with a class of persons Occupying positions in the civil service, and
therefore I tbink it is quite plain that it is
rot a money Bill which is out.side the jurisdiction of this branch of pairiarnent. Let
rny bon. iriend from Halifax correct me if
1 amn in error, because I have not had
r,ccasion ta pay a'ny attentiOn to this Bill
until a feiw minutes ago. My understanding as ta the effect of the Bill as presented
is that it is merely increasing the salaries
of private secretaries to the ministers. It
provides for them being pilaced. in a higher
rank than they could have been placed in
under the Act as it stands on our statutebook. The latter portion of the clause
says

should be given to the ministers in the appointment o! thecir private secetaries, and
the latitude should extend to their being
able to demand persons properly qualifled,
and of course to pay them proper salaries,
and, therefore, 1 would not be disposed to
chal'lenge the Bill in that respect, but when
my attention is called to the effeet of this
law as it stands, and as it will stand on
the statute-book if this Bill is passed, I
think the suggestion made by the hon. gentleman from De Lorimier is a wise one,
that the delay o! one year is too short, a.nd
especially when we are going to increase
the salaries o! these private secretaries in
a very large measure. It mighit be the
means o! placing in the civil service a
great number of persons w~ho woulId be

for the purpo-se of reaching the in6-ide

Hon. Mr. WATSON-There are two or
ibrea points on whioh this House should

1 consented to second the motion of the

'mould bie satisfied that the cooimittee
should rise and report progress, if the
leader of the House would undertake to
give socie information to clear up points
'which are now in dispute. I rather favour
the idea that we should rise andl report
progress, and get further information. We
shouid have some assurance as to wliat
ùpositiofl the late private secretaries are
going to occupy before the Bill is passed.

what lias been done in the other House.
If hie does flot approve of my suggestion
1 do flot propose to insist, but 1 should

have discussed this question, why the samne
regulations and privileges ehouli not be
extended to the ministers of the present
day, which. the ministers had and exercised
under the old law.i

Hlon. Mr. POWER-Do I understand the
suggestion of the hon, gentleman fromn Portage la Prairie is that- my amendment be
withdrawn, and that there be substituted
for it a motion that the committee rise and
report progress, and that when we go into
committee again the hon. leader of the
flouse wîll give the information asked for?

Hon. Mr. BELOOURT-Reverse the proposition.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes.
Hon. Mr. POWVER--With the consent of
the committee I ask leave to withdraw mny
motion, and substitute a motion that the
committee rise, report progress and ask
leave to sit again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND - Before the
question is put I shouhd hike to drawv the
attention of the hon. the leader of the
flouse, to the fact that I intend to move
that one year be changed to three years.
1 do this in order that we may be prepared to express an opinion upon it.
Sir M.LACKENZIE I3OWELLHon.
What reason is there that the law should
be changed to that extent except the one,
that you have no confidence in the present
ministers P Under the old law, as I understand it, ahi that is required is one year's
service in order to enable promotion to be
made to a certain class. As I understand
the present proposition, you give an opportunity to a minister to recommend the
promotion of his private secretary, after
serving one year, to a higher grade than
lie occupied under the old law. Under the
Act as it stands, a minister couhd recommend that his secretary be adv'anced to a
higher grade after serving the saine hength
of tinie. My own view is that under the
old law, three years wvould be a short
enough period of service, unhess the secretary was appointed with the distinct understanding that at the end of the year he
should receive promotion. While my own
individual opinion would be in favour of
the three year service, I have heard no

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I will candidly
answet my lion. friend and say that 1
neyer noticed the form of this enactment,
and if it had corne under my revîew 1
would have suggested to increase the termi
fromn one year to three years. Seeing it
now, and finding that tfle salary is a larger
one than a secretary would be entitled to
under the old law, it seems that it is an
additional reason why he should serve
longer as secretary before he is entitled to
that very large salary and that exceptional
privilege which. is contained in the law as
modified by the present Bill.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Perhaps the House
will allow me to say just one word; in my
humble opinion this is a money Bill and
we cannot amend it.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-Froxn the committee,
reported progress and asked leave to sit

reminds me of a certain gentleman in the
northwest, very gentl.emarxly and wvell
educated, whom I have met in discussions
frequently, and when hie was a member of
the Northwest government he would listen
to arguments o! his supporters as to
why a bridge or culvert should be constructed, or any other matter, and then he
would say, 'well, gentlemen, I shahl think
of thre matter more fully, and ask what
Henry has to say about it.' Henry was
his co-partner in business. Well, this government is looking in ahl directions awny
from themselves, and it reminds me of
that remark-' we wvîll see what Henry bas
te say about it.' That is to say, the comnmissions have to report to the governmnent
before the goveriimient makes Up its mmnd

friend, there was a Iack of confidence in

the governiment in reference to this comnmission, bave not had confidence in their

the responsibility o! acting as the government of this country, but they want ahl
the help they cari possibly get. Ail the

late Liberal government. When commissions were. needed they were appointed,
and we can eay that they were chosen from
both sides of the House. I do net remember a.ny time that there was any ]ack of

mnade a mistake, because, there is a feeling
growing in the west that the ea.stern manufucturer is the western farmers' enemy.
I noticed in the press a short time ago
that a resolution lias. actually been submitted to a large gathering of farmers
in the west suggesting t.hat they should
pass a resolution to boycot the eelstern
manufacturers of agriculturaI implements.
Surely that is net a good st.ate of affairs,
yet that feeling is in the minds of the people of the west, and you cannot blame
them. The very men who are asking the
farmers of the west to buy their products.
put up the rnoney for the purpose of preventing the farmers of the west from getting a market for the products of their

the fox, and it is just possible that some
of the farmers of the west may undertake
to do that, even without waiting for any
report of the commission. I offer these observationîs to this House because I know

which is a great and important portion of
bhe country, have consisted practîcally of
nothing but threats as to what the capitalists and the inanufacturers of eastern
Canada may expect wbfenever the west is
strong enoughi to deal with themn I arn
absolutely certain these gentlemen are not representing the west in the House, and
are not expressing the opinions of the west.
1 arn satisfied the people of eastern Canada, who have gone to the west and built
their homes there, are grossly misrepresented in the statements made in this
House.

Hon. Mr. BEDLL-I wouid like to say a
few words before a vote is taken on this
motion. It is with some difflculty that
one attempts to make a speech on the
subject, because the speeches heretofore
made have not really dealt very closely
with the matter under discussion. 1 do
not know that there is any great advantage to a deliberative body, when it has a
question before it for consideration, to
wander so ividely as we have wandered in
discussing this Bill. I should resist very
strongly the temptation to follow the varjoua speakers through their wide wanderings, because ini order to do that it would
require a very lengthy speech and one
which I do bot think would be of any great
profit to this House. &o far as I have succeeded in taking note of what was said
during the discussion, it has very largely
deait with old issues. Very extravagant
statements have been made, which have
been very familiar to me on the stump on
a great many occasions. I did not expect
to hear thenm made in the Senate o! Canada in 19112. It seems to me that the objections which have been urged againat this
tariff conmmission are miot very serions, and
some of them, I think, could not really
have been intended seriously. The remarks

Hon. Mr. BELL-Resolutions and petitiens can be eas.ily secu-red, but I amn satisfied that time îvill vindicate the correctness of what I am saying that these state-.
ments which, if true, are alarming, and
these th-reatenîng statements made as te
the attitude o! the west towaTds the east
will, in the course of time be fonnd to be
without foundation. The people of the
west are largely people who came froni
the east, and they could not have left al
their conimon sense in the east. 1 have
no doubt the people o! the west will bd
found to be good Canadians, wise and intelligent enough in their political. knowledge to knowN that no one part o! any
country can absodlutely insist upon having
its own way if that country is to be great
and prosperous. WVe are goîng to be a great
country just se far as we can supprese excessive manifestation o! provincialisff or
localism, and rise to nationaliszn. I do
not wonder, after listening to the speeches
that have been made to-day, that there are
hasty, inconsiderate and dangerous stateients made in the west to-day in some
places. Why should t.here not be? THose
gentlemen who have spoken here are assumed to be the leaders and teachers o!
the peuple.

the House te thîs matter, because it has
excited a great amount of feeling in the
west, and because it is fromn bis awn towii,
Calgary. Sometbing shauld be said in this
House on the question. Sncb a statement
is miscbievous, ta say the least of it. The
hon. gentleman wbo is alleged ta have
made this speech is a member of the House
of Commons and is responsîble ta the gavernment for any language of this kind that
he uses, and for any public declarations
that bie makes. I amn sure that aur experience of aur American friends who bave

opposite of whiat is stated here. We have

statement which I have read is perfectly
new ta me, and I arn sure the leader of this
House will corroborate me when I say that
it la entirely incorrect. I leave it ta the
House ta say whether any notice should
be taken of this article.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The advent of
the Arnerican settier in the Northwest has
resulted in the rapid development of that
country. He is appreciated for bis, enterprise, bis energy, and his loyalty to Canadian institutions.

on Mr. Bennett's behali, bis entertaining
the alleged sentiment which. he is said to
have expressed, and to assure this Hlouse
and the American settlers in tbe west that
no one appreciates tbe valuable acquisition to Canada af these people to a greater
extent than Mr. Bennett.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-The leader of the
government bas evidently not read the report of the speech made by Mr. Bennett
before the Canadian Club in Montreal last
rnonth. The whole of Mr. Bennett's speech
wvas to this effect, that in Mr. Bennett's
opinion it was exceedingly dangerous to
have a very large number of sucb settlers.
He even went so f ar as to say that same
sections of Alberta were occupied by 74 per
cent of American settiers, and that these
people were.creating a sentiment of separaation. I would advise the leader of this
Hotise to read the report of Mr. Bennett's
speechi before the Canadian Club at Montreal. If hie does sa, he wîll find that anything the papers say about it is perf-ectly
justified. For years and years I have
thought, and I have said ta members af the
late government that it would be well to
mix up th-ese Amnerican settiers with British
and other settlers, and not ta have tbemi

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I arn sorry that

sbould bave been very pleased ta have
said ta hlmi tben, as 1 arn bound ta say
ta the House naw, that I arn informed on
Mr. Bennett's behaîf that the statement bie

fiction of sensational journalism. It is a

all congregated in a certain locality which
would be practically a part of the United
States. I have repeatedly made that suggestion to the members of the laVe government, but unfortunately in that, like many
other things, my advice was noV followed.
We sometimes raise a French flag in Quebec. I arn told that on the last 4th of
July some Americans -hoisted the United
States flag. IV is said that it took some peopie with codi heads Vo preverit some ultraloyalists from tearing down that flag. Then
we would have had an insult to the flag and
complications. You must remember that
any excuse is good enough ivhen you want
to 'get into trouble.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I may say, in answer Vo whit my hon. friend has stated,
that Mr. Bennett cari scarcely be held resporisible for what may appear in the newapapers. 1 have been told by those who
heard the speech alluded Vo, that no such
reference, and no such reflections were
made on the Arnerican settlers in the west.
0f course, it is utterly impossible to prevent misrepresentations beirig made, by
sensations i people attempting Vo produce
mischievous resuits among new settlers.
Havirig lived in the Northwest for a great
many years, and coming very closely in contact with the cornmunity of American settlers, I may say that there is no such feelig entertained in the west as that those
settlers are a menace Vo our institutions.
Hon. GEN\TLEMEN\-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I may further
say hs, that no clasa of settler bas more
rapidly ideritifled himiseif with the institutions of Canada or so quickly anid readily
assimîlated himself, with great advantage
Vo Canada, as the American settler.

Mr. Davis) delivere-d in the Senate the

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I agree with a lot ai,
it but some of it I do nat agree with.
Han. Mr. DOUGLAS-The point is this;
I have nothing against the character of
Mr. Bennett. In bringing this matter before the Hanse I did so because I
thought it was rny duty, as a rnember ai this Hanse and as a representative
fi-rn that part af the country, ta protect
the reputatian ai the people ai the west.
I hald very different vie-ws as ta the Arnenicans who have settled in the west, and
who have proved themselves valuable settiers. I look upon this whole matter as a
slsnder on aur citizens of the west, and I
arn sure that the end is not yet. Sornething
wirl be done ta show that aur peaple are
loyal. If they have difficulties they will
make their difficulties understoad. They
are loyal, energetic nnd a business people
ai the first qusiity. We are proud ta have
them in aur midst and we hope that any

Hon. Mr'. DAVIS-I arn pleased ta know,

and that I arn not ploughing my furrow
alone. I have one gentleman who supports
a great many ai rny views, the hon. gentleman who represents the city af Calgary
in the Hanse ai Commons, and who is
known ta be a good Conservative. That
relieves me ai the charge af partisanship.

in one matter. I stated that I considered
there was no danger from the Americans,
and that they were loyal and iiked our
systeni of governent better than their

A great many of them treked out
of the United States because they wanted
to get away froni the systern of government

REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE.
The order of the day being called:
Third reading (Bill 49) 'An Act respecting the MontrTeal Central Terminal Comipany,' as amended.-Hon. Mr. Owens..
Hon. Mr. OWENS moved that the Bil]
be referred back to the cornrittee for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-The hon, gentleman should give reasons why he asks to
have the Bill referred back,.
Hon. Mr. OWENS-When that Bill was
before the comrnittee two arnendrnents to
clauses 3 and 4 were inserted, -but similar
amendrnents have been refused in simular
Bis since. One Bill which passed the
comrnittee to-day and another Bill which
cornes before the cornmittee to-morrow are
similar. I think it is much better that this
Bill he referred hank, and that ail Bis of
a sirnilar nature should corne up at the
sanie time. We are not asking for any
protection that is flot given to other coin.panies. I think that ail Bis that corne
before this House that are of a sirnilar
nature shouid he treated in the sarne manHon. Mr. DAVIS.

ner. Arnendrnents were put in this Bill
that were -refused before the Railway Cornrnittee in the bouse of Commons. I think
it is rnuch better to refer this Biil back to
the Cornmittee on Railways, Telegraphis and
Harbours for further consideration than to
discuss it here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-The hon. gentleman lias g-iven but a faint idea of the
purposes hie has in mind in rnoving to return this Bill to the Cornmittee on Railways, Telegraplis and Harbours. Sorne
clauses bave bea-n added to this Bill by the
cornmittee, after due consideration. They
are practically standard clauses. My hon.
friend is right in saying that a sirnular
clause was refused this morning in a Bill
which is reported to this House to-day,
but hie has failed to add that the circurnstances were not sirnilar.
Sorne of the
clauses introduced in the Bill this morning
were concerning a transportation company
which, on the face of its Act, could not have
any intenti on of carrying on an urban passenger business in the city of Montreai.
The other charters in which our Railway
Comrnittee, as well as this House and the
House of Commons, have introduced the
clause to which rny hon. friend takes objection, were cornpanies which couid under
their charter powers, do urban business
in the city of Montreal. This is a distinction that has been made by the Railway
Cornrnittee. 1 see no contradiction in the
policy foiiowed by that cornmittee. and for
that reason I object to returning the Bill
to the Railway Cornritte.e.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL-I think it has
been a comnon practice to refer a Bili back
to a comrnittee for further consideration. I
take it that that is a very proper thing to
do where arnendrnents have been made,
because they can be properiy discussed and
the pros and cons can be heard in the coinrniittee as they cannot be here. Therefore,
I think, aithough I have no interest in
the Bill, that the request of the hion. mcmber should be granted, and the Biii referred back to the comrnittee. Unfortunately, I arn not a niember of that cornrittee,
but I had an opportunity of being present
and hearing the discussion, and I think it

ThiTd reading Bill (9) 'An Act bo
amend the Crixainal Code.' - Hon. Mr.
Lougheed.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I should like the
third reading ta be further postponed for
an amendment which bas to be made. I
might say that some changes are being
made in the British Columbia statute to
whielh reference is made in thir, Bill, and
it will be necessary to harmanize the two.
I would suggest that it stand over tili Monday next.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Wbile amendments

I think it would be advisable to bave one
regarding the libel law. Any newspaper
print, or any print whatever, wbich publishes raischievous statements against the
character of a country or against national
interests ought to be prosecuted by the
public prosecutor at the demand of the
individual or the corporation affected.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I may say ta My
hon. friend that while there may be some
affinity between saw logs and paper, it
would be rather incongruous to couple
libel with the saw lags and timber mentioned in this Bill. However, I quite agree
with tbe wisdorn of the suggestion made
by my hon. friend. It is a question which
I suggest that he work out. I do not know
but that it would be in the public interest
that such should be done, but I arn not
prepared to express any opinion upon it

SECOND READING.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of Bill (116) An Act to amend the
Civil Service Act.
He said: This is a Bill for the purpose of
amending the Civil Service Act so far as it
relates to the Customs Act. This Bill was
really introduced by the late government,
but owing to the dissolution of the House
it did not reach its final stages in parliament. The object is to create senior chief
clerks, a class of clerk for which no provision has been made. It proposes increasing
the salaries of certain senior clerks by
$400 a year. When we go into committee I
shall be very glad to give any further information on the subject.
The motion was agreed to and the Bill

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of Bill (124) An Act to amend the
Civil Service Act.
Rt. Hon. Sir 'RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-What is this for?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Thîs Bill is applicable to the assistant postmasters o!
Montreal and Toronto. They are two first
class officers. They are given salaries running frorn $2,800 to $3,500 a year. The Toronto post office is the one in which there
is the Iargest revenue o! the wvhole country. Montreal comes next, and the Tevenue from that office is increasing very
raipidly also. The Bill is for the purpose of
giving greater recognition to the assistant
postmnasters of those two important cities.
Rt. Hon. Sir RLICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-How mucli?

they cost money to put thein through. Railway Bils are money Bils. I think the
doctrine proposed by the hon. leader of the
House should not be accepted.
Hon. Mr. DANDUÂRND-I draw attention to the fact that if this were a money
Bill, then the whole Civil Service Act
should not have been amended in this
Chamber, and anything affecting the classification of the civil service 'would be outside the jurisdiction of this House. When
the Civil Service Act was passed we amended it in very many ways. This is an arnendment to the Civil Service Act. It simply
alters the classification and votes no money.
It simply declares that private secretaries
when appointed, may be appointed to a.
certain clasa under certain conditions.

civil service, and that under this classification money is to be voted which will be
comprised in a money Bill, but my contention is that until that stage is reached
this Chamber can deal with this Bill, and I
would ask the hon, gentleman who represents the cabinet if this Bill itas introduced in the House of Gommons after a
resolution had been offered the House, with
the consent cf the government?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHIEED-Let me assume
the government would bring down a Bul
voting subsidies payable on a certain date.
Can this House postpone the payment of
those subsidies for a longer period in advance?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-Undouhtedly
no. But I say there ia no money voted by
this Bill, and niy hon. friend bas noV answered niy question. If the money were
voted by this Bill it would have to be proceded by a resolution introduced with the
sanction of the Governor General. Was
this Bill preceded by a resolution?

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-It
seems to me there is no question about our
power. The reference to the Grain Bill by
the right hon. gentleman is correct te a certain extent,' but no further. If the Grain
Bill cornes to us for consideration, and
makes provision for the appointment of
certain commissioners who are to obtain
salaries, we have flot power to interfere
witb those partîcular clauses. That does
not, bowever, prelvent this House fromn
,dealing -,with -and arnending any other
clauses which do noV affect the revenue. I
do not think there is a question about that.
The point which bas been raised here is,
to my mind, a very nice point.
This Bill makes a provision for a change
in the mode of promotion, and carnies with
it a certain salary. As bas been pointed
out by the leader of the House just now,
the Gommons in its wisdom bas continued
a law whicl lias heen in existence for a
number of years, provîding that this increase of salary Vo the civil servants may
be paid in certain cases after an officiai
has served one year. The proposition now
DANDURAND-My opinion is is, we do not object to the promotion of
Hon. Mr.
that this is simply a classification of the the clerk, nor to the increase of salary

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I do not think
the analogy pointed out in the Grain Bill
would hold good, for this reason: the House
of Gommions, in this Bill, hias expressed itself that at the expiration of a year there
should be a charge against the consolidated
revenue by a certain amendrnent. That is
the point-that upon the expiration of a
year a certain charge will be made against
consolidated revenue. The Senate cornes in
and says: 'No, we shaUl postpone that
charge against the consolidated revenue for
three years.' It is not a question of classification; it is a question of postponing the
payment for a longer perîod than the House
of Gommons which has jurisdiction with
money matters bias done. The question,
therefore, arises, the House of Commons
having expressed itself as to when that
charge will be made against consolidated
revenue, can this House step in and say:
'No. we will postpone it for three years ' P
If that can be done, we can indefinitely
postpone that charge. I do not think that
is in contemplation.

SENATE
'which follows, but we say it must be deferred for three years. Speaking for niyself personally, if this were a new Bill, introduced for the purpose of regulating the
promotion of these servants, 1 would say
at once it ought to be three years, but now
we are attempting to change a clausé in
the law which provides for the payment
of certain sums to a certain class of civil
servant, making the term three years instead of after one year. I take the point
of order that the committee should rise
and the question should be put to the
Speaker. I do not know whether I arn
understood, what I mean is that this point
of order should be referred to the Speaker.
The CHAIRMAN-I arn quite competent
to judge the point of order.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I did
not ask you whether you were or flot. I
have no doubt of your competency to decide any question and every question that
might arise, but notwithstanding your
superior knowledge to that of the Speaker,
you have not the authority of the Speaker.
The CIAIRM.AN-At present I have.
*Hon. Sir 'MACKENZIE
you have not.

BOWELL-No,

The CH.AIRM.AN-I will have to cail you
to order.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I admit you can give a decision, but that decision would not be.final, because it could
be appealed against to the Chair. I do not
wish to deprive you of any honour, or any
exhibition of your talent, or knowledge of
the rules governing tihe House. I take that
point in oreder that we may have a final
declaration froru the Chair.
The CHAIRMAN-I will read rule 70.
The Senate will net proceed upon a Bill
appropriating public money, that shaIhl net,
within the knowle-dge of the Senoate, hav-e been
recom'mended by the King-'s representative.
It would be necessary for the leader of
this bouse to inform the Senate that this
was a money Bill before we could proceed.
Hon. Mr. KElUI-I caîl attention to wvhat
I consider a distinction between this Bill
Hon. Sir MAÂCKENZIE BOWE.LL.

and what are known as money Bis.
The rule applies with reference to the resolution upon which a money Bill is founded.
Apparently the government did nlot recognize this Bill to be a money Bill, and did
not present any such iresolution. They
appear to have recognized it as being
a mere arnendment to the Civil Service
Act, authorizing a qualification of certain persons to occupy a certain rasik. lucîdentally to that s "uch persons would becorne entitled to the salary that might be
paid. That does not change or affect the
nature or character of the Bill, which provides that any person chosen by a minister
to be his private secretary may, without examination and irrespective of age, be appointed a clerk. That is the enacting part
of the Act. And then it goes on to describe
w~hat kind of a clerk, whether he is te be in
subdivision 'B' of the first division or subdivision 'A' or subdivision 'B' of the second
division. That entities him to rank and
p)osition permanently under the Civil Service Act. The mere fact that they go on and
add words which may be superflous does not
make it a money Bull. It goes on to say they
may draw a salary within one amount or the
other, the maximum and the minimum.
If it is an infraction of the rule then the
Commons should have said so when the
Bill was taken up. The rule will be found
laid down in Bourinot, page 628:
That it is quite regu.lar, however, to agree
to arnendmente which affect charges upon
the people incidentally only and have ilet been
made with that objeOI think if the leader o! the House will
further consider the matter he will see that
this has not been interpreted by the government as a rnoney jilL They have net followed the practice wîth regard to s meney
Bill. The salary is a mere incident to the
objeet o! the Bill, which is to place the civil
servant under a certain status in the Civil
Service Act, and that entitles him to one
salary or the other, and for the purpose of
defining what that is to be, it is placed here
in the Bill. It does not seemn to me to be the
voting of the money for any particular purpose. It is dealing with a class e! persons,
and incidental te that, snd for the purpose
of preventing any possible misapprehen-

I could quite understand Vhat rny lion.
f riend would say: ' Well, there is always
an element of unccrtainity involved in a
general appeal to the people,' but I liave
mentioned a terni far short of the natural
length of a parliarnent, and that is the reason why I said three years, Vhinking it was
a period that would 'be accepted by everyone. The lion. gentleman wlio is to the
rio-lit of the leader of this House (Hon. Sir

consider a lirnit of three years. Was rny
hion. friend rerniss in lUs duty as leader of
the opposition when i 1908 hie allowed
the Act to pass with that very short period
of one year? Nowv that it cornes here, and
1 see tlikit it is only a year, it ,trikes mie,
and it .struck very many senators, I believe,
,even ni- hion. friend, duit a period of 12
months is too short. He may feign indignation; I amn under the impression that hie
does feign indignation when hie speaks with

and the organized agricultural interests.
because tlîev are organized ai over the
country, should have some say in this
matter. Is the commission to be loaded
up witil partisans and high protectionists?
A short time aga, Mr. Ames made the
statement that the commissioners had to
be in syînpathv Nvith the protectionist
gaovernînient, and only last night 1 heard a
very eloîluent gentleman in another place
saying :«At one time we had eight
establishw~ire manufacturing
barbeci

goverrament put barbed wire on the frie
list, six of theni have been wiped out and
onlv tw-o left; but I hope wlien the tariff
commission is appointed we will have thein

cIrn poopIl. and aiakt2 themi a little more
contented than thet are at the present tinie,
they should adopt the system I have outlined, and give the agriculturists of the
cou.ntry representation. It may be that
thev will select some agriculturist who
cails himself a fermer. There are two
ciasses-the egriculturist and the fariner,
one livinez in thé, tcwn and the other in
the country. They maY appoint a farmer

it was flot until after the statements were
made public in the newspapers that we got
information as to the effeet of certain
changes. I agree that where parties are
examined who are not seeking for special
benefits, then the provision is a good one,
but my remarks were addressed to the case
of persons who corne before the commission, or before parliament or the country,
asking for certain special privileges for
themselves, which privileges amount to a
power to tax the whole community for their
benefit. In suc.h case I say no concealment is justified or should be permitted.
They should be compelled to niake a dlean

apply for subsidies, bounties or tariff increases.

saving himself from disaster by hiaving a

to every reasonable man that, where disclosures are made of the character to which

commission, for the purpose of saving the
manufacturer from financial disaster owing
to foreign competition, and partîcularly
with reference to a line of manufacture or
industry which may be buit up in Canada

take into consideration the interest involved, that tliat information should be

class o! cases mentioned by my right hion.
friend, where such a man has asked for a
favour, or for an increase of the tariff, or
has asked for a tarif!, because it must be
kept in view that there are cases where
industries are not really protected by the
tariff-industries upon the f ree lîst which
might be built up in Canada to the general
advantage of the public intereýt. 'Therefore I say thiat so nxany intere..ts xighit
possi.bly come under a clause o! this kind
that to- begin to make provision by excepting any particular class *would probably resuit in ,an abuse. I think, under the
circumstances, the conimissioners must
exercise some discretion. The government
must exercise discretion. They are charged
with these very important interests, and
it is utterly impossible before hand to make
provision for every unlooked-for condition
thiat might arise.
H-on. Mr. CAMPBELL-Take tfle case
where a man is not seeking any revision o!
the tarif!, not asking for any increase or
anything o! the kind. When this commission goes around I can imagine that they

prices hie receives and what profit hie

that case he should be protected and bis

that is not the case referred to by the right

where a man goes to the commission and
demanda protection or a bounty, there
should be no surrender,_ and he ought to
lie able to make a case that would stand

he took the other view, say: 'Under the

my mind, is the object -of the Bill, but to

6hould be no such division as is indicated
sometirnes on the floor of this Huse, as Vo
there bei.ng two sets of people, 6o Vo speak,
in Canada. We are ai] producers and al
consumers. Many lines of industry are
carried on in Canada with no protection

have a customs tariff of ten per cent. Other
lines of business 15 per cent, others 20, 30,
40, 5~0 and 60 per cent. And these are conditions whieh the goverim-ent of Canada
have considered in the best interests of

laid down by both politîcai parties in Canada. No substantiai différence has. apipeared In ithe actueli carryting on of tie

a principie whichi can bie carried out in

and fairness to the different peopie. Then,
further, the government of Canada have
no power to find out the cost of things except in Canada. They cannot go to the
different countries which export goods to
Canada and iearn from manufacturers
there what it costs them for the raw material for the different lines, and what it
costs for the labour for the different machines, what a yard of cotton, or woollen,
wouId cost thern.
Hon. Mr. WATSONl-Why flot P
Hon. Sir LYMAN JONES-Because they
have no power outside Canada.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-They can woblect information.
Hon. Sir LYMAN JONES-They can colleet it, but cannot compel anybody to corne
and give information. When they are importing goods into Canada, the Customs Department may ask themn the cost of production and so on, to ascertain whether it
corresponds with the invoice price; but,
the commissioners cannot go into any
foreign country, and obtain information
that wouid give Canadians the advantage
which, under this Act, might be given to
any manufacturer in the world, t.hus
placing our manufacturers undler a disadvantage, which no one desires. This
country wishes to have the tariff so framed
as to give to the people of Canada such
protection as is needed to carry on the
affairs of the country, and no more. The
tariff shouid be so levied as not to bear
unduiy on any particular class of the peopie of Canada. The late governmentand sa far as 1 know, ail governments in
the past-have undertaken, through the
members of the government itself, to get
the information needed to enable thern to
corne to such conclusion as they Vhought
would be right in the framing of their tariff.
What difference is there between that prînciple and the principie that the government
of the day propose? Jnstead of their going

1 subinit that thé greatest care is
necessarv in the taking of this evidence,
either directly or by a commission, and if
the evidence becomes public it wi]l put
Canadian manufacturers at a <isadvantage
with each other, and particuiariy with the
compétition that comes from outside countries. It is a well known fact that in the
principal lines of business in Canada compétition from abroad is very keen. In some
important lines in this country the larger
part of the business in Canada is done by
foreigners, by -people who imnport the goods.
No one believes that that is ia the best interests of Canada, if we could produce them
in the country at a price not exceeding the
price whichi we have to psy for thein and
ébing 4henm in. Every oe beliEres that if
we could have a great consuming publie

products ef Canada, that would be materialiy in our interests, and I amn sure no
one intends te do what wili harmi any interest in Canada. Sometimes people get
in their minds that conditions exist that
are unfavourabie to certain existing situatiens, or certain classes, if I may use that
word in the sense in which I întend it, different peoples of the country. In se far as
the government need the information to enable them Weknow what to do. they ought
to have it, but it oughit net te be made

Departament sent a commi.ssion to the United States to ascertain the cost of goods
wbich entered into competition wîth the
goods of the hon. gentleman's firm in the
Northweat-to inquire as to thbe cost of
binders, and what they sold for-with the
resuit that a duty was plaoed on the binder
which came into competition witb the article sold by the Massey-Harris Company in
thec Northwest. The duty on the biruder was
raised a few years ago, as the resuit of that
investigation. T.he House knows very well
that a very important clause was introduced into the legisiation -of Canada a few
years ago, known as the ' dumping clause.'
If it could be sbown that United States
manufacturers were shipping goods to
Canada and selling themn be]ow cost, the
clause would be broucbt int operation, and
such sales prevented.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Not
below cost, but below the pnice ut wbicb
the article was sold in the country frein
which it was imported.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-Yes, and below cost.
If there were a surplus of goods and Vhey

Hon. 'Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL--Not

but these goods might be sold at less than

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-That

coming into unfair competition 'with the
Canadian manufacturer.
Now, our hon. friend from Gananoque
(Hon. Mr. Taylor> has gone into a detailed
statement as to the production of carniages,
or sleighs. He says there are some sixtyeight different firmns or institÎt.ions interested in the manufacture of that carniage,
and whose goods he bas to buy. There is
no question about that. He has also told
of the difficulty we have in this whole system of a protective tariff; he bas told us
that what is one main's manufactured
goods is another man's rawi material. That
ia one of the great troubles in drawing a
tariff. The moment you protect un industry by a protective tariff you have difficulty in arranging that tariff, for the
reason that yeu do not give a manufacturer an opportunity of inlporting raw inaterial for bis industry without taxing hini
un-duly. 1 am inclined to think that there
la one institution that the hon. gentleman
forgot. It is an institution that lie is probably more interested in, and bas been the
means of causing greater success to the manufacturer of carniages than any other institution in Canada that he has referred to,
and that institution is the government that
gives bima protection. The institution that
furnisbes the protection is probably the
most profitable part of the whole industry.
I certainly tbink that this commission
should be appointed for the purpose of
securing evidence and of laying that evidence before parliament, and that it should
be made public. I can.not see tbat any
man who is doing a legitimate business,
and is protected, should object to the public knowing exactly how he la doing his
business and what bis profitE are. There
is no question that during the last fewv
years, under a government that was supposed to he a low tariff government, mergers have heen created in Canada and that

am-akening publie opinion as to the necessity of road buil-ding, we find the provinces

the federal goverrnment, as 1 have said, bas

Consequently, at the last general election
the party now administering the affairs ai

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-No, but that is
whiat it is proposed ta do. It is a matter
af detail, but the central government propose that whatever iund is appropriated by
Iparliament for this purpase should be distributed on the basis ai population. I think
that is a very reasonable distribution to
mnake af sncb a iund, and for such a purpose. Any other distribution, as hon, gentlemian can appreciate. would scarcely receive the support ai the variaus provinces.

propositions. Until the provinces take up
the question, and elaborate a schenie that
will be mutually satisfactory to their
own government and the central government, it will be impossible to put the nmachinery in motion. 1, however, did point
out that the relations between the central
government and the provinces have, for
sonie years, been of so agreeable a character as to permit this being done. We corne
together for negotiation almost every year.
We find the provinces meeting %vith the
central government and discuszsing« various
problems which are of mutual interest to
them, and it is thought that bv such meetings miachinery may be provided and details worked out, and a plan evolved whichi
ivili appeal 'to the good sense of ail parties concerned. It was Nwith that in view
that this Bill was couched in the general
terms which I have pointed out.

there have been miany occasions on which
it would have been a very popular thing
to introduce an unlimited issue of paper

that a very aarge xneacure ,of popular support could be obtained for a Bill which
would deal with the multi-millionaires îvho

parliament should fix a minimum wage for

flot so a few years ago. It is only 'within
the last two or three years that these
huge figures have accumulated at ail, and
that this thing has beconie, as I believe
it to be, a very great evil, to be grappled
'with under peril of serious consequences
to us ail. I do not think there was rnuch
ground for complaint ini 1900, or, for the
matter of that. for a few Years therealter.
1 want to ask rny hon. friend-and Dobody
ought to be able better to enswer the question than himself-whet he thinks of the
position of the Northwest to-day. In my
opinion, the Northwest ie outrageously overtaxed for federel purposes directly. The
Northwest is paying besides a huge tribute
to the manufacturers of the eastern provinces, and, more than that, the Northwest
lias recently been deprived of 'the natural
market which it oughit to have had,
*which At would have had, if our policy
had been carried out, and whieh as rny
hon. friend behind me said, and I believe
is perfect truth, would have been worth
tens of millions to thern to-day.
I sey nothing of their having to pay
heavy municipal taxation. Unfortunatély,
the evidence on that point is not
sulffciently detailed to enable me to
go into it minutely; but this much is
known, even on the very meagre evidence which the government have been
able to produce-and here let me say
that they ought in ail conscience to
have acquainted themselves minutely and
in detail with the entire amount of
municipal and local taxation ini every province of this Dominion before they entered
on this peth of theirs. But we find this,
in Ontario the municipal taxes-not the
local taxes, which are a thing apsot-are
put down from twenty-five millions to
twenty-six millions a yeer. We flnd that
in Manitoba they are put down et sornething like seven millions. In British
Columbia, though there 1 fancy they are
chiefly urben, they go to somiething like four
millions, and so on; whereas in the other
provinces, and in rnany of them 1 amn told
-1 speak. merely from the information I
have received-the taxation outside of that

in the case o! Ontario farmers there
is some compensation for the huge tex
that is levied upon them. There, if
c.ur protectionists do steal e, goose, they
et any rate give back the giblets; but
ne such compensation exista in the case of
the northwest provinces. There everything
is taken from them and nothing is returned
to them. Here we have an enormous surplus-the largeet surplus our history reeords-and, et the saine tirne, with tha-t
surplus, the government recently brought
down a budget in which they did not
say a word about lightening the burden of
this enermeus taxation. Let me go over
the case of Manitoba and British Columbia a littie once more. Here we have in
those provinces a huge amount of taxation paid in 1910-11, an emount of smreThis had risen in

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The northwest provinces have scarcely
haîf the representation there to which they
are entitied. Even i'n this House the northwest provinces, with. a population which is
very nearly two millions to-day, have a far
smallen nepresentation in proportion te
their numbers than the maritime provinces, or the provinces of Ontario, or Quebec.
Unden those circumstances, I say that it is
doubly and tnebly impropen that a new departune should be made,. that the basis of
our federai arrangement should be tomn up
as it is being tomn up, and that those provinces should be let in for expenses which
were neyer contemplated 'wheu they entered
the confederation. Let us considen where
these things will lead to. In two years the
Nonthwest, if it continues te grow as it bas
been growing during the last few years, wili
have a population equal to that of the province of Quebec. In five years it will have
a Population equal te that of the province
o! Ontario, and be entitled to an equal representation. Recollect that these things
to which 1 have referred are taking place in
a communitv which is geographically isolated fnum us ta a very great extent, withi
which we have only a slenden connection of
two or three raiinoad lines, and I warn my
hion. frieuds that it is not prudent under
those circumstances, to press those people
too far. I have not referred to OntarTio, niy
own province, for two neasons. One is that
the finances of Ontario and Quebec are
considerably iiitermingled, and that unIess it were possible to have a pretty accurate idea o! what proportion of the imlit. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT

portations in the great port of Montreal belong to Ontario, sud what proportion to
the other provinces, 1 cou]d nlot give an
equaily accurate statement. But there is
another reasont, and I admit that here my
frienids in the maritime provinces stand on
firm ground; they may, with very great
justice, say to the people of Ontario-the
majority of the voters of which province,
I arn sorry to say, are mainly respousible
for the preseut state of thiugs as far as the
refusai to deal with the United States is
concerned. ' You will not allow us a market in which we can prospex, in which we
can dispose of our produce, and therefore it
is but right that you should be obliged to
pay for works of a local character undertaken by us.' If they bring forward that
argument I do not know but I would be
obliged te admit that there was a great
des! of force in it. I wîll say this further,
as a citizen of Ontario, knowing how fertile, how great a province Ontario is-for
I know it well; few men better; few men
have traversed it from end to end oftener
or longer than I have doue-but nevertheIess I say that the present prosperity of
Ontario is due mainly, if not eutirely, to
the prosperity of the Northwest; and I
point to the resuit of the census of 1901,
when, after twenty years of ai National
Policy, in the decade that had elapsed between 1891 and 1901, Ontario presented to
the world the most mniserable spectacle of
a great, rich, fertile province reduced to a
state of atrophy.

-WVhy hion, gentlemen, between 1891 and
1901 the total growth. of the great province
of Ontario was barely 68,000 souls-froin
2,114,000 it had grown to 2,152,000. A viler
record I never saw for a country of
such resources and of such natural
wealth. One-third of one per cent per
annum was the growth of Ontario from
1891 to 1901, and almost the entire
of that paitry growth took place after
1896, as the census records wili showý

that I ever heard brought up in any con«
test, and by. a11owng itself te be made the
tool of a set of selfish scoundrels who cared
nething for anything except further ]ining
their well-flled pockets. F'or these purposes Ontario turned down the best offer
that had ever been made from one nation
to another.

would convert these territories into provinces. They did so. From tha't day these provinces had a status, but not before. On the
13th July, 1908, the late government brought
down a certain resolution in parliament,
deciding that the boundaries o! Manitoba
sbould be extended in the way we propose
t., have them to-day. That was in anticipation of the financial subsidies being increased. It happened that the neg-otiations
between the two governments proved abortive; they did not see eye to eye, conseque-ntly the negotiations resulited in nothing
being done. It is not unreasonable tu suppose that, as recognition was given tb Manitoba on the l3th July, 1908, touching thé
extension o! the boundaries, and having in

between the twvo governiients these subsidies should be retroactive from that date.

in that tarritory, that there is a total population of semething like four hundred or
leas white people in that territory. From
that I assume that the gentlemen who are
talking in that way thought there was ne
person in that country that baud a voice in
the affairs of this country, or in the arrangement cf affaîrs in that country except the people whom they were prepared
te cali white people. But there is a class
of people there who are citizens in tilat
country, who hav-- aIl the rights and privileges belonging te a.ny other citizen, who
have the right of franchise and everything
else, and who are tax-payers. I allude
now to the gentlemen whom we cail the
hialf-br2eds of the country. I suppose
when those speakers assumed there were
only four hundred, or less white people
in the territory, they did net take inte consideration the large population cf haifbzeeds who are scaftered through that territory dewn te Churchill, Nelson, and all
through there, who have just as much rigbt
te be heard as the four hundred people
wvhom those speakers talked about.
.Now I submit that the government went
te 'werk without consulting these people at
ail. ihey arranged te extend the beundaries cf Manitoba and te hand over the
territery that these people lived in, where
they were born and where, in many instances, their fathers were born. The Dominion gevernment saw fit te undertake
te hand that territery te Manitoba without
ccnsulting these people in any way. There
is a tiourishing town in this territory called
La Pas, where there must be a population
of about one theousand people. NVere they
taken into censideration? W~ere they asked
te ceme te any conference? A great many
questions affecting their welfare and rights
should have been considered. WVe find the
province cf Manitoba desireus of taking
this territery within their boundaries.
The people living in the territery neyer
asked te be taken in. It was Manitoba that

527

wanted the territery. They are being taken
in without their rights being considered.
The province cf Manitoba is pretty heavily
mertgaged, it is loaded dewn with bonds
of ail kinds for the purchase of telephene
lines, for the bonding cf railways, for
stations at Winnipeg, and fer ail kinda cf
wild cat things. Are these people te be
brought into Manitoba without receiving
any compensation P Are they te be thrown
holus bolus into Manitoba without their
intereat being considered, and wiil they
have te assume ahl these liabilities without
being consulted P Then the rights they
have te their educational system in that
portion of the territery -sheuld have been
taken intoecnsideration. The least that could
have been done was te have heard what
they had te say. The gevernment did net
do that; they simply said: we will put you
in tiiere wvhether yeu want te go in or net.
Why ail this hurry and haste ? This thing
has been geing aleng for the last three or
four years, and anether year would net
have made much difference. 1 notice in
the correspendence between the government cf Saskatchewan and, the leader cf the

Han. Mr. WATSON It should bclong ta

pression, theéy happen ta be at the trough,

They taok five miles af territory, a large
portion af the shore line of Hudson bay,
including what will be the city of
Nelson. If Ontario has a dlaim ta the territary, I can prove that Saskatchewan lias
a better dlaim. I have in my hands documents which the leader ai the Senate sent
me after the debate began this afternoan;
I have not had timie ta ga through them,
but I think I can prove that Saskatchewan
has a much better dlaim than Ontario,
which province bas a visianary dlaim.
They had their territory there, and anything given them was a gift, from the people af Canada.

Hon. Mr; DAVIS-Yes, I would. In the
near future, with the growth of the western
country, with the opening up and development of the Hudson Bay road, perhaps a
larger city will be built at Fort Nelson
than any other city in the Dominion. It is
a reasonable proposition to suppose that
there will be a large city there. My hion.
friend froma Halifax laughs. Does hie not
know that there are large cities in Russia
much further north than that-cities larger
why
than Toronto or Montreal-and
should we not have a large city there?
Hon. Mr. IPOWER-There is not any
Hudson strait autside those large cities ia
Russia.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-That does not make
any difference. We heard the same story
with reference to the straits of Belle Isle.
The Hudson straits are easier ta navigate
than the straits of Belle Isle. There is not
as much fou, no snowstorms and no more
ice, and with proper telegraph and telephione
communication there is no doubt that the
tine will came when Hudson straits wvil1
be navigaatýed five or six months af the year.
The MNinister of Railways has outlined another scheme, which my hion. friend forgets, to run a line of steamers across the
bay, and run a railway across UJngava to
the Labrador caast.
Hion. Mr. DAVIS.

Manitoba.

Han. Mr. DAVIS-Surely it should. If
they wanted ta do anything for Ontario, the
pSoper thing would have been ta extend

Now, 1 submit, here is enough correspondence te show that as far as the communications between the federal government and the government of Saskatchewanl
are concernied, with reference to this conference, there cannot be any question tha'.
Saskatchewanl asked time and tirne again
te be repreaented at the conference that
was held between the province of Ontario,
the federal governiment and the province
cf Manitoba,. Now, nny province ini this
Dominion that bas a legitimate dlaim te
be present at a conference cf that kind
surely should net be ignored. Their dlaim
to t.hat territory was better than the dlaima
of Manitoba: today.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Celumbia)-XVhy is Alberta sulent?
Hlon. Mr. DAVIS-Alberta is away off to
one aide. It neyer owned this territory.
Our claim te this territory is better than
the dlaim of Manitoba, because this territory at one time belonged te us. We administered the laws in that territery. Our
legisiative assembly had jurisdiction over
it, wve policed it; throughi our legislative
assembly, and lieutenant governer we appointed ail the magistrates in that territory;
we took care of the administration of justice, the arrangemients of educational questions-everything in connection with that
territory. It was represented in the legislative assemhly at Regina at one time by
a gentleman namied McLeod, and 1 cannot
go ever the naines, but three or four different times three or four different parties
represented that territery in Reg-ina. I have
the honour of representing thiat territory,
and had polls in that territory when I was

contended that that portion of the Northwc-.t
Territory bordering on the Hudson bay a-id
lying b)etiveen the Neisen river and the 6Oth
parallel of latitude wouid be awvarded to the
province of Saskatchiewan. If tliis were donc
a natural boundary line between the province of Saskatchewan and Manitoba would
be found in the Nelson river.
This terrd.tory is tributary te S.askatchewan
rather than te Manitoba. the rîvers flowing
through this territorv flow froni Saskatchewan. In the very near future it is expected
thet this territory will be connected with thle
province of Saskatchewan by a railvray, onp
terminus of which wiii be in Saskatchewan
and the other at Fort Chiurchlill.
In bumrning up the saine memiorandumn
shows:
(1) That those portions of the 01(1 districts
of Saskatchewan and Athabaska, îîot ineiuded
in the province of Sask~atchewan have been
for the paet twenty years and should continue te ibe united with the area forming
that province.
(2) Tha.t the province of Saskatchîewan and
the province of Manitoba are both entitlel
to have their boundaries extended te Hudson
bay.
(3) That granting te tlîe provinces of Siskatc.hiewan those portions cf the ahi districts
of Saskatchewan and Athabaska,' lie Nelson
river forms a natural boundary, and the only
reasonable boundarv between tliat province
and the province of Manitoba.
(4) 'Ihat the territor. north of the Nelson
river ia tributory te the province of S-îtskatchewan ra.ther than te the province of
Mianitoba, and 'the interests cf the people are
more closely allied ivith Saskatchewan.
(5) That the province of Saskatchewan has
a nsuch greater interest in a transiportation
route via Fort Churchill and Hudson bay te
the European markets thaen lias either the
province of Manitoba or tlie province cf Qatari..
Then we find in the supplementary statement submitted on behiaîf cf the province
et Saskatchewan wvith reference to the
dlaims of the province fer an extension of
boundaries te the Hudson bay:
That in their opinion the lx'undar'es of

rights of the people were recognized, and
respected, and those people in Keewatin
énjoyed ail those rights under the very
saine ordînances. The school law that we
have to-day embodied in the constitution
of Saskatchewan is e'xactly the school lawv
that w-e had under the old Northwest Terrîtories ordinances, passed. by the legisiative assenib]y-the very same iaw that the
people that you propose to join to 'Manitoba enjoyed. How could they imagine
what was going to happen when they w-ere
cut off and thrown to one aide that way?
They petitioned to be taken into Saskatchewan, where they naturally belonged, because they feit that if they were taken
into Saskatchewan they would enjoy the
same rights that their. fellow-citizens are
cnjoying. But they were thrown off into
No Man's land, and it is proposed to attach themn to Manitoba without giving theni
any rights ini regard to educational matters. 1 do not consider that fair. Those
people that belongaed to Saskatchewan, and

venture to say that the governnient has
neyer sent anybody there to consult their
wishes in this matter; and those are free

Ontario to fair treatment. If Ontario is

you permit me to caîl your attention, not
r-o much te what la contained in the Boundaries Bill, as to what it. does not contain.
The sehiool question of Manitoba has for
long been discussed b3, the ablest lawyerii
in the country. They have crossed swords
pro and con and in oui day the legal tourney stili goes on.
I do not propose to advance any opinion
as to the constitutioiuîhitv of the stand
takeni hy one side or by the other. Until
the crack of doolr the lglprofession nîay
be hopelessly sundered on this point.
While it may be claiined that provincial
righlts are a sacred thing- that there should
be no interference wvitli theose rights by the
federal parliament-it should also be borne
in mind that there inay be. and there actaa'Jy is, such a thîng as provincial wrongs,
alid when it la fel.t that such a condition
prevaris, where ia 'the renmedy?
The miinority in Manitoba feel deeply on
this question. They have reasons in plenty
te complain that they have been harshly
dt'alt with, that their dearest rights have
been trampled upon by a majority that
seems regardiess of the appeals of natural
justice.

534

SENATE

The fathers and mothers of the mînority
feel it incumbent upon themi to give their
offspring a reli.gious as well as a secular
education. This they deem a duty they
owe their God, their country and their
children. The State steps in and tells themn
they will be permitted to do this, but, if
they se elect, they inust also contribute of
their means te sustain other schools they
cannot use, cther achools from which is
excluded the training which fits them for
the Mie beyond. Thev wiil have to support two sets of schools-those which they
use and the schools of their neighbours
which they do net and cannot in conscience
use.
This is the condition that faces us in
Manitoba, up to the present a comparatively small but important province in the federal family group.
In other provinces-I have now in mind
these down by the sea-there wvas a time
when feeling ian high on the school questien, but at long- last a settiement was arrived at. There ivas a compromise-there
was a spirit of give and take-there was
on the part e! the majority a willingness
to be just if net generous, and a peaceful
solution of the trouble was achiéved.
Not so, however, with Manitoba. It stili
clings to the mot.to that in school matters
at least the minority lias no rights which
the majority miav concede or respect.
We will be assured that in certain sections of the province the Catholic people
have been permitted to establish and conduct schools which are practicalv soparate
schools.
They cannot in the true sense be recog.
nized as such be-cause they are forced to
conform to certain regulations laid doivn by
ari education department which mereiy
tolerates them, but ever looks at them askance.
Let us consider the conditions prevailing
in a section composed entirely or almost
entirely of Çat-holics. These people establish a scheol. It must bc deemed a public
school. AlI the money used in its erection
and maintenance came out of the purses
of the Catholic people, with the except:on o! a pittance called a government
grant.
HIn. Mr. COFFEY.

Regulations were laid down whereby relig',ious training is cut dewn to the minimum. It is barely tolerated. Catechism
may be taught, but only for a very brief
period, a.nd this, if I amn not mistaken, after
school houre.
Just here some one may put the question:
Dûes not the teaching of religion in the
schools lessen the efficiency of the secular
studies? To this I would answer that in
nearly every province of the Dominion
where Catholic parents are given fair playwhere their schools are placed on the same
oting as the public schools-where they
1<
are not hampered in their work by vexatieus restriction s-thdy not only hold their
ojwn in secular studies, but in many places
art far in advance of the public schools.
But to the proof, which I think will be a
revelation te many who imagine that Cathelics make a *mistake in not taking advantage of the public school training. In the
cîty of London at the last entrance examination, 382 pupils f romn the public schools
,went up for this test. 0f these 285 or 74ý
per cent passed. At the same examination
43 candidates from the separate schools
went up for examination and 42, or 97J
per cent, passed. Let me say too that this
is flot an isolated or exceptional case, for
like resuits are obtained by nearly every
other separate school in the province, and
London's separate schools employ enly
ntuns as teachers.
Catholic people are told aise that they
must have ne religîous emblems in the
sohools, because the law wvill flot permit
it. The inspector may not deal harshly
writh the conditions as he finds them. He
may tolerate these practices, but if se he is
flot doing bis duty as an officer of the law.
Catholics feel deeply on this matter. The
scnse of wrong cuts as with a sword. I
ar, sure many of my non-Catholic friends
de not fully realize the depth of the wreng
inflicted upon their Cathobli neigh-bours.
Yes, Catholics feel aggrieved and abundant
reason have they to Eo feel. Their faith is
dearer to Vhem than aught else. The little
catechism they place in the hands of their
children is a classie. It is not much te
look at, but within the covers of that smal

Hon. Mr. WATSON-[ wish to inake
a few general observations at this stage.
In the first place I arn very sorry that the
school question has been introduced in this
debate in the speech of the hon. gentleman
from London. 1 had hoped that the Manitoba school question w~as settled a number
of years ago. I was -rather pleased when
'botli sides in the other chamber conceded
that a settiement had beten made anid could
not be changed. I arn inciined to think
those gentlemen who made that settiernent
have sized up the situation very accurately
as far as Manitoba is concerned. 1 do not
think they should exist, or Nvould exist
there were it not for the fact that hiaif a
dozen men keep the agitation alive in order
to keep themselves before the public.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Oh, no.
Hon. Mr.-WATSON-I corne frorn that
province and think I know what I arn talking about, and 1 say with reference to the
school settiement which was made in 1897
between the Man.itoba and federal government, that if ail parties were favouTable
to carrying it out in its entirety, no such
Ion. Mr. COFFEY.
H

conditions as have been portrayed hy the
hion, gentleman from London would exist.
One thing Manitoba bas decided upon is
that, so far as the state is concerned, every
child in the province shall have a secular
education to fit him for the duties of this
if e. They permit of relîgious instruction
boe.ing held in the public school between
haîf past three and four. They carne to that
conclusion because it was found that portions of the population were growing up illiterate because qua]ifled teachers could
flot be found to teach pupils in schools
that were drawing grants from the province.
I do not think any religious body should
find fauît with a school law that permnits
thern to have religious instruction between
ha]! past three and four, one-haîf hour a
day, and these provisions are made in that
Act. From the onslaught that was made
on the Manitoba governnient and the Manitoba school law by my hon. friend, I arn
sure if sorne of the hon. members of this
House had been irnpressed by the statements made by him, they must have forgotten the conditions of that settlemenýt.
The conditions are that where there is a
minority, be they Catholic or Protestant,
they have certain rights in the school. Any
religious denornination can withdraw when
the religious exercises o! any other denomination are being held.
That freedom ia
give n. There is no objection to Catholic
te'achers. They can be employed so long
as t.hey ar,- qualified. So that I think Jh
together, if the people ivere agreeable to
go aiong the lines of the school law o!
Manitoba, there should not be any complaint of insufficiert time to give instrucC:ons to children in their rnother's faith.
The extension o! the boundaries of Manitoba has been a very live question in that
province for a great number of years. A
number o! years ago we agitated to have
the boundaries extend further west than
the present boundaries. When the provinice
was first formed it went only to range 13,
west of the first meridian.
After that it
was extended to range 29, west of the first
meridian. The province bas been known in
that large area of country in the northwest
as the postage stamp province. The agitation was created to extend the boundary
west of range 29 to Regina or Moosejaw.

MARCH 18, 1912
That mas objected Vo by the people resident in that district wesV of range 29. Their
dlaim was that Manitoba had a very heavy
debt, and they did noV wish to be -attached to it. They preferred to throwv in their
lot with Saskatchewan. Consequently the
boundary was not extended west, because
the people living there objected to be Vaken
in. Then an agitation arose as to the
boundaries o! the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. A Bill was passed in
1905 giving "autonomy to those provinces.
WVhen that was done, Manitoba naturally
wished Vo extend the boundaries, but the
difficulties. in doing that have been explaincd, inasmuch as the province of Manitoba
wished to geV the samne area, as nearly as
possible, as the provinces of Saskatchewan
and Alberta, about two hundred and fl!ty
thousand square miles. To do thiat, a part
of the hinterland of the province o! Ontario
would have to be given Vo the province of
Manitoba. There is also the difllculty explained by the member for Saskatchewan,
that the portion o! the hinterland north of
Manitoba vwas under the control and jurisdiction of Saskatchewan, or the Northwest
Territories.
Hon. Mr. POWVER-It had been.
Hon. Mr. WVATSON-It was at the time
of the formation of the two provinces. At
that particular time that te.rritory ivas a
,portion o! Khe Northwest Territories and
under the Northwest Territories government; and those people, as lias been stated
hy the memiber from Saskatchewan, felt
that they had a jus.t dlaim to have a choice«
a% Vo location. They did by petition, as
stated by the hion, gentleman express preference Vo remain in Vue 'Nortliwest Territc-ries as they had been for a number of
years. However, the government and tha
members for Manitoba, I might. say, using
their influence withi the government,
claimed that as far as the hinterland o!
Manitoba was concerned, that particular
portion o! the territories should belong to
Manitoba or should noV belong to Saskcatchewan, and should belong Vo Manitoba when
the Manitoba boundaries were extended.
That prevailed, and the result was that
the western boundary of the province o!
Manitoba was extended north and that

formed the eastern boundary of the province
o! Saskatchewan. At that tiine, as has been
stated by the hion. gentleman from Prince
Albert, Saskatchewan claimed that they
ought to have acces to Hudson baytliey ought to hiave a port at Churchill
However, the governnment did not see fit to
aceede to their request, and extended the
b undary up to the northern boundary of
the province of Saskatchewan as formed
now, leaving ail this territory vacant for the
purpose of ext-ending- the province of Manitçpba. Then the question came up as to
the boundary between Ontario and Quebec,
and to give Manitoba an equal mileage
with Saskachewan and Alberta it was
found that they would eîther have to
extend the boundaries of Manitoba eastup
that territory.

Ontario objected to the taking" of any portion of old Ontario. IV vas finally decided
by the government o! the day Vo extèend
the boundaries in a north-easterly direction
£rom the north-easterly bounda'ry O! Manitoba to Hudson bay, making the provincial areà practically equal to the area af
Saskatchewan or Alberta. That vas passed
in 1908 by resolution of the House of Gommons, and transmitte-d to the Manitoba
government, but they did noV see fit to acc ept that boundary until March, 1911. They
claimed that the government should state
the financial ternis a~long with the boundary. It was contended by the governm1ent
of the day that the financial terms would
be a matter for a conference. IV was not
starting a new province. Manitoba had her
swamp lands and univers1ty lands, and
had an allowance on account of public
lands. Mr. ]Roblin wanted to have a grievance against his political opponents for a
purpose. and it hias been mnade ai football
f rom that tine Vo the present. The very
boundaries proposed by the government in
1908 were accepted in 1911, and these are
the exact boundaries as laid down in the
present Bill, with this exception, that there
is a proviso which altlows the province of
Ontario to have a right o! way to Port Nelson or Fort Churchill, for the purpose of
building a railway. That seema to me to
be the most childish proposition ever submitted to parliament. IV is simply juggling for political effect. We might as wel
ask that wc should have a strip five miles

SENATE
in width from Manitoba down te Fort William over which we send neaTly ail the
freight of the northwe.st provinces. 1 had
not a great deal of sympathy with my hon.
friend when he asked for a port at Fort
William. 0f course, when you speak of a
townsite, or valuable property, that is a
different thing, but a port for shipping
purposes ma-kes no difference to a province
eo long as it is iu Canada. This provision
is merely given as a sop te the goverument
of Ontario. I suppose they have demanded
the price, and the government say we are
going te give you anything you ask. Ontario said: 'We are determined to have a
port on the Hudson bay,' and the government say, *'we will give you a strîp five
miles iii width from the eastern boundary
of Manitoba up to Port Nelson, and if
that is not the port selected, then a @trip
of land 200 feet iu width up to Fort Churchill.' Now, as has been stated by the hon.
memnber for Saskatchewan, the province of
Ontario have five years te miake that selection. They are not required te build a
railway, but they get possession of the
land, which is under the jurisdiction of
the province of Manitoba, and Manitoba
bas got te bear the expense of administering the law over that five mile strip although Ontario owns it. The province of
Ontario can take that strip aiong the shores

days ago to lay before this House the correspondence between the federal govern-ment and the Manitoba government. I
was waiting for the production of tHiose
documents in order to be in a position to
be able to say a few words on this question. Those documents not having been
produced, I think that the hon, leader of
this House wil consent to postpone the
discussdon tii] vvmiorrow?
Hon. Mr. KERR-Before that, perhaps
the hon. gentleman wiil tell me upon what
principle it was that, in this distribution
of land, the district or territory known as
Ungava was given to the province of Quebec. I understand it was on the principie
that it was the hinterland, the land iying
north of the province, and on that accounit
should belong to the province of Quebec.
If so, why then was land whîch iay nortli
of the province of Ontario flot given to
that province? Why was this tangent line
drawn from the tweith range in the province of Manitoba on its teastern boundary
over towards the coast of HudËon bay, and
the land north of that tangent uine taken
from the province of Ontario, and given
to the province o! Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That subject
might be discussed more advantageousiy
when the Quebec and Ontario Bis corne
down, which I expect wili be some tinie
this week; but I might say it was for t.he
purpose of equaiizing the territory o! Manitoba, and also, I have no doubt, for the
purpose o! including the harbour at Nelson. The eastern boundary running in a
north-easteriy direction, striking the shore
of Hudson bay, equalizes the territory so
as to place the three provinces territorily
on an equality wvith eachi other. Now the
mileage of Aiberta is 253,000 square miles;
that of Saskatchewan 250,000 square miles;
that of Manitoba 251,832-an equai±y
about as close as can be approached'.
Hon. Mr. KERR-But I do not t4iink
that quite meets the point 1 want to understand. If that land belonged equitably
where it has been given I could then
understand that you might draw your uine
where you liked about it; but the land
north of Manitoba is given to Manitoba as
belonging to that province, and, if that

principie is right, then the land north of
the tangent uine of which. I speak, clear
to the shores of Hudson bay, wouid belong
to the province of Ontario. The eastern
line of Manitoba is a paraliel of longitude.
Ail east of that line belongs moraliy and
equitabiy to the province of Ontario.

Hon. Mr. KERR-No, flot north of Hudson bay; between Hudson bay and the oid

the province of Manitoba. The province of
Ontario to-day extends to the line of Manitoba. Now, ail the land north of that is
Keewatin.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes.
Hon. Mr. KERR---That part of Keewatin
that lies north of the province of Ontario
equitabiy belongs to Ontario. By many
person the reason su,-gested is because
they wanted to give access to Manitoba by
way of a harbour or harbours. That does
not necessariiy cover the matter, it seems
to me, because if the land 'Was given to
the province of Ontario, then a roadway
ten miles wide which, is talked of, but
which is not contained in this Act, might
have been given to the province o! Manitoba over lands belonging to the province o! Ontario, and so give Manitoba,
all Manitoba then, acceSS t'O ports on
Hudson bay. In other words, they woul
have got to Hudson bay over a right-ofway instead of Ontario aoifla there by a
right-of-way through Manitoba, but the
land and, ail that goes with the land wvould
hiave become vested in Ontario, and it
seems to me, on the principie on which this
has always been administered, and which
is recognized in this very division north of
Manitcha, that ail such territory should
be given to Ontario.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Do I understand
the hon. gentleman to refer to part of the
land now within the proposed extended
boundaries of'Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. KERR-Yes.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It is quite logical
that the boundaries o! Manitoba should be

extended to Hudson bay, embracing that
part of the territory between Hudson bay
siLd the oki northern boundary, so as te
give it the amount of territory possessed by
the other two provinces.
Hon. Mr. KERR-How does it give it the
amount of territory?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It is a matter
*of distribution by the g3vernment owning
the land.

it the right of way through that territory
in the same fashion you are doing now
-with Ontario?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It is a matter
for this government to exercise its jurisdic-tion as to the transfer to any particular
-province. 0f course we cannot all have
-the same conception of what constitutes
equity, but it is manife.stly fair that Manitoba should be placed territorially upon an
*equality with the other two provinces, and
it is. only lu that way it can be done.
The SPEAKER-Hon. gentlemen are for-gctting that we are not in committee.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-This matter
rnight. be discussed when the other boundaries Bis cornes down.
Hon. Mr. POWER-My view about this
matter is perhaps a littie different lrom the
views expressed by some other bion. genilemen. It is contended on behaîf of the
-province of Manitoba that Ontario should

have more than she has* got. It is contended on the part of Manitoba that Manitoba should have more than she has got,
and now we have the claim put in by Saskatchewan that she la entitled to quite an
important consideration in this arrangement. «With respect to the province of
Saskatchewan, I do not think that the hon.
gentleman from Saskatchewan has put the
case f rom a judicial stan.dpoint, if I may use
The. hou, gentleman
that expression.
&la;ms that because in old times, before
1905, when there was what wvas called the
Northwest Territories, which territories had
a legislature that met at'Regina, the Northw~est Territories were divided irit-o four terr;tories, and a portion of Saskatchewan rau
castward to the north of the existing
province o! Manitoba. Saskatchewan had
an unquestionable dlaim to be concidered now lu connection with the proposed extension of the boundaries o! Manitobai; but the hon. gentleman leaves out
of sight altogether the fact that varjous
things have happened since then. In the
first place. the old Northwest Territories
were practically done away with. The new
province o! Saskatchewan comprises a large
portion, the greater portion of what was
then the territory of Assiniboia. It contains the greater portion o! -what was then
the territory of Saskatchewan. It contains
a t.onsiderable portion o! what was then the
territory o! Arthabaska, and in 1905, 'when
the new iprovince o! Saskatchewan was const.ituted out of the oid Northwest Territories,
what had gone before was .practically
wiped out. As far as I remember, I did nlot
pay any very particular attention to the
expressions of feeling o! the representatives
o! Saskatchewan and Alberta at that, Urne,
liit 1 do not remeruber that there was any
serious complaint made, in this Chamber at
any rate, - lvth respect to the boundauries then given to the- province of
Saskatchewan. I think now it is to
be regretted that when the new bounand Alberta

darnes
were constituted lu 1905, the boundaries
o! the old province of Manitoba had nlot
been extended to the 60th parallel of latitude. I think it ivould have been better

people could corne under the law, and the
people who should so alter the law are the
legisiators of Manitoba. The present Minister of the Interior is anxious that peace
should reign throughout the Dominion, and
1 think he ùnd his leader should have
sufficient influence with the present government of Manitoba to induce them to take
the steps necessary to rernove the grievances which the rninority now complain of,
and the whole thing could be done by a
very simple Bill, and that would end the
business altogether. I feel, lion. gentlcmen, that the school question is one which
is better not in politics, and I feel that
now when the Dominion government and
lodal government of Manitoba are in cordial sympathy, there is an opportunity to
take that question out of politics for good
and ail. It is a bad thing for the whole
country-bad for the government, and in
my humble opinion, bad for the opposition.
It is not the sort of question we should
be tigtiting about, and 1 trust that when
another session cornes around the hon.
leader of this H:ouse will be in a position
to corne down and tell us that, owing tô the
tact and judgrnent shown by botti parties,
by the governrnent o! Manitoba and the
federal governrnent, this question has been
ultirnately and finally rernoved, frorn the
sphere of politics.
The rnotion was agreed to and the debate*
wvas adjourned.
THE GRAIN B3ILL.
SECOND READING.
lion. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of Bill (32) An Act respecting
grain.
He said: It is not necessary for me to
enter upon any lengthy explanation of
what is known as the Grain Act. We spent
a very considerable part of last session in
dealing with this very important Bill. It
was senf to a select cornrittee, and that
cornrnittee gave the closest possible attention to the preparation of the Bill, which
afterwards went down to the Cornrons.
That Bill has been very large]y, if not
altogether, accepted by the Commons, s0
that upon its return to us this session, very
few important ainendments will appear.

True there have been a nurnber of miner
arnendrnents made, but when we corne to
discuss it before cornrittee, it wilI be observed that probably the principal arnendment to the Bill will be found in section
57, which deals with the establishment of
a sample rnarket. Then there is another
section, 207, dealing with car distribution,
which is a departure from the Bill of last
session.
Hon. gentlemen are doubtless familiar
with these particular sections, inasmuch
as they received sorne lengthy discussion
a.nd consideration at our hands during the
present session. Certain arnendrnents were
trought in involving discussion which wiil
only be repeated when we corne to con,ider these particular sections. With
Ihese two amendments I rnay say that the
Bill is substantially, barring certain details and particulars, wbich do not affect
the question of policy, the same Bill which
we passed hast session of parliarnent. Without occupying your valuable time at this
late hour of the niglit, I propose moving
the second reading with the view of its
reaching the cornrittee stage, when' we
can enter into details more fully than at
this time.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-I do net wish to
de1ay the House by discussing this measure. I agree with the hon. gentleman
that this. is practically the saine Bill that
vas so well considered by the Senate during last session. It went over te the House
of Commons a.nd they have made sorne haif
dozen changes which I do net think are
miner. They have reialhy chatnged the
whole principle of the Bill. In one pa-rticular, with regard to car distribution,
they have made material changes.
The
sample mnarket is entirely a new feature
and pernits rnixing, and that was neyer
contemplated in the Grain Act. I received a communication to-day frorn flh
executive of the Grain Growers o! Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan, complaining about some changes that have been
made in this Bill in the House o! Gommons, and they ask that the Senate should
take some action, paTticuharly with reference to the two arnendments. They consider them of such importance that they

aTe willing to sacrifice the whole of the
Bill rather than submit to these two amnendments. 1 would suggest that, as these
gentlemen will be here this evening or toinorrow, they ahouid be given aome opportunity of laying their views before the
Senate. I do not know whether you want
to refer this Bill to a conimittea or- not,
but I do think that, as this Bill is for th3
purpose of dealing withi the commodities
of the farmers of the Northwest, they
-should be considered. This Bill is flot intreduced by the goverument for the purpose of facilitating trade; it is for the purpose of protecting the Northwest farmers
-and their representatives shoulId be heard
Lefore the Bill is finally deait with.
H-on. Mr. DAVIS-When this measure
was first submitted to the House it ivas
very nearly a copy of the Bill that w*as put
through the Senate last year, and which
went to the House of Commons. On ac-count of the dissolution it d-id flot become
]aw, and the present Minister of Trade
and Commerce took it up and, after con.sulting with the farmers, practically introduced the old Bil. After the Bill was
printed the governiment must have had
;some other representations made to it,
.and amendments have been introduced.
As the Bill stands to-day it is simply a
farce to present it to this House or to the
House of Commons. Ail you have to do is
to draft the Bill providing for the appoint-ment o! a grain commission, define their
duties and fix their salaries. Ail the prinýciPles the farmers have heen fighting for
years to secure have been taken away irom
tihem by this Bill. For years they have been
ýfighting for the distribution of cars, and they
have sernt their delegates down here to
lace the railwvay compauies, and at hast
they got a Jittie freedoin, but this Bill
takes it away from theum.

serious thing for the farmer, bccause it

a matter of fact, the four companies belong

his grain to the market himself, but if hie

of the cars granted them by legisiation, if

hig-hest price they could get.
By placing

appraisers at the different ports; they commence at $1,2W0 and the maximum is
$2,200. Those who know anything ef the
working of the Customs Department know
that the most important officers, more particularly at the larger ports, are the appraisers. They deal with almost every item that
is imported into the country, and they
ought to be men of superior ability and
talent and practical knowledge; consequently, in making the selection to fill
those offices, they shouid be made fromn

ion. Mr. KERR-WVe are cetting- into
an inconvenient practice in this case.
The Bill sixnply providesz that certain persons wvho are flot nowv iii the civil service
can be placed on the civil service list on
a certain status. The fact that this Bill may
give thern the riglit to be paid eut of the
treasurv does flot make this a money Bill.
.1 hope the Speaker ivili understand 1 amn
speaking- witli ail deference. I siniply desire ta say thiat I do flot think il follows,
that it mnust necessarilv be a mone '%Bill
because the Bill w-as founded upon a reselutien that has been introduced.
In other words that a Bill founded on a
resolution mnust necessarilv be a money
Bill. Hon. gentlemen will see what will happen. For the purpese af preventing a
change or to prevent the Senate dealing
with it at al, it might be founded on a
resolution. and that would in effect cut out
the jurisdiction of the Senate te deal with
it aecordin.- ta that, rule. It seerns ta me,
therefore, that this xnight be open ve-ry ivell
for furthier consideration. because we must
look at the Bill to see whether it is actual!a rnoney Bill. If this Bill had provided
that certain persans should be paid a certain surn of mioney, that would be one
thing, but it is quite another matter ta say
that persons w-ho are in the public service
and in receipt of salaries now, are te be
entitled te be jilaced uponi the civil service
iist o! a certain status is necessariiy a
money Bill. It strikes nie that it is openi te
a good deal more consideration t.han we
have been giving it as yet, and I would
like, before we pass the Bill, to have an
oppertunity of dîscussing- it again.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It seems ta me,
out of courtesy to the other House. whien a
Bill cornes down preceded by a resolution
of the House, wve are bound, out of courtesy

ta the Ccommons, ta accept it as a maney
Bill. To assume otherTwise would be to
presuppose that the presiding officer of the
House of Commens would be a party to an
attempt to deceive this House, with a view
te lead us ta believe a Bill is a money Bill
which really was net. We can scarce]y
assume the Hause ai Commons, in the
first place, and the Speaker, in the second
place, would resort ta that formn of evasion
for the purpose af securing any advantage
ta whichi they wauld net he entitled by
hampering the Senate in passing upon such
a measure. With reference ta the period af
tiane rnentioned in the Bill, I wvould regard
that as one of the terms of the hiring, so ta
speak, and it seerns te me it is geTrrane ta
the paymient of the money itself. It is one
ai those terns, and if we can alter a terni,
ai payment, which is ai the essence ai the
contract, it seerns ta me w'e can arnend anix
maney Bill so long as we keelp aur hiands
off the actual arnount inentioned. Howvever, 1 defer ta the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-The matter ef
the Bill itself is not o! sufficient importance, for myself at ail events, ta decide ta
challenge the decisian ai hisa hanour the
Speaker, and I let the matter rest there, al1theugh I wouid not like that it shouid be
cited as a precedent some day when we
would feel like geing mare deeply inta the

certain universities should be nmemd in the

and discrimination is practised. The rates
are flot fair Vo the different parts of his
own province and to the province of Nova
Scotia. l'ne fact that the Intercoloiiial
railway was built to bind confederation together should lie no reason for allowing
them Vo make rates that are unjust and
that discriminate.
l7ion. Mr. UtHOQUErT'E-For trie reason
given by the hion. gentleman wiio lias just
sat down, 1 wish te, say a f ew words on this
question. The lion. memiber from ilalifax
<Hon. Mr. Roche) said the mnanufacturing
industries in his province would be ruined
if the tariff of rates on this railway were
put under the control of the Hailway Conimiîssion. That, I tnink, was the best proof
that discrimination in rates. is practised
on this railway. 1 amn told tlîat some
parties get rates, that are only a third of
wliat other people have Vo pay. i knoiv
that la Quebc we have been asking for a
uniform tariff on the Intercolonia1 railwvay
for sorte time, and I have been given examples of the discrimination prevailing in
the rates between the different cities in the
provinces on goods carried both east and
west. Why shouid the people in thie maritime provinces be favoured in tnie matter
of rates on this railway ? In my opinion,
thie tariff of rates on this road should be
put in the hands of trie Railway Commission.
lion. Nlr. Bi•IQUE-\When this anatter

suggested to trie lion. mnember trom Da
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) that

from the Board of irade of Montreal a
statement whichi gives in detail cases
wlîere, t0 their knowledge, discrimination
iii rates is practised. As far as 1 arn concerned, 1 amn satisfied witli that report,
w-hich shows tIîat there is ground for coinplaint ag-ainst that railway. One of the

sion was to prevent that state of things,
and 1 think it is neither fair to the publie,
for to the railways, nor to the different
localities, to allow a government railway
to follow rules which cannot be followed
by other railway conipanies that are in
conîpetition with that railway company.
One locality should flot be treated differently froma another. For these reasons
1 propose to support the motion.
Hon. Mr. THULMPSON-While 1 live in the
maritime provinces, 1 do not reside on the
line of the Intercolonial railway, so that any
views I may have with respect to the road
would not be of a personal character. I do
flot think the presentation of Vhis matter

whjch you can p'ace your finger or) iii respect to discrimination on the Intercolonili railway as it runs through the maritime
provinces, as compared with the ireight
rates on the other railway systems that go
through the samýe provinces. The hon. gentleman from Gananoque, who liais shipped
a great quantity of goods over many roads
to different portions of the maritime provinces, said the ohter day, in the discussion,
that there was no grievance as far as he
kiiew, and that there were no discrinîinating
rat( s as between terminal points. But Vhis
Heus'e mlust remember that the Intercolonial
forlows the coast line, and that they compete with vessel trade. IV would be a question whether the Intercolonial railway
should not carry lower on that coast lne
than, perhaps, the Canadiaýn Pacific railway would carry it in the centre of the
province, because of the competition of
vessels at alinost every station.

of the Railway Commission. The only evidence we have before this House, and upon
which we are asked to determine by a
vote that the Intercolonial should be placed
under the Railway Commission, is this
memorial froni the Board of Trade of Montreal, which represents a disgruntled shipper; but they do not themselves take the
responsibility of saying that these grievan,ces exist. They say: 'We are inforined.'
Before this House acts definitely in -respect
to a matter which can be deait with by the
other brandli of parliament very much better than by the Senate, and whose advice
naturally -,%ould be taken with respect to
these matters in preference to the advice of
tie Senate, so far as the Railway Department is concerned, because the Mîinister of
]Raîlways is a nieniber of that branch of
parliament, we should have definite informnation. We Should be able to say that
such and sucb is the case. There is not in
this case anything more than a pinhead
grievance. The inatter has not been placed
before this House in such a manner that
a member can exercise real sound judg-ment in voting on this motion.
Hon. Mr. BELL-Tliere bias always been
a, tendency, in dealing wjth matters in relation to the Intercolonial railway in. parliament, to regard it as a property that wab
built entirelv for the benefit of the maritime provinces. I know that is the case in
the other Chamiber, and I think it is the
case here to a considerable -extent, and in
the west also. That is a great mistake.
The Intercdloiiial raiiw.ay lias undoubtedly
been of great. importànce to the people of
the maritime provinces, but it has been
,of even greater importance to the people
of Quebec and Ontario and, thougi not to
such an extent, to the -western provinces,
Lut certainly it lias been to the great merchants of Quebec and Ontario. One of
the results that was feared in the east at
the tinte of contederation was that the bus'iness of merchants in the maritime provinces would be interfered with as a resuit
of confederation. That was realized, and
I think almost ail, or a great many business men in Ontario and Montreal, will
admit that the one best market they have
is the maritime provinces. That lias aiways been the case and is the case to-dity.

555

The resuit of confederation was to transler the wholesale business that had forimer'Iy existed in the maritime provinces, to
?NiontreaJ, Toronto and other western ports,
so that to argue that ail the advantages derived from. the Intercolonial railway are
derived by the people of the maritime
provinces ia absolutely incorrect. The most
tijat can be said ie that it is a mutual advantage, and if any loas were incurred in
the management of the Intercolonial railway, it should.ble -made good by the people
of the country. It is not for the maritime provinces alone, but quite as much
for the benefit of the people of the 'larger
provinces, Ontario and Quehec.
Hon.

Mr. POIRIER-Very much more.

Hon. Mr. BELL-The fact of the matter
is that they derive greater advantages. It
is now prop-osed to take a vote on this
question and to commit this Senate to a.
proposition of this kind when it is manitest that we are absolutely without knowledge of the subject. WVhat do we senators
know about the details of this matter?
What do we know about the innumerable
small arguments that have induced the
management of the Intercolonial railway
tc make their rates what they are to-day?
We know nothing at ail, and when you
propose to pDlace the Intercolonial railway
in exactly the same position as a'il the
other business railroads of Canada, you
are undertaking to do something- which
should not be done, because the Intererolonial railway stands in a class alto-ether by itself. In the first place, the
Intercolonial railway was a palitical road,
built iii order to bring together the scattered provinces which went into confederatien. In the next place it is a politicWl
road because it had to be constructed over
a route which would be made as isecure as
possible fruim attack by the enemy, and
therefore it had to pursue a route whicli
would not be adopted by a line constructed
for purely commercial purposes. It was
built through a part of the country and
placed in 'sucli a position that it would be
n difficuit matter to make it psy. That is
nlot the fault of the maritime provinces,
or the fault of the people of Canada. The
consileration that had to be kept in view

SENATE
was to place that road where it would
serve the purpose of uniting thc provine.es
together, and where if could be kept as
secure as possible fram any chance of attack.
Now, what is the resuit? The resuit is
that in the Intercolonial railway we have
a line with two productive ends and a
non-productive middle. So far as the maritime provinces are concerneci, they supply a
business to the Intercolonial railway which
makies it a very profitable road; but there
is a long haut across the province of Quebec through an undeve&oped country, which
is a tax, and always ivili be a tax upon the
resources of the road, preventing it froin
becoming a money making 'Une. WNe have
had two increases iii fte rates upon the
Intercolonial w'ithin the last, ten years, and
the people of the maritime provinces are
now, I think, paying enough for the freight
that ia being- carried for thiei on that line
of railway. They are not favoured; they
do flot consider fhemselves favoured; and
they do flot see any reason why they
should. be compelled to pay excessive rates
in order to inake up a loss that is due f0,
another part of the system. The centre of
the system was flot placed where if is at
their suggestion; the location of the line
where it exists to-day wvas regarded at that
time as a political necessity. Another important fact was poinfed out'by the hon
member who spoke last; at almost every
point in the whole leng-th of the Int-ercoloniial railway it is in campetition with
water carniage. Well, it may be said, if that
is the case the Railway Commission would
take those fhings into cansideration. I
presume fhey would; necessarily they
would have to takie theni into account; and
the chances are that if they did they would
find it quife impossible to apply the ordinary taniff, and the ordinary regulafions to
the operation of that road. There are points
whcre water carriac«e makzes such sfrong
compefition that you must adapt lower rates
or go without business. Then ag-ain, there
are considerat ions which probably induce
the management to makze different rates hatween the east and the west on that line.
For a very long time ia the hisfory of the
Inforcoloiîial railwvay if was simply a means
of carrying manufactures, flour and supplies
of varions kinds f0 the maritime provinces.
Hon. Mr. BELL.

Year after year the cars of that road had to
corne back west emipfy because there were
no f.reighits for fhem; and what would be
more natural, or more necessary, than that
the railway management should endeavour, by lowering their rates wesfward, ta
secure in some way freight for their cars?
They have done thaf, they have been compelled to do that. They have made all sorts
of efforts to make that road profitable by
securing freights for the cars coming west.
They have gone to the expense of filling box
cars wifh coal and cleaning those cars ouf
at the end of their journey in order to get
sanie freight west; and in that way, and in
thaf way alone, they could hope to get
sanie business. We cannot pronounce judgment satisfactorily or safely at a mornenf's
notice here upen those matters. We would
require to he put in the saine position as
the board of management, of the Intercolonial railway, or of the traffle manager.
]!robably if xve had fume enough to spend
with him we cou-Id see the -reasons w-hy the
tariff rates on the Infercolonial railway are
what they are to-day.
The principal grievance seems to be in
the city of Montreal. No one else is here
pefitioning with reference to this matter.
Montreal is a very important centre, yet 1
do not think we are warranted in taking
hasfy action upon representations caming
from a place even as important as «Monfreal, unless if is supporfed by the rest of
the communify. What do these complaints
amount to P They say they hav e to pay
a higher freight rate sending goods one vay
thi4n fhey pay sending thema the other.
If there is a higher rate frorm Montreal,
the people in the maritime provinces have
ta pay it. If there were discrimination on
the freight going east between Toronto and
Montreal, there mighf be saine ground for
complaint, but if the people who are s.hipping froin the wesf to the east get the
saine rate, then there is fia hardship at ail.
The freight rates bave fa be pnid by the
people of the maritime provinces and not
by the merchants who make out the bills
of lading and sbip the goods. 1 have not
had anything presenfed f0 me showineg that
they are su-bject to unfair compefition.

VN are asked to interpose between the

ineasure, then it mnust be a measure that
undertakes to dictate to the government
as to the inanner in whichi the Intercolonial
raiiway is to be controlleat. It would be
an idie thing for us to invite a rebufi by
undertaking to take a sîîap vote on a resolution of this kind, instructing the government of Canada that it should give up the
control o! the Intercolonial railway and
pass it over to the Railway Commission.
What was done by the government o! Sir
%Vilfrid Laurier when the Railway Commission was formed P The Intercolonial railway was deliberately excluded from the
operation of that commission. It has neyer
yet been placed under its control, and if at
any timie it should be considered necessary
to place the Intercolonial raîlway under the
coutrol of thec Railway Commiission, then
it is for tlie government to do se. WVe are
not being treated !airly in this inatter, and
1 waut to protest against any idea thiat
the people of thec maritime provinces have
been exceptionally deait withi as far as the
Intercolonial railway is concernced.
They
have paid ample rates. It was ilot constructed specitilly for thein. it was constructed for the general advantale of Canada at that date, and we shou]d relieve

Railway Bloard. That railway was also buit
under an agrecment-an agreement with
jBritish Columbia when it came into conI fEderation. That argument, therefore, fais
absolutely to the ground. 1 have no secrional feeling, and have nothing against

they object to a condition by whicli every

,,ay every credit is due to Mr. Pottinger.
He hias bad to steer a course between the
different governments and hias done well,
but he has been handicapped right along by
political and other influences. The rates
on the Intereolonial railway are not low.
I might quote the case of cor.dwood, the
rates on which are prohibitive on that road
to-day. Cordwood is a great source of revenue to the faTmers, and the reason cordwood cannot be shipped on the Intercolonial railway is because the rates are too
high. I agree with the hion. member for
Pictou; I think he is perfectly right. We
do not use the Intercolonia1 railway at
St. John; we use the Canadian Pacifie rail'xay, and will continue to clo so. Ships
are loading an.d unloading tiiere, but the
goods are not shipped on the Intercolonial
railway. My friend referred to the coinmission and said that they should have
but one object in view. 1 might join hini
in that, but 1 mig-ht flot vote for his motion. I think arbitrary conditions on the
Intercolonial railway should be wiped out,
but if arbitrary conditions are imposed,
then we should hold the government responsible. Talle the commission we have today; 1 do flot know how many private cars
they have not got to take their families
around, and that ail goes to the debit side
of the account, and you cannot get any
satisfaction out of them, because you have
placed in their bauds on arbitrary power
to do whatever they like without aux ap.
peal. I do flot wisb to make a statemient
that I cannot substantiate, but I thinik some
statements might be made that would open
the eyes of this honourable House and the
country with regard to the management of
that road. I arn not talking of any particular party. If I were talking I should
say it was withini the last ten years, but
I arn not talking as a partisan, I amn talking as a New Brunswicker, and I protest
against the railway being throwni in our
teeth ail the time. It is a good asset. The
government were offered tbree or four per

and I presume tbey will do justice to New

by my hon. friend and others as to the best

that. I cannot join with my hion. friends
w~ho find so much fault witb the Intercoloalai railway. It is a good railway; it has
a beautiful roadbed; there is plenty of
work; and what we want is not to milk that

tiie correspondence that passed 'between
the varions boards of Trade and tne Minister of Railways, flot only uluer this government, but under the late government.
Memorials were presented to the flon. Mr.
Grahiam, and othier memiorials have been
forwarded te Hon. Frank C3ochrane,, the
present Alimster of Railways, stating
reasons why the Intercolonial railway
should be placed on the sanie footing as
other roads. One of the main objects was
to give the people of' Uic maritime provinces, and of Quebec, through whichi that
railway runs, a tribunal to wtîich they can
appeal. As the lion. member froni Rotijesay (Hon. Mr. Doniville) said se iveli, there
are very often arbitrary rules on the Intercolonial railwvay from which there is nio
appeal; but under the Railway C.ommnission
the people in the provinces would have an
appeai to an impartial tribunal in order
to secure their righlts and redress.
lion. Mr. ]?OIRI.R-Those points 1
knew, and se far as they go they are al
riglit. 8o muchlihas been said about the
maritime provinces deriving almost the
entire benefit from the building of the Intercoloiial raii'way that I will ask my hon.
friends if the iboards of traie of St. John,
Moncton, Amherst and Sydney have been
consulted ? I ask this, not to put any
obstacle in the way, but in order to meove
slowly on a question that is possibly more
momentous than some of us mfry imagine.

I have my own reasons for saying that.
1 ask my hion. friend if those boards of
trade have been consulted.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN

I arn

net in a

poâtion to answer that.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER-While by no means
condemning a muove which, I believe, will
eventually crystallize, ni own impression
is that at this present moment it would
be preinature to vote this resolution and

1 know instances in rny own district
where anything but justice could be had
at the hands of the Railway Commission.
If is useless te mention those cases here,
but I wish they had been leit to the Intercolonial Railway Board, and 1 am sure the
decision could not have been any more
bjased or worse. The chances are ninety
out of a hundred that it would have been
more satisfactory. It being known to us
now that the interested parties in the maritime provinces have not been consulted,
à.nd coming back to the purposes for which
the Intercolonial railway was built, I say
that Ontario and Quebec derive a larger
benefit froni the building of the Intercolonia] railway than other provinces, just
-s the. western Provinces derive a greater
benefit from the building of the roada out
wcest than we in the east. The roads built
in the west are constructed for the whole
Dominion, but primarily the western people get the benefit. Ontario and Quebec
have rec-eived the greatest benefit froni the
building of the Intercolonial railway, because froni confederation-and it is stili
continued-they have shipped to us exportsa nd merchandise in the proportion
cf three te one in comparison with the
merchandise that we ship back to them.
I would ask my hion. frîend net te pres

And it seems to me that this Bïll is a
strong reflection cast by this government ou
the provinces, although they do flot aay
it in so many 'words. Practically they say
that they do not think that the-se provinces are going far enough, or doing sufficient towards the improvement of the
roads, and therefore they corne forward
with this Bill and propose that they should
take this power out of the hands of the
local authorîties. The province from which

1896 they had had a series of deficits, and
had experienced great difficulty in finding
nUoflCy to run the country. It is natural
to suppose that when they returned to
power they should say: ' What is the best
thing vie can do with this money that has
-a governcorne into our hands? 'Being
nment is a good governmnent.' 0Of course no
course they would flot take the view that
would have been taken by a government ni
favour of a low tariff, and try to remit
duties and thus lighten the taxation of the
people; but they say, « We are getting this
large sum of money into our hands; we
have been placed in a position where we
have large sums of money to deal with, and
-the best thiiùg that we can do is to turn
naround ând distribute this money, or hand
it over to the various provinces as best
we can in order to give them an opportunity of saying that t[îis Dominion government is a gaood goveruniient.' 0f course no
governmen±, and no individutal, can becorne popular in any part of the world
quicker than by distributing money; and
that appears to me to be one reason, at any
rate, why the government have brought
down this measure. The hon, leader of the
government stated in his speech that this
question of good roads liad been made one
of the principal planks of the Conservative
platform. Thiat may have been the case in
the east, but as far as the province o! British Columbia is conccrrned, I do not think
the question ivas ever mentioned. It certainly ivas -not in the upper part of that
province, whiere 1 liad an opportunity of
hearing a considerable number of speeches
made on both sides during the liste campaign. Therefore, I do not see that there
was anything on t-hat ground, to be said in
the way of urgent necessity for the governIt -%as
ment bringing down this Bill.

ýSome hion. GENTLEAIEN-Hieu r, liear.
lion. Mr. B0ý5T(WK-For a numiber of
years we have heard this cry of better
ternis for British Columbia, and î understand now that the government have under
consideration the question of a commission
to deal with this matter of better ternis.
They could not do better than apply their
power and consideration to the problemn o!
how they can meet this matter of taxation
in British Columbia and not let t11e proportion of taxation there be so heavy on
the people as it now is. In regard to the
co-operation between the provinces and tlie
Dominion, we have liad some experience
in British Columbia over this question in
the matter of fisliery riglits. l'o a certain
extent there is a joint jurisdiction over the
question of fishery regulations and, se fan
as my experience goes, 1 do not tlsînk that
co-operation of the Dominion government
and the provincial government in this matter has been nearly so unanimous as the
leader of the government may possibly
have led hion. gentlemen to think the other
day when hie talked about the Dominion
and the provincial governments coming together and co-operating so much better than
they did soon after contederation was
formed. I do not think this is a right way
to r-et about dealing wdih t-his question of
the roads. If the government Nvant to help
the building of roads throughout the proviuces, they eshould have found some means
of handing this money over to the provinces and allowing them to deal withi the
matter themselves. Dual control, and the
dual arrangements that have to be made,
the drawing up o! agreements betwveen the
Dominion and provincial governments,
would not, in my opinion, work out at al
satisfactorily, and I think the wvho1e matter should have been dealt with along constitutional liues and not in the way proposed in this Bill.

He neyer answered the question, but hie

had such an understanding.
In a caucus

Interior, fur the Nationaliste, or the Tories,

The twenty-twe
miembers ail informed
the
government
that they were
prepared te vote against the Bill, but after this
declaration only five voted against it, tbe
others supporting the governiment. If this
statement is true, these ministers and the
Roblin gevernmnent are deceiving the public. If it is net true, they obtained the
votes of the cQuebec members on false pretensQes and false representations. The only
way is to refer that Bill te a conference te
ascertain wvhat was
the understanding.
When asked if there wns an understanding,
the man wlio gave hjs word that they had

' That question is tee tliin,' -and hie -%ould

created fer the protection of minorities,
and it is very fortunate that the Senate
exists. I do flot care about the finaucial
part of the Bill, but there is a question of

is entirely oniitted froin the Bill.
It is
our duty te ascertain exactly the state of

It is the Protestants thernsel1ves who
asked dor the rights in Manitoba. because
at the tirne they thoughL that Manitoba
would be a French and Ca.tholic ipoeovince.
At that time the population was nearly ail
Catholic. There was a Catholic 'bishop
there and Catholie missionaries and it
was thought that it would be the samne as
the province of Quebec, and the minority
asked to be protected. Why should we
ha"ve to beg iiow to have our rights respected? I have heard it said that the opposition to separate schools is not because they
are Catholic schools, but because they are
not good schools. A few days ago 1 was told
to read the report of Dr. Merchant about the
Catholic separate schools in Ontario. 1
quite admit, hon. gentlemen, that there
are Catholic schools in poor centres that
niay not be up to the mark. We have
the samne thing in Quebec where we have
Protestant schools that are not any better, and only last week we had a report
from the inspector of these schools saying
that they were so bad that the Protestants
were sending their children to Catholie
schoëls. We must not judge by special cases.
I say that our schools in Quebec are juat
as. good as the Protestant schools, even
better. Hon. airs, I can give you exampies. Take the men who have studied in
these separate schools, and who are now
here or in the House of Commons.
Do they not speak eloquentl.y and well in
both languag-es? I n-as proud the other
day to hear two French Canadians in the
House standing up and receiving the attention of the whole House, and speaking
better than many of the English members
and these French members speaking in English. I arn pleased to see the saine thing in
this House. I do not say it for myseif, because I amn not a fluent speaker in the
English language, but 1 know%that other
French members in this bouse can speak
very fluently in English and these men
were educated in the separate schools by
the priests and friars. and they can stand
up in this bouse and show that they are
more educated than the Englishmen wl'ho
have been educated in Protestant schools.
I do not say that for the purpose of
boasting. but it is a fact. How many
Eng-lishmen can speak, in bothi !ang-uages?
Hon. Mfr. CHOQUETTE.

I was glad to hear the Postmaster General and the ex-Postmaster General liaving" a wordy war in the En2lish languare
and speaking better than many of the
English members of the House of Coinnions eau speak in English. 1 nierely sa%
these few words by way of digression in
order to defend the separate sehools. I
have been told that Ontario is spending
a great deal of money on public schools.
That may be truc, but why do they spend
so much money? Recause they have te
pay their teachers such high salaries. In
Ontario they have to pay big salaries in
the Protestant schools, whereas in Quebec our children are taught by the nuns,
priests and friars who educate the people
for love and practically do flot receive any
salary. An Englishi friend of mine told me
that they were spending two or three turnes
more in Ontario, for education, than w-e wvere
in Quebee. That may be true, but in the face
of what I have told you, as to the large
salaries paid the Ontario teachers, that is
not to be wondered at. The French rnernbers of this House are just as well educated and better educated than the English
inembers, and I might evýcn add that
it takes two or three times as much
money to educate an Englishman as
it does to educate a Frenchman, and
that is the reason it costs so much more

The SPEAKER-If the objection is

nîay lie suspended by a majority of the

the g-reatest possible consideration should

sections; surely it cannot bc said, or expected, that the sections which areoh

The order of the day being called:
Resunîinil tlie further acijournied debaie
on the notion for the second reading- of Bill
(115) an Act to provide for the extension of the bouiidarieS of the province of
Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-Hon. gentlemen,
Lt mnay not be amiss for nie to preface
what 1 amn about to say in support of the
amendment moved ýby my Lhon. friend
lromn Grandville (Hon. Mr. Choquette)
by giving the House the assurance that I
shall approachi the subject in a caliin .and
dispassionate inanner. in a spirit of fairplay and conciliation, and withi a desire
to .-ive full consideration to the rights,
the beliefs, the Scruples, and even tile prejudices of the parties intérested. 1 have
flot stopped to consider for one mioment
whether there is any party advantage in
fhis matter wlhatever, having reguard only
to the interests of the Dominion, of the
province of Manitoba and the territory of
Keewatin, as the 'v impress themselves on
my mind and on miy conscience. It is
well to recognize at once that this Bill is
in the nature o! an arreemlent; it is a bargaain, and in dealiizl withi bargains and
ag-reements it is always. well f0 bear iu
mind that it takes fwo parties to make a
bargain, -and finit if you wvant te arrive
at a just, fair and perinxent agreement,
proper consideration lias to 'be given to
ail the interests, te ail the parties concerned. Tliere should be nothing in an agreemient, especially ail agreement of this

kind, which would justify anybody, or any
party to it, in 'being- too insistent in havinz ail its o-wn way. There should be no
question lieraý for either side to insist upou
the paurid of flesh. If the Biih, or agreement, or bargain if you wvjl, is approached
in that spirit, it is quite evident to me,
as it nmust be quite evident to any parliainentarjan, that we will nlot 0-n'y flot solve
a difficuit question, but will bring about
more trouble for the future.
Now, I think it well that we should defille exaetly what are the constitutional
and legal relations between the D)ominion
of Canada and the parties interested. We
niust renlember that the territory of Keewatin forius part of the Doniinion of Can7
ada.
X% assumed jurisdiction over that
e
part of Canada, and because we assuiied
jiirisdiction and have exercised it for
years, that territory is part of the constituency of the Dominion of Canada. ln
assuniing jurisdietion we assumned a duty
towards, all the people inhlabiting that territory, and it is that duty which. we are
called upon to discharge in dealing with
this Bill. WVhen the question of extending the boundaries of Ontario, Quebec and
Manitoba arose, the government of Canada
were necessarily called upon to look at the
constitutional relations between the central goverrnient and the provincial goverimnents, and the territorial governiment
as welI.
Under the Act which governs
the matter, that is the amnendment to the
British North America Act, 1871, parliament *could have done. in reference to this
lerritory, one of three things-continue to
admninister the territory by giving it. snch
a-1ditional authority as the developmient of
the prerent day requiremnents need, org"anize it into a province by itseli, or, thirdly. annex if, or part of Lt., to Manitoha or
to -«nll otiier province.
These are tie
t1hree things whielh the parliamient, of the
day have to consider in dealing withi this
mleasuire.
The low -hich governs the
miatter is quite clear.
Parliament lias to
administer that Iaw as it is found. With
ieference to, these tlîree alternatives, there
is realy only one of themn which is obliýgatory on this parliament, and that is the
one to whicli I have already referred, that
is, the dutv to continue to administer that
territory. The other two, to create this ter-

to the contrary.
But in order to annex that territory, the
whiole thing must be the subject of an
agreement, or a bargain, and we must not
lose sight of that. This agreement and its
termis should be acceptable, in s0 far as
possible, flot only to the people of Canada
at large, but to the people of Manitoba, and
to the people living in the territories, and
I might point out that, in seeking to make
that agreement to-day, there is upon Canada particularly the duty to see that its
own constituents who live in that terrîtory
of Keewatin, and their rights, whatever
they may be, are properly protected. If
an agreement with Manitoba cannot be
made satisfacLory to Manitoba and also
satisfactory to our own constituents in the
territory of Keewatin, then there is nothing
else for this parliament to do but to continue to administer the territory of Keewatin under the law as it stands to-day,
and w-ait until such time as the province
of Manitoba and Keewatin can, through
our ow n interinediary, secure terms which
can be satisfactory both to Manitoba and
Keewatin. Manitoba can to-day refuse to
take this Bill. She is not bound to accept
its terms, or ans- portion of it; and Canada
is not bound to annex any part of Keewatin
to the province of Manitoba. For my part,
it seems obvious that, in trying to make
terms mutually satisfactory, the ternis
should be thought out in a broad and
generous spirit, not with the idea of being

too insistent, or hiaving the pound of flesli.
It is quite clear to me, as it is to most hon.
inembers of this House and the other
branch of parliamient, that so far as the
financial termis are concerned, and so far
as the territorial limits of the territory to,
be annexed are concerned, we have deait
in a most generous manner with Manitoba.
1 tlîink it will be the common verdict that
Manitoba is receiving far more generous
treatment than Quebec or Ontario are going
to receive when the timie comes for the extension of their otn boundaries. I ama fot
disposed to quarrel with the financial and
other termis which are now proposed to us;
they may be, in the opinion of many. far
too generous. M-%any might say that granting suchi termis to Manitoba is an encouragement to the other provinces to come
and make raids on the Dominion treasury.

involved in the amendment submitted by
iiiy hon. friend and which I have seconded.
What are the claims of these parties P Are
tiiere in the territory of Keewatin rights,or
dlaims, 'which. are not being protected, and
which shouid be protected P If there are
dlaims of that kind, I submit it is our duty
to continue to administer those rights. If
thiere are legitimate rights on the part of
those people which should be saleguarded.
I say the duty primarily and essentially
rests on this parliament, and perhaps more
so on this -branch of parliament, to see that
tiiose rights are protected, or at ail events,
that every possible means of securing and
protecting those rights should bie resorted
to before this Bill is finally passed by parliament. What is the positionP In the
province of Manitoba there are no separate
schools; in 1890 the provincial legisiature
abolished the system of separate schools
which, Up to that time, had been in existence in the province. Hon, gentlemen will
remember as well as I do what followed.
The Act was attacked as ultra vires and
flot constitutional, but the Privy Counicil
declared the Act to be within the powers of

.NARCH 20, 1912

the province, and so far as legisiation goes,
the separate school systemi in the province
of Manitoba became, in 1890, and lias been
-ever sinoe, abolished and gone -for ever.
To-day there are no separate schools in
Manitoba. That is the legal position. It
is welI to rememiber, also, that by a subsequent judgment of the Prîvy Council it
was declared that the minority of Manitoba
have a very serious grievance which should
be remedied by this parliament under the
provisions of the British North America
Act. The elections were fought out on that
issue. The Conservative goverament of the
day, as everybody knows, attempted to enforce upon the province of Manitoba remiedial legisiation. The attempt was made
to compel Manitoba to restore the separate
sehools, or to give the Catholic minority
of Manitoba the righits to which it was entitled. I believed, and 1 have believed
since, and believe now, thiat it was impolitic, that it was not a proper coursè to
adopt, and that a very grave mistake was
mnade by the government of the day in trying to impose that legisiation upon the
province.
1 did not then believe, I have nlot since
believed, and I do not now believe in coercion, in compelling, or in trying to coer.ce the pro vince of Manitoba, or any othier
province, in educational mnatters. 1 believe
that was the great defect of the Bill of 1896.
Thiere was ano:ther thing whi-ch affected
the nîinority, a defect, to nmv mind, rendered that rneasure utterly useless, and it, ias
this: that there was no provision in that
Act which would have enabled the Cathiolie ininority of Manitoba to have its own
tnxes for the support of its own schools;
sc- that the Act of 1896 was absolutely futile.
I do not *want to characterize it with a
stronger word, though, I could, but I say
it was absolutely futile. 1 do flot propose,
for my part, that legisiation of that kind
should be attemiptedâ agaîn, and 1 would
be the la-st to support it..
Hon. Mr. WATSON-I would like to ask
the hion. gentleman if lie thinks the parlianient of Canada woul have had any power

whiich would afford relief to the Catholic
minoxity.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-No; I have already said so.
1 have juat said that 1Jhe
Aoct of 1896 was obsclutely useless, *so far
as protecting the rights of the ininority in
Manitbha waà conoernied, iuiasmuch as iA
macde no provision by which that minority
could have had its own taxes, for the use
of its own schools. For that reason, I opposed then the Bill of 1896. I was a candidate in the city of Ottaws at that lime,
and I opposed ýit on the hustings and aiterwards. I believed then, and I believe
now, and have believed since, that if in
1896 the government of Manitoba had been
approached in a proper spirit., that question would have been settled, and settled
wit.hout the great turmoil that was tlien
caused throughout t.he length and breaddth
of this counitry.
I believe that the province of Manitoba to-day. if appealed to iii
a proper spi-rit, and a proper way, by the
government of the day, would find soine
solution to this question which 'would fo.r
ever take il. out of politics, and save us

in discussing a question which should have
been disposed of and settled ma.ny, inany

A law of tlat kind wvill, or wiIl not, produce an effect according to the manner in

or defective, not according to the letter of
the statute, or the spirit of it, but in th&,

province, that law would be administered
in such a way that it would nlot serve the
purpose for which. it was intended. That in

1 may perhaps venture to gay to my friends
from Manitoba that it would be a flot unfitting recognition on their part if, on saine
future day, on giving thouglit to the situation in that province, -they eme to realze
that those with whom those -who have acted
as we have aoted especially sympathize, are
not enjoying the full liberty which they are
entitled to and to which they aspire. Not
that we ask for any promise or eny guarantee

that question, so, set as to show them6elves

not leff generous in recognizing the rights,
or the dlaims if you do not choose to onui
them righta, of the elass of people with whom

we are particularly in sympathy, then I think
we may olaim ta have proved ourselves in aur

present action in their regard.
That is the Minister af Justice, evidently in the samne line recognizing that the
minarity are entitled ta privileges of which
they have heen impraperly deprived. But,
of course, the strongest point is the onc to
which 1 referred in apening, that the very
corner atone af confederatian is the rccoganition af those rights. When it wvas found
that there wcre three provinces that did
flot corne within the Act it created a very
great deal af excitement over the country.

Tupper and Archbishiop Cannally got tagether and drew up a memorandum which
lias been respected. by the majority in that
province, and I believe no further trouble
has risen. There is friction only in the
province of Manitoba, where we supposed
that we had made the terma so plain and
sa clear that it would be utterly impossible
for the province ta violat,- them. They
anly accomplishied it by violating the provisians under which thcy came into the
union. Naw, I woul like ta say a word or
twa as ta why Catholica feel 50 strongly
upan this question. They regard religion
as part af their educatian. If education is
con[ined ta the three IR's it does not build
up character, does nat add ta the strengtli
of marais, or honour, or propriety. We have
-in illustration af that in countries autside.
There are onlv two countries where religion
is absolutely excluded from ail education
under tWie constitution ai ;the country;
those are France and the United States.
France naw is drifting juta i nfideiity. The

It would surprise

the pilgrim fathers, and thbe men who
founded the United States constitution, if

thcy were alive ta-day, ta discover what the

Canada from thé United States. If we are

United States, it wilI be a sorry day for

the position Canada occupied years and
years ago, by our objecting Vo denominational schools, and rather favouring publie schools. Confederation would have
been almost impossible unless the righits
of the mincrity in regard Vo education had
been an absolute provision of the contiract,
and in regard to Manitoba, thatt province
had accepted the condition at the tume she
came int-o the union, and for nineteen
years had carried it out, and there was no
justification for the repeal of that Act. I

one.
I do flot think we can obtain anything by interfering in this matter.
You

to that portion of the territory, -but on the
larger question, wirth the sta.tement made
by the two leading membert of the piesent government, I do not think it would

the Bill now passed, but leave it entirely
to the genereskty and liberality of the people of Manitoba Vo reoonsider the case, and
in the hope that a change rnay take place
which would improve the position of thbe
minority in that province.
Hon. MNr. DAVID-I intend Vo move soine
ainendments, but before doing so I wish
Vo make a few remaîk-s, u-hich I hava
w ritten, because the question is very ini.portant, and I do not wish Vo say any
more than 1 need. There are certain facts
that cannot be denied. It cannot be deiiied that the Laurier government has been
denounced with a grent deal of violence
for the last fifteen years because they have
flot settled the question of the Catholic
schools of Manitoba and the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta in such a way
as to give satisfaction to the Catholies of
this country, and especially the province
of Quebec. No one can deny that the chie[
of the late government was denounced
everywhere on the hustings, ini the Conservative and Nationalist press, in public
institutions, colleges, and even in schools
for being more or less a traitor Vo his race
and Vo bis religion because o! Vhe settlement of the school question in Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta. 1V was said,
u~nd repeated, that it was a misfortune Vo
to have at the lîead of the government a
Prime Minîster who was a Catholie and a
Frenchman, because he was obliged Vo
rnake concessions with a Protestant, an
English Prime Minister, %youldnot ho forced
to make. I do not like Vo say too much on
this question. But I cannot help asking
those who daîed to make this statement,
il they have gained hy the change? I have
a great respect for the Prime Minister of
the present government, but 1 should like

MARCH 20, 1912
Hon. Mr. DAVID-Yes. It is incredible,
after the denuniciations which have been
uttered, the solemn promises which have
been made in the whole country, which
are the cause in a great measure of the success of the Conservative and Nationalist
party in Quebec, that these promises were
flot fulfilled by inserting something in the
Bill in accord with what they have preached for the last fifteen years. We must suppose that they are men of honour who desire to keep their reputation and not be
considered as inipostors in the eyes ot the
country, and their conduct is incredible.
unless they have been promised that something would ho done to satisty the Catholic mninority of Keewatin and of the province of Manitoba. They must be in possession of some assurance, if flot a positive
and final promise. Somethîng must have
been done ta persuade the members of pailiament to vote as they did, and to induce.
the public to think that something would
be done to remedy those injustices which
they have so violently denouneed. I feil
%sure that membere of par1liament and
others have been influenced by such promises and declarations, as stated by the
lion, gentleman from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Ohoquette) and there is reason to believe
that the declarations will perhaps have
some influence in this House, and that
some members of this House may bie induced to do what others have done in another Ohamber under the same impression,
and that is why it is important to know
what is true or taise in the declarations
and the allegations nmade by the hon. gentlemnan trom Grandville. It is in the interests of the country and parliament that
we should be assured as to the extent to
which those declarations are justified. This
is the justification of the amendaient moved by the hon, gentleman trom Grandville,
seconded by the hon. gentleman from Ottawa, and so ably supported by the two
hion, g-entlemen who have just spoken. But
it bas been said, and it will bie repeated,

only denounced the policy of conciliation
and of mutuel concessions of the late governiment and ot the Liberal party, as a
crime, but they declared and promised
solemnly on the hustings and in all their
newspapers, that if the Laurier geverfiment were defeated justice weuld bie done
to the Catholîc minority and to the Frenchi
population of the province of Quebec, that
all the injustices which were committed
by the Laurier government would be reinoved. Nobody can deny those tacts. But
there are other tacts wlîich are equally
true. They repeated that they would, at
the first opportunity which might bie offered them afler the assembling of parliament, proceed to remedy those evifls. We
know that one promise was that the naval
law passed by the late government would
be repealed-but let us not deal with the
question of the navy, let us stick to the
îohool question. In ail the newspapers and
on the hustings during the lust election,
and sînce 1896, they promised the people
that they wouid do their duty in this respect. They even denounced as a crime
the policy of conciliation and concession
adopted by the Laurier governiment. What
are the tacts? What have they done? In
vain I look through the Bill to see if there
is something which justifies there denunciations and tuifils their promises. I read
between the uines to find something, but I
see niothing&at al-I dû net sese even anything similar to the school systemn whicb
wvas establislied in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, which have been
denounced with se much violence, and
whiclî is non' se well appreciated that a
xew days ago at a meeting a! the Catholics
of Vancouver, it was declared that they
would be happy in the province of Manitoba ta have the school systemn which is
in existence in the provinces o! Saska.tchewvan and Alberta.

tiffeHou. Mr. CLORAN-This time.
1-on. Mr. LARIVIER1E-This time, yes,
aind you will find it out toa soon, perhaps,
for what yo expect. I believe that the
legisiature of Manitoba wvill this time
open thieir eyes ta die cansequences ai thieir
nisdeeds in tiîc piht. This amendment dernands tliat tlîc' gavetrnunient here approacli
the go%-eiiiieiit af 'Manitoba. The governnienit of 'Maniitoba lias no more ta say on
tliis question than thie governrnent here;
it i.s the legislatture af Manitoba thiat lias
ail ta say about it. It la the legislature
that wîll change the laws that are in force
there to-day, and thierefore this ameadment
is perfectly worthless because it directs an
appeal ta a body which is not responsible.
Of course, the gavernment may lead the
Hanse, they may even instruet the House,
but that la not sufficient. They must have
the support ai the Hanse as welI. And if
my hon. iriend the member for Portage la
Prairie (Han. Mr. Watson) has anything
tc say in the matter, the Hanse will flot
approve ai any snch settlement as is proposed by my hion. friend. Alter ail the agitation that lias taken place bath in Manitoba and in the eastern provinces, I say
unihesitatingly that the legislature ai Manitoba will have their eyes apened. and will
offer a remiedy for the present situation.
If they fail ta do that, if they do not
acquiesce in the request of the rninority
af Manitoba, I for one will introduce reniedial legislation in a future session ai
tlîis House. WVe still have the right to pass
reniedial leg-islation. The order in counicil

measure.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-Yes.
Han. Mr. LARIVIERE-My friend the
senior member from Ottawa says yes. I remember very welh that the then member
for St. Boniface, the late Senator Girard,
made the proposition, and hie was supported by rny lion. friend from Ottawa,
(Hon. Sir Richard Scott) and it carried
hiere and the aniended Bill went back ta
the Commons. It m-as admitted that a
mnistake had beeni made by the House ai

guardian af the privileg-es that the minority passesa. and it is the duty of the

,hîs remarkable statement by saying that
.the Bill was a bad one. He repeated the
declaration several times, but strange to
.say, as a legisiator addressing his peers,
representatives of millions of people in this
country, after telling themn that the Bill
was unfair and unjust to his province, and
that it was a bad Bill, yet declared that
he would vote for it. Where can you find
a parliamentary institution in the civilized
world where a legislator wvill get up and
say a Bill is rotten and bad; stili lie will
rote for it. That is a remnarkable statement to make. Then we had other senators xvho lamented the fact that this school

Education is a
lire interest and always will bie in one way
or the other. I intend ta discuss this Bill
from one or two points af view, those ai
honour and honesty that ought ta exist
between man and man; that fair-play and
justice should 'be handed out by the garerning autharities to the governed. Naw,
what is meant by honesty and honour bietween man and man P It means that one
man shaîl flot take the other's praperty for
his own use and benefit; that is honesty
and that is honaur between man and man.
Under the systemn which this Bill proposes
ta place Keewatin in, that is the Manitoba
systern, you farce themn ta accept a worse
position than they occupy now
If this

place the people of that new territory, who
are enjoying certain righits to-day, in a
perilous position, in a position ai uniairiiess, in a position takzing away their
righit. This cry ai separate schools is ta,
my mind a simple ane. It lias puzzled me
ail my life, at least since I have taken an
interest in questions of public polity and
public issues, ta find such bitterness
against separate schools.

non-Catholie friends. 1 contend that there
are to-day in this country three classes of
population-Catholic,
non-Catholie,
and
non-Christians. I venture to say there is
-lot one Catholic in the Dominion of Canada who would demean and degrade hini
self by taking a dollar irom a Protestant
fellow man to educate his Catholic child,
and then force the Protestant to educate his
Protestant child at his own expense afterwards. We find communities at large, men
who ought ta know and act better, be more
honest, and have more honour, go to the
poor Catholic father of eight or ten children, take his one, two, three, four, five or
ten dollars and appropriate it for the purposes of his Protestant school to educate t.he
iProtestant child, and then force the poor
Catholic ta bleed himself once more to secure the education ai his own Catholic
child. Is that flot a thing to be ashiamecl
of? Is thât fair and honest between man
and man? That is donc ta-day in Manitoba, but I arn glad ta say not throughout
Canada. We would disdain ta do that in
Quebec, and I arn glad ta say that under
the guidance af men like Mowat, Ross and
others, the province ai Ontario hias time
and again refused ta do what Manitoba hias
done, Rnd the Catholics af Ontario have the
same rights as the Protestants in Quebec.
Why should the same systemn ai hanaur,
fair-play and justice nat exist in Manitoba?
Why should that province talze irom the
poor Catholie people mancy ta educate
their children? This Bill gives thcmn pawer
ta do t.hat in regard ta Keewatin. Is there
a gentleman among us who is prepared ta
say that Manitoba shall be given a chance
ta bleed the Catholics ai Keewatin, the
same as shie lias bled the Catholits in
Manitoba for the henefit ai Manitoba and
ag-ainst the weliare af the nation? 'Remiember that the men who (lo this are the rich

no recourse. There la no process of law
against legisiative enactments, whereby
officers of the government are authorized to
collect money unfairly and unjustly from
certain classes of the population. As far as
education is concerned,
our separate
schools, as so ably and eloquently pointed
out by the hon, gentleman from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Choquette) do not turn
out ig-noramuses or men unfit to, earn their
living in the world. Probably they produce men more honest than the other
schools, because thev are obliged to bring
into their dailv life the principle of obedience to the latv of God.
That is what the separate schools do.
NVhat we want in our separate schools is
Pot merely a half hour, or an hour, of
tesching o! the catechism, but we want
the religious atmosphere of the Catholic
iaith. We want the children to understand
that the law oi the gospel must be obeyed
from nine in the morning tili four when
they leave, and also in their homes and
in their play. It is not necessary to have
the children sitting in school under th«
catechism and answering questions; the
sig n of the finger is enough to make the
child understand what hie ought to do or
ougbt not to do. It is not so, mueh teaching catechism as it is having histories that
will record facts and not fiction sud fable.
We want in our schools poetry that will
flot pollute the minds of the young maidens. We want in our sehools the careful
religious supervision that will prevent the
yeung generation frem practising the arts
oi race suicide. I say that advisedly. I
know right here in the city of Ottawa
there are parents whe have been obliged
to take their children, seventeen and eighiteen vears of age, from some of the biggest
cchols in Ottawva, on aecount cf the immorality that exists there, because they are
under no moral restraint. These are facts
that confront seciety to-day. We do not
want these things introduced into our
sehools and that is the reason we want
contrel of ouir own sehools, which we have
and wvhich we wirl hold. We are prepared
te give the saine centrel to other bodies,
twhether they be Christian or non-Christian.

We do not object te the Jews having their
own special schools. We insist on our
rigbts te educate eur children according-to
the laws of the Catholie iaith. Let others
do as they please, they ivili find out the
resuits later on.
New, I ask the hon.
leader of the Heuse te see that bis government plays the game fair and gives
justice. His pevernment is streng enoughi
te be decent in a matter of that kind,
strong eneugh te be fair, and streng enough
te secure justice. W~e have ne objection
to the Bill on other grounds; we are glad
that Manitoba is geing te hiave an extension cf territory. The Bill would go
through ivitheut axnendrnent and witheut
discussion if it containcd a clause stating
tliat the rifflts new existing, civil or otiierwise, in the territery of Keewatin wiIl be
maintaitied after the tcrritery is annexed
te Manitoba. If the geverinnent de flot
see fit te insert such o1clause, %whlat
inference must we draw? It sinip]v mneans that
the present geverniment vishes te destroy
the existing rights, civil, educational and
etherwise, by handing these people over te
the Manitoba government, bound hand
and foot. If that is the intention of the
govelument, it is a dastardly ene; a most
contemptible one, and one that ought *to
be fought to the bitter end. I do not believe that is the intention of the gevernment, but 1 will only believie it is net their
intention when they introduce into this
Bill a clause whereby the existing rights
of the people cf Keewatin shall be safeguarded and proteeted. Othierwise I shaîl
bra.nd the government as the most disreputable one in the history of Canada. They
are giving away the rights e! a free people and making themu wvorse than the
slaves in the days, o! Rorne, barterin- away
their rights without consulting them. That
is net the part cf a strong government that
desires ta be fair and j ust. WVe simply
are
asking to have a two Une clause stating,
that thie existing rights of the people of
Keewatin shaîl be safeguarded and protected alfter annexation. If the goverfiment refuse that, then there are a couple
cf ministers that ought ta be beheaded tonight. The hon. senator from Grandville,
(Hon. Mr. Choquette) pointed out, reading from ' Hansard,' that two of these ministers saved the life cf the government on

to that amnient, and I '«111 vote for it,

I have been tohd tlîat the Manitoba legislature is in session and they nîay inake

Bill to extend the boundaries of Manitoba,
and to mnake some chianges in the financial
relationîs between Manitoba and the Dominion. 1 do flot mean to say that the
amendment moved by the hion. gentlemnan
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Choquette) is
out of order, because 1 suppose one can
just as well move against the Bill because
it does not contain something as on account of anything it does contain. I have
taken the liberty of stating that I do flot
agree with the Minister of Public Works or
the Postmaster General, and I do agree
most cordially, as a matter of law, with the
hion. the junior member from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt). Thien cornes the question,
even thioughi I think that the lion. gentlemani froin Ottawa lias given us good law,
ain I bound as a unatter of conscience,
desiring to give the best vote I can, to vote
for the amnendaient? Before one can answer
that question, lie lias tIo look at the actual
position. This is a question whihi lias to
be settled between the legislature of Manitoba and the government o! Canada, and
the question ha, if by passing this amendment we will help to bring about a satisfactory arrangement. It seems to me it
wouild have juat the reverse effeet. This
amendment, althougli said to be for delay
only for a few days, means a hanging up
of the Bill for this session. We are now

amendment or the sub-amnendment is passed, it means that the Bill will not go any
f urther this session. WVi1l the passing of
this amendment help the cause of separate
schoola in Manitoba and Keewatin? I do
not think it will. The effeet of our holding up this important measure, a measure
which is so important to the people of
Manitoba, would be to irritate the people
and the lugislators of Manitoba and make
themn much less ready to enter into friendly
arrangements with respect to this question.
There is more or less a sort of criais.
We must bear in mind that the gentlemen who are now members o! the goverfiment, and their frienda, during the late election campaign, and for years before that,

question in such a manner as to remove
the grievances o! the Catholica of Manitoba. 1 do not say they all said that, but
that was the ground tak-en by a great
many o! them. It seems to me it ia better
to give the gzovernment a chance to settie
the matter. Why should the Senate, at a
criais like this, ivhen we are perhaps
'within a few weeks o! a eettlement of this
question, intervene and prevent the aettlement? No one has given any reason why
we should do that. I take it that this la
the acceptable time. If the governiment,
of this country and the government o!
Manitoba get together 'while they are in
sympathy over most things, I think it
highly probable that they w-ill be able tcn
settle this question in such a way as to
remove the grievances of the Cathiolie
miinority in Manitoba. Suppose the Senate break in and prevent the bringinz

are not responsible just now. It is a
question for the governiment, and we had
better leave it with them. Why should
we interfere between the government and
the legislature of Mu~anitoba? The government is doing something. We did soniething in 1897, but I honestly think there
remains something to be done yet, particularly 'when Manitoba is to be enlarged;
and I think this government shou]d be allowed a free hand, just as the Laurier
govèrnment was.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Coluinbia). I think the amendments now before
the House are irrelevant to the Bill.
Amendments must be germane to the
measure and I submit to his hion. the
Speaker that thiese amendments are uxot in
order.
The SPEAKER-The main motion is
for the second reading of the Bill. On
a motion of that kind any member is pernmitted to move as an amendment a declaration o! principle or anything o! that
kind.
Hon. Mr. FORGET-WVhen the cons-titution of Manitoba was framed in 1887 a
clause was irtroduced which, in the eves

MARCH 20, 1912
of the legisiators of the time and o! ail
those interested, was intended to protect
the rights of the minority in the province
o! «Manitoba, either Protestant or Roman
Catholic. We know the reauit. Acts ,were
passed by the province of Manitoba creating a system of schools, and from 1870 to
1890 the legislature of Manitoba succeeded
in getting around that clause of the constitution of the province. and passed the
Act witli regard ta education which is in
force now. If that clause could not protect the Roman Catholie minority of
Manitoba. I have come to the conclusion
that no amendment, and no clause that
could be introduced in the Act before us,
-would hold that province and secure the
riglits of the minority any better than
the section in the provincial Act did. I
believe any neg-otiation of the kind which
is proposed after this Act was passed
would amount to nothing. Therefore, it
would be a bass of lime. I shaîl vote
agyainst both amendments when they are
presented.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-A great deal lias
been said during this discussion by thie
different speakers of -the attitude of tihe
Roblin government; in fact, the attitude
o! the Roblin government towards the
Calliolie minority la practically the aiubject of discussion.
Suggestions have been
made that the laIe Liiberal goveoenment did
flot give the Catholic minority the treatment they should receive in the province
of Manitoba.
My lion. friend from St.
Boniface (Hon. Mr. LaRiviere) referred
to me, I suppose, because I was a
member of the government at the time
this arrangement was made between the
federal and Manitoba governiments.
I
want to make one point clear, and to
place the Rablin governient in the
proper position.
That government for
years, to my mind, had been inducing the
Catliolic minority of the province o! Manitoba ta support them in loal poulies, and
the hion, gentleman froni St. Boniface,
(Hon. Mr. LaRiviere) is aware that
Roblin bas had the solid vote of
thie Oatholic minorily, on the understanding that lie was willing, if permitted by the federal authorities, ta grant

the relief wvhich the Catholic minority o4fthe province of Manitoba a.sked for.
On the occasion of Sir WVilfrid Laurier's
visit to the city of Winnipeg, on Monday,
fitl of September, 1910, a large delegation
was organized by Archbishop Langevin, and
Father Coffey was entrusted by the ArchbiGhop to head that deputation to interview
Sir Wilfrid, and -on that occasion the grievances of the ininority were placed -before
him, particularly for the purpo-se of inducing him to dîscuss the situation xith
Mr. Roblin. As Father Coffey states, in
this interview, hie was assured by Mr. Robilin, that if Sir Wilfrid would pledge himself flot to interfere with Mr. Roblin in
chang-ing the school law of Manitoba, that
lie would g-rant relief to -Jhe Çatholic miinoritv.

By the way, Mr. Blernier Ia the gentleman who delivered hînself in the local
House in Manitoba the other day, taking
the same stand as was taken by hion, gentlemen iii the other House, notably the
Minister of Public Works, whien lie stated
that lie considered the «Manitoba schooI
question settled, and that the Catholicï
lost their opportunity wheni they refused
to support Sir Charles Tupper on the Remedial Bill. The interview proceeds:
Father Coffey was the spokesman of -the deputation having been charged witli this responsi'bility, it is said, by Ârchbishop
Langevin, before his departure for Montreal.
Pallier Coffey addressing Sir Wilfrid said
that the depu-tation had reasan to believe that
Hon. R. P. Roblin, Premier of Manitoba,

to the Roman Cothaîzo minarities in the province of Manitoba, if assured of the sympathetie co-operatioln of the Dominion authorities, and lie asked Sir Wilfrid to caîl

Sir Wilfrid Laurier replied that his information es to the inclination of Mr. Roblin in
thie matter differed from 'that of Father
Coffey. Re judged Mr. Roblin in this matter
by hie public actions, and statements,
and hle was well aware that, on a number of

Then they go further:

minority in the added territories will b.
governed by the rights of thse present inhabitants o! the province, it was sought by
this amendment to establish a right to denominational schools at the tirne of the passin- of this Act, and I will show in a few
minutes thse great difference that woulid have
been made. But let me say at this juncý
ture that I quite agree with the law, as
mentioned by the hon. member from Ottawa
this afternoon, that under section 10 of
chapter 62 o! the Revised Statutes, the
territory in question is practically governed by the provisions of the Act of 1875,.
which. was almost in the same wording,
incorporated in the Revised Statutes in
chapter 62, section 10. I do not quite
agree w-îth the hon. gentleman from Ottawa
that that Act has the effect of giving vested
rights to the inhabitants o! the territory
in question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-My hon. friend
is flot doing my argument justice. I did
flot use the words 'vested rlghts.'
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I must retract that
eipressicn, because thse hon, gentleman did
not use it.
He said: 'Bights in posse.'
But rights in posse and vested rights are
quite a different thing.
The rights which
they posseags have flot corne into existence,
and are conditional upon a state of things
which has flot yet taken place.
These
rights, under the wording of the statute,
are that they are te be entitled to separate
schools if certain things are donc, if a
commissioner is appointed, and if other
conditions take place.
But these conditions not having yet taken place, these
rig-hts have not come into existencé, and,
more than that, I dlaim that chapter 62
of the Rcvised Statues is not a constitutional law.
It is a law that is governed
by section 18 o! the Interpretation Act, as
contained ini the Revised Statues, that every
Act shail be so construcd as to reserve to
parliament tIse powver o! repealing, amending, revoking or rcstricting any power or advantage thereby vested or granted to any
person whenýever such repeal or revocation
is decmed by parliament to be required for
the public good. I dlaim it is not a vested right: not only la it not a vested right
which can corne into operation, but it is

flot a vested right whjchl could, in law, be
the foundation of any claim on the -part of
the minority, and my appreciation of the
Mondou amendment would be that it
would have placed the minority in a very
inferior position to that which they will
occupy ifl the Bill is pasEed in its present
forin.
If that amendment were adopted,
At would mean that they could claim no
other rig-hts but the rights which they
actually possess et the tirne of the passing
of the Act- They would be deprived of
any rights which the minority of the province of Manitoba may have possessed, whether moral or otherwise, at the time of the
union, and of any rights wihel they maY
have acquired subsequently to the union.
1by reason of the legisiation which has been
passed in MaNInitoba. and therefore they
would not part-icipate in
any shape
or form in the r;,Izt-s whielh have
been secured by legisiation of Nfanitoba.
Their riglits wvould be confined to such
rights as they could claim under section
10 of chapter 62 of the revised statutes,
and as existing at the present time. Now,
will it be claimed t-hat the conditions of
those inhabitants who have had so far, I
understand, a school or two supyported bY
themselves in a -country which was not
under any system, of taxation, a stronger
position, or even a position as strong as
the minority in Manitoba occupied in 1870?
Evidently not, and therefore, to xuy mind,
there can be no doubt t.hat they would
flot be able to make any dlaim which
would commend itseàf to any court of justice.
Now let me refer to tlue judgirent of the
Privy Council in the Brophy case, -as found
in t.he law reports, 1895, page 215. Here is
their appreciation of the judginent in the
Barrett case.
The judgment wvas referred
to by the Lord Chiancellor in the Barrett
case:
So the sole question raised %vas %hether the
publio schools Act of 1890 prejudicially affeoted
any right or privilege which the Roman Catholics by-l-aw or practice liad in the prov1
ince at the union. Their Lordships arrived at
the conclusion that this question must be
answered in the negative. The only right
or privilege which the R~oman Catholies then
possessedl, either by law or in practice, was
the right or privilege of e5tablishing and
maintaining for the use of members of their
own chureh suchi school, as they please. It

Hion. Mr. BEIQUE.

righlitly, thsat unde-r that scttleînent the
question was sittled. It *was legaliy settled
but the moral claimi reniained ail tise same
and it was adniitted by ail parties concerned, and always conceded-by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier as weil as other members cf the
Liberal party-that it was not the full measure of relief te which. the minority wvas entitled at the time, and that it was accepted
as a compromise, and the hope xvas ail the
tirne expressed that when public opinion
%vasin a better mnood te deal with tise question, a furtiser measure of relief would. be
g"iven.
Hon. ',%r. LARIVIERE-W\as there net
part of that settiernent stating that this
was thse finalitv of tIse whole thing?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-The settlement xvas
announced in tise speech freom tise Throne
by the Canadian governinexit. and it was
stated tisat it was a settlinent of the case;
but it was, as 1 have statcd, a settlinent
as far as the legal side of it was concernied,
and I net only admît, but 1 dlaim that it
would not now he open in law te the Caoadian parliament te impose a Remedial Bill
on thse province, and te impose upon the
province, by reason of tise passing of the
legisiation of 1871, further leg-isîntien on
the subject. 1 caîl attention again te the
fact tisat if tise minority in the territory te
be annexcd were lirnted te their rights as
they exist under chapter 62 cf thse .revised
statutes, they would be deprived eiitirely of
the benefit o! the legisiatien contained in
chapter 26 of the statittes cf Manitoba fer
1897. In ethier words, it wouid be open te
the province of 'Manitoba te take that
course, althougi thse province of Manitoba
is beund te respect that statute and is unable to, repeal it, because tisat statute lias
thse character of a coiîstitutienal Act. They
wou id net bc obligzed te apply tise p)rovisiens of that statute te thse new territory,
and tise new territory miighit be left witheut any rsimedy at ail, without the benefit'
of nv leagislation of 1897. 1 corne now 1
another point. My contention is, that flot
only an ameodusient .of that kind would be
mucli werse than tise Bill as it is, but that
it is net in thse power ef the Canadian parjianient, in thîs Bill, te make any stipulatbon in regard te SChoois8 in thé', territ0ry'

to be annexed. whiech would bc binding on
the province of Manitoba. I think that is a
point which has flot received as yet the attention of anybody whno has spoken on the
question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-That point has
no bearing on the arnendmnent at ail; that
is why we did flot discuss it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-But 1 ain not speaking of the amendrnent; 1 amn speaking of
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURI-But my hon.
frîend has not discussed the amendaient at
ail yet; we have flot hecard a word about it.
Hon. M%.-.
BEIQUE-I arn taking niy own
course. The hion. nemiber rnay flot bc satisfied with the course 1 folloiv. If I have
anythin_, to state 0o1 the amendaiient I wvilI
state it bv and by, but I arn stating the
iaw as I understand it to-day, and rny proposition is that it is flot open to this parliament to amend this Bi'!, to deolare that
a systeîn of law contrary to that contained
in chapter 26 of the Manitoba Statutes for
1897 shiffl be applied to the territory ta bie
annexed. It bas been taken for granted
that this could be donc because of the constitution of the Imperial Act of 1871 which
savs:,

The parliamenit of Canada may fromn time
ta time with the consent of the legisiature
ewf any province of the said Dominion, increase, diminieh, or otherwise alter the limits
of such province, mpon such ternis a.nd conditions as may be agreed to by the eaid logislature, and may, with the like consent, make
provision respeoting the efleet and operation
of any suoh increase or diminution or aiteration of terri-tory in.relation to any province affected thereby.
And the further provision is contained in
section 6:
Except as provided by the third section of
this Act, it shall noît be competent for the
parliamenýt of Canada te alter the provisions
of the last-mentioned Act of the said parliarnent in s0 far as At relates ta -the province
of Manitoba, or of any other Act hereafter
estebltishing nem, provinces in the said Dominion, subject alw-ays to -the right of the
legieiature of the province of Manitoba ta
alter from time ta lame the provisions of the
legi6lative aýssembly, aind ta make 1:îws respecting elections in the eaid province.
For the dlaim that in this Bill a provision may be incorporated determining
39%

611

what system of schoo]s shall obtain in that
territory to be annexed, one must rest on
these words: «Upon such ternis and conditionse, as are to he found in se4ction 3V But
my contention is that those words cannot
control, and have no reference to anything
which may relate to any constitutional law;
in other words, that when the province of
Manitoba was created it received its constitution in vi-rtue of an Imperial Act, and
that constitution apphies to the whole of
the territory-to the niew territory as well
as the present.territory-and that it is not
in the power of this parliament to change
the constitution in any shape or forrn.
It is not in its power to change it as regards education any more than in otiier
respects.
Suppose that this parliament
should try to makze it a condition of the pre-sent Bill that tlip legýisative ecouncil of the
province of M1%anitoha should le abolishied.
wvouId it b- in thîcir pow-er to insert a
clause of that kind? I sa *%
evidently ne.
I say that parlianient liaving been given
the power to extend the territory of Manitoba, implies that the territory is to faîl
under the constitution of Manitoba as it
exists to-day, and that fia separate constitution can bie created for the territories
which are to be added. Therefore, I say,
that if a clause of that kind were inserted
in the present Bill, determnining that in the
territary to be annexed, the people would be
entitled to separate schools, and although
the province of Manitoba %vould accept
that, they would not be bound by it, because it would be contrary ta, the constitution, and ivould not *be in accord with
the Imperial Act. The Dominion parlia
ment ia functus officie as regards anything
thiat pei'tains ta thie eonstitutioni of ManitUba. and next yea.r. or nt any timé alter
the, passmng of tie Act, a clause of
that kind could be disrcgarded by the
province of Manitoba and treated as a
nullity. 1 do not dlaim, hc>wever, that it
is not in the power -of the province to
ainend, and that it is not the duty of the
province of Mani-toba to furt.her amend the
legislation on sehoals from whiat was passEd inii 8w3,to isuppiement it in order ta Tender fulil justice ta the minority, but I say
that it must be done, not in an Act of this

(In the Committee.)
Hon. Mr. LOUGHIEED-There is a proposai to amend clause 3. My right hon.
friend bias suggested that the appointment
of a tariff commission shouid be during
pleasure. The difficulty that presents itself to the government in accepting this
suggestion is that capable men would hesitate about taking office under such a tenure. It is desîrable they should feel that
they would be secure in their office during
at ieast five years. ilt will probabiy involve
men abandoning such positions as they
may at present occupy and accepting this
office, and it would be very difficult to secure such an officiai unless lie feit lie was
absolutuly sure of eîuî>loyîîîent for five

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I do not exactly iollow imy hion. friend.
Ail other governnment officials, with one or
twvo exceptions, are appointed during- pleasure, and there is very little difflculty found
in filling their places, especially on such
salaries as my bon. friend's coileagues propose to attach. I see serious objection to
making these gentlemen independent, as
they virtuaily would be, of parliament or
of anybody. They can oniy be removed on
an address of both Hlouses of parliament at
any time for cause. Practically speaking
we know that that means that they cannot be removed at all.
These parties
should flot be made independent of the ordinary tenure of office. My hion. friend I
thînk can point to no other case, except
it may bie such as the Railway Commission, in which men are appointed in that
fashion, and I do niot think a precedent
shouid be estabiished in this matter. I
think the Railway Commission hold office
durin« ao-od behaviour.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-They are appointed for ten years, and this office is
scarcely analogous to that whichi would be
occupied by an officiai in the civil service.
The civil service is a permanency; my hion.
friend would flot he prepared to concede
that this is a permanency. From the observations made by my riglit hion. iriend, it

Hon. _Mr. LOUGHEED-There must bc,
some source from whichi to obtain iniformation necessary to the proper framing of
a tariff, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that, though the fiscal policy o! Canada would change, a body of this kînd
would be eminently useful in securing such
information as might be desirable from

1 gathered frorn his rernarks that the reEuit might be different. It does flot seem
to me that it is possible for those commissioners to hear ail the evidence and makie

I do not see how a report could be made
without expressing sorne opinion as to the

H-on., Mr. LOUGHEED-Now rny hon.
friend goes on to another factor. My hon.
friend eliminates then the question of belief, or grounds. I have been discussing
that part of the amendrnent in which he
speaks of the grounds, if any, for believing; that is, in the earlier portion of the
arnendrnent. To that we object, because
we have something superior to grounds for
believing; we have facts elicited after -am

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I draw a distinction hetween an opinion and a finding.
There is a certain conflict of facts before
us. That conflict cornes in by reason o!
contradictory facts or contradictory positions being taken by the persons who rnay
be examined by the commission. They
must make sorne finding; thev mnust make
some report upon the siuation or upon the
conflict itself that confronts them, but as
to expressing a belief, the Department o!
Finance, which will. adrninister the Act, is
ývery desirous that the belief of the commissioners, in contradistinction to fidings
of fact, ehould be eiiminated-that they
should flot express a belief, or should not

-You 'can have no facts until the thing

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Oh no, we are
now dealing with the inquiry as to the cost

question already, if this report will be contidential, or as other reports which are
put on the table of the House when they

reports mean only this, that the commissioners from time to time make reports
without any comments or any recommendations on the evidence; because if they make
no recommendation whafever, or no report
as to their views on the evidence, there
is no harni, and everybody would do as he

The position ci Solicitor

the gcv-'.rnment can either do without the

without a Soiicitor General for six mcnths,
and if they can get along for six months,
they can do so for t-;eelve, and so on. In
that event, the office is unnecessary, and
I ask if the lion, leader of the Izovernment

why is if that the demands of the former

Why does hie not respect his own opinion?

Hon. GENTLEMEN-Hear,

hear.

Hon. iAr. CLORAN-Tiien iuy next question is: How is it and why is it that the
present gover'nment ignores the 6enate ?
In the olden days of Sir John Macdonald,
Sir Mackenzie Bowell, Sir John Thompson and ail the others, the Senate was
honoured to have the services of at least
one, and sometimes two or three, active
ministers of the day. The present government has been in power for the past six
months and wve have no responsible minister, though we have a very good active one
without portfolio, and I think that the
Prime Minister is overlooking the ability
and capacity of the present leader of this
House in flot putting responsibility upon
his shoulders. The Conservative party.
which is supposed to uphold the institutions of this country, should look more to,
the dignity and the usefuineas o! the Senate
by having some of their colleagues in this
House in the miniistry. I suppose that is
a delicate point for the hion, leader of the
government to answer; but I stand here
toi say that there is not one man in the
cabinet to-day who is more worth 'v of
bearing the responsibilities of office than
our present leader in this -House.
Hon. GENTLEMEN-Hear, hear..
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-AII 1 have to say to

Hon. MNr. POWER-That is ail right.
The amendment does flot hinder that.

Hon. Mr. BELL-Ai long as it is not re.
pealed, it may be in the power of every
government to proceed with the expenditure. It is only in the first instance that
this government will proceed to make the
appropriations. If the experiment is found
satisfactory, I presume it may* be continued. It is weil known that the government of the United States bas adopted this
mode of promoting the construction of good
highways. It bas been in operation a good
rnany years. Any one who knows the condition of things in the arnaller provinces
realizes that some assistance is required.
For instance, Nova Scotia bas voted sorne
$200,000 for road purposes. It bas a deficit
of $170,000. It bas evidentiy borrowed ail,
or neafly ail, the rnoney which. is to be devoted to road purposes. It is quite evident
that the financial. condition of the majority
of the smaller provinces is sucb tbat they
must obtain assistance. Our treasury is
abounding and overflowing.

Hon. Mr. BELL-The amendment is a
deliberate charge that the government of
the day is not going to do this thing f airly.
,It says 'We cannot trust your efforts in regard to this six or seven hundred thousand
dollars. We do trust you in respect to
everything else. You can spend $17O,0OO,OOO
this year and we shall not dictate to you,
but when you corne down to this apparently
srnall appropriation, we cannot trust you.'
Why should we do that P Is it worth while?
If you make that change in the Bill, what
have you added to it P Nothing to give it
any force. ;The government bas the absolute power »o do preciseiy what the amendment asks for, and the representative of
the government tells us precisely what the
governrnent is going to do.

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-The cuckoo song.

Hon. Mr. DAV18-Give it to the provinces and let tbem do wbat tbey like

Hon. Mr. BELL--Shall we add to the
subsidies of the provinces per head ? That
would simply be to increase tbose subsidies. It might be done equally and fairly.
It may be necessary to do it; we do not
know as to that. But bere the government
desire to afford a certain amount of assistance to each of the provinces. and tbey
limit its application to roads. Instead of
paying $100,000 to the provincial goverfiment of Nova Scotia and letting thema put
that into tbeir general fund and appropriate it as tbey please, tbe government
of Canada takes the power to give them,
say, $100,000, and to provide tbat that shall
be applied to highway building and notbing else. What is the objection to tbat P
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Mr. DkNDURAND-Then why object?
Hon. Mr. BELL-Then you say : 'We
wont trust you, we want an instrument
signed, sealed and delivered, binding you
to a certain course of action.' There is
no doubt at ail the Bill takes power to
grant the money to the several provinces,
c'ven if those provinces fail to implement,
on their part, the expenditure, because in
the last section of the Bilhl the central governÉment is enabled to go and do that work

sures in a crude and unsatisfactory condition. We are simply trying to put this Bill
into the 6hape i which I have no doubt, it
would have been framed by the government if they had had lime to devote to the
work. Hon, gentlemen have said that we
have to trust the government in the expenditure of the untold millions which appear in the Appropriation Act. The hon.
gentleman must remember that in the Appropriation Act we get ahl the items.. It
sets eut how every dollar has. to be spent,
and where it has to be spent. There is no
blank cheque about the Appropriation Act.
The hon, gentleman f.rom Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Bell) admits that under this Bill the government
could
select
one
province
for special faveur, -or tiwo or three
provinces. We should be 'wanting in our
duty to the various provinces if we allowed
this measure to go through in sucli a shape
that it would be possible to favour one
province as against another. 1 think there"
are a number of hon, gentlemen sitting on
the government aide of this House who will
find it very difficuit indeed te vote against
this amendment.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The
doctrine laid down by some of the hon, gentlemen who have just spoken has been
rather a surprise to miembers in many respects. The question cf want of confidence
strikes me in this manner: The gevernment proposes to make an appropriation cf
money for certain purposes. They have announced their intention of distributing that
money in a certain way. The amendment
which -is proposed is tantamount te saying:
We have ne confidence in the declarations
which have been made, both in the Ceinmens by the Premier and by the gentlemani who introduced the Bill, and by the
leader cf the governiment in this Heuse.
You have told us that yeu propose te distribute this money in proportion te the
population of the different provinces. We
do net believe Yeu. We will bind ycu te
that declaratien for feae that you may be
misleading the public and migleadîng the
House. Hence we wiIl attach te that Bill

arn
from
with some remarks that have been made
on this subject. The lion. gentleman 'who
nioved this amendment says that every
one in the Senate approves of the Bill,
and the manner in wh;.h it proposes the
money «should be distributed. I differ
from that position altogether. There may
te, in the distribution of this money for
the purpose ol improving the roads in the
different provinces, a greater disposition
in one portion cf the Dominion than in
anothcr to expend a larger sure. Peihaps,
being a representative from Ontario, I
should not take that position; it havîng
the largest 1 -population of any province it
would necessarily receive lhe largest
amouant cf 'money. We hear a great deal
of the necessity for having roads and
railways in the great Northwest te enable
the producer cf grains te reach the depot
by which these commodities can be sent
te nmarket. We were told the other day
that some have te drive fifty, sixty and
one hundred miles before they can reach
a railway station. If we are desirous cf
dcveioping that country in the way it
ehould be develoPed, the governiment ehould
net be Testricted as te the manner'in
which they should dispose cf this money,
s0 long as it is done equitably. If it is net
distributed equitably, the goveTnment becorne responsible to the people and can
be condernned by thern. I arn Living MnY
ownl individual opinion upon these points.
I arn not discussing just now the propriety
cf appropriating any amount cf money.
Supposing the Senate should se amend
this Bill as te render it impracticable in
its working, and supposing the government, after considering the wvhole question, should decide te abandon the policy
involved in this Bll, they can then do
precisely as the late government dîd in
dealing with the Drumrnond County railway scherne. The Senate, by a large majority, rejected that proposition, because
they theught it was *extravagant in its
character, and for many other reasons.

MARCH 2-2, 1912

the House of Commons has before it the
argyuments that bave been advanced in this
House, their judgment will accept this
amendment. I protest against the doctrine
that this House should not adopt an
amendment because it may be in conflict
with the decision of the other House. If
that doctrine is to be ad-mitted, then, as
bas been said, we had better pack our'
traps and go home and let the House of
Commons run the whole show.
Hon. Mr. KERR-In the tirst place there
is not a single word in tbe proposed amendment whicb is in conflict with the proposa]
of the government as expressed by the
leader of the House.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Wby
put it in?
Hon. Mr. KERR-There is nothing wbich
wvill prevent tbem from. carrying out what
be says they are going to carry out. In
ilie absence -of words declaring their intention, we have to take a blanket Bill and
justify legisiation whicb leaves the door
open for tbem ta change their minds. Any
one wbo reads tbe Bill will see in the firat
section that this may or may not lie an
expenditure in more provinces tban one.
Tbe wbole of clause 1 conteniplates the expenditure cf money in any province, and
leaves it open to do it in any way they
please. The principle bas 'been accepted
by the aLlier House that iL muet be in proportion ta the -population in each province
and that it muet be done in each province.
Ail this amendment provides for is ta put
in writing this declaration whicli migbt.
or migbt not, be repudiated by soie members of the party on the opposite aide who
have already voted for the Bill, or it might
be repudiated by some members of the governiment, because it is argued that they
had a rigbt ta change their minds and
were not precluded. Tbis is a -plain propoeition and, as a matter of sound legisiathon and as a matter o! preserving the dignity of parliament, and as a protection
whicb. the Senate is specially charged ta
provide in the interests of the amahler
provinces, whîch may need this aid more
than the larger ones, I say if there is a
duty ta amend any Bill it is ta amend this
42

Bill. W~e are doing it in accordance with
the expressed declarations of the ministers as to their intentions. Under these
circumstances, I submit it would not only
be the heiglit of folly, but it would be a
great impropriety on the part of the Senate,
to pass this Bill in the form in which it is
presented, instead of in the amended formi.
As to the course tbe Comrnons may take,
that is a matter we cannei anticipate. I
should be sorry to think that, over a matter of this kind, we should be put into the
position of adopting such a course as bas
been hinted here. If that is an indication
of a threat, if it is something going beyond
what is reasonable argument, if it is an
assertion of power, or if it is an assertion
of an intqltion to carry out soenething
againat a chamber which is specially charged with thfe revision of these Bills, then
1 say our course is only made doubly clear.
Lt appears ta mée that the hion, gentleman

I said 1 hoped it was flot a threat. I accept the statement that it was not a threat.
Now, we corne down to a reasonable way
of dealing witb the matter. A mnan makes
a proposition to you and lie says «I will
do so and so,' and when lie is asked to put
it in writing he sits down and writes soniething what is only hall the bargain. You
state to him 'You said you would do so
and so.' He says «Yes, 1 ami to do that.'
Then you say to him, ' Put that in there
also and express the whole of the bargain.' That would be a reasonable proposition.
Hotn Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Go a

Hon. Mr. KERR-If niy lion. friend liad
some person representing him and the peopie for wliom lie was speaking, they would
have said, 'OCertainly this whole bargain

this government is speaking for the peopl1e
of this country as well as for its party, I
think it is only fair to say: T'ut. the whole
of the bond in writing, and then there can
be no misunderstanding.' 1 think the illustration tlîe hon. gentleman gave mie is a
very goodione, showing what is the every
day practice, that people do flot put haif

icy is entered into. If there is any special
circumstance by which the federal authorities may deem it in their judgment useful
to carry en such a work, then it seems to
me it will be the duty of the féderai government to seize parliament with such a
demand and to ask a spacial vote for that
object.

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-If we divide the
money equally among the provinces, I do
flot quite appreciate that view of it. Section 6 doca not aay that the governiment
can take advantage of tihe consolidated
funds in addition to the money specifically
voted.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-When my hon.
friend is asked what he will do under that
clause 6, his only anawer is that possibly
a condition may arise where the federal
authorities may need to expend a certain
sum for thi building of a federal road. I
have heard' my hon. friend fromn Portage
la Prairie <Hon. Mr. Watson) say: ' What
does that mean-a federal road.' We have
no such thing as a federal road. My hon.
friand cannot foresea any condition other
than the possible building of a faderai road
which would justify the federai authorities in utilizing clause 6. When you declare that the money will hac apportioned

means that the faderai govarnsnent will

which will take place after this session, it
appears that this legisiation nceds to be
implemented in the sense of clause 6, the
governmant will then be in a position to
show this Chamber why it should substituta itself to the provinces in the building
of roads and bridges.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The Bill now
reads tihat way under the amended section.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I do not think

Hon. Mr. LOtJGHEED-Yes there is no
question about that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURÂND-This 6th clause
was struck out while I happened to bc out
of the Chamber and I did not hear the
remarks that, were made. If hon. gentlemen will allow me, I shaîl1 answer the arguments any hon. friend puts up now ini
defence of clause 6. When the government
decides. that it will divide the money in
proportion to the population of the various provinces, then it recognizes that the
construction and imprfovement of highways
wvill remain, where it belongs, with the
province and the municipality. The provinces will carry on ihis work. Clause 6
says that under an arrangement sanctioned by the legislature and the Lieutenant
Governor in Council, the federal governnient may do it. I do not see how this
can ba carried out when the principla of
the Bill is that the money will be distributed among the provinces. When I put
the question: * What is the usefulness ol

with senior and junior classes and creates
niew classes, name]y, grades A and B. It
does a-way with the stanmpers a.nd sorters
of the 4th class and junior 3rd class, putting thern into the 3rd class. Grade B,
stampers and sorters, under existing law
reeeiving $500 can go up to $600 with incrernents of $60 a year. The 4th css coininences with $500 and goes Vo $700 with increases of $100 a year. The junior 3rd class
goes fromn $700 to $800. All these are replaced by grade B and the officers in this
class will receive $500 and go ta $800, wvith
s.nnual increases o! $100, a very small increase in each case. I might say that auother object in so classifying these officiais
is with the ultirnate result of bringing

Hon. Mr. WATSON-For the information
of the bon. gentleman, who is nat a member of the committee, I might say that
this Bill was referred ta the Railway Conimittee, and then referred ta a sub.committee of the Railway Committee, who reported
back ta the Railway Committee that thèy
had snch confidence in the draiter of the
Bill and the Bill itself that the sub-committee did not even take time ta read the
clauses, and the 'Railway Oommittee
passed it an back ta the House without
reading the clauses: so you have the Bill,

the samne way.

may say, that I feit fromn the outset, that
this, was such an important departure in

that the government should express its

It seerms plain ta 'ne that this Bill will fot
go through without the governmentt assuxning the responsibility for its final
adoption. Perbaps it is with a view of caliing the attention of the Minister of Railways to the fact that this Bill has been

and they expect to continue to get, dividends not onlv an the capital invested in
those industries, but on the watered stock
as well. The cost of living bas. gone up all

dividends that go to water and to windthis so-called stock that we know is wind
and water-and divide that money up
amongst the labouring men and artisans
that are working for them, there wvould
not bie so much complaint. The labouring
men of this country want to see that when
the investigation takes place they get right
to the hottom. of these things and expose
ail the wind and water that is now in the
stock of those institutions. They wvant to
prick the bubble, and see that those people
'will be allowed only interest on the money
actually invested; then the labouring men
will be able to get larger remuneration for
their labour. As it is now, they get a very
small measure of what is made by the
manufacturera, the largest bulk going to
the men who cau control tariffs because
the labouring men cannot do so. Therefore, I say, there is no class of people in
this country who have as much interest
as the labouring men in having a representative on that tariff commission.
In reference to agriculture, is there anybody who will tell me that the farmners,
'wbo produce the 'whole wealth of the country, are flot entitled to some representation on that commission?? There is not
one single thing that the farmers of the
west place on their farms in the way of
machinery that they are not taxed for.
The manufacturer is allowed to bring in
his raw material free, but the farmer has
to pay taxes on everything. If he inproves his place by hard work and industry and places on it $l,0WO worth of mnachinery, hie is taxed to the extent o! 171
per cent. -Surely the manufacturer is flot
the whole thing. We hear of Canada for

thing hie uses. The wealth that is produced by the agricultural c]asses goes into
the pocket of the manufacturer, and the
farmer should*have a representative on
that commission so that hie can see whiat
is b-eing done. Nobody has ever asked for
a commission, except the Manufacturers'
Association. The labouring people and the
farm-ers will have to watch that commission. I do not think a farmer or gardener
who lives near a manufacturing town
would be a proper representative. I want
a mnan who wiIl represent the ag-ricultural
intereats from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
It has been demonstrated by the deputations o! farme*rs that we have had down
here, that we have just as good men bandling the plough as any other men in this
country, men of just as much abilty.
There would be no trouble lu getting a
proper person from among the agriculturists o! this country to put on that commission, and the samne thîng applies to the
labouring people. The labourer sella bis
labour in a free market, and hie bas to
buy his necessities in a protected market.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I ueed not say

character.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I have exaffined the amendrnent which is so vague

made by my hon. friend froen Prince Aibert (Hon. '.%r. Davis) are worthy of
attention.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I arn sorry to have
the pronotitenent that the governrnent
refused to re4cognize the labouring classes
and the agaricultural class of this country
in these appointments.
My hon. friend

though it wvas drafted by the law clerk:
but if the government wished to adopt

There is no use dodging behind the phraseology of a clause in order to get away

Hon. Mr. POWER-It is more than that.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN--Would it flot be weli
for the hion. gentleman to tell bis colleagues that it is not fair or just that senators appointed towards the end of the s-ession should be fined because they were not

Hon. Mr. DANIEL.

He said:- The object of this Bill is te make

a change in the judiciary ef the Yukon territory by reducing the number of judges.
Under the present law a provision exists,
and we are working under that provision,
that three judges ehal] constitute the
judiciary off Yukon District.

These judges

MARCH 25, 1912
are entitlied te a salarv of $5,000 a year and
an É'lnwance of $5,000 for living expenses.
Owing te the reduction in population and
the corresponding reduction in ail other
interests in that remote section, it is now
ascertained that eue judge can perform al
the duties incidlent te the judiciary of that
district. It lias therefore been suggested,
and that suggestion is embodied in this
legisiation, that two of the judges wlio have
expressed their willingness te comply with
the arrangement, should accept a retiring
aiiowance of $5,000 a year during their
lifetime. The country would thus save
$10,000 a year.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARITWRIGHT
-Is it net possible toe crploy these gentlemen otherwise under the law?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-No, because the
judges were appointed for the Yukon Territory. There is ne machinery cf lavw on
the statute-book by which you could
compel those judges te accept positions
elsewhere. It lias however bee.n provided
that in the event of the governent choosing at any time, owing, to an increase of
business in that territory, te increase the
judiciary, that they shiould be sent back
te the position they formally occupied.
Trie Bill further provides tliat ovving te
the reduction of the judiciary, the court
en banc of that territery should be the
court cf appea!l in British Coluinbia.

-- Saving at the spigot and wasting at the

Hon. Mr. POWER-Economy, as far as
I can judge, has not becu the generai trend
of their policy. Now I -make this suggestion to the government: they are dispensing with the services of two judges, who
wiil receive a retiring allowance of about
$5,000 a year. These gentlemen who will,
when this Bill passes, be ex-j udges, would
be just the men to appoint as chairman
to some numerous commissions the present
gover.nment are creating, anid you can rely
upon their being fairly judicial and nonpartisan, as men knowing the law and of
more then average ability. r think it would

commission that has been appeinted to
inquire into the constitution and adminis,ration of the civil service, one of those
judges would be juat the kind of man to
appoint to that commission. The government could save a considerable sumn of
inoney in that way-th%- salaries of additional commissioners, or at least the retiring allowance of the judges, and I think
that is the spirit -which the hon. leahdr
of the Senate seems te be filled with-of
saving wherever we can. 1 do net wish to

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-We substantially adopted the different amendments Of
rny righ.t hion. friend, îvith the exception
of, peThaps, the amendments to subsection 1.
Rt. Hon. Sir 'RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Perhaps I had better explain iny object.
because I dare say we *lnay corne togef ';.-t
upon it. The only way .we have at pueflt
of getting information as to t' 4 true position of a lot of these factories and industries which. are constantly m-aking applications for some change in thie tarifi, is
throug-h the Census Report. Thiat report is
only good up to the end of the particular
vear in which it is made, and we neyer
succeeded in g-etting these census reports
in our hands until two or tlîree years have
elapsed. By that tirne great changes take
place and have taken place in the position
of many of these industries. It really would
be a matter of very considerable practica]
interest that we should have the latest intelligen- that could be obtained as to these
miatters. I will go ovez the whole of tbe
matter xith muy hon. friend iii detail. For
instance, the number of factories now existing vary sometimes, to my certain knowledge, enormously, within a period of three
or four years. I suppose the question of
the amnount actually expended in cash in
erecting and equipping the saine is one of
those lie feels some difllculty about. We
wvili say nothing about that. Take paragraph 'c ', it strikes me that is a point
upon wbich the governrnent should be informed and upon which the country ougbt
to be informed.
The question of Inergers is attracting a
good deal of attention, and my experience
has been that vcry serious frauds have bDeen
committ-ed hy the issue of buge bloclis of
wvatered stock, whicb is afterwards made
an excuse for demanding subsidies frorn
the government in order to enable the parties to pay interest on this stock, and an
argument is brought forward which I never
regarded with much favour myseif, but
which seems to have had favour in other
quarters, that inasmuch as gambling in
watered stock had been extensively dealt
in, and because a number of people had
been induced to buy this, I won't say absoâitely wvorth1ess stock, at -i higb price, that.

therofore it is nereSsary to protect them.
In all cases wvheie application la made for
an increase in the duty we ought to know
what wvas the real cost of the manufacture,
and we ougaht also to have a list of the
sýha'ýýh1'ders, and the amount and number
-,r shares held. There should be no diffi_ty about their givîng information as to
l
the dividends or the wages of bands, and
the number of hours' work per diem.
' G' is a simple matter apparcntiy, and
I think should be easily ascertained. If
this commission is, to do anytbing- like the
work which it is expected to, and wvhich,
from the. debates in the Gominons, it was
apparently intended to do, these are points
on w-hich we should have some detailed
information. From mv hion. friend's remarks, I gether that bis vicw was to lirnit
this; tariff commission to a ver.v narrow
sphere, inàeed, a§ compared with that
which wvas talked about in the other Chamnber. I dare say hie is right-I arn not at
,11 zure he is not right-that the tariff.
commission should be, if I underst-ood hlm,
sipya commission for the purpose of collecting" facts and statistios to be supplied to
the government of the day, and of course,
tb the public also. I dare say he is, quita
right. in that, and it simply deals, if it is
limit'ed to that, with two thiugs, I think,
one that tbey should obtain as f ull information as possible. I am bound to say,
that I do not see, under suchi circumstances, why ail these frilis and feathers should
be created. I do not see why we sbould
have men called. tariff commissioners paid
salaries equal to those of Cabinet ministers
for the purpose of doing what I can assure
hlmii could be.quite as well. done as any
expensive tariff commissioners that wc
can select may do. If we were toi select,
or ta allow bis bion. friend beside hlm to
select a dozen competent customns bouse
officers who had been in the habit of dealin" with these matters, and whom I could
select, I arm quite sure they would render
veery good service to the state, in the shape
of chief s of a bureau of statistics. But his
view, and the view laid down in the Gomnmons, appeared to me to be diverse, and if
his view is the correct one-and I think it
is-I do not exactly sec why ive should

the conclusion that the inquiry should be

them and devote their time exclusively te
the other inquiry.

Hon." Mr. LOUGHEED-I mean the Coinmons. I arn unaware of any representations

is sigùiified by the Bill.

Rt. Hon Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHTthe
Yes, ibut as V4o question of salary, I think
bii hon. friend besîde hlm (Sir Mackenzie
Bowell) can tell hlm that officers of very
cor.siderahke ability in the customns are paid
vastly smaller sums of money than we propose to gîve these gentlemen. I think the
bighest paid collector in our employment
is only receiving something like $2,500 a
y(ar. I thînk $4,500 is the maximum that
you propose Vo give Vo any collector of customs.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes, but especial
duties were assigned to them; it lias been
the invariable experience that you have to
-fix a larger salary where you create a
apecial office.
Rt. Hon Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHTThe doctrine that yon can lug in men from
the end of the earth and offer theni a good
salary, and that you get in that way exccptionally good men, is a very dubious one.
I would rather trust exiperienced officers of
Gui own than men you bring in. If it were
,pçssible for you Vo take the tariff entirelv
out of polities, that is another question altcogether; but my hon. friend knows that
cannot and will not be done. This business
of creating a tariff commission was supposed, when it was brought in, to mean that
these gentlemen would have practicafly the
f-.Fming of a tariff. Now, as I und-erstand
il the government, speaking through the
mouth of my hon. friend, entirely abandons
that view. They do not want Vhem eaven
to make a report as Vo what rate of duty
sbould be imposed.
Hon. %Ir. LOUGHTEND.

Rt. Hon Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHTThen I have misread the debate in the Gomnmnons and the remarks made upon it in the
newspapers and elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The suggestion made
by the riglitlhon. leadex of the opposition
in regard to inquiry in'to ithe financial condition of the manufacturers is a fair
one.
The right honourable
leader
of the opposition does not ask that the
tariff commission should have a right to
g-o into all manufacturing institutions and
examine them; hie limits the right to this
point, that when any firm, corporation or
individual
engaged
in manufactu.ring
cornes to the government asking for an increase of the rate of duty on his particular
fine of goods, that means that lie is asking the government to increase the price
of that article to the consumer. Surely
the consumer has a right to know the
ground on which the manufacturer asks
for an increase of the duty? It is that
class of cases to which the right hon, leader
of the opposition has alluded, and it surely
ib not a-sking too much to give the government an opportunity Vo investigate on
tlie Uine indicated. I wou.ld flot give the
-authority to the commission; but the minister should have a right to say to the tariff
commission: 'Go and investigate fully the
entire financialI and other conditions of
that industry. They are asking for an increase of duty and before the government
will grant it we must know the real state
of that business.' There is nothing perilous or unfair about that, and I arn with
the right hon.. leader of the opposition on
that point. WVhere manufacturers are content with the regular tariff and ask for no
especial rate, we have no right Vo investigate their affairs. As a legisiaVor I -would

MARCH 25, 1912

flot grant the governinent that right at ail,
unless there wvas some special cause, such
as a merger. The hion. leader of the House
wvill see the simplicity and reasonableneas
of the demand.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Of course I amn quite ready to amend the
proviso, aiter what my- hon. friend has
said, by striking out the words 'after 'in
ail cases where the commissioners report
an increase of duty.' I would u.ndoubted]y agree with himn ini striking out that
portion of the clause which refers to the
commission.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Of course that
deals with one phase of the asnendment,
and while the paragraphs are based on
that, yet the paragraphis thexuselves initroduce another element, naxnely the inquiry into the fruancial condition of the
company. Now, a number of manufacturera in the saine class may have ail the
variety of financial conditions that the humani mid cen conceive. Even suppose
onie of those manufacturers should have an
inflated financial condition, that should not
necessarily influence, and wouid. fot influence the framing of the tariff with reference ta that, particular line of manufacture, and yet et the saine time an inquiry
and a disclosure of the fadas which would
be ascertained as to that inflated condition
might be of the greatest possible injury to
the industry as a whole. As to the practice
of issuing bonus or watered stock, I
faau to see in what way Ttiat has an application to the framing of a tariff if the inquiry is based upon the cost of production
tram. the rswv material and transportation
up to the flnished product. They must flot
take into consideration that because a coinpany has issued bonus or watered stock
a dividend must necessarily be paid upon
it. An individual might say, 'While I
have invested $100,000 in this industry, I
ivould net teke two or three hundred thousand dollars for it.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The cost of production is a matter of
very considereble difflculty to get et. I arn

what devices are had recourse ta ini the ettempt ta get subsidies, and their neme is

plications macle during the last fifteen
yeers, and five years before that, for increases, and I know the kind of statements
made ta us and how extremely-I tvill not
say felsified, but extremely dubious these
stetements were, and the governiment, if
they are wise, will take precaution to arcertain whet the tacts are. My hion, friend
says it does not matter what amount of
dividends is paid. IL does metter. Nobody
in his senses, if lie knew it, would ellow

case additional subsidy is going to be
planted to a going concern-ivould think of
granting additional subsidy to an establishment paXing fifteen or tiwenty per cent
dividends ofi the amou.nt of capital actually invested.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I notice that the government are giving a large subsidy ta the
Timiskeming and Northern Ontario rail,way, which is a going concern and paying
a handsome dividend.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Perhaps it ia ; I have no information about that.
It
is not every
company that tumbles into a Cobalt; the
case is well put. At present, for the purpose o! getting information in discussing the
tariff, we are to an enormous extent ,limited
to the cenSUS Teturfis. Now those returns
are neyer up to date; they are always two
or three years old, sometimes four or five.
I think in the case af the census taken in
1891 it was six years before a good deal af
the information was brought down to us.
There wes a lot of information that I wanted to get and I had great difficulty indeed,
in extracting it from the government of
the day, although it wes there, and much
the samne thing I am afraid will accur tram
time to time. Now much, not ail, af these
amendments are just ta enable the tariff
commissioners to get information Up ta

I think my hon. friend should not abject.
His other abjections are an a question af

Sharp speculatars got contrai of those terminai and interior elevators and began

ta criticise what the gavernment may do
until we have had some further evidence

Hon. Mr. POWER-Tbe hon. gentleman

question with the utmost patience, and I
think with a good deai o! intelligence.
That committee did not favour governanent
ownership, and any anc who considers the
result o! goverfiment ownership o! elevators
in the case o! Manitoba wvill not be anxious
to eee the Dominion government going inta

ourselves ta this idea o! government ownership unleas it becomes absolutely necessary.

Hon. Mfr. YOUNG-The difference be,ween clauses 33 and Bill (Q) is that in

3. The provisions cf section 208, with the excepYtion of subseotion 3 thereof, shahl apply to

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I have a motion te
strike ont this clause. AI] the grain producers of the w-est are opposed to it. The
men who produce the grain are the men we
should consider, and not the middlemen
or the men who are there for the purpose
of making money out o! the grain growers.
This clause is supposed te establish a
sample market for the seliing of grain at
Winnipeg, Fort William and Calgary. It
w~oiid be an immense benefit te the elevator combines w-ho are always looeking for
an advantage, but what good would it be
Vo the people who are mostiy interested?
The grain business cf the west is controlled
Dy a monopoly. We have it in the evid'Ence that w-as taken by the Senate comiiittee. I mîght read from the evidence
of the witnesses te refresh your memory.
Yeu wvi]l find the interests represented by
such men as Douglas, Heffelfinger, Serle
and Morrison. They tell us that they ae
int-ertwined in one great mionopoly. They
contro7l net only the terminal elevators,
but the interier elevators aise. Some cf
the companies, like the Peevey control
four or five interior elevator companies.
It w-as supposed te be doing business and
conipeting in the interior Vewns, and they
controlled everythi-ng. Wîth those gentle-

697

men controlling the terminal privilege at
the head of the lakes, what advantage
would there be to anybody to go on a sainpie market and buy grain? What could
they do with it when the elevator combine
controls ail the binning facilities at the
head of the lakes? You cannot buy grain
on the sa-mple market and make any use
of it unless you have a place to store it.
Does any person think that the different
members of the elevator combine are going
on the sample market to compete with one
another? No independent mnan would wish
to purchase grain and put it into hins controlled by the monopely for fear they wouid
mix it. One of these clauses in this BUi,
subsection 'e ',. and the other clause I
opposed in this House in reference teo damaged grain that went through and is incorporated in this new Bill, show that those
in favour of a sampie market are the combines who wvish to get control of the cars.
If yon interfere with the distribution of
cars, you wiil throw the producer of grain
into the hands of the lnonopoly entirely.
A sample market wil do themn no good.
The combine wiil coliect the wheat in the
interior and take it to terminal points and
mix it. The large milling interests have
their own interior elevators. They can buy
at street puices and get ail the grain they
want. The other man who cannot take advantage of the sainple market is the eastern milier, and the foreign miller because
they have no storage facilities and could
not keep the identity of the grain passing
threugh privately owned elevators.
Hon. Mr. WVATSON--The miller is opposiflg it.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Certaiiily, because he
is a sensible man. But can a nian preserve the identity of his grain geing
through those elevators that these gentlemen who are so expert at manipulating
control? What condition would his grain
be in a! ter it goes throughi ail those different processes that w-e hleard of iast year

is only one way you can have a sample

by the lion. gentleman froin Prince AIbert,
the people whýo are dealing in grain as a

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The

England goes to the mnarket wit-I his
srmples of grain, and sells it. The purchaser buys it subject to the character of
the sample, and if the fariner bas sold an
improper sample lie suffers, but the pur-.

these companies are supposed to be affording some competition to the people in the

Hon. Mr. POWER-I was prepared te
vote for the amendmeût of the hion. gentleran from Prince Albert (Hon. Mr. Davis)
but it seems ta me from. the observation
made by the leader af the g-overnment and
flhc amend.ment which. he proposes that
there is something ta be said ag-ainst th;s
amendment. There appears ta be a unanimous sentiment against the mixing af grain.
I think the wiser course is ta accept the
axnendinent moved by the hion. leader ai
the governiment, and not ta insist upon the
anendment proposed by the hon, gentleman
fromt Frince .Albert. We ought ta strike
out these words in lines 8 and 9, «and the
mîixing of grain permitted in connection
therewith.' We do nat want mixing of
giain under any circumstances, and if the
haon. leader of the goverrument will consent
ta have these words stricken out, there would
be very little abjection ta his amendment.

SENATE

I have neyer raised my voice ag-ainst that
decision, but I have never inet a lawyer
who bas been ab]e to explain that judgment. Up to 1871, according to the school
law of that.province, we could establish,
and did maintain, separate sehools ali
through that province. We received our
allotments of money un-der that law. An
agitation was started a few years before to
bring in a non-sectarian ]aw. Our rights
could not be taken frorn us until the old
law was repealed. It was decided that we
had no rights in law, but 1 cannot understand that decision. The law that was in
existence at the time of the passing of this
Act in New Brunswick gave us the privilege of establishing schools in every part
of the province. We had what was called
superior schools in New Brunswick, and
that seerned to sway the opinion of the
Judicial Comrnittee of the Privy Council,
because these schools were a grade under
the grammar schools. Some of theie schools
were started by the Baptiste, and sorne by
other denominations, and sorne few by
the Catholic people. Every session of parliament we had to ask for a special grant
for the support of these superior sehools,
and it was a question whether parliament
would vote that grant every session or not.
1 would like sorne lIegal gentleman to tell
me why we had no rights under the law
in 1871. We were able to keep our sehools
going in any part of the province where we
*wished to establish Cathollic schools, and
we did keep them going.
Now to-day in New Brunswick there is a
rvery happy condition of things. I amn glad
to say that while our rights from the legal
point of view, have been denied, the administration of the law is pretty satisfactory and we have schools now that suit
very welI.
W-e have no great cause for
conp'laint in New Brunswick, and do not
complain, and I amn not complaining now,

siens M~'anitoba is at last coming into its
own. 1 could neyer understand why the
aiea of Manitoba was so restricted by the
governmnent which had to do with settling
thefirst boundary, in the midst of millions
of acres of wild and unremunerative land.
Every government since the first delimitation has pursued the same parsimonious
policy, but now, under the present Conservative administration, the hopes and aspirations of -Manitoba are brighter, and it
is gratifying to find the government with
a just appreciation of thîs question. I
would lîke to 'have seen not only Manitoba, but 6askatchewan and Alberta, given
full autonomy, full control. of the public
domain within their borders-and neot kept
longer in leading strings; and as to subsidies, placé themn in the same position as
the provintes -which control their own
lands.
It is demoralizing to provincial governments to be spoonfed for years, and thousands of dollars thrown into their lap for
which they did not toil or spin. They
should be allowed to work out their own
financial arrangements.- In turning over a
newv leaf with a new Liberal government
in power, the provinces of Saskatchewan
and Alberta should bave been given full
autonomy and less money. I have how~ever, noticed wîth pleasure that the Premier, in alluding to the new provinces in
his comprehensive and masterly speech, intimated that it is the intention before long
to place the land within the bordera of
these provinces under their own control.
I noticed also that the Premier intimated
that the maritime provinces, Nova Scotia,
Newv Brunswick and Prince Edward Island,
would not be forgotten, but no intimation
was given"of considering the Pacifie province in any readjustment, although it contributes three times as much revenue per

from doing what was, right in the interests
of the Cathelies cf that territery. I could

that we must net in our laws sew seeds of

grant supplies of any kind, or involve directly
or indirectiy the levying or approbation of any
tax upon tée cpeople, they must be initiated in
the populfar branch, in accordance wi.th law
and constitutional practice (f).
Section 53 of the British 'North America
Aot, 1867, expreselly provides:
Bills for op.propria-ting any part of the publie revenue, or for i'mposing any tax or i.mpost
shah1 originate in the House of Comomne.
And a etanding order of -the House of Gommons deôlaree exiplicitly:
Ail aids and supplies granted to Her Maîesty by the parliarneat of Canada are the oole
gift of the House of Gommons, and aUl Bis
for graating such aids and supplies ought to
begin with -the House, as it is thle undoubted
r.igh't of the Hlouse te direct, limit, and appoint in all sueh BIals ilie ends, purposes, consideratione, conditions, limitation6 a.nd qualificiations of such grants whieh are flot alterabie by -the Senate (g).
In what respect does*this aniendment infringe that rule? There is nothing which
deals with supply or which, directly or indirectly levies or appropriates any tax upon
the people-absolutely nothing. It does flot
involve any expediture of money, and I do
flot think any one will argue that there may
not be in the Bi'lmonetaryand other provisions. If the monetary clauses corne within
the provisions of the rule, they could not be
altered by the Senate, but surely it would
not be contended seriously for one moment
that a Bill which cont.ains other provision,
in addition to the money provisions, could
not be altered by the Senate. ht would be
absurd. Otherwise ail the House of Comrrons would have to do would be to put al
its legislation into the Supply Bill and this
House would be reduced to absolute impotc-ncy. That contention, on the face of it, is
absurd.
lo.n. Mx. LOUGHEED-While it is a
pleasure to hear my hon. friend deal with
tis subject, it is necessary, in view of the
fact that the Chamber has accepted the
ruling of the Speaker, there has been no

fippeal from bis ruling, and for the purposes*
of the debate we accept iL as being proper.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT-That may be £0,
b>ut I rise for fear some hon. friend mav be
inclined to think that the amendment infringes the rule. If my argument is not
eonvincing, a simple reference to Bourinot
at page 69-9, will suffice. He says:
It is frequently found convenienit t0 introduce Bis involviing public ex.pendîture in the
S,-nate, and ini euch case, the money causes
are euabodjed in the Bill as presen-ted, in arder to make it more intelligible; when the
Senate goes into comnmittee on the Bill, these
clauses are ordered to, be 1sf t ont. They are
printed in red ink or in italics in the engrossed Bill sent up to. tihe Commons and itre
technicaily supposed to be blanks. Tliese

elausàes aré always considered in a

pTeioua

cermimittee by the Comnions, and then regularly referled to the Commi.ttee of the Wbole
on the Bih. In the samne way, reeolu-tons impo6ing a tax or duty must ha alone considered
by the Gommons, a.nd referred -to the ornniittee on a Sena-te Bull.
There is the very provision which provides that a Bill may be initiated in tlua
House containing both monetary provisions
and other provisions, and whilst the Senate is precluded from dealing with the,
monetary provisions, jurisdiction is given
to it to deal with questions that are not
monetary. The whole question is whether
-tila amendment is one affecting supply or
is for the purpose of levying an appropriation for any tax upon the people. What is
there in this amendment which in any way
concerns supply or levies or appropriates
any tax on the people? The mere reading of
the rule seems to me to be absolutely conclusive that this is not an amendment of a
monetarycharacter. If there are anyinclined
to vote o'n that ground, I submit they will
not be justified in doing so. The argument
which h-i. been set forth by the hon. rnember is based on common sense and backed
by the authorities. I hope the hon, leader
of the government will not insist on having
the Speaker rule that iL is a money Bill
because there happens to be a financial
clause in if. I know the calibre of the
leader of this House, and he knows wvhat
le says in that regard is not founded on
sense or justice. If he were not ln the,' position le occupies lie would flot urge it, because if his view should prevail this House
would become an enipty nothing, and we

led infallibly te the sa-me conclusion.
This is easy ef deinonstration.
The territories are under the immediate
control and government of the federal
powe.r.
The only 1a-ws that govern them are federal laws. The ordinances aiter a-il are
merely regula-tions a-uthorized by the federal la-w, reipeala-ble a-t wvill, annullable at
a-ny tim-e.
Net beîng provinceýs, no provincial laws
could they have, ner could the territories
acquire suclh rights a-s provincesz create for

Yet those territories are none the less

rý ghts which a-pplies te provinces on their
entry into the confederation, applies equallv a-nd with the sanie force te those saine
territeries when they, in turn, enter the
cc.nifedera-ion.
Now, a-s a matter of fact, the Northiwest
TErritories nre subjeet te that legislation
ef 1875, passed by this parliam-ent and
which, ful.ly thirty seven years a-go, nccorded
them sepa-rate and denomina-tional schools.
That law has neyer been repealed.

It stîll exists, a-nd le as far as concerns
st-parnte a-nid denlomineýtional1 schools, it e.xisis, just as it was passed in 1875, withouit
ever ha-ving undergone a-ny modification.
Therefore the territories corne into confedera-tion witih righits and privileges remogn-ized and g-iven by law~.

The niews of such an outhurst was ieceived

I was in Rorne at the trne, and at the request of th2 Canadian authorities I left the

ances I had received, shewing thçm the docu-

ments aboya cited. This largaiy contributed
to dispel fears and te restore confidence. The
delegation which. had been delayed. was defi-

nitely decâded upo-n. The delegation appoi1nted several iveeks before, received their commission afresh.
They proeeded. te Ottawa,

copenad negotiations with the federal authorities,' and wvith sueh result that on May 3,

1870, Sir John Young telegraphed te Lord
Gran ville: «Negotiartions with delegateýs rio6ed

The negotiatione provided that the denom'inational or eeparate achools wouId ha guaranteed te the mdnnrity of the new province

of Manitoba. The French language raceived
sudsh recognition. that it was deci6ed it would
lie used offici*aiiy both in parliament and in
the courts of Manitoba.

The Manitoba Act was then passed by -the
Hlonse of Commons and Senate cf Canads,
and ssnetioned, by tise Governcr General.
I may a4d that since these pages were
written, the highst judicial tribunal of
England, in a ce'lebrated judgment reccgnized in that legisiation tise character cf
a solemu piedge when it said:
There de no doulit eîther what the points

Act of 1870, which wss in truth a parliamen-tary compact, must be read.
The interpretation given by the Privy
Council te tise Manitoba Act, does not
inereiy apply te that province alone, for
the good reason that the agreement (pacte>

The spoliation was manifeat. The federal

That which is granted ta the minority of

in Alberta and Saskatchewan ta the minority of those two provinces.
The demonstratian ai this will be br'ef
but positive.
Clause 93 ai the British North America
Act reads thus:
93. In and for each province the legielature
may exc.lusively make laws ini relation to education, suxhject and according to the following
proviisione:

?f the ardinances of the Northwest Territorles, passed ini the year 1901, or ivith respect
to religions instruction in any public or eeparate 6chool a6 proviîded for ini the said ordinances.'
Such a clause upsets the entire spirit of
clause 93 of the British North America Act,
because it substitutes in the first paragraph of the imperial enactinent the words
sejarate sehools for the words denominational schoo]s, restricting it thereby ta
those separate schoals only that conform ta
the ordinances ai 1901, a protection which
heretafore guaranteed the existence of the
denominational schools that the law racognized.
In -order ta understand the nature of this
exceptional legislation which. was irnpqsed
on the new provinces and ta seize the full
scape of the crying injustice which was perpetrated upon 4 he Catholic and the Fcrench
rnînority af the Alberta and the Saska.tchewan. we need but ask ourselves the meaxxing of a denominational school and that of

of the district in which it is establishe>d;
it is the school of a minority that wili not
or cannot accept the instruction given to
the majority.
The separate sehool is that which faces
thc publie school.
It need net necessarily be a denominational school.
For example, in a school district where
the Catholic inajority has a Catholie public
sehool, consequently a denoininational one,
the school of the Protestant minorit-y becornes a separate school which. might perfectly well be, and very likely would be, a
neutral school.
This is a fact that none wilI dispute and
which the sohool system of the province of
Quebec, imoreover, most clearly illustrates.
For its part, the law confirms the doctrine
that 1 propound when, in clause 93 of the
British North America Act, it mentions the
powers, rights and pxivileges of the dissentient schools of the Queen's Protestant
subject.s in the province of Quebec (paragraph 2), and the rights and privileges
ci the Protestant minority in every province in which a separate school system
obtains (paraggraphi 3).
In fine, the Northwest ordinances o! 1901
upon which rests the school enactment of
the Autonomy Law o! 1905, ordain-(c]ause
14)-that the minority, Protestant or Catholie, of the ratepayers of every district
<clause 45) may establish therein ii
rate sehool that will be subject to ail the
ob',gations imposed on publie schools.
It is, therefore, more than abundantly
proven that a separate is flot necessarily a
denominational school, and that, in Alberta
and in the Saskatchewan such a school canflot even be a denominational school.
The iniquity of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's legislation, is now apparent in ail its ugliness
to eyes that WEI flot lose sigcht o! the distinction which has just been established
between the denominational and the separate school.
The constitution guarantees the preservation of denominational schools in ail provnces 'wherein such schools have had aiready a legal existence at the time cf the
entry of any of themn into the confederatien.
Hon. Mr. LÂNDIl!.

In 1875.. by a special enactment, the federal parliament granted denominational
sehools to the Northwest Territories.
In fact the law of 1875 gave the majority in each sehool district the right t-o
liave whatever school it thought fit, consequently the right te denominational scheOls.
Consequently this right given iby law was
safeguarded by rparagraph 1 of clause 93 of
the British North America Act, and the
Catholic niinority, wherever there was one
ini the school districts of the Northwest
Territories, retained, guaranteed 'by the
constitution itself, the privilege already
obtained.
What did Sir Wiifrid Laurier do?
WiLh a stroke of his pen he blotted eut
from the British North America Act the
mords denoroinational scheols and substitutes therefor the words separate schools.
By that one stroke the Catholics ef the
Northwest Territories, in the districts in
which they are the majority, have lest
their righit te denorninational schools.
The niineritv aione, and only in the districts in which such minority exists, can
lienceforth. have separate schools, but
separate schools such as they are constituted by the ordinances of 1901, that~is te
say, separate schools from which religious
instruction is banished.
This is what the Laurier-Sifton amendment gave te the Catholics of the NorthWvest.
That which our constitution guarantees
in gýeneral terms to ail the other provinces
cf the Dominion, Sir Wilfrid Laurier
snatches violently from our charter and
deliberately refused it to the Catholics o!
the new provinces.
And Catholics are found who proclaim
thcmselves satisfled with this guilty deed
of spoliation and wvho, in dust and humiliation, ask that ive join freely in the sacrifiee of their rights and in the glorification
of that iniquitous piece o! legisiation.
We have ne part in it. We wish to defend, our rights, despite the unqualified
blindness of those who have eyes and who

But why seek elsew'here, that wvhich Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, himself, explained in euch
clear termes in the nowv historie letter which
hie gave to- the public, and in which he
said to one o! hie friende who had con-c
sulted hi-u on the subjeet:
Ths impression prevaila that fflparate

will be ecclesiastical schools. This is quite
an error. What you caîl separate sehools in
this instance is praetically national sohocils.

As a matter of f met, the objection of Roman
Catholies 4o schools suoh as alone receive
state aid under tihe Act of 1U&0 is conscientiens and deeply rooted. If thim had nlot been
mc, if there had been a system of public
education acceptable ta Catholicq and Protestants alike, the elaborate enactmnents whicah
have been the stibjet of se mach oontreversy
and consideration would have been unnece-smary. It ie noterious that there were acute
differences of opinion between 'Catholics and
Protestants on the education question prier
to 1l870. This la recognized and ie enxphasised
in almost every line cf those enactmnents.
There is nq doubt either what the peints of
dif erences were, and it is ini the light cf
these that Othe 22nd section cf the Manitoba
Act of 1870, which was in truth a parliamentary compact, must b. read.
Those findings of the Lords cf the judicial
comm-ittee were followed by an imperial
order in cuncil whieh said:

Let us, in the first place, see what was

That judg'ment has been commented upon
by Sir Wilfrid Laurier a few days ago in
such a sophistic manner that *it is necessary to give here the words cf the flndmng of

One must flot forget-as Sir Wilfrid

by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, that we must read
the findings of the Privy CouncUl.

schocls from aU payment or contribution te
the support of any other sehoole.
The great mistake whicé, was made byv the
governiment of Sir Maokenzie Boweil in' that
Remedial Order was that they were ordering
the province of Manitoba te do more than
tiey who had passed the Order couid enforce .
If the province of Manitoba refused te coinpiy with the Order, tiey could very well have
passed a Bill, which wouid exempt Catholics
and the minority from paying taxes to the
public schools; they oould very weii have
passed an Act giving the right te the minority te organize their own schoels, but they
could net by any Act of legisiation or by
order in counicil, or in any maniner whatever,
give away the funds of the province of Manitetba te the separate schois.* And in thiFe
they made a fatal mistake; they introduced
a Bill and, Just ais we had anticipated, while
the Bill authorized the legisalture to pass a
Separate School Act, te, exempt from taxation the supporters of separate scbools, they
coudd not give te the schools any share in
the public meney and therefore, if the Reineidal Bill had become a remedial law, the
achools which migit have been organized
eould net have received anu f und6 eut of the
public treaaury; they would be at once placed
in a position of inferiority and therefore the
settiement could net be satisfactory ta the
minority.
Such was tic contention of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, and I heard seme day or two ago
my hon. friend from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) affirma the samne doctrine.
But, as usuai, whencvcr lie finds it convenient, Sir Wilfrid lias forgotten, and very
checrfully forgotten, what la known as the
Dupent amendment, an amcndment which
thc member for Bagot had given notice ta
the House e! Gemmons, the purport of
wiich. was preciscly te meet the case o! a
refusai on the part o! tie legialature of
Manitoba te contribute the proper funds
for the maintenance of the Catholic separate schools.
That amendment read as follows:

to those who endeavour te prevent the

At one time Manitoba violated c:ne of
those solemn and binding treaties.
*A case %vas made which f rom court to

t.he Privy Council, and an order -was given
tio the Manitoba legislature to, remedy the
injustice it had committed.
That Remedial Order was signified to the

up to, this. date, bas refused to coznply
wvith it.
On the other hand that same province,

the Dominion is to-day, asking the Canadian parliament for an extension of boundaries.
The territory to be annexed is actually
governed by the laws of the Domninion and
its population, under isucli laws, dlaim that
it has a right to denominational and separlate schools.
Those riguhts are denied by certain ministers who contend that the Dominion laws
do not apply Vo the proposed annexed territory, and should they apply, that the proper machinery to render themn operative
has neyer existed and, finally, that by the
British North America Act., 1871, no change
,,hlatsoever could be made in the constitution of Manitoba.
We have established beyond a doubt,

The Act of 1876 has been the only law
affecting the Keewatin district between
that year and 1905 or 1907, and under it,
during that time the mînority had no right

At the outzet I may say that without examining minutely into every Act passed by
the Federal parliament it can be plainly

those contained in the Act of 1876 which
was the only law governing themn, and in

the people at that meeting assembled,

and the territories also, pledged themselves
to be perfectly satisfied with a settiement
on the lines arranged with Saskatchewan
and Alberta with regard ta that question.
Now, that is not the pound ai flesh. It is
just a question ai fair compromise. My

hon. frîend who made such an appeal
against the amendment has, simply done
this-he has relieved the government iromi
the obligation which fails upon thein as
fai as he can do so; but they cannat be
relieved ai that obligation. They are
handing over a large slice ai territary ta
the province of Manitoba and getting clear
ai the obligation that is oni their should111

Dc minion territory the obligation resta
with this parliament; once it passes inta
the province of Manitoba, the legisiative
pawers will belong ta the provincial legislature ai that provnce, I arn satisfied ai
that. But l;efare it passas there, why in
the name af gaadness could nat the government say ' we do not want ta impose
extraordinary conditions; we do not want
ta coerce the province ai Manitoba; we
do nat want ta take you by the throat;
but be generous as others are generous in
this country, and have given evidence of
their gencrosity; be iair-minded; be broadminded, because this is a big country,
and yau have got ta live on terms oi
iriendly feeling with yaur neighbours, na

ed in 1871, and when he noticed the Bill
that was heing introduced he gave expression to the following language:

Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-In looking
over the debate in the other Chamber in
1875, -it is quite clear, from the current of
thought that prevailed, not alone on the
part of the government but on the part of
the opposition, that ijn gîaxiting, a constitution to the territories in the manner %ve
did, certain îights that were then set forth
would be for ever preserved and that they
could not be changed. That was the opinion, not only of Mr. Blake, but of Sir
John Macdonald, and of the leading mnen
who took paît on that occasion. I have
under my hand here the observations made
by Mr. Blake as to the necessity for thse
preservation of the rights of the minority.
Alter eoncurring in the opinion that the
powers which were thexi being granted
were very much larger than were then assumed, Mr. Blake spoke on the -Bill

jntroduced by Mr. Mackenzie.

refusai of the peoffle to acknowledge God
in their schools has drîfted into infidelity,
and forty or fifty millions of the population
neyer bend the knee to their Maker. They
have Taised the god of Mammon and the
god of Reason, believing that it is unmanly
to recognize anything they cannot coinprehend. Faith has vanished from the
land. You see the consequences of it today. I have here the remarks made by
the leader of the Church of Scotland in
Canada, speaking of the population coming

Their morality is 10w; they recognize nothing but mammon, nothing but ternporary
prosperity. That is w-here we are drifting.

is to be called ini a few days, and one rnember draws attention to the fact that unless religion is introduced into the schools
they are drifting on to immorality. WVhy,

unless by the charity and ki;ndly feeling of
the non-Catholies to preserve our rights and
privileges, there is an object lesson in the
province of Quebec that ought to be taken
to heart. As I mentioned the other day,
at the time Quebec came inito the confederation it wvas assumed that the dissentient
schools existed there by law, and when it
was found that they did not exist by law,
Sir Alex. Gait resîgned, but atonement
was made. The moment Quebec became a
province, rnost lîberal laws were adopted
conferring on the dissentients the right to
establish their own schools. There is not
a high school in the province of Quebec
that is not subsîdized by the Quebec government. An immense school was organized for the purpose of teaching Protestant
ininisters. ' In the face of that, how can
non-Catholies in parliament take action
ta deprive the minority of the rights and
privileges claimed by them, in view of
what they see pervailing in the province
of Quebec. Is that a noble examele ta the
people? I have here the opinion of Mr.
Robins, who for 30 years wvas the superintendent of the Protestant schools in the
province of Quebec. S. P. Robins, L.L.D..
Principal of McGill Normal School says:
I wauld do less than justice ta leading
politicians of ail shades in this province if
1 were not ta state xny admiration of the attitude which they maintain towards educatioli.
During an association of more than thirtye
years with the public education of Quebec, an
association whioh has repeatedly brought nie
a suitor on behalf of education into contact
wvith men of influence of ail political parties,
1 have found a unfersai desire for the spread
of popular education, a wiilingness to listen
patiently ta the viewv of practical educators.
a wide love of fair p1ay for the educational
rights of the minority, and a determination
to hoid the precious interest of education
aloof froni the turbulent arena of political
party.
Surely that example is worthi following.
I feel deeply grieved on this occasion at
the apparent decision of this-House to rab
a mninority of the rights and privilegzs
that were guaranteed ta it under the constitution. It ia a very seriaus blow. It is
the firat time that the Upper Chamber bias
so acted. When my BTi'l came before the
Upper House of the old province of Canada in 1863 what was the vote? Contents

line. The Upper Chamber lias flot on one
Eingie occasion snce the introducetion of
governiment into Canada failed to respond
Io an appeal from the mînority to proteet
its righlts. It is a discredit and will make
thoze who corne afterwards, I hope, blush
that this Chamber now, with the large
majority they possess, deliberately refuse
to recog.nize rights whatever they may be
fhat have been sacredly .promi'sed under
our constitution. 1 arn not making any
reference to Manitoba; it is hopeless.
Nothing could be more sacred than the
agreement under which Manitoba came into
confederation. The Act passcd in the Canadian parliament and the Imperial parlisment, and continued during the long period
of nineteen years, without anybody calling
it in question, and a madcap like Martin,
who now represents one of the slums of
London, off his own bat took the view of
the matter that hie would create one school
and telling everybody to attend to that
particular school. 0f course it hias been a
failure. The Catholics in many parts of
Manitoba continued to subscribe to the
public school and at the same time to support their own school. 1 saw it was hopeless for this parliament to make any move
in that direction, and that is why 1 did not
advocate any action in regard to it, but
so far as making a declaration in regard to
the territory we are annexing to Manitoba
is concerned, it is our bounden duty to
make provision for any rights they have.
If they have none, it amounts to nothing,
but any rights they have should be honestly and fairly preserved.

Manitoba wlth a population cf three or four

No wonder Catholics do net go into that

Hon. Sir RICHARD ISCOTT-No, the hon.

Hon. Mr. McMULLEN-What is the condition cf things in Manitoba to-day? They
have r. common school system. Any Catho-

MARCH 26, 1912
lic or Protes~tant minority have the right ta
arrange with the teacher af a section to
use the last hall haur in the evening for
the purpose af giving religiaus instruction.
They can came in if they choose and teach
the Catholie catechism or the dogmas and
doctrines of the Catholie church for that
hall haur. The Protestant minority may
do the same thing. It appears that the
Catholic minarity are nat quite satisfied
with that arrangement. Their idea with re.
gard to instruction in schools is, apparently, that the religion should be the leading ieature of education within that school.
It is made the leading feature. In the common schools secular education is made the
leading feature, and the schoal is opened
and closed. with prayer. In case the minority in any school section dlaimi the right
ta give religiaus instruction for the last
hall hour, those who do not agree with
the proposed instruction ta be given have
the right ta withdraw from the school. I
should like ta know why aur Catholie
friends are not satisfied with that arrangenment. They ought ta be. Surely they can
arrange ta give their children in the last
half hour af the school day ail the religious
instruction necessary. At the time the
question af the establishment af separate
schools was up in Manitoba I occupied a
seat in the House of Commons.
After
studving the ivhole question, I came to the
conclusion that if yau were gaing ta divide
the very limited number of sehool children
in Manitoba, and put thema inta two camps,
separate schools and common ichools, yu
would impose a very costly educational
-ystemn upon that province-a teacher hired
at three, or four, or five hundred dollars a
year ta teach three, or four, or five pupils
in the common school, while another
teacher would be employed in the separate
school, perhaps acrass the way, or at no
great distance, ta teach four, or live, or
six Catholic children. I contend that the
educational system of each province should
aima at giving ta the children an education
ta fit them, in a business sense, for the
battie of if e. A secular education is an absolute, imperative necessity for the children, girls or boys, ta fit thema for the duties
of life. Christian education is aiso necessary, but it should be given in the church,
in the home, or in the Sabbath school. Our
48

Catholic friends think that they cannot
manage to educate their children in a religious sense in these three places, and
they want to contrai the schools and make
religiaus teachiig the leading- element in
education. I do flot think it is right that
the children should be deprived of the
right of a thorough education to fit them,
for the battie of if e. I have no desire ta
trample upon the rights or the conscientious convictions of any Catholic or Protestant.
1 want ta afford to them the f ull
privileges I would like for myseif, but 1 do
flot believe in attempting ta force Manitoba to perpetuate any privileges that
those people in Keewatin may have
had. To attempt, by legisiation ta compel
Manitoba ta continue those things will
only resurt in Manitoba finding ways
and means
whereby they
wvill get
araund any restriction or .provision you
may place upon that province. Sa far the
(Jatholics have not been unjustly deait
with In Manitoba, although they themselves are in lave wîth separate schools that
give religiaus instruction f ram beginning ta
end. That is the feature af the educatian.
1 think that they are fairly well used, and
while they have the right ta take possesý
sicr af the cammon schaol for the last haîf
liaur and give religiaus intructian in itý
with the privileges and rights that they
enjay, as far as church matters are concerned, as far as the Sabbath schoals are
cancerned and in the home circle, 'I think
they should be well satisfied. They should

the same rights and privileges that the

nation should aim at a high standard of
education for the rîsing generation, and it
is better, in the interests af the Catholie
minority and their children, that they
should be educated aide by side wi.th the
Protestant children and thus 'be prepared
to compete successfully for the honours
that an efficient, thorough education would
bring them. It is better for them, and 1
anm sorry aur .Catholic friends do not see
it in that light, ta get education aide by

side with the boys withi whorn they wvill
have to compete in the battie of life. I
regret that we have over again this neyerending fight on the separate school question. I would rather have peace and barmony. If our Catholic friends could only
see it as they ought to see it, taking advantage in Manitoba of the opportuflity
offered them by the public schools, they
would be ready to bury the hatchet on
this question and take the situation as it
now exists.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I think this is the
most sensible amendment which bas been
moved to this measure. It is not a question of separate achools so much as one
of rights. I have pointed out that this
section of territory that has been taken into Manitoba does flot .belong to that province. It is keewatin, and the people in
Keewatin have not asked to corne into
Manitbea; Manitoba wants to take them in.
If they have any rights, those rights should
be settled before they rre taken in. If a
vote of the people in that territory had
been taken as should have been done, and
the majority of the people in Keewatin
had voted to go into Manitoba without any
guarantee of rights, I would heartily support the Bill. I submit, on broad principle, that the people who are interested
in that territory should have been consulted. If there is any question, or doubt,
in the mind of anybodly with reference to
these dlaims, it should be settled in some
wvay. Eminent lawyers in the country
dlaim that certain rights exist. We have
also a certain other school of lawyers who
say those rights do flot exist. Who is going to settle the question between these
two opinions, given by equally competent
learned men? I see nothing wrong in this
amendment. We should obtain the opinion
of the Supreme Court. The question would

tained by conciliation than by force. You
cannot take these people by thc seruif of
the neck and throw them into sornething
they do flot want. There is nothing wrong
in this proposition. It is exactly in line
with the proposition made in the other
House when a gentleman introduced a Bill
with reference to the Ne Temere decree.
Hon. Mr. MeMULLEN.

A question arose as to the jurisdiction of
parliament in thîs matter.
One body of
aawyers eaid the people of Quebec had certain rights, and another body of lawyers
said they had none. The governnxent said
we will get a decision from the Suprenie
Court and ascertain the rights of the people. If that was the proper course to pursue in one case, is it flot right in the other.
more particularly as the people o! the territory have flot been consulted P It would
*xave been fair to have taken a plebiscite
if the people who are going to be taken
into Manitoba.
Not having done that, a
decision of the Suprerne Court would have
the effeet of quieting the feeling in the country, because if the finding is against our
friends who submait dlaims, I think they
will loyally accept the decision o! the court
and everything will be settled in a satîsfactory way. If you put the Bill through
in its present form, you are flot goîng to
settie the matter and you will have trouble.
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-I desife to ask the
hion, gentleman from Wellington one question. Re seemas to be wedded to one great
scystem o! public education for the whole
people. It is a broad question, and that
presientation of the case appealIs to many.
Supposing we have two sehools in a town,
cay in -Manitoba, one attended by fifty or
one hundred Catholics and the other a publie school attended by fifty or a hundred
zion-Catholics, and supposing the separate
school gives a complete system of secular
education; supposing, as 1. dernonstrated
the other day, that school outstripped th?
public sehool in resuits in secular studies,
what right bas hie, or what right bas any
mnan, to corne into that school and tell me,
a Catholic, how much or how little of my
faith I rnay teach in that school? Catholîcs
feel deeply on this question, and no matter what cornes or goes, no inatter how
much taxes we may have to pay to our own
school, or how much we may be forced to
pay to other schools, we will always and
everywhere have our own system o! education.
Hon. Mr. MdHUGH-As hon. gentlemen

Hon. Mr. WATSON-It might be just
as well to understand what this Manitoba
school lawv is about w'hich there is so much
WVe have heard some very
controversy.
Severe criticisms on the way in which the
Roman Catholic minority in Manitoba
were treated by the mai ority in that provinct. The school law of 1897 exubodies the
settiement arrived at between the federa]
and provincial goveruments of that date,
and that Act provides for the religlous instruction, and specifies the hours, the days
and aIl Auch provisions that are made. It
is a short Act, and reads as follows:
An Act to Âmend the Publie Sehools Act.
(Assented to 3Oth March, 1897).
Rer Majestv, by and with the advice and
consent of the Legislative Assembly of the
province of Manitoba, enacts as follows:
1. Religious teaching, to be conducted as
hereinafter provided, and shall place in any
public school in Manitoba;
(a) If authorized b-y a resolution passed by
the mai ority of the school trustees cf the district in which the school is carried on, or

2. Such religi*u teaching shall take place
between the eurs of 3.30 and 4 o'clock in
the afternoon, and shall be conducted by any
Christian clergyman whose charge includes
any portion of the school district, or by any
person duly authorized by such clergyman, or
bya teacher when so auithorized.
3. Whlere s0 specified in such resolution of

of parents or guardians, religions teaching

children is forty or upwards, and in villages

I certainly think there is a miscouception
in the minds of some people. 1 said the

SENATE

other day, during- the debate, that 1 did
flot think the question would have arisen
except for the purpose of making it a football. That has been done in Manitoba, and
probab]y tried to be used that way elsewhiere in the Dominion of Canada. As far
as the Educational Act is concerned, the
Catholic minority should have no cause of
complaint. I cannot fully appreciate the
scruples they have about religion and teaching religion during school hours. It is probably a good thîng, but so far as the
affairz of Manitoba are concerned, 1 arn
proud to say no0 such condition as ha&
been described by the hion, gentleman from
Victoria division <Hon. Mr. Cloran) exists,
or ever did exist, in that province. The
relations between the Catholic minority in
that province and the Protestant rnajority
are very agreeable. There is no bigotry,
as far as I know in the way of Protestants
persecuting Catholics, and I think the representations made here by some lion. gentlemen advocating arnendments to this Bill
should not be quite so severe.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I had occasion
to examine this question as far back as
1908, when the proposition was made to
the Manitoba goveriment by the late government to extend the boundaries on certain lines. 1 then studied the question to
the hest of my ability and came to the conclusion that, on the question of law and on
the question of policy, I would support
such a Bill as the one which is now before us. What I had decided I would do
when sittîng on the other side of the House
1 deterrnined to maintaîn and carry out
when on this side of the House. It is a
question of law and policy. I will not apollogize differing on a question of law1
from- the hion. gentleman
from Victoria division. And I will not apologize
to any one for deciding what is the
best policy to be followed. It is a question
of judgment and conscience. I have felt
that the best way to serve the minority
1ii
Keewatin and Manitoba was to follow the
lines 1 am now following. A few days ago
I voted in favour of an amendment to
postpone the discussion in order to allow%
the federal government to enter into pour
parlers with the Manitoba government to)
see if ail the grievances that are claimed
to exist in Manitoba could flot be removed.
Hion. Mr. WATSON.

I stated hast niglit that I hesitated considerabiy in doing so. I was reeady to speak
on the second reading before the amendmuent was proposed, but as I felt that my
speech might perhaps have some influence
in weakening the decision of some of my
colleagues in voting for the amendment, I
abstained from speaking before the amendment was voted upen. The result was just
as I had foroseen. My misgivings were
absolutely correct. We eeparat-ed on racila.
and religious lines. This is what I want to
avoid, and that mistake I shail not repeat
this time I shail vote against any amendment.
Hon. Mr. FORGET-As a Roman Catholic, in 1897 j accepted the settiement made
by the late government of the Manitoba
school question as the very best that could
be made under the circumstances. While
holding this view, I amn free to say that 1
have the greatest admiration for the then
Prime Minîster of Canada, who took the
bold and manly stand which hie dîd in
trying to push through the House a
measure which hie thought best for the purpose of settling the grievance of the Roman
Catholics in Manitoba, but which proved
But, as I said
his political destruction.
before, in accepting as a Roman Catholic,
the settiement which was made by the late
government of the Manitoba school question, and believing it was the best that
could be made under the circumstances,
I say that, if it was good enough for 25,000
Roman Catholics in the whole of the province of Manitoba, it should be good enoughi
for the 50 or 100 Roman Catholics who are
to be found in that portion of the Northwest Territories to be added to Manitoba.
I am in favour of the Bill as prepared by
the government. 1 am against any amnendmient whichi could in any way endanger
that Bill or postpone its acceptance by the
province of Manitoba. 1 say that I amn in
favour of it on political grounds. as wvel
as on grounds of good policy. The present
government cannot afford to delay the passing of a Bill of this kind, and the Liberals,
who formi the majority in this House, caDnot take the responsibility, as a party, (,f
delaying the acceptance of that Bill. We
know that in the past five or six years the
late government was charged with delaying

MARCH 26, 1912

purposely, for political or other reasons,
the enlargement of the province of Maitoba. Whether right or net, the charge was
made against the late government, and if
to-day the majority of Liberals who compose this ýHouse were to act in such a way
as to defeat the present Bill, it would be
regarded simply, to my mind. as a confirmation of that charge. Therelore I say
for political, as well as public reasens, I
am in favour of the Bill.

order to ascertain the righits of the Catholies in Keewatin. There is no coerCiOfl.
I arn sure the lion, leader of this House,
who has not said a word thus far, was
waiting for an amendment of this kind,
and that hie will rise and say that hie accepts it.

in 1875.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-He is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-It seemed to
me a somewhat harsh condemnation of the
men of the day, and I 'wondered if hie was
expressing the fact as it reaily is. We are
to-day facing a situation which did not
obtain in 1875. This Bill has passed as it
is, in the form in which it is, because it
has been feit that as a question of law it
was inopportune to move amendinents; at
ail events, a certain number of inembers of
this Chainher were -act.uated by that conviction. I have no dou.bt that there had been
an apparent exhibition of intolerance in the
province of Manitoba in 1890 and I would
not like to compare the sentiment there with
the sentiment which exists throug-hout other
provinces. Comparisons are odious, and
comparisons that I would make to-day,
seemingly favourabie to a province, would,
perhaps, be found to be untrue to-morrow.
But here we are now with an aniendment

shou.ld like to raise a point of order as to
this amendment. I should like to point
out Vo, the hon. the Speaker, and to this
Chamber that in the first place it is not
germane Vo the Bill. It deals with a subject which is entirely foreign to the Billin the second place if is repugnant to the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-In what respect?

Hon. Mr. OLORAN-That is the worst
of it.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-In the third
place, it does flot propose in any way.ý to
affect the Bill. The only expression that
parliament can make touching upon'a subject upon which it legisiates, must be contained in the four corners of the Bill. If
that were not the case, there would be
no conciusiveness to legisiation. Now, I
miay say in the fourth plaée, that this proposes giving instructions to the government, and no such, precedent can be found
as giving instructions to, the governinent to,
deai wvith a subject attached to n Bill and
not deait with in the Bill.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-If nmy hion. friend
will wait tili I amn through I will answer
anv question hie may wish to put to me.
The 'Manitoba -Act of 1870 contains the
words « at the union '; those words stili remain in the Manitoba Act, just as they
have been ail along; they wîll attach to
them exactly the samne opinion that tbey
have had ail along in reference to the province of Manitoba, so that in no respect, in
no way, does this proposed arnendment
amend or seek to amend the Manitoba Act.
It merely purports to define the meaning
oi certain words in the Manitoba Act mnasfar a:- they would be applicable to the territory which they are now annexing.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Would my hon.
friend permit me by way of illustration.
Suppose my hon. friend from London (Hon.
Mr. Coffey) said that the woTd 'union'
should mean the province o! Ontario, what
'would my hon. friend say? That is practicallv what hie does.

Hon. Mr. YOUNG-Surelv we are getting
nterpretations.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That is, it departs from the original compact of union
between the province of Manitoba and the
governmxent of Canada as confirmed by the
Imperiai Act.
The SPEAKER-Yes, 1 understand that.
but 1 do flot understand that this amendment amends the British Nort~h America
Act of 1871.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It places another
meaning on the word 'union.'
The SPEAKER-It places a meaning;
that meanixig may be good, or it may be
wvrong. lUit is good it does not interfere
wvith the Act. If it is wrong, as any judge
will decide, they will not be bound by the
meaning that we may place on certain
words in the i.mperia-1 statute.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-The amendment

Now. in what way does that amend the
Act.
It shall be held to -mean in respect of the

Surely that is not an amendment to the
Manitoba Act in any way. If this aniendment passes, section 22 of the Manitoba
Act, will remaîn absoluteiy intact, untouched. I think the point of order is,

Hon. Mr. POIRIER-I do not see that we

that is for the Supreme court tc, decide;

The SPEAKER-The pa.rliament of Canada took upon itself to strike ont ail the
first section of clause 93 of the British
North America Act and insert in its place
a new clause. The words 'denominationa]
schools' were stzrick-en ont a1together and
the words ' separate schools according to
the ordinances of 1901 ' were put in. That
was an amendment of the British North
America Act. It mn ay be said that in constituting a province the parliament, may
have certain rights it does not have when
merely annexing territory. There snay be
a distinction. *But I say that At has been
in former days by the pai-liament itself. I
do not mean that we have a right in this
c ase to substitute a new clause for another
one. I want a little more light on that
Snbject than I have niow.

The SPEAKER-If 1 understand this
aniendment, it is a cl anse added to ther
interpretation clause of the present Act.
The present.Act in section 2 has two paragraphs, (a) defining what the province of
Manitoba iieans, and (b) defining what,
the word 'King' means. This motion is
to add a third paragraph defining in wh at
way we should understand the word 'union'
when we read it in the British North Amnerica Act.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-WilI
the Speaker tell me whether that is an iM_

different consideration. The Northwest Territories Jay there, and the central government have the right to ereet those territories into provinces on whatsoever terms they
choose.
Hon. Mr. 'BELCOURT--Of course I do
flot dispute that. In one case we were
creating provinces; in this oase we are
annexing part o! a territory ta a province;
but I pointed out the other day-and this is
a matter that has been lost sight of by xny
hon. friend and a great many gentlemen
in this House, in discussing this inatterwe are making a bargain; it is a pure and
simple agreement we are making wîth these
people; and il we take words froin another
statute surely we can define the nieaning of
these words, just as we would in inaking,
say a collateral or additional. agreement ta
another agreement. We say 'Here are certain words to be found in the British North
Surely in making this

agreement we have a right ta define the
meaning o! those words in applying ta this
partieular territory.' There is actually no
difference whatever except that in one case
we were creatîng provinces, and in thils
case we are annexing part of a territory. I
say we dýid in 1905, almost in exact words,
what is naw proposed by the amendment
of the hon, Mr. Coffey.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I rise ta support the
point of arder raised by tee hon. leader
of the government in this Hanse; not, however, for the reason that he baG urged in
support of it, but by 'way of calling the
attention of the hon. Speaker ta the point
which he bas raised: In 1905 when the
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were
constituted this parliament was acting in
the discharge of its duty under the Imperial
Act of 1871 which enables this parliament
ta create provinces and ta give them a constitution.
0f course, in keeping with the principles
of the British constitution, and, as was
very properly ,said by the hon. member
from Ottawa, instead of repeating word
for word, or with certain changes, as
a matter o! canvenience only, section 93

767

'vas used by way of referehce, and in making certain amendments in the reading
of that section 9,3, parliament was clearly
in the exercise of its duty. Coming now
to the point of order, if the laws regarding
sehools had not, by* the Manitoba Act,
which is the constitution of the province,
been made a part of the constitution of the
province, then I think the amendment
woul be perfectly in order; but, according to my understanding of the question,
by the constitutional Act of the province
of Manitoba, the privileges of the minority in school matters were made a constitutional question, and that constîtutional
question governs the whole province, not
only as it may be constituted to-day, but
as it may be constituted to-morrow; and
I claim that it is flot because new territory m ay be added to the province from
time to time that this parliament has a
right ta say that part of the territory annexed shail not be governed by the constitution of the province; the constitution
has to extend to the whole province.
Hon. GENTLEMEN-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE,-By way of explaining the position I have taken on this quemtion, and which I take agaîn, I dlaim
that it is part of the constitution of Manitoba and that the ameudment seeks to,
place the new .territory on a different footing as regards schools from the balance of
province.
The SPEAKER-Does the hon, gentleman
refer to the Act passed in 1887? What does
the hon. gentleman oa.1l the constitutional
Act?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-The Act of 1870, as
confirmed by the Imperial Act o! 1871. It
is the constitution of the province, and my
point is that that constitution applies to
the whole province as extended fromn time
to time, and thst it is not within the power
o! thîs parliament to prevent that cons8titution from applying to the whole province
as it may be extended from time ta time.

feel in niy soul that wlien these expressions
are s-ent out -the people will be more
honest, wi!1 take them to heart and live
up to them. I do not expect justice at the
hands of Manitoba next year, or in ton
years or, probably, in 100 years. My ancestors had to wait 700 years before they
got justice. My ancestors, and the an,cestors of na.ny of you were hunted like
wolves. They fouglit for their riglits; tliey
were not silenced by the voice of the British parlianient, or the dicte.tes o! the British governient. They went from hedge

I beg
his pardon, but LIsay expressions of opinion
have been made here on the floor of the
Senate on several occasions that the minority of Keewatin should flot get the protection to which they are entîtied because
they are amail in numbers and weak, and
some went s0 far as to say that they had
not petitioned Wo have their rights protected. On both questions those hion, gentlemen were wrong, because the people 0!
Keewatin had petitioned this government
to protect their rights. Then, as to the
population of the country, it is unworthy
of a representative of the people to say
that because a people are smail in number and weak, their riglits- should be sacrificed and thrown to the dogs. I hold that
the government of the day has been given
ample opportunity, every possible means
whereby to rectify this condition of things,
and ail those who have spoken in support
of the amendments to the Biii have done
so in the beat of faith, in the interests of
freedom, in the name of the constitutions,
in the name and on behaif of conscience,
and on behaif and in the name of a poor
feeble people. Now what could the leader
of the government advise his colleagues in
regard to our action except to say -' Weil,
gentlemen o! the government, the Senate is
proposing amendments, not wîth the oliject of destroying or injuring the Biii, but
simply Wo improve it, simply to secure a
littie measure of protection for a poor unprotected people.' That lias beeii our attitude from the beginning.

coming Womy last word on this subject: I
heard an hon. member say, in my presence
and in the presence of others, that God
Almighty could not change the Manitoba
law. I thouglit at the time when I heard
the expression that it was an awvful blasphemy-' God Almighty himself, could not
force Manitoba to change its law.' I do
not accuse the hion. member fromn St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Larivière) o! having given
expression to that statement. To my mind,
it was an outrage on human decency and

truth and honour. That is a sad condition
of t.hings, and this Bill, as it is, will go to
preserve the present condition of things,
until we, the mninority, are able to convince the rnajority of the future-not of
to-day, they are too blind, too bigoted, too,
dishonest to-day to admit the riglits of a
poor, long-suffering people.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-I do not rise to,
propose an -amendment, but just to quote
the words of one who might be listened to,
especially by the party now ruling this,
country. 1 desire to quote a few words,
from Sir George Ettiene Cartier, spoken
whien lie was about to leave for England,
for the Capital where the founidations of
confederation were about to be discussed.
The event took place on the 3Oth October,
1866, at a great banquet given to him by
his admirera in the city of Montreai, and
that very question which has been oceupying the attention of this House for so long,
and which.has been before thie country for
the last 20 years, was brought up;. it 'will
take but a few moments to read what he
said in concluding his speech. That wvas,
the question uppermost in the minds of the
people at tbat time. It particularly occupied the attention of the Protestant minerity of Quebec at that period. They were thp
ones who w'ere against gîving a legisiature
to the province of Quebec becau-se they
thought the rights of the Protestants would
not be safeg-uarded by that legisiature. They
tvanted legislative union, one parliament,
and no provincial legislature, and the reason
was that they did not want to be at the
mercy of the French Catholic majority of
Quebec. In order to get the confidence of
the Protestant minority of Quebec, as' welI
as assuring t.he Frenchi, or Catholic aninority in the other parts of the Dominion that
they would *be as fairly treated as they
would be- in the province of Quebpc. he
said:
I arn aiso a Frenchi Canadian, as a great
nuinber of those I see around me. 1 love my
race, I have for it an affection wh.icb is quite
naturaL but as a politician and a citizen, 1
love also the others. And 1 arn happy to

drom the wording of this clause, I can see
.no iiecessity for making such a recommen,dation. The Internai Economy Comrnittee
must have had some basis for coming to
that conclusion and for makingz this report, otherwise it shouid not h ave been
mnade. Say what you please, any one reading that report can corne to no other conclusion than that some improper payments
ýhave heen mnade by officials of the Senate.
lion. Mr. THOMPSON-That, is the report in reference to the estimates which
ýcontain amounts te be paid to the officiaIs
-of the Senate. The only action the cominittee could take -%vas to affirm some principle of which the Senate w-ould approve.
Hion. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The
expianation bears out what I have said. If
the committee had stated as a fact that
~money had heen paid by officiaisz without
the authority of the Senate, then I could
.understand the reason for putting it there.
[t-simpiy states that such and such pay-rnents shouid not be made.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-You wiri remem'ber that the estimate that was before the
House of Commons ivas before our committee. That estimate contained amounta
1o be paid to oifficiais of the Senate, that
'.had not been approved by the Senate. This
effirms the fact that uiitil they are ap.proved by the Senate, althoughi they appear in the Appropriation Act, tis Senate
-Îvill nlot consent to the payment.
lion. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-That
îs the position I take, that the inference
-to be drawn from the wording of this clause
is, that the moneys which appear in the
-Appropriation Act, and which Nvere referred
to the commîttee, had been paid to officials
'which hiad not been approved by the
.Senate.
-Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-It has not been

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I fully

no money should be paid to officiais unless
it has been recommended by the Clerk and

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The
reason I did not refer to that point is, that
I made the suggestion that the report should
be considered paragraph by paragraph.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-The mover of
the resolution to adopt the report has flot
discussed the whole report. I think the
first clause is out of order, because it just
declares a principle, It is declared that the
Senate has a right to make the appointment, and that it is for the conimittee to
say what the salary shaîl be. The committee are to make the report to the Senate on
matters that have been sent to that com
mittee. 1 think the clause can be accepted
by this House and when th e salary is asked
for, then we can see if the appointment
was approved iby the Senate. WVhen we
corne to the other clause I will take further
objection.
Hon. Mr. McMULLEN-I think a certain
latitude should be given to the Speaker and
the Clerk of this House to inake arrangements at the commencement of the session
for things that are necessary. For instance, in the case of pages, they will be
anxious to know whether they are going
to be engaged, so as to make arrangements
to attend. The Clerk of the Hoitse, aiongwith the Speaker, should 'bc in a position
to say to these pages that they are going,
to be employed. It would neyer do to keep
ail these positions in an open condition
until the Committee on Internai Economy
meets. The Clerk of the House should
have the right to f11l any of these positions,
and ask the Committee on Internal Economy for their approval.
Hon. Mrx. WATSON-I think the Internai Economy Committee should have control of ail the matters refenred to in this report. .In the past, authority has been granted to the chairman of that committee to see
that the pages, messengers, &c., were provided durinz the recess. There has been a

MARCH 26, 1912

sort of conflict ever since the Civil Service
Act has been applied to the Senate staff. I
believe the beat interests of the Senate and
staff could be served by the Internai Economy Committee dealing- with ail those matters referred to in the report. I do not see
how any item in this report can be declared to be out of order, for the reason
that ail those matters in the report have
been referred to that comimittee by the Senate. It ia for the Senate to adopt or reject a report as they see fit. The committee have deait with the matter as their best
judgment directed. The control of our staff
can be beat arranged by that committee. If
the Clerk and the Speaker are to direct all
the affaira of the Senate, then the committee can be dispensed with at once.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I fuliy
,concur in the remarks of the hon. gentlemnan, but unfortunately ive accepted the Civil
Service Bill as it came from the House of
(ommons, which placed certain powers in
the Speaker and Clerk, and they are in
the same position as a miniater of the
Crown and a deputy head. They, therefore,
deprive the Internal Economy Committee
of the powers they formerly possessed and
exercised. I quite agree that that committee should be placed in the position they
,occupied previously, but I sav that they
overatepped themselves in dealing with
duties which belong to the Speaker.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-There is one
lunction of the body which has its importance and whieh. the hon. gentleman lias
flot alluded to. It is that of the Governor
in Council, which. is the Senate. 1 have not
.examined this report in the light of the
powers which have been g-iven to his
~honour the Speaker.
'Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I referred to that. I said the reconimendation
had to come from the Clerk to the Speaker
and then be confirmed by the Senate.
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND-I always understood the recommendation corne from
.the Clerk, or deputy Speaker, to his hon-our the Speaker, but these mattera have
'-been returned for discussion and concurxenee by the Senate. I have always held
that, although the Civil Service Act stopped
there. when the Senate vas seized with a

775

the
report coming from. his honour
Speaker, At was within its jurisdiction and
power to refer the matter to any standing
committee, the Internai Economy Committee, the Debates Committee, or any committee which would be most likely to deal
with it more intellig-ently. It seems to me
there is a control of the action of our ministers by the Senate, which takes the place
of the Council.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-What seems to
trouble his honour the Speaker is that he
has assumed, with regard to the employees
during recess, that they are to be under the
control of the chairman of the Committee
on Internai Economy instead of failing to
the Speaker or the Clerk of this House.
The Chairman may be entrusted with
those duties. The first paragraph says:
s0 f ar as the Chairman may be
'In
authorized to do &o.' So that it is openi
to the Senate to leave a part of these duties
to either the *Cierk or the Speaker of the
House.
Hon. Mr. POWER-As there are some
hon. bon. gentlemen in the House who are
not f amiliar with the practice which. has.
prevaiied in the past, I think it may be
well very briefly to state what it has been.
Any hon. gentleman who looks at Bourinot
wvill find iA stated there that the Senate
have been most jealous to control their
own staff and keep their financiai affairs
in their own hands, and that the Senate
have appointed a committee, which is now
known as the Comxnittee on Internai
Economy and Contingent Accounts, whicb
looks into ail these questions and reports
to the Senate. When the Civil Service
Aniendment Act of 1908 was introduced,
there was a feeling on the part of a good
rnany hon, gentlemen at firat, that this
Act interfered considerably with the control which the Senate had before that exercised over ita employees; but when the
hon. members of this House came to consider the question, they found that that
was not the case. They found their action
was a little more roundabout than it had
been, but that the control remained still
in their own hands. As iL is now, if anythîng wvas to be done with respect to the
salary of any officer who is receivinz more

SENATE
than $500, the first thing is that the clerk,
who is the chief executive officer of the
House makes a recommendation to hie
honor the Speaker, and bis bonor the Speaker submits that recoxnmendation to tihe
Senate, and the Senate is then in a position,
just as is the Governor in Council, with
respect to the varions departments under
the Civil Service Axnendment Act of 1908,
either to deal directly 'with the recoxnmendation made by bis honor the Speaker on
the memorandum of the clerk, or if the
members of this Hous feel that they are
not aufficiently informed on the matter, not
sufficiently up in the details, hie may refer the 'matter te their Committee of Internai Econoxny and Contingent Accounts,
wbich is a fairly large and intelligent committee. Some of the xnembers, at any rate,
have had a great deal of experience and
know a good deal about the staff of the
Senate, and they consider the matter referred to them and report back to the House
with their conclusion. It bas been the
general rule, although nlot a uniform rule,
that the House bas accepted the reports
of the coinmittee, and it does seeru to me
that there is no reason why we should depart from that practice. The ibeginning of
the report means that the Senate propose
to retain in their own hands, and not to
depute to his honor the Speaker, or anybody else, the rigbt to deal 'witb these
matters which, in the past, have been
dealt with on the recommendation, generally, of the Internai Economy Committee.
The concluding portion o! this paragraph
o! the report says:

case any emergency should arise, bel ore
the commit-tee is constituted at the next
session of par]iament, then the chairinan
o'f the committee should have the right teset pro tem, and I do not think that is an
objectionable provision. Here ie the report
of the committee adopted by the House on
the 2nd of September, 1910:
Yoar committee would reeommend thait during recess any vacancy necessary to be filled,
or appointment absolutely neoeseary which under the opinion of the Justice bepartment
does nlot corne wxthin the irovislions of the
Civil Service Aot, shall be m~ade by the Chairman of -the Cormmittea on Internal Econon2Y
and Contingent Accounts subject to the conflu-mation of the Comniittee at the next ses6ion oif -parliament.
That is just what I stated the practicewas. The question is whether this House
shafl retain the control exercised ever
since the Senate was a Senate, or whether
it vvill abandon that and allow it to pas&
into the hands of some other party.
The SPEAKER-I would ask the hon.
gentleman if he will give me tili to-morrtOW.
Hon. Mr. POWER-We have spent a
ereat deal of tîme over this thing.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I cannot appreciate that there is any point of order where
the matter has been referred to the committee by the Senate. I have taken the
point of order. It is the old fight over
again. Last session the other Speaker had
the same controversy goizng on, and u-e
should settle it once for ail, whether the
Senate are going to rule, or uvhether the
Speaker and the Clerk will rule. Both caunot rule.

AID TO AGRICULTURE

BILL.

SECOND READING.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moyed the second
reading of Bill (100) An Act for theAid and Encouragement of Agriculture.
He said: The purpose oi thîs measure is
that a special grant be made annually by
the Dominion government to be distributed
pro rata amongst the provinces, on the basis
of population, to aid agriculture. It has
-been discussed very much of late in the
press and in the House o! Commons, and it
is not necessary for me to deal at length
with it.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARDJ CARTWRIGHT
-Does it state the amount of the annual
grant?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-No.

cial governments but with that fundamental
principle that the distribution shall be on
the basis I pointed out-population. It is
purely for the promotion of agriculture.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-Is anything said
about its application?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It is difficuit to
outlie what its application may be. Oue
province may desire it applied in a particular way and another differently, but it
would have to be the recuIt o! mutual arrangement betweeu the two governments.
IL is to co-operate with the population in
promoting the best interests of agriculture.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-There is a very great distinction between
this and the Highways Bill, inasmuch as
agriculture is one of the subjects assigned
by the British North America Act to the
federal parliament, and they have the full
right Lo deal with it, and everybody will
desire Lo see agriculture aided in every way
and shape- that it can be doue.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bll
was read the second time.
At six o'clock the Speaker left the Chair.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-I do not see any
great objection ta appointing one of the

this particular case it could nlot be carried
out, because they are desirous o! securing
a judge who is competent ta hear evidence

creating the position. The local government creates the position, and the D)ominion makes the appointment. You can flot

in their places.

%vork of the judges in Ont.axio. We have

iudges in the city and district of Montres.],
and I -am not exaggerating when I say
that a citizen who brings suit to recover

to keep abreast with the number of cases
constantly broug-ht before the courts, there
were a nuniber of judges allotted to certain
*districts in the iower part of the province

and when '-nI. Chase Casgrain was Attorney
General for the province of Quebec, he
tried to chance the mode of allotting theni,

was not apt to forget them It struck me
that' if the system proposed by Chase Casgrain had been put in force and the eystem.
of local judges had been adopted, as was
the case in Ontario, the country would have
been saved much expense. I gave a great
deal of attention and study to -the question, not studying the law, but the facts
connected with the appointment of judges,
and I quite agree with the hon, gentleman
from York that in Ontario there are a
number o! counties in which the junior
judge is altog-ether unnecessaary and the.
expense should flot be incurred. I hope
this government wilI not follow the example o! the government they succeeded
and appoint judg-es 'where they are not required. I hesitate nlot to eay, and the
statement is confirmed by my bon. friend,
that it la little lesa than a crime to make
appointments which are absolutely unnecessary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I admire the
rnemory of my hon. frienid who recalîs this
case from Gaspé, which. was cited when rny
hon. friend was in the other Chamben.
That was an extreme and exceptional case,
but he is right in stating that there are
many judges in Quebec who have flot very
rnuch work to do, while the Montreal judges
are overworked. I n'as sunprised to hear
that. the saine situation prevailed in Ontario. Some efforts should be made to try
and remedy the evil which was pointed, out
bý. my hon. !riend from Montreal, .because
M\ontreal is in dire need. of three more
judges in the Circuit Court o! Montreal,
which is similan to the Ontario County
Courts. There is in Montreal a very
larg-e population, but we have to face
political conditions in Quebec as in
Ontario, very ]ike]y. The old idea oi decentralization is finmly rooted ln the county
rural parts, and it is hard to persuade the
members who rely on popular sentiment to
alter the systema when they have to lace
the opposition o! their own electors.

Bill is to extend the charters of the Canadian banks, which wiil expire on the Ist
of July next. It aiso provides for the enlargement of the tirne for the emergency

or t.heir capitalization. It is proposed to
enlarge this time from the Ist of September
to the end of February, in fact giving two
additional montha. During this tiane the
crop is being moved, and it is regarded as
necessary that this additional time should
be given so as to admit of the emergency
circulation 'being calied in. I might say
that it is the intention of the governmnent
at the next session of parliament to bring
down legislation consolidating the Bank Act,
and otherwise amending. it. In the meantime, it is proposed to overcomie the absence of any leg-islation in that direction
by extending the ban], charters.

not have beeiî prevented, or the suffering
and loss ýof the people prevented to a large
extent if there had been sorne inspection
at the head office. It lias been objected that
a bank having 175 branches could not be
inspected, as it would be impossible to visit
ail those branches; but the government
need flot inspect a single branch, only the
head office, because the history of ail the
failures shows that the rascaiity was perpetrated in the head office of the bank.
Hon. GENTLEMEN-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL-The branch'Qs

which sends out its inspectors, and no
trouble ever arises *at the branches; but
the head offices are neyer inspectEd except
by their own. inspector, who is under the
control of the general manager and the
board of directors, and the g2eneral manager is usually supreme in a1l these batik
matters.
It would have a very deterrinz
effeet on the general manager if hie knew
that an inspector might corne in at anv
time and examine his .books.
Another
thing that couid be donc is to require the
banks, when they send in rnonthiy sworn
statements to the Finance Minister, to send
aiso copies of reports sent by branches
to the head office.
In this way trouble
in any branch couid be traced, and this
vwould greatiy facilitate the care and supervision thec Minister of Finance mus t

Hon. Mr. DERBYSHIRE-Based on the

that they have appointed Professor James,
who is the Deputy Minister of Agriculture
for the province of Ontario, and one of the
-very best agriculturists we have in the
Dominion. He is conferring with the province, finding out what can be done to help
to build up agriculture in the several provinces, and I arn satisfied this amount of
,nmoney is goin g to do good, dîvided as it is
equally among the provinces according to
population.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-It has been my good
fortune to see eye to eye on a great many
,occasions with the hion. leader of the government in this House. I rnust say, however,
that in the present instance I cannot accept
entirely the reasons wlîich hie has. given for
opposing the proposed amendment. I think
it is the province of this honorable House
-to be the guardian of the constitution, and
,one of the main things in the con stitution is
*equality between the provinces as regards
the subsidies. I think that that principle is
underwritten in very strong letters in the
constitution. I quite agree as to the distinction which is drawn between this Bill and
the Highways Bill, but I would not be disposed te go so far as to agree wvith
the hon.
gentleman when he says that it would be
outside of the province of this branchi of
parliament to try to legisiate or te amnend a
Bill in the direction which is sougaht to be
-done by the hon. gentleman from Halifax.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Do 1 understand
the hion, gentleman to say that the Senate
had not the right to amnîed the Bill? 1 did
flot say that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-The lion, gentlemian
did not go so far as that, but, if I under-stood him well, hie said it would not be
proper for this House to go to that extent.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I said that on
the ground of policy it would not be wise
1or the Senate to go te that extent.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I arn disposed to
take this pàosition: that, as far as podlicv
is concerned, it is a good pelicy for this
House to affirm its rights whenever any
serious question arises, and I can see no
more serious question than the question of
maintaining the equa]ity between the provHon. ýSir MACKENZIE BOWELL

mnes in the distribution of subsidies. There
is a feelingc in the eountrv that the government-not any more this governiment than
the late government, or other governinents
in okien times-have had a t.endency to
favour tihe provinces wvhere their own party
is ini power, and that is a practice wvhichi
should flot be continued. If we intend, to
build up a nation we should try to broaden
our ideas and not be controlled as much
as ive are always by party consideration;
cur considerations from day to day should
be conducted in a broad manner. I repeat
that the principle underlying our constitution is equality between the different provinces, and if the motion of the hon. gentleman from Halifax is rnerely to embody
,n the Bill that principle that the subsidies
1
that are to be voted shou]d be voted in an
cqual mariner to the several provinces, I
tail to see wvhat objection there cani be, or
in what way it would be out of place for
the government to accept an ameridment
of that kind. The hon, gentleman refers to
immigration. I quite apprehend that the
government might be prepared to present a
Bill to this House asking for an appropriation to be devoted to the purpose of
lielping an individual province, especially
one of the western provinces, where more
importance should be given to immigration; but that would net be in the nature
of a subsidy. It would be on account of
special circumstances, and in the interest
c,! the nation at large, that a provision of
that kind sbould be made, and 1 quite
qgree that in that case a special subsidy
iglit be voted. But this is not a Bill
that is intended to apply to a case of that
kind at ail. It is a Bill, according te the
declaration of the hion. gentleman, and according to deciarations made in the other
House, which is by way of subsidy to the
several. province-s, and w-hich is intended
to be given equally to the several provinces, and 1 fail t(»see the g-reat objection

in the other Bill. That proves that we are

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-If the g-overniment intend to distribute the rnoney proportionately among the provinces, why do they
refuse to say so in the Bill ? They say
trust us.' That is ail right. We might
trust the present government, but this law
wvill be on the statute-book and may remain
there with other governments in power that
we could flot trust. We should not allow
any government to vote money eh bloc in
this way without giving any statement as
to how it wvill be expended. It is striking
at the very basis of responsible government. In the estimates every dollar has
to be voted, and is subject to criticism.
We do flot trust the goverilment to make
contracts without calling for tenders for
any expendîture exceeding $5,000. The
adoption of the amendment will flot interfere with the spending of the money.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR-Not a dollar of the
money appropriated in the supplementary

this Act.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-If we amend the Bill,

irovernmant would not accept the nînendment. It xvould not be very diplomatic on
his part to say that; but if lie did say it
thiat would be sufficient to warrant me in

the province of Quebec whio have been swallowinx their principles and thev miglit be
disposed to use some of this money to figlit
the Liberals in the province of Quebec. I
think it would be safer to amend the Bill
in the manner proposed by the hon. member from Halifax. If they will make provision for expending the money in the mariner stated in the supplementary estimates,
I shall have ne objection te support the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The supplementary estimates ougalit te be sufficient.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Will the lion.

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-The Bill says it
may be distributed iii any province. Forthis year it may net make mucli difference,
since the estimates are before parliament,
and there can be no objection te the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-I do not intend
to support the amendrnent. My principle
reason is that agriculture is one of the subjects upon which parliament lias jurisdictien. Another reason is that the dîstribuHon. Mfr. CHOQITETTE.

tien of money for agricultural purposes is
net, to mny mind, on the saine footing as
equal distribution in aid of highways. I
supported the amendmnent of the hion. member frem Halifax, that money in aid of
highways should be distributed equally, in
proportion to population, between the provinces. It does not strike me that that
principle is applicable te this Bill. I
can see reasons why a different principle would apply.
There are some
provinces which are essentially agricultural
and others which are not. There may be
justification for the gevernment granting
aid to dne province more than another because it may be essentially an agricultural
province.
To-day Saskatchewan and Alberta are almost exclusively agricultura,
provinces, and it is reasonable and equitable to say that those two provinces ouglit
to receive probably a larger share of moneys
in aid of agriculture than Ontario or Quebec even, where the development is mucli
larger in other lines than in agriculture.
To-day there are some provinces receiving
industrial aid from thie government which
is mot given to other provinces. Take for
instance the bounties on lead and oil, articles which. are not produced in every province. Some of the provinces have none at
ail. I arn also reminded of the fisheries
bounties, which are paid almoat exclusively
to the maritime provinces. Se it is quite
clear that if the government did grant to
ag-ricultural provinces larger aid than to
other provinces, it will only be equalizingwhat they are doing in other respects for
various industries. For the reason, tliat
parliament has the jurisdiction to deal with
agriculture, placing this Bill in a different
position from the Highways Bill, and for
the reason that some -provinces are essentially agricultural provinces, I think the government ought to be given a free hand in
making this distribution in proportion to
population. What encourages me further
to oppose the amendment is the fact
that we have evidence in the -estimates of
the intention of the government, for the
present at aIl events, to make an equal
distribution. It may be at present that
the provinces should get equal amounts;
but the time may corne when they should

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-There seemsz to
be some misunderstanding as to the nature
of this Bill. The principle of the Bill is
that the government shall have discretion

niake a distribution of it as they thinkproper, subject to a vote by parliament.
There is nothing within the four corners of
the Bill, s0 far as the principle is concerned, binding the goverument to make an
equal distribution among the provinces;
but the government say it is their intention
to distribute the money pro rata amongsct
the various provinces.

Hon. Mr. PROWSE-In regard to encourag-ing agriculture, I do flot agree with

When ,the Civil Service Amendment Act
19w6, was enacted on the 2Oth July, 1908,
and became the law of the land, it contained the following paragraphs (7-8) Edward VII, chapter 15, section 2, paragraph

There is no possible ambiguity in the
interpretation o! the law as it stands, and
the comrnittee have no right to substitute
theaelves, in the application of the law,
to the persan whom the law itself designates and empiDwers with the right oi
executing it.
The recomniendation o! the conimittee is
consequently out of order because it clashes
with the law and is etill out of order because the subject which forma the basis
of such a recommendation has neyer been
subxnitted byheH setthdeirais
of the comxnittee.
I asked the chairman of that committee

By this last clause of the first recommendation, the commîttee is asked to do a

is against the law. It shall neyer be caried and no man appointed by the Senate
under those conditions shall be paid by the

when I said just now that it was illegal.

which the Minister of Justice dlaims the
Senate or committee had in refererice to
the Civil Service Act.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETT-I did not vote
a moment ag-o on the appeal from the decision of the Speaker, because, as I intimated, the Speaker was deciding on the
wvhole report and we were only on the first
recommendation. Tire committee disagreed
with the Speaker on the recomniendation.
I would have voted against the point of
order, but I think the other provisions are
correct. As to the first recommendation,
supposing the law should be as bis lion.
the Speaker stated, that the report is flot
in order, there is nothing to prevent the
conîmittee asking the 'House to make such
a declaration; there is nothing in the declaration which, deprives the Senate of one
iota of its righits. Therefore, there is. nothing in it to whichi we can object. If the
report will inake a declaration that al! thernessengers or othier employees shou]d beappointed by the Senate, it would be quite
different, but as the report is simfly a deelaration saying that wlien an employee is

quite ag-ree with the hon. Speaker that the
Senate can act anly on the recommendation
of the Speaker, but my contention is that
ithe second part of the first paragraph lias
lo be read as if the wording were in this
way:
Se far as your commrittee inay have been
authorized ta tact dnring recess in caske of -ergency upon -the proper recomînendation acrording to the statute.
When the report said the committee bad
been authorized we have to assume that
the committee hias been properly authorized
to do it. If it is a condition, so that the
cornmittee may be properly authorized,
that it must corne on the initiative of the
Speaker, then the meaning of the clause
,of the report supposes that that bas taken
place and that the Senate lias acted on the
initiative of the Speaker. The point raised
b>' the Speaker assuming that the Senate
mAy act irrespective of any initiative of
the Speaker, is not correct.
Hon. M.r. LANDRY (The Speaker)-I
'want to answer that reference to the letter
,of Mr. Newcombe. He says it is nat necessery ta inquire into the authority of the
Comrnittee on Internai Economy and Contingent Accounts, but lie adds so far as it
blas not been set aside by an enactment of
'the law. And that is just what lias bappened-it lias been modified by the statute.
*The hion. member answered mne by quotinga
-section 32. Thiat is not a reply to my contention. Section 22 of the Act says that
iese nominations shail be on the initiative
of the Speaker. Does clause 32 contradict
the clause at ail? One relates to the classification and salary of employees, and the
other to appointments. We should be careSul not to confound the two sections.

far this has not been set aside by an enactinent of the law. but we have an enactment of the law, and to-day, by the
law, the Speaker lias a ri__ht to make recommendations for the approval of the
House. Il the Speaker has recommended a
person where does hie take his authority?
Hie takes it from the ]aw.
lion. Mr. BEIQUE-Does the hion. the
Speaker deny that if the report read as I

Hon. Mr. LKNDRY (The Speaker)--My
hion. friend asks me if the report was altogether different from what it is now would
it be right? Certainly if it is an entirely
new report, and if ail that is objectionable
in the report is taken out, 1 would not say
the same thing. But I take the report as it
stands, and that report calis for an order of
the House to pay the employees named by
the committee. I deny the right of the commnittee to nominate employees, and as they
have no right to name the emnployees, nobody can give the Clerk, the order to pay

the lion, gentleman prefer that I shouid
choose my secretary outside of the civil
service at a cost of $2,100, or select a secretary at present in the service at a cost
of $600 to the Senate P The law gives me
tlie alternative, and I chose the less expensive way. Why sliould the hon. gentlenman complain ? He says former Speakers
did not have secretaries. Why P Because
the law did not make provision for it, but
under the present Act, as head of a department, I have a right to a secretary. I contend the Senate lias no right to pass judgnment on my action in that matter, because
in doing s0 it is asserting a power wbich it
does not posseas. It was a personal act
quite outside of the statute, thougli that
peculiar power is given by the statute itself.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-On this point I
agree witli the Speaker, and really, the
chairman of the cominittee must see the
faise position in which the comnmittee lias
placea the House in making thîs report.
Clause 12is undoubtedly out of order. The
reference is to salaries snd contingencies
of the Senate at page 39 of the estimates,
but in the estimates we do flot see a word
about Mr. Lelievre. ]Reference bias beeti
made to a l-etter, but it is a l.etter which
was flot referred to a committee of this
House, sa it is quite clear that this part of
the report is out of order. It is said that
Mr. Lelievre should devote his wliole time
to the services of the Senate. There is no
doubt the Senate has a right to say how its
employees shall occupy their time.
WVe
know that Mr. Lelievre is qualified for lis
work, but there was not a word said about
him to the committee and how can tliey
miake this report. Tliey add:

For ail these reasons 1 wouid ask the
chairman of the coriniittee to drop that recommendation, whichi certainly has been
inserted under a inisunderstanding, or because of inisinformation. I amn strongaly
with the Speaker whien hie says that it is
out of order.
Hon. Mr. POWVER-His hion. the Speaker
seemed to wonder how it was that the
Chairman of the conirnittee became conversant with this letter, and ifitimated that
the Clerk of the House Jiad no right to
allow the letter to pass out of his possession
or to be seen by any one but himself. The
position is this: The Speaker of the Senate neyer lias lied a private secretary. The
Senate takes the place ot the Governor in
Council. A private secretary cannot be
appointed without the concurrence of the
Governor in Council. When we arrived
here at the opening of the session, we found
that, without any reference to the Senate
whatever, a permanent charge was attempted to be placed upon the revenues of the
Senate, and it wvas very natural tihat the
Chairman of the Conimittee on Contingent
Accounts, whose peculiar duty is to look
after the financiai affairs of the Senate,
-chould wish to know how this charge came
to be miade ag-ain4t the Senate. I assume
that lie went, very proper]y snd naturaliy,
to the Clerk who is the chief executive officer
of the House, to find out on wlîat autlioritv
this hail been done. and thereupon I suppose the Clerk showed him the letter *of his
hion. the Speaker.
The Clerk did iiotliinL but bis duty in
the inatter, as 1 take it. I think what I
have said g"oes to show that his honour the
Speaker is coînpletely wrong-, because no
fixed charge can be made on the revejiues
of this House without the eonsent of the
House, and that consent bas iieyer been
I«îvei. N-,o matter whether this question xvas
referred to this corniittee or not, the matter hias now been brought to the notice of
the Senate, and the Senate is in a position
to deal -%'itb it as it pleases. Just as the
Governor in Couincil could deal with the
question of the private secretary of a member of the governiment.

However as bis honour was apparently under the -impression, ths*, as Speaker *he was

am very much raistaken, a few montha ago
it was thought Lelievre had tee much ta

Port McNicol, Owen Sound, Goderich and
Port Colborne.
The moment you surrender your bills of lading and order the
wheat out the storage ceases and there is
no object in holding it back. At Fort
William and Port Arthur, the initial charges
on grain are as much as the storage charges
for two months on the eastern terminal
elevators. At Port Arthur anid Fort William.
the moment the grain enters there is three
quarters of a cent storage for fifteen days.
and one-thirtieth after that. as long as it
remains there. On the eastern elevators.
storage is only half a cent for the first
month and only a quarter of a cent for fifteen days after that. The storage at Fort
William and Port Arthur is four times the
charge made in the eastern elevators. The
western elevators have made large suas
and have paid as high as 40 per cent dividend . If I buy 4,000 bushels of grain from
Carruthers, or some other firm, they do not
know when they will be able ta get it or
what the charges will be and they have ta
speculate. The elevators are charging 3 1-2
cents a bushel for grain which was ordered
last December, and is net yet taken out.
If the railway could not ship it out there
would be some excuse, but when we know
they are shipping hundreds of thousands of
bushels there is no excuse.

suppose, practically rotted. Under the old

It appeared Vo me, as one of the members
of this House then, that it was understood
it would not be embodied in the permanent

Vogo a long way towards satisfying the

are the parties mainly interested; Vhey are
su.pposed to be the judges of their own

matter. Had thev presented a strong objection through their delegationa, when
their delegates were heard before the memibers of this honourable House last week, I
would have been disposed to grant their
wishes. But when their delegater, were heard
'before a large number of members of this

they were Canadians. From w-bat 1 have
seen of our militia 1 can say that we have
men of considerable ability and who miake
vèry good soldiers. Therefore 1 broughit iu
the Bill withidrawing 'the bar sinster' against
a Canadian to command the Canadian arnîy.
This Bill, which is no doubt weIl meant, is
for the purpose of making a lot of generals, that was not nîy intention. The
men who are mentioned in this Bill are
really only clerks and departmeutal officers.
Are they to be taken into cou sideration
and not men who have served a lifetime in
the Canadian militia, w-ho have organizedl
regiments and have commanded them, and
spent their time and their money as such
comrnanding officers in keeping the regiment
up to the proper standing. 1 am proud of
the militia of Canada. I think this Bill
should be so amended that the government might, in its discretion recognize
officers who have commanded regiments and
who have always stood ready to figlit for
their country. Why should thiese men be
debarred from the higher ranks? I do not
propose to make any factious opposition.
1 arn only calling the attention of the governiment to this omissiciu that bas been
made in this Bill. If we are going to have
a large army îvhy should tlie officers ho deh
barred from rank on account of mnie
hold staff rank, and who have neyer douie

Stonewall Jackson said 'War is Hell', and

-ent lime. 1 aui fu1ý- lu accord with certain reniarks of tlie lion. nieniber from
Rothcsay (Hon. '.%r. Domiville). The hionQrary rank of lieutenant colonel and other
positions have been g-iven during ai num1-er of years past to men w-ho tiever rendered any service, for the reason that they
'iccupied certain positions, aud that they
are able to assist in the maintenance of
the different battalions to which they are
atta.ched. I question the propriety of such
promotions. I do flot think either myself or the Speaker have cause to complain,
for, without solicitation on our part, or
cni the part of any of our friends, speakinug
for miyseif, we were given higli and hionourable positions in the force. 1 attribute
this to the fact that my lion. friend and
niyself served long enough to obtain a long9
service miedal, but I agree with the hon.
gentleman from Rothesay, when lie utters
these sentiments that gentlemen who have
neyer given a single day to the country in
the way of volunteering should not be
foisted to the honorary position of lieutenant-colonels. Ib is flot confined- to one
party, but lias been done by both. In

calis for something more than the statement that there lias been a request frorn the
local government.
Hon. '-\r. ELLIS-I have heard the question discussed in the House of Commnons
on more thani one occasion, and I think it
%%asý pretty well cunceded that the goverfinment must respond to the deninnd of a
local goveriment mki.,suchi a request.
It could flot fairly be as:sumed f rom that

that the request miust be allowed, but there
is no dou.bt whatever that there is no protection of the public treasury against the
demiands that the local governments see
fit to make upon them. It ought to be
fixed in sonie way, so that they should not
have to act simply on the demands of the
local governiient.
Hon. Mr. DAN_1DURAND-The Minister of
Justice who preceled the present holder of
the office, was oi opinion that, before a law
was passed bY a province increasing the
numbAr of juidte.-s the federal authorities
should be approachied and the miatter discussed between them. I suppose that there
is nothing whiclh will force the federal governiment to automiatically put the Act in
operation and brime dowii a vote for the
salaries of a certain nuînber of judges, but
there should be sorne co-operation and understandin.1 between the federil and provincial power. I heard mv hion. friend the
leader of the zoveriimient, a moment ago
declare that the Minister of Justice tvas
bound to assent to the demand of any province for an increase of the number of
judges. I do not know if that is the policy
of the present governiment, and possibly if
my hion. *friend will consult the Minister
of Justice hie will qualify this declaration.
because we have on the statut-e-book in Quebec, provision made for an increase of three
judges in the Circuit Court of Miontreal.

There hias been a pressing demand by the
Quel>ec guveifimetît for the appointmnent of
those judges from year to y-ear, and thîe late
government, as w-el as the present governinent, lias been made aware, not only
of the desire of the government, but of the
need of Montreal througli the representatives, of the bar and the public bodies of
Montreal, such as the Chamber of Comnmerce and the Board of Trade. The present
Minister of Justice is well acquainted withi
the necessity of doing something to relieve
the situation in Montreal. There were hast
year somne three or four thousand casesl)erhaps double that number-waîting on
the list to be heard, and the situation hias
not improved since then. There is a generai clamour for more speedy administration of justice before that tribunal. While
I arn discussing the question of the Circuit Court of Montreal, I might say that
strong representations have been made that
at the saine time when those new judges
are appoînted the salary of the judges of
that court be increased.
Their present
emolument is $3.000 or $3,500.
It is true
that the amounts involved in the cases
generally are not as large as those in the
cases tried before the Superior Court, which
is called the High Court in other provinces, but the principles at stake are the
sanie, it is the sanie law that lias to be
applied, and niany classes of cases are coinmittedl exclusively to the care of that court.
Judges, havingl to live in a centre like Montreal or- Toronto on a mneagre pittance, caninot maintain their prc>per station nor the
dignity tvhich should surround the occupants of judicial trihunals. I repeat what
1 said last session, that the salaries of
those judges should be increased to at least
$5,000. The work they perform used to be
done by the Superior Court judges.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED The difficulty
lias been recognized in Quebec, with the
class of judg-es to which my hion. friend
lias referred, that the work is distributed
unequally.
The work in the cities is
largely congested and the work in the rural
districts very light. I think the late governiment had difficulty, and the present
itoverrument will have to grapple with the
same difficulty and direct the attention of
the provincial government of Quebec to

SENÀ1ýTE

the iecessity of adjusting tiiose matters in
order that an equililirium can lie established, and so that the same number of
judges can perform more evenly distributed work and meet the exigencies of the requirements in that province. I think there
is a general recognition that men discharging judicial duties in the city of Montreal,
o! the class to which my hion. friend has
referred, should receive more substantia]
compensation than those discharging a
much inferior class of work in the outside
districts. Before this Bill reaches its final
stage 1 should be glad to take the matter
up with the Minister of Justice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-That statement
is not se true to-day as it was ten years
ago when somne courts of Quebec had not so
much work to do. I might mention the
district of Three Rivera and the district
of St. Francis. Ten years ago one judge
sufficed for Three Rivers, and one for Sherbrooke. Since then many industries have
developed in these districts and a second
iudge has been appoixited for each of these
places. There are stili1 districts where the
work is solmewhat light. * The whole system would break down in Montreal if a
certain nu.mber of j udges were not called
in monthly fromà the rural districts to help
the judges of the city with the work they
have before theni.

instance of the farmers themselves. No
later than the present session they were
recommended at a meeting held by the
grain growers in the city of Regina, and
a resolution wvas solemnly adopted urging
the government to legisiate in this way.
This was not done without deliberation.
They have been demanding the same thing
for years. In 1910 the provincial government of Saskatchewan, at the instance of
the grain growers, appointed an elevator
commission to make inquiry with a view
to carrying out the recommendations of
the grain growers of that western country,
and they took up the various aubjecta
which has been strongly demanded in the
way of legisiation fromn the central government by the grain growers. Here are the
charges against the present system; one of
them is that the defects of the grading system-the same grading systemn we have
had for years and that we have to-day-and
the absence of a samle market ta enable
men to buy grain which, Vhough slightly
bleached, smutted or frosted, ie of superior
quality, but is bought at a price f ar below
its value. That is to say, this particular
grain is bought from the farmers by the
grain dealers at a pfice below its value;
and to overcome this difflculty there must
necessarily be a sample market. Now, on
page 22 of the same report we find, in
dealing with t.he alleged system of monopoly of the grain buyers, this statement is
made:
Selling by grade alone is one main condition
of their buying the grain below its value.
That has always 'been the complaint of
the grain producers until within the last
fewv weeks. Then we corne to page 25 of the
same report in which the idea is still further developed. The Commission states:

Hon. Mr. FORGET-.May I ask the year
of the report?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-1910.
Hon. Mr. TALBOT-WVas not that at the
time when the farniers were agitating for
the government ownership of the terminal
elevators, where the mixing would take
place?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That may be.
It was said the other day that this demand
was based solely upon the supposition that
the government would enter upon and expropriate or absolutely own the terminal
elevators, and the House apparently accepted the atatement of my hon. friend from
Prince Albert (Hon. Mr. Davis) that this
agitation of the farmers for the sample
market was based entirely on that supposition, and that expectation. Now let us
deal with that. Here is a further demand:
There is a general demand among the
farmers for a sample market. It arises from
the belief upon their part that the general
g e price*does not do justice to particular
Iort"!of grain. either lots especially good, or
lots that are low or off-grade. It je argued
by some, in reply to this, that if the seller
of a very good let of N.\o. 1 Northern gets
over the average grade price the seller& of
a poorer lot of the sae

gradeý' gets the same

price.
Now, coming to that question as to whether ail this agitation is based upon the
expectation >o! the government aesuming
control of the elevators, wvhat do the farmers say? On page 29 of the same report we
read:
To begin irith. the assertion sometimes made
to the effect that a sample market cannot be
ee;tablished in Winnipeg withotit public ovuerqship, is simply not truie
And in this report the words ' Is simply
not true' are in italies, so as to emphiasize
and controvert the staternent that the sampie market must be contingent on public
ownership.

sometimes had cloubts as to whether we
should talk about the average bin. Any
wheat that will just go in over the line,
and below the Uine goes into one bin. There
is a spread of three cents a bushel in that
wheat. One wheat may be worth two and
a haif or three cents more than the
other, but ail goes into the samie bin.
I question very much whether the buyer
purchases on more than the minimum
grade. He knows hae is going to have wheat
of a certain grade, and some o! it will be
over that line, and some be]ow it.

much better than anything we have under
present conditions, because the presexît conditiojs are such that a man who ships
wheat to the Minneapolis market gets
every cent of what that wheat is worth.
The milling industries around Minneapolis
have a capacity o! some two lîundred nillion bushels a year; 1 do not think they

That wheat is bought and shîipped direct
to the mil'ler; it does not go througlî the
elevator at ail, and the miller gets that
type o! wheat, and the producer gets everythiiig that le in it, because there is keen
competition for that partis2uiar type of
wheat. Now that condition is ideai. We
have not got that in Winnipeg, and we
cannot have it, for the simple reason that
we have not the market. We have only
tlîree or four milling companies there, and
.1 do not kxiow that they do very much to
put up the price o! wheat. I do not think
the whole combination of millers are competing very hard against each other to increase the price of wheat; I think the price
they pay is the average price. 1 arn one of
those who believe that in the very near
future we wvI1 have those ideal conditions
in Winnipeg. With the statute left just
as it is, whexi the conditions are such that
tlîe people ivant the sample market, they
ivill be able to have it by proclamation,
because 1 behieve that, notwithstanding
the fact that the reciprocity pact failed
last September, the people of the west must
have the United States market for the
wheat. I anm also satisfied that tIe United
States wilh take the duty off in order to get
our wheat, and if they do, then we have
those ideal conditions for the samplIe market in Winnipeg. I want to have the statute left iii sudh shape thuat the people of

arn opposed to the arnendmnent suggested by
the member from Prince~ Albert. I wouid
have, probably, some doubt whether I
should vote even for the aniendment that
was suggested the other day. However,
if the arnendment is passed, 1 think it is
in the right direction and ne harrn can
corne of it, because it does flot appiy until
the conditions are such that it shouid apply. I do flot look on this Grain Bi'll as a
party rneasure. I know that, for a great
number of years, both political parties have
been striving to frarne this Grain Act. In
ail that trne I have neyer known that
political considerations entered into the
question. 1 do net sec wby they should.
and I know that they shouid not. I arn
satisfied that members of the House of
Comrnons on both sides, and rnembers of
the Senate on both aides, have endeavoured
to iend their best judgment to bringing
about legislation that wouid meet the situation. It rnust be remembered that, while
this Bi is peculiariy fitted to temporariiy
relieve the situation of the western producer, its trade aspect is secondary. There
bre conditions in the west that are at
tirnes, very very bard. We wiii have them
discussed under another clause here to-day
-the car distribution and ail those tbings
-but 1 think the House %vouid do weii to
leave this clause as it stands at present.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH-I wouid iike to ask

Hon. Mr. DE VEBER-This business
looks to me sornething like a horse race,
with a number of horses in it, and the
jockey of each tryîng te obtain the lead,
and we who are not in the race are the
judges, and I think we should look very
closely to the question befoTe we judge as
to what we shouid do. In regard te the
sample mnarket, it seema good to me. I
know if I were buying a horse I wouid
lîke to see the animal before I bought hiii;
I wouid like to look at his teeth te ascertain bis age, to look down bis legs to see
if there were any incipient aplînts, and I
wouid like to look at his bocks to See if
they were suspicious. To my mmnd, as far
as it cari be managed, the idea of a SampIe ma.rket is ideal. Locally it would be
perfect;, the farmer would bring his grain in
and seli it on sample and get bis money and
go home. As far as any individual car can
be handied separateiy, that wouid hold
good; but when you have to ship grain as
far as we bave in the west, for instance
from Alberta to Liverpool, it must go
through a good many bands, must be

It is simply proposed to add another system. In comrnittee the other day I said
that the saniple rnarket ivas the ideal market, but 1 questioned whether the time
was ripe, that is as to conditions, for taking care of the grain at such terminal
points as Fort William and Port Art hur,
where innumerable dealers in the grain
business would be requiring bina for a
number of grades of wheat. Many of them,
would want apecial bins to handie several
of those grades, thus absorbing the bins;
and bearing in mind that you stili retain

send a saniple of that grain to England
and be sure that you were delivering the
saine wheat? -Whereas, if that grain is
graded it goes to a certain grade, and you
get your rnoney for that grade. As to
the mixing part, 1 amn not so satisfied as 1
arn with the sample market. The mîxing
is not an unlawful thing to do. If I go
into certain parts of the country and buy
one or two million 'bushiels of grain, and
they are of different grade, I can mix that
if I like before it is graded. I can buy
every bit of grain in a certain portion of
the Northwest, and before it cornes to be
graded there is no law that I know of to
hinder me f rom mixing that grain and putting it in any grade I like; but the very
instant 1 have it graded 1 cannot mix if
any more. There is nothing in the law
to prevent a man from mixing his own
grain to any grade he likes; and as it is
unlawful to mix grain after it is graded,
what is the use of putting the clause in at
all . You have it right there in the old
Act. That is the way I look at it. as a man
in the street.

it that that clause is nat put inta effect

want ta delay the Hause, I could point ont
that in this report ai the conference of 1908
the railway men bitterly apposed the pro-

position of special hinning at Fart Williaîin
and Part Arthur. One praminent railwav
mani, in expressing his views, said: ' If
yau adopt that systenu we ivili have to
spread aur elevators ail over the place ta

the number ai -bins that wautd tIen be required. Mr. 1Partridge said there were
about 300 dealers, and how xnany would require bins it was impassible ta say. My
anly desire is ta give yau some practical
information on the warking out af it. A
great many erraneaus impressions have
been created in cannectian with this whole
system and method ai handling grainthat it is going ta be entirely for the -benefit ai the. combine, as my hion. friend frami
Prince Albert has affirmed sa aiten. That
is an erraneons idea ta place before this
House. Advantages are in favaur ai tIe
owner af the grain when it camtes before

that awner may be, and wha gets it at the

for one purpose, to take the grain off the

order clause shahl remain intact and locked
Up as it is at present. I think that is a
fair proposition. A great meny cures have
4been suggested for the unfortunate congestion we have eit tiînes in the Northwest.
Soute have suggested that a percentage be
given to the farmers, and a percentage to
the elevators, but the ides, amongst fairminded men, grain growers as well, some
ef them prominent in the councils of the
organization, has been that the class 1
have indicated have no show whatever
under the car distribution clause if there
is a car shortage, under present circumstances. Let me point out to you that the
man outside the car-loading lîne very sel.-dom draws bis grain to market during theý
,cpen seeson in the fail. 0f necessity hie
must devote as muchi time as possible to
forming operations before the freeze-up.
The best hie cen do to draw his grain to
miarket is one load a day, while the men
who can take advantage of the car-loading
mey ]oad a car in a day. Therefore, you
can see that in order to hau! so large a
quantity of grain to market, lie would have
practical]y no time in the fali to attend to
bis farming operations. As a rule the man
draws in a load or two in the faîl while bis
fern operetions are going on, because hie
has debts t-o psy for twine, blacksmithing,
&c., and then lie will leave the rest of his
crop until the ground is frozen and hie cannot. go on with farm operations. Tien hie

be possibly at soute points sixty or seventy
loads of grain there,. sud a car cornes in

sonable situation.
position arises, that the car-order book gets
clogged up with dead ordprs and there is. no
way to clear it up., Taking it ail in ail, I do
not think it is asking too much to devote
a few minutes to consider the class of
farmers indicated, and see whiether or not
we cannot at least try to afford them se
relief.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-Yesterday I stated
that, having heard the representations of
the farmers, I was against pariagraphi ' e ' of
clause 207. They were unanimous in demanding that this be dropped; and I think
it was a great concession to give to those
who were advocating clause 207 as it
stands, to introduce in that clause paragraph ' b,' which was to be a mere temporary application of relief in case of damp
grain. But I must not lose sight of the
tact that when the representatives of the
farmers werc heard the other day it was
stated, and flot denied, that the farmers
from long distances were at a great disadvantage; that farmers hiad to wait soxue
five, six or seven days with their load of
wheat before being able to discharge their
wagons; and it must be et very highi expense, and if at ail possible we should
corne te the relief of that class of fermera.
They live eit a long distance frout the cars,
soine 25 or 30 miles, and they are kept front
five to eight days -before they cen unload
t.heir wagons on to the cars.
I think there is a good deal in the ides
expressed by the hion. gentleman froni
Killerney (Hon. Mr. Young), and I think it
deserves consideration by this House. It
la not quite plain to my mind as to whether
a proper clause could be framed to give
effect to the idea, but it is worth consideratien. I, therefore, miove that this debete

Third reading Bill (32) An Act respecting Grain.
kion. Mr. YOUŽ-G-The lion. member
from Montreal, who had the floor this
morning, has been called away, and asked
me to present some matters to the House.
The question had been raised as to whether it would be possible to grant relief to
f armers, in the matter of loading cars, residing at too great a distance from a railway. The hon. gentleman devoted a great
deal of hîs time during lunch hour to endeavouring to framie a clause. He had an
informal conference with those representing the various interests, but found great
difflculty in framing a clause either to his
own satisfaction, or to the satisfaction of
the House, on so complicated a question.
He asked me to read to the House the
clause he suggested, prepared in a hurried
manner and in the short time et hîs disposal. He does not feel satisfied that he
has, in this intricate and complicated
question, properly worded an amendment
to meet the views of the House. The proposed amendment is as iollows:
In. time <d unexipeoted congestion, and for
the 6ole punpose of coming te the relief of
farmers who m-ay have corne fr-m distances

realize that the difficulties in frarning a
measure ta fit this state of afiairs iultiply as we go on discussing the various
features. In view of this, and in view of
the fact that we are having this year an
experience in car shortage which inav help
themn out, 1 would ask, the leider of the
government to seriously consider, under
the circumstances, and at this late date 0f
the session especially, a withdrawal of
clause ' e 'entirely leaving that matter to
be deait with at some future time. Withi
the experience of this year, added to the
experience of other years, they might take
into consideration the building of these
interior elevators that. I have suggested,
or any other matter that in their judgmient
may help to ameliorate to some extent car
shortage when it exists.
Hon. Mr. TALBOT-I wvas very much
pleased, indeed, to hear my hon. friend
fromn Killarney (Hon Mr. Young) inake
some suggestions which would lead us to
believe would be favourable, or would work
to the advantage of a certain clasz- of the
western farmers at least. I was not pleased
because I thought that his, suggestion would
really be workable, but 1 rather thoixglit
it was a sien of a gentie prick to his conscience for the vote he had given this morning.
This question of the distribution of cars
has a very long history. In the early days
oi wheat growing in the west, and when the
elevators were first erected, the farmers
had to seIl their grain to the elevator peopie and they soon iound that they were
being robbed. The elevator people were
putting the grade of their grain as low as
possible, and paying the least possible
price. It was only natural that they should
do that, and they did it. The farmers began an agitation for the right and privi-

iege of getting cars and shipping thetir own
arain to Winnipeg and Port Arthur and
Fort William, and Sellingr tile grain
tlirough commission agents. Aiter miany
ye ars of agitation they got thiat privilege.
They came to Ottawa year after year before they got that privilege of getting cars
in a certain rotation and shipping their
own grain. Ever since, t1he elevator peopie have been trying to break that arrangement and to compel the farmiers ta ship
their grain through the elevators. I want
ta point out the resuit of such a condition.
ln the town. of Lacombe, in which 1 live,
there are elevators. The neighlbouring
iocality is chiefly adapted ta mixed farming
and not a great deal of wheat wvas grown.
A few farmers have gradually been increasing their acreage af wheat. I know
two of themn particularly. One af them
grew somnething over 3,000 bushel s of wheat
and had a sufficient quantity ta ship by
carload lots. He ordered bis car and secured it. His wheat was graded No. 3 and
ivas sold in Winnipeg through a commission agent and the owner realized 78 cents
net per bushel for bis grain. The other
farmer adjoining him, a mani whorn 1 amn
particularly acquainted with, hiad not sufficient wheat ta ship a carload lot, and he
had ta go ta tlie elevator. There are two
elevators in the town. He went A both
of them, and they agreed that bis wheat
was No. 3 grade, and he sold ta one of the
elevators, but only received 6-2 cents a
bushel for it. The srnall farmer who is not
able ta ship his grain by carload lots is
robbed in that way continually, and I do
not see any way af preventing it, because
there is a combine among the elevator men
and. no competition. I have another case
that 1 desîre ta put as clearly as possible
before thîs House. In the town of Sovereign, in the province of Saskatchewan,
since the Bill we passed a few weeks ago
came into effect, a certain farmer requested
cars. There are two elevators there, one
called the State elevator, and the other
called the Goose Lake Grain and Lumber
Company's elevator. Bath af these were
buying grain. The farmer had asked for
cars, but advantage was taken of the new
law and eight cars were given ta the ele.

vator companies. The cars loadled by the
StatL elevator were as follows: Canadian
Pacifie railway cars Nos. 73946, 57968, and
4-4z69; by the Goose Lake Lumber and
Grain Company, Canadian Pacifie railway
cars Nos. 84968, 83654, 92324, 38656, and
Canadian Northern railway car No. 43744.
These cars were loaded out of their order
by these elevators, the alleged reason being that the grain was damp, or getting
out of condition. The cars left for WVinnipeg where they were to be inspected. The
farmers of the locality got suspiejous and
sent to their agent in Winnipeg and found
that these cars were graded straight, and
that there wvas nothing wvrong with the
grain. What is the resuit ? In thiat same
town a farmer brought his grain in and
wvent to the elevator and was told that his
grain was No. 2, but that No. 2 bin was full
and they would have to put it in No. 3.
That would make a difference of some 2 or
3 cents a bushel to that farmer. He %vent
down to see the other elevator company
and was tôld the same story. Alter goîngthrough the town trying to secure a place
in wvhicli to leave his grain, or to seli it
to some merchant, he. found that he could
flot do anything with it and he went back
to the elevators and said, 'I guess I will
have to take No. 3 bin and No. 3 price.'
The elevator man said, 'I amn very sorry,
No. 3 bin is full and No. 4 bin is full, and
the best 1 can do for you is tu give you
No. 5.' There are many cases of robbery
like that in the west, and if this privilege
is to be taken fromn the farmers, of havingsorne show of justice and fair-play, so that
they can ship their grain in carload lots,
then I think there is something wrong. I
would dislike very much to see that privilege taken from the farmers of the country.

bis seat, but I want to miake a suggestion
lù the leader of the government in order
to meet, as far as possible, the objection
which bas been taken to this clause. From
my own standpoint, I should consider it
was an admirable provision to meet the
diffculties which have been pointed out,
that have arisen in the past. I amn gaing
ta suggest, in order ta meet the viaws of
thosa who have made some strong objection to it, that that section of the clause
sbould be dropped. If it la found during
the coming year, after harvest. that a pro'.ision of a similar character is necessary,
parliamnet can step in and enact it. In
the meantime, if we are tu end this session
before next Christmas I would suggest that
the clause shoulci be dropped.

circumstanceS, the g-overnment would have
na desire ta abtrude upon parliament a
provision whch is not acceptable. In dalerence ta the sentiment expressed, I wil1
not divide the House but regard the amnandment carried as on a divisioný, as this,
in any avent, would seem ta be the likely
result. There is an amendient which I
shauld like ta make ta section 41.

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I quite agrea
with that idea. I think the consensus of
opinion in this House is that this section
should be dropped. I quite appreciate
.what the hon. gentleman from Lacombe
(Hon. 'Mr. Talbot) bas said. Yet I cannot
quite understand why a fariner should
start from bis home, 25 or 30 miles away,
wvlth a load of grain, without first liaving

these buyers in order to ascertain whiat bie
can get for bis grain.

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-The lion. memiber

The country should assist in the construction of dry docks to provide for the large
vessels which corne to our ports. The fact
that a dry dock does not pay is no argument against it; we would neyer have dry
docks at ail if we acted on that principle.
Let us look to the future and build up the

requirements of the country, those people

GOVERNMENT HOUSE PROPERTY,
TORONTO, BILL.
SECOND AND THIRD READINGS.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of Bill (182) An Act respecting
the Government House property, Toronto.
He said: Under the provisions of section
108 of the British North America Act this
property was appropriated by order in
counicil for militia purposes in 1871, and
later in 1908 Letters Patent were issued
vesting the titie in the property to -the
Crown and the province of Ontario. The
property has now been sold to the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, and the
province of Ontario, in making a transfer
of same to the railway company, has been
met by the difficulty in titie. The opinion
has been expressed by the lawyers who
have had to -do with the titie, that the
transfer, or deed, should be sanctioned by
parliament and not by order in council of
the Governor in Council, as was made to
the province of Ontario. It is therefore proposed that this Act shahl be passed for the
purpose of confirming the titie of the province to the property so as to permit of their
passing: it to the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company, who bought it.

with a concrete case, and with a province
which occupies an exceptional position.
Prince Edward Island occupies a position
which has no parallel within the Dominion.
Since it entered confederation it has had
to face a diminishing population, a diminishing revenue and increasing liabilities.
It is a province which is in no way discharging its duties of government in an
extravagant manner, ibut, on the contrary,
in a more economical waÿ than any provIt is a province

which has been handicapped by a physical
and geographical, as well as by commercial difficulties, since it entered confederation. Upon these grounds, entirely apart

these claims so advanced by the province.
I need'not say to hon. gentlemen that since
1873, when the province of Prince Edward
lsland entered confederation, the terms of
union of the other provinces of the Dominion have undergone very considerable
change, thus changing, to a certain extent,
the view point which the province may advance for further consideration of their
claims upon the government. In the first
place, they urge a claim of damage by reaHon. Mr. LOUGHEED.

son of the non fulfilment of the contract of
the Dominion government to furnish a proper means of communication with the mainland. I need not point out to hon. gentlemen that this is an old standing claim of
the province of Prince Edward Island and
has been dealt with on former occasions
In 1901 the matter was taken into consideration, and an increased subsidy, based
upon this particular claim was granted.
It is logical to suppose that if it was a
claim in 1901, entitling the province to consideration, which consideration I think was
fixed at something like $30,000 per annum
as an additional subsidy, it is a naturally
continuing claim. That is to say, as it was
one of the terms of the union at the time
of confederation, if in 1901 it was shown
that damages had been sustained to the
extent reported by the subsidy as then
increased, it would be natural to suppose
that it would be a continuing claim and
that, as time went on the damage would
continue and might probably be intensified.
I am not going to elaborate that as a factor, but that is urged very strongly by the
province. There is another claim which
they advance, and which I think they can
advance with very much more force than
the first claim to which I have adverted,
namely, compensation for their public
lands.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Compensation for public lands?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Conpensation
for public lands in this way: When Prince
Edward Island entered the confederation
she did not possess public lands, .but in
lieu of public lands the Dominion governnient made a grant of $45,000 per annum,
in compensation for want of Crown lands.
That would represent about 50 cents per
head of the population. I need not remind
lion. gentlemen that in 1905 one of the terms
of the admission in confederation of the
two new provinces of the Northwest Territories, -Saskatchewan and Alberta, was
compensation for public lands represented
by about $1.50 per head. If that was a
reasonable allowance to these provinces
at that time-and it has been repeated, also
during the present session of parliament
in the case of the Manitoba subsidies con-

exist for granting to Prince Edward Island
-a siilar sum. We cannot lose sigit of the
lac; that compensation of that 'nature is
flot based so much upon what the province
bas been deprived of, as the factor of
allowing to the province a sufficiently adequate sum for the carrying on .of the vani*ous functions of.gôvernment. If, therefore,
Prince Edward Island only received at the
time of confederation 50 cents per head in
lieu of Crown lands, and we have established the precedent in these thiree western
pro:vinces of recognizing that they were en*titled to $1.50 per head in lieu of Crown
lands, or in lieu of their lands, it is flot
unreasonable to say that the province of
Prince Edward Island, upon this item
alone, would -be justified in corinng to the
Dominion government and saving. ' Iasmuch as you have in recent vears established the precedent of allowing to other provinces $1.50 per head in lieu of Crown lands,
the same should he done with reference to

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-MIlow me to ask
-one question, not that I desire to question
the argument: in the case of these two
provinces the land was there and the Dominion grovernment retained the lands and
merely exchanged values. In the case of
Prince Edward Island there ivere no lands.

Entirely
apart froni the question as to thîe province
flot owning its lands, which I mighit say is
very ]argely accidental, should we, in
making ternis with one province, place
that province in such an advantageous
position as to resuit to the disadvantage
of anothen province that does flot own its
lands? Let me point out some of the
revenues enjoyed by the other provinces
of the Dominion owning their natural resources. New Brunswick received in the
year 1910 from what is termed a territorial
revenue, $494,491.64; Nova Scotia in the
same year received from its mines $629,000, and from Crown lands $33,600. Quebec
in the saine year received, in respect of its
lands and forests, $1,150,000, from its
mines, fishenies and game $182,132, a total of
$1,332,879. Ontario in the same year received from timber lands and licenses $2,M2,000
and $32,12M from lands, forests and mines,
a total of $3,240,722, whereas Prince Edward Island only receives the small sum
of 50 cents per head in lieu of its lands,
in ail $45,000. There is another factor
which mav he said to, entitie Prince Edward Island to equitable consideration, and
that is ils debt allowance. When the province of Prince Edward Island came intc
confederation there was an allowance for
debt representing $4,700,000 upon which,
accordinga to the basis of adjustment with
the other provinces, she would be entitled
to 5 per cent. It seems to have been one
of the ternis of union, or arranged at the
union, that Prince Edward Island should
build the Prince Edward Island railway.

people deal largely with Ontario and Quebec, and in returul they take very littie
from us. We may send them a few barrels
of oysters, or some other trifling thing, but
the market for our products is elsewhere,
and as we buy laTgely from Ontario
and Quebec, we do flot show very large
customi returns. Whether large or amati,
however, the termas of confederation shouid
be carried out by this governiment. We
are losing our population. In the ten years
between the census of 1901 and the census
of 1911 we lost nearly 10,000 of our population. Our people have gone ]argely to
the west, and wherever they go they are
of benefit to the conmunity in wý%hich they
reside.
Hon. GENTLEMEN-Hear, hear.
Hon. '-%r. YEO-The Minister of Finance,
speaking to this, Bill, said that in sorne respects the dlaims were, perhaps, flot legal,
but they were equitable. I think our dlaims

on this question. I believe we are right-

fully and honestly entitled to this increased
subsidy. As the right lion, gentleman has
just said tha-t this debate wvil1 not be closed.
at the prescrnt tirne, I shall not say anything fuxther, except that I arn heartily in
accord with the BibI that is now before the
House.
Hon. Mr. ELLIS-J intended to cover
some of the things that have been said by
the hon, gentleman who has just taken his
seat. 1 do not think it is any argument
against a Bill1 of this kind to quote federal
expenditures in Prince Edward Island, or
federal expensea in the maritime provinces.
These expendîtures are for federal purposes, for the protection and advancement
of commerce and for the general welfare of
the Dominion. It is not fair or proper to
bie continually bringing this matter up as
against the maritime provinces. These are
not local affaira, and ehould flot bie charged
up to these provinces. 1 have a personal
objection to a great many references whieh
are mnade in this Chamber to the maritime
provinces in this regard. The hon. gentleman has referred te. the f act that we receive s0 much per head from the revenue
and only contribute a certain sumn. That is
not a fair argument. We pay according
to the rate of taxation that is levied. If we
do not import our gooda, but buy themn
from the other provinces, and if our conditions are flot as favourable as they are
in other provinces, that shoixld not bie cast
up against us, as if we were poor relatione
coming in here and seeking to get aima
from the parliament of Canada. I think
that kind of argument is highly objectionable. We should consider this Dominion
as one country, and abthough it la cut up
into provinces, it should bie regarded as
one whole and each section of the Dominion should be treated alike. If I can
carry my memory back to the time when
confederation was flrst established, we
were not very anxious for it. The province
of Nova Scotia up te this day has neyer,
as a province, given its assent to the union.
It could not help but come in 'when its
legislature c arried it without .a vote o! the
people. New Brunswick rejected it on the
first election; a year afterwards, on account
of the influence o! the British government
and various other inflir.nces, we entered

SENATE
into confederation. 1 Nvas an anti-confederationist; I firmly believed the time had
nlot arrived for con federation and the plani
was nlot a good one. Ever since I have
been a member of this Dominion, I have
done my best, according to my lightsometimes it may have been very dimto promote the interests of the country,
and I think that ie the feeling of our peopie generally. In regard to the Prince Edward Island claim, I would like to call attention for a few moments to the last pubtished statemnent of their accounts, that is,
for the year 1909. Those for 1910 ïmay be
in the library, but I could not find thexu.
The Dominion subsidy in that year was
$233,181. Well, they spent haif of that
money on education alone.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Exactly, for which we pay.
Hon. Mr. ELLIS-I do nlot care who pays
for it. The money is the money of the
people of that island, coming to themn by an
arrangement made wîth the government,
and it is nlot right to say that we paid it.
The hion. gentleman did nlot pay any of it,
nor did anybody else pay any of it. Prince
Edward Island got the money as part of
their bargain, or arrangement, and they
expended $129,000 of it in education, that
is very neariy haif of the subsidy for that
year. Then, running down the columns
of the accounit you will find no extravagance, Their hospital for the insane cost
themn $35,000. They paid in interest $34,000,
which is interest on the debt-încurred in
the interest of the island itseli and could
not be overlooked.
They expended on
roads $28,000, a very small amount for that
part of the country. The total revenue in
1909 was $375,000, including- the subsidy. Well, that was not quite haif of the
revenue we get in New Brunswick froin our
Crown iands alone, and we do not get too
much. So I think that Prince Edward
Island has a fair case, nlot s0 much, perhaps, for any particular thing, but because
the peo.ple are not able to live on the island.
That is about the truth of it, and that is the
condition they have to meet. They are goîng away at the rate of one thousand every
year. It is, no doubt, a beautiful islanil
and a good island, yet the population fell

off in one decade from 100,000 te 90,000.
Now, wlio would like to live in a town, or
place, where the population is gradually
diminishini, so that when you look around
to-day for your friend of yesterday you
find that hie has gone to the United States.
Hence, there is dissatisfaction amongst the
people of Prince Edward Island which
ought to be regarded, and to which soine
attention should be paid. It is no great
stroke of statesinanship to deal with a sudden emergency when it arises, and to deal
well, perhaps; but wvhiIe the time is easy
that ehould be done, and it should be done
generously and liberally. The number of
people who go fromn Prince Edward to the
United States is very large.
The great
bulk of- those who leave the country go
there though many go to the Northwest.
My hon. friend says they figure well; but
they have been figuring well in the United
States. I remember, not long ago, when
the mayor of Boston was a Prince Edward
Islander, and so they 1111 dignified and honotirable positions, but the country in which
they were born and brought up does not, in
seine way, fill the bill, and the managers
of the public affairs, of this country ought
to give as much attention at least te subjects of that kind as they do -to the ordinary and general subjects which press upon
themi from day to day. You wil] remember
that in the last twelve years in which this
decrease of population has gone on, we
have had a systemn of taxation which, although liberal at its birth, does not seemn
to have grown up as liberally as it should.
When the appeal was made to the people
of the country recently to ratify the reciprocity agreement, the result was a disappointment te us. The eff ect of that would
be to decrease the population of Prince Edwvard Island, because there is not a sufficient amount of wealth in the country, and
you cannot produce it unless there is soe
nèw condition created by the genîus of the
governnxent. I do not care which government it is, or how it is done, but somethin.g of that kind should be tried. 1 quite

this moment the needs of Prince Edwardj
Island demand a speedy remedy, and I arn

Hon. Mr. PROWSE-I ivent very caref ully over Mr. White's speech, delivered
on the 26th. and the arguments he made in
defence of the Bill, and also the dlaim of
the littie province I have the honour tc represent, was put very forcibly. I listened
this morning to the hon, leader of the
Senate, and he bas put the matter very
plainly. I do not see why any member of
this House can object ta the Bill. I wish
to commend the government for the liberal
way in which. they have acted towards the
province. If the Dominion government
made a mistake in taking Prince Edward
Island into confederation, I arn not
exactly sure but we have had the worst of
the bargaîn. I know the province has flot
derivedbenefit in any particular. WVe have
last population in the last twenty years at
the rate of one thousand per year, whereas
I think possibly if we had remained a
separate province we could hav-e retained
our population and looked after our awn
affairs. The leader of the opposition has
made- the statement that the Dominion government daes not receive as much as the
island gets back. Now, I can accounit for
that in this way; millions of dollars' worth
of goods is boughit in Montreal, Halifax, St.
John, Toronto and Ottawa, where the revenue is collected, and Prince Edward Island
does not get credit for it. That is one part
of the niatter. One other point 1 arn going

she also proi-ed to be a failure as far as
the carrying out af the terms of confederatian was concerned, but she dîd good work
also. The Laurier government came into

government has presented a memorandum
'oontaining a aertain number of claimu

SENATE

against the federal government and asking
for somne kind of compensation in settiement of those dlaims. My opinion is that
if the governiment wanted to pay an increased suhsidy to the province of Prince Edward Island it should have compensated
those dlaims in a formai way by giving that
increased subsidy, but stating that it was
in settiement of a certain number of
clainig, or of ail the dlaims.
What
I complain of in the presentation of
tbis Bill is that there is no preamble statîing under what head and for what reason
this money is paid. Now, in what situation
will the government o! the Dominion be
for the future in facing any similar dem&nds from any other province? Four or
five years ago we passed resolutions in these
two branches o! parliament asking the imperial parliament for a revision and increase of the subsidies to the provinces,
based on resolutions arrived at by a conferenc-e of ail the provinces with the federal
z overniment. After the members of that
conference, representing the provinces, had
agreed to the amount they were respectively entitled to this parliament solemnly
asked the imperial parliament to alter our
constitution and deciare that this was a
final settiement for ail tiîne to corne. On
the representations of the delegates from
British Columbia to the House of! Lords, an
amendment was made to the Bill which
struck out his declaration of finality. The
Bill was returned to the House of Coinmons, which declared that the wvill of the
Dominion of Canada must be carried out
in toto, and that aniendment was rejected
and the Act was passed. Now this legislation which was embodied in the Imperial
Act, and which practically forms part o!
our constitution, because it wvas an amendment to the constitution, is set at nauglit
by this presenit Bill in the forai in whichi it
is introduced. That is a considerable error
of which we will feel the effect for years
ta corne, and which could have been avoidÀed if the Bill had been brought in withi a
preamble stating that an increatu o! subsidy was given in payment of dlaims made,
and under the form of an annuity against
the federal government by Prince Edward
Island. Now we are back to where we
were before this Imperial Act was passed,

different provinces for increased Subsidies.
A gross blunder has been committed in
thus reopening the wvhole question of provincial subsidies and quite uselessly so.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-I have listened
with considerable interest to this debate,
and it seems to me that the action the
governiment have taken in regard to this
matter and the presentation o! the case
that was made this morning by the leader
of the government in this House is one that
is to be strongly recommended to Mr. ItcBride, the Premier of British Columbia.
He has for a long time been struggling for
better terras for British Columbia, and I
think no atronger argument could be presented on bis side of the case than the
remarks o! the hon. 'leader o! the House
this morning in presenting the case for
Prince Edward Island. The right hon.
!eader of the opposition bas shown the
position, as far as the constitutional question is concerned, and the last speaker
pointed out the evils that are likelv to
corne upon this country by adopting the
policy that la laid down in this Bill. I think
the speeches made to-day will be an encouragement to British Columbia to go
ahead and spend money recklessly, as they
are doing to-day. At the hast meeting of
the legisiature o! the province, they passed
estirnates aniounting to sonie $ 16,000,0N0,

stop. It is quite possible to go forward
and arrange for the expenditure o! money,
and, as my hon. friend said just now, the
credit of the Dominion is going to be injured very seriously if the credit of these
provinces is impaired. I will point out to
the hion, leader of the governiment that
British Columbia to-day has incurred liabilities to the extent of pretty nearly $50,000,000 in the guarantees they have giveii

ta railway comnpanies, and, in addition to
that, they propose ta expend some $6,000,000 more than they hope ta get in the next
year. That sort of thing will nlot go on
very long, and therefore the argument put
forward by the leader of the goverriment
in this House to-day eimply shows that the
government should consider it necessary ta
corne ta the assistance of the province oi
British Columbia, an.d help them out in
order to maintain the credit of the province. It je a very serious matter wve are
up against, and there je a limit to that;

-And expenditure for Public Works, whidh
I take to be roads, of $157,000. I am rather
indebted to my hon. friend from St. John
Hion. Mr. LOUIIEED.

(Hon. Air. Ellis) who proved iny case up
to the hlt a littie while ago. He was good
enougli to read us a statement wvhich made
it appear that the whole difficulty has
arîsen from the fact that they will flot tax
themselves to pay for their schools as other
provinces do. The entire amount of the
deficit which my hon. friend, the leader
of the House, read averaged something like
thirty or forty thousand a year. It is quite
clear the deficit has arisen 6impiy and soleiy because the gentlemen in Prince Edward
Island will flot tax themselves to pay for
their schools. In point of fact, they hardly
tax themseives at ail. They tax themselves nothing like in proportion to what
othier provinces do. I may tell my hon.
friend from St. John that I agree with
hlm this far, that I do not complain because one province contributes mucli more
largeiy than another to federal purposes.
I raise no question as to whether a particular province has been well or iii treated,
and whether it is a fair subject for generous treatment or not, then a statement of
the total amounts that have been expended
out of the federal treasury in that province is, very much in order and pertains
very much to the question. I entirely dissent from him in thinking that when taxes
are paid by a province into the federal
treasury, to be employed for fe-deral purposes, the Dominion government has a
righit to take these moneys and apply them.
as they are practically going to apply them
in this case, for the purpose of paying for
things which are not intended to be paid
out of the federal treasury or with federal
rnoneys. To ail intents and purposes this
$100,000 we are asked to pay is a
grant from the federal treasury for
t.he purpose of enabling the people
of Prince Edward Island to maintain
their schools without paying any taxes.
I say it is a distinct infringement of the
r;ghts of the other provincem that that
should be done. I say more particularly
that the western provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba and British Coluimbia, which contrîbute very largelZy indeed to federal purposes, should not be
called upon to contribute money for just
such purposes as it will be employed for
iU we pass thie measure. I call attention
to the fact that there are two very dis-

M1ABCH 29, 1912

tinct anid very important issues to-day.
One is what I rnay caîl the practical issue,
which I have brought before the House,
that just so sure as wve pass this Act, just
so sure do we set the door open for an infinity of ot.her demands which will undoubtedly be made upon us, and which may
make this comparatively trifling Bill the
foundation stone for demands which ivill
cost us the equivalent o! an addition to
Our debt of two or three hundred million.
No attempt lias been made Vo deal with
that. No attempt lias been made to answer
it, because every man in the House, o!
experience, knows that I state the exact
f act when I say that so sure as this Bill
passes, so sure will innumerable other demands be made by the other provinces.
Then, there was the other matter brought
forward extremely well by my hon. friend
beside me <Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and
that is the fact that a very few years ago,
after f ull and prolonged conference, lasting, if I remember right, for some five or
six weeks, between the representatives o!
the varions provinces, an arrangement was
come to as Vo the sums to be paid Vo each
province; that that was ratified by the
Dominion parliament, and ratified afterwvards, or considered necessary Vo be ratified, because it affected the relation of the
various provinces, by the parliament of the
united kingdom, aud that there is now on
the statute-book o! the imperial parliament
a statement that, at t.he request of the
Dominion parlianient, this settlement wvas
to be final and conclusive. Thus you propose to destroy and tear up, by a measure
which has been very slightly discussed indeed in the other House, and which if it
passes this House will of course be, as I
say, the foundation for a very serious raid
upon the treasury in a very short time. I
have no objection to the mode in which
these gentlemen dispose of the money
which belongs to them, but I repeat that
1 have the strongest possible objection to
the money of other provinces being taken
Vo provide for their educational system,
when these other provinces are already
taxing themselves very heavily to maintain
their own schoo]s.

of the House, in addition to whiat 1 pointcd out this morning, and tliat is* in the
case presented by the province to the
Dominion government upon this subjeet;
the deficit for the last fourteen montha is
shown to amount to $120,000. 1 find that in
education for 1911 they have epent $128,483.33, an increase of $67,288.52. This next
item probably is the most conclusive argument and the most conclusive reason wh.ich

Hon. Mr. LOUGMEED-That is, almost
one-fifth of the subsidy granted by the
Dominion government the province finds
it obligatory to spend to maintain its poor;
and it may be pointed out, and has been
p.ointed out, that the increased cust in poorhouse maintenance tells the tale of the loss
of population by immigration. The enterprising and hardy seek the western provinces, and prove to be the best material
for developing that country, while the infirmn generally are left to be taken care of
by the province.

about 2,000 square miles. It would be unreasonabie, and 1 think almost absurd to
expect that, in addition to the legisiature
and ail the machinery of the provincial government, they should have municipal institutions as well. The truth is, that the business o! the provincial governrnent of Prince
Edward Island is substantially the business
which is ordinarily done by a municipal
council, and it is unreasonable to say that
things shouid be paid for by municipalities
when there are no municipalities there. I
do not mean to say that there is any reaison
why the people o! Prince Edward Island
should not, throughi their legisiature, tax
themselves for these local things which the
municipalities pay in other provinces.

nothing conclusive in that ta prevent the

SECOND READING.
,Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of Bill (185) An Act to authorize the sale to the province of Manitoba
of certain ordnance lands in the city of
Winnipeg.
He said: This is a Bill with the object
of transferring to the province of Manitoba
certain thirteen acres of land in the city
o! Winnipeg for the consideration of $200,000. The property was first transferred
fromn the Hudson Bay Company to the government of the Dominion of Canada under
terms of an imperial order in couneil dated
the 23rd o! June, 1870, for the admission
of Ruperts Land into the Dominion; and
on the 22nd of Ja 'nuary, 1872, the Dominion
government took, for provincial snd federai purposes. from the Hudson's Bay Company, a block of 50 acres of land under

Of
course no question can arise as to the right
of the Hudson's Bay Company to permît4
the grantee to derogate from the terms o!
the grant. We have to take the grant as
we find it. It is held for specific purpose,
namely public purposes.
The transfer
from one branch of the Crown, as repre.
sented by the federal government, te
another branch, as represented by the
provincial government, and the value of the
property bas been discussed along commiercial lines. It must be quite obvious to
hon, gentlemen that it would be impossible
for the Dominion government to divert this
property for uses other than the uses specified in the grant. It wvill be found that
there bas been a very great diversity o!
opinion among valuators as to the value o!
the land for commercial purposes. I have
before me a list of many valuations hy different parties as to the value of tbis property for commercial purposes.
These
valuations run f rom $M3,000 up to $688,700.
Hon, gentlemen will readily comprehend
this tact, that land of this character that
is tied up for particular use must necessarily diminish verv greatly in value. If a

SENATE

property is conveyed to the grantee by the
grantor subject to certain uses or for certain purposes, and particularly if those purposes be of a public character, it is impossible to conceive the grantee, unless hie cau
seil them for publie purposes, doing anything else with the land except to occupy
it himself. Now, it has been ascertained
upon close inquiry that, -for the purposes
that this land is now being used, the government of Canada will be placed in a very
much better -position with $200,00 to expend upon the increased. requirements of
the government in carrying out the objects
for whiph the land is now used by .going
sorne little distance from the present location and building military quarters, or military buildings for which purpose this is now
used. This land is being transferred to the
provincial government to use it for provincial purposes. I understand it is proposed to erect provincial buildings upon
it, and 1 need not point out that the transfer from one branch of the Crown to another branch of the Crown still permits of
the land being vested in the Crown.

wouid be w'illing to pay a larger sum?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-No.
Hon

Mr. POWER-Yes, I think, so.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-M.Ny hion. friend
refers to a valuation made by Colonel Bigigar, wvhich valuation represents $631,795,
fixing the value of the buildings at $176,799, and it is pointed out that those buildings would be o! no possible value to anyone purchasing the property.
They are
old, dilapidated buildings, and ent.irely inadequat-e for the purposes o! the government, and no niatter who bought the buildings they could scarcely be considered of
any value, or an asset on the property.
Consequently, $176,799, in my judgment,
would.have to be taken out of that valuation. He also deducts from his valuation

could flot divert it to any other purpose
than a public purpose. As I have pointed
out, in the original grant from the Hudson
Bay Company it must be so used. As a
matter of fact, it is intended for provincial
buildings. Considerable negotiations have
taken place between the provincial government and this goveramnent, extending over
quite a considerable tinie, as to the transfer of this property. I understand at one
time it was proposed that the provincial
governiment should pay $300,000 for it. The
provincial government would flot pay that
amount, and has neyer been willîng to psy
more than $200,000 for the transfer.

friend has probably in view the fact that a
large part of this script was transferred to
parties who purchased.
Ever since the
government has been issuing script it bas
been made use of ail through the west as
a matter of commerce. It is proposed that
those who are assignees of this script shahl
not be permitted to locate. I understand
that there are three or four hundred who
hold scrip. Provision is made by which it
miglht be commuted upon being returned
to the g-overninent. The naines that I have
read indicate the actual original holders
o! the script, the parties to whom it ivas
issued and who are yet the holders of that
scrip, and who were volunteers and served
in South Africa and certainly earned their
scrip. The policy of parliament up to the
present time bas been to extend that scrip
froin turne to tiine.
That these holders
should lose the advantage which otherwise
would be given would be a case of very
great hardship.

Hon. Mr. TALBOT-No, I think it applies
only to the actual volunteers.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-There was a suggestion made that it should be extended to
the actual volunteers and that where the
scrip was held by a speculator, the government would take it back at a valuation of
$500. The government has seen fit te extend the turne, not only to the original
owner of the scrip, but to the speculator
who bought to the scrip. The time will be
extended until next September.

the leader of this House should be directed. As I understand, in the old province of Canada, at the time of the Fenian
Raid of 1866, there was no general organization of militia, but in Nova Scotia we had
an excellent militia law under which every
man, from the age of 16 years to that of
45, was enrolled -and had to turn out a.nd
drill for a certain number af days each
year. Unlike my hon.* friend from. De
Lorirnier, I was, unfortunately, aid enough
t.hen ta turn out and drill-I mean uni ortunate in the sense that, in looking back
now, I arn so much older than my hon.
friend. It will be remexnbered that practically the whole maie population of the
province of Nova Scotia was constituted an
organized militia. When the Fenian Raid
threatened, those men were called ont in
this way: the different battalions met and
drilled at Halifax, for instance-I do nat
know to what extent throughout the province-and in the end the artillery corps
Look the place ai the regulars in the fortifications at Halifax, and I suppose that
the survivors ai those men would be ail
entitled ta share in this bounty ai $100.
While I would nat grudge it, I remember
that the South African war, and the land
grants made ta the valunteers who served
there started up a crop af claimants on
account of those earlier difficulties, and
there was an organization formed in
Nova Scotia, and I think
in theend it extended aver the whole country, to
pnsh their dlaims for cansideration. Their
application wvas for grants similar ta those
given ta those who Look part in~ the Southi
African war. I arn glad that the government have not adopted the plan that was
followed with regard ta the South African
veterans, but I think same provision should
be put in this Bill to prevent dlaims from
men who did not, actually undergo any
hardships at ail, who were not volunteers,
but who were compelled by the law and
statute ta tnrn out. I was one ai those, and
I shonld be ashamed ta take money for having donc that. If I had valunteered, and
had run any risk, it would be a different
thing. I was simply ready ta turn out, and

I neyer did any actual service. I could
nat help it; I had ta turn out, under the
statute; I did not smell any powder, and
why should I, aiter the lapse of 40 years,

The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
resd the second time, and referred ta the
Committee of the Whole.
(In the Committee.)
On clause 2,
2. Ia this Act -"volunteer"-means any person who was regularly enrolled or enlisted
in and servedl with an y militia or of New

one thousend eight hnndred and seventy, excepting, however, the twa battalione of riflemien formed for service in the 'Narthwe6t.'
Hon. Mr. POWER-I do not know just
the exact meaning ai ' called ont for active
service,' but I think this measure should
apply only ta those who actually did go ont.
Take the battalion ta which I belanged:
We were, in a way, called ont, and were
under orders; there was rather an expectation that a Fenian warship was going
to take Halifax, and we were told that if
the vessel appeared during the night, the
sinlfor aur assembling- wonld be three
guns, but we did not actuahhy do any
active service.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That is a mare
difficuit task than doing active service. I
venture ta say that any saldier called out
for active service wouhd very niuch prefer
being engaged in the activities af war thani

It is not only the question of rates on
the road, but the question of the standing
of the road in construction. In this the
government have some responsibility to see
that roads to wvhich they give money in
the way of subsidy are constructed of a
certain standard. We have a provision in
the Railway Aoct, of 1911, wvhich requires
the Raîlway Board to insist on the road

525 miles. It is estimated that the maxirîium cost of this road wiIl be $65,000 per
mile, a very much lower estimate than
that for the building of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie in its mountain section. The province of British Columbia bas entered into
an agreement with this company to guarantee its bonds up to $35,000 per mile; so
that it will be observed tha.t the road itself
assumes a very considerable obligation,
and the assistance which is being granted
by this government is not unreasonable,
%ýhen we take into consideration the very
extensive character of the work to be performed. The granting of a guarsntee by
the British Columbia government which,
to, a certain extent, will assist the road,
wilI, of course, entail the coxnpany raising
cf the necessary funds to make up the difference between the $12,000 per mile and
the estimated cost of $65,000. The guarantee of the province of British Columbia
will only assist t.hem ini financing that difference of $35,000 per mile. This is intended to, be a transcontinental systemn and
wîll certainly be a great factor in the development of the country through whicli
it will pass.*

railway like that runs. It starts at Vancouver, and ta Westminister, and then up

their railway department and engineers,
and the machinery tliey had at that time
for seeing that the work was properiy carried out. Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper in the
interview above quoted points out that the
province af Britishi Columbia to-da -y has no
praperiy qualified people who are capable
af giving a report ta the provincial government as ta the condition of the road that

MARCH 29, 1912
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-There are just
two points to wvhich I would like to make
reference. The government reserves the
right to see that the road is bult up to the
standard provided for in the Subsidy Bill.
I would remind my hon. friend that section
8 of the Railway Act applies to this company. That section provides that any road
which conneots with another road under
authority of this parliament is subi ect, so
far as its through traiffic is concerned, to
the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway
The Canadian Northern
Commissioners.
railway is a Dominion road and connects
with this road in British Columnbia. It,
therefore, makes through rates subi ect to
the jurisdiction of the Dominion Board.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Did not the Privy
Council hold differently in the case of the
Montreal railwayP
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Columbia)-I arn very surprised that the hon.
gentleman should say anything against the
granting of this subsidy to the Canadian
Northern Pacifie railway. He knows very
,Neil that that company requires communication in ail directions, and it does not
make any difference whether the acheme
is promoted by Americans or Canadians
or any one else. We cannot have too many
roads in t.hat country. If this government
is willing and ready to subsidize a road of
this kind, why should lie object? The company would net build unless they saw some
chance of doing business, and that it was
going to be a benefit to the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I 'do nlot understand .that the argumeû~t of my hon. friend
fromn British Columbia tends to that conclusion. If I arn not mistaken, and if I
understood his argument, and I think I
did, it seemed to be clear that lie coinplained that the rates would not be fixed
by the Railway -Board of Canada, nor the
standard of the road; that the company being a provincial company, ivould remain
under the Railway Act of the province and
wouild not f ail under the jurisdiction of the
Railway Board. I think that is the long
and the short of his argument.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I ivould regard
it as entirely unnecessary te again discusis this matter, inasmuch as it was se
fuly debated that anything that miglht be
said upon it now wouid probabhy net contribute in any sense towards an adjustment cf the différen~ces between the two
Houses. Owing te the f act that the Gemmons has refused te accept the amendments cf the Senate, and has disagreed
thereto. it seems te me te be almost a
werk cf supereregatien, so to speak, te
again go back te the Commons and ask
themn te agree on an amendment to which
they have already dissented. I regret very
much the majority have seen fit te amend
the Bil te the extent mentioned, as the
apprehensions which I intimated in the
discussion wiil prebably be reaiized iný
the defeat cf the Bill. The Commons
seems te have taken very streng grounds
upon the subject, and 1, therefore,
do net intend te ge inte the merits
cf the questien, except te say that
am ini faveur cf the

Senate net insisting upen its amendments.
1 think it would be in the public interest
that we sheuld accept the message cf the
Gemmons, they having signified their agreement te certain of the ainendments, which
embody to the fullest extent, in my judgmnent, the principle laid down by my hon.
friend from Haliifax. I entireiy disagree
with the report cf the committee, and I
think it désirable we sheuld dispose cf the
matter at once by having a division thereupon.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I regret very
rauch the anneuncement which the hon.
the leader cf this Heuse makes, that possibly the declaration cf this Chamiber, that
it will stand by its amendment. may have
the effeet cf the Bill being withdrawn. I
regret it ail the more that it seems te me,
and te the majerity o! this Chamber, that
there is ne cause for disag-reement with the
lieuse of Commons on the subject. The
facts recited, and thé reasons given fer
maintaining these amendments are absoiutely incontrovertible. It is affied that
the policy ef the present administration,
as expressed by the leader cf this admninistration, and as represented in thîs Chaanber,
will net be thwarted or hainpered in the

least by these ainendments. W~hen the
original Bill is set side by side '%vith the
Bill as amended to-day, it will be the conviction of ail unbiased minds uflat there is
no cause for the refusai of the Commons
to join with the Senate in passing this Bill.
The nîeasure has been discussed considerably, but there is one point that 1 would
like to emphasize. It has been stated in
the other Chamber that there seemed to be
some inconsistency in the policy felwed
in this Chamber on this Bill and on the
The Bill

government can deai without any restraint
The federal geverninent prewhatever.
tends flot to offer by that Bill aid to agriculture by voting money to the provinces
under certain conditions, which money it
could expend directiy. 1 stated in the discussion we had on that Bill that 1 saw
nothing ini the constitution which bound
the federai authorities to maintain an
equaiity in expending money, as between
the provinces, based on population. Seeing ne such principle in the con stitution
1 did not feel lîke hampering the fedéral
authorities in spending that money threugh
the provinces wvhen it could itself do so
with absolute freedom, without regard te
population and in the manner they thought
best in the gènerai interest of the country.
The construction of highways is a provincial matter which devolves on the provinces
under the constitution and the tielp which
is given to local works in the province le
a heip which constitutes an absolutely new
departure and which is contrary to the
spirit of the federal compact. That being
se, it seems to me that it appertains te
this Chamber to safeguard the principie
that the money shahl be spent and distributed throughout the country according t»,
the population o! each province. One of
the reasons given in the other Chamber for
their'refusai to agree te our aniendment ih
that the gevernment has shewn that it intended to carry out that principle, or
polîcy, in the Supply Bill, by distributing
that money according te population. Se
f ar, se good, and nobody in this House, as

SENATE
far as my recollection goes, has questioned
the good faith of the present administration. It has been added in the other ýChamber that there would always be a check
on the government, if they did flot follow
that policy, because a demand would have
to be made yearly for the grant and, if there
was a deviation from it, it was for parliament to approve or disapprove. The auswver which is made to this argument is
that if this enactment is not in the Bill
there will remain no other way for this
Chamber to dissent from any future administration, which would try and apply
a different policy. but to reject the Supply
Bill. This is an extreine measure which
the Senate does not want to put itself in
the position of adopting, and for that reason
it simply informs the present administration that they approve of itis policy, and
they want to insure its continuation.
For these reasons I support the motion of
the hon. gentleman from Halifax asking
that the report be now adopted.
Hon. Mr. BELÇOURT-It would be very
regrettable, indeed, if the government of
the day were to conclude that this Bill is.
not to be enforced, but that it is to be
dropped because of a difference of opinion
between the two Huses. I think that the
situation .may be well and justly put in
this way: On the one hand there is a desire to assert the supremacy of one Chamber, and on the other a desire to support
the position taken by the other based on
absolutely sound log-ic and absoutely good
reasons. I appeal to my hon. friend, the
leader of this House, and I ask him if the
reason given for the attitude of the maj ority in this House is not one that la in every
respect logical. There is absolutely nothing
there, as pointed out in the reasons, that
will hamper the government in the administration of the moneys to be voted in the
Supply Bill. I have read the discussion in
the other House and have failid to find,
and our hon. friend has failed to give us,
aay good reason why the Gommons should
insist on refusing to adopt the fourth
amendment made by this House to the Bill.
The one reason given is that it is the intention of the government to apportion this
money in accordance with the principle
whîich we have laid down in the amendHlon. Mr. DANDURAND.

aient which is objected té. The majority
in this House are justitied in saying that
if we give way to the House of Commons
we will be givîng way to merely a desire on
the part of that House to assert its supremacy over this Chamber, because on our
side we have every good reason, we have
logic, and common-sense, and we have embodied in the Bill a provision which mnerely carrnes out what the expressed intent of
the governînent o! the day is. $o you have,
on the one hand, ao far the the House of
Gommons is concerned, an assertion of
supremacy over this Chamber, and on the
part of this House a stand based on logic.
So if this House gives way, it is flot because the reasons we have furnished do not
amply justify the position we have taken,
but because the House of Gommons wishes
to assert a supremacy over this Chamber.
I submit that the majority of this House
would flot be doing its duty to the country
or to itself if it did not insist upon the
position it has taken. There was another
reason given ini the other House why the
majority in the Senate was said to have
been inconsistent, because of the manner
in which it deait with this Bill, on the
one hand, and with the Bill in aid of
ag-riculture on the other hand. My hon.
friend from De Lorimier <Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has already pointed out that there
is no contradiction, for the reasons he gave.
I may be permitted to remind the House
that the majority of this House did not
support the principle that aid to agriculture should be dîvided according to the
population, not only because of the reason
mentioned by the hon, gentleman from De
Lorimier, because agriculture is within the
jurisdiction o! this parliament, but because
1 and others expressed the opinion' that
funds in aid of agriculture sbould not
be distributed according to population.
1 distinctly took the ground, and I
think quite a number o! gentlemen
agreed with me, that when you are dealing
with agriculture it would be quite proper
not to divide the mnoney according to the
population of the several provinces, because, as I pointed out, there are several
provinces which are essentially agricultural
provinces, while others are less so. I take
it for granted-and I think I am perfectly
amendment
correct in saying-that an

MAROR 30, 19128
similar ta the amendment in the Highways
Bill was not made ta the Bill regarding
agriculture because of that very reasan.
Sa that the principle which we applied ta
the Bi cancerning highways was one
which the majority of this House did not
think appiicable ta the othbr subject, aid
ta agriculture. I submit it would be very
impraper, and nat ta be accepted on the
part of the majarity of this House, that
we should retract the amendments which
were made ta the Bill under consideration
simply because the other Hause wishes ta
assert its supremacy in a matter of this
sort. We have, an aur side, good sound
logic. Why should we give way? There is
al)salutely no gaod reasan given for the
stand taken by the ather House, and I
think the Senate awes it ta itself ta initz
on the amendmeot.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I propose ta suppart
the repart far the reasans which are mentioned therein, which ta my mind are unanswerable, and for the additional reason
that any aid given ta the provinces by way
of subsidy-and I take it ta be such in the
prezent case-should be distributed equally, and equally means acoording ta
population, unless special cause be showx
ta do atherwise. When we have te deal
with -a Bill which, in fact, gives a permanent mandate to the government ta distribute aid of that kind by way of subsidy,
and for ail time ta came, so ta speak, 1
think it is aur duty ta see that the principle
is applied, unless the gavernnient is ready
ta show cause ta the contrarv. No cause
ta the contrary bas been shawn. On the
other hand, it has been stated by the present ad.ministratian that their intention is
le distribute this money in the manner
which is embodied in the amendrnent adopted by the Senate. Therefore, I have no
hesitation whatever in supporting the report, and I think it should be adopted unanimously by this House.
The House divided on the motion, which
was adopted on the following division.

Hon. Mr. KERR, in the absence of Hon.
Mr. Edwards, rnaved the adoption of the
report.
Hon. Mr. BELL-I arn a member of the
cammittee which has just reported,. and I
tind it impossible to concur in the report
as presented. I particularly resent the
proposition that this evidence should bý
printed at this time. I agree with
the report in s0 f ar as it says that no time was
given the cammittee to make a proper inquiry or to digest the evidence, and therefor I see no reasan why it should be printed
and 3,200 copies distributed. The evidence
is absolutely ex-parte, and to an extreme
degree the evidence submitted was that of
selected witnesses who held most extreme
views on same of the subjects the committee was appointed to inquire into, while on
other subjects no inquiry whatever has
been made. I most emphatically dissent
from the proposition ta print this extreme
partisan evidence on a portion of the subject matter submitted ta the committee.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Were the extreme
views right or wrong ?
Hon. Mr. BELL-I have already said
that 1 concur wîth the report in sa f ar as

Hon. Mr. BELL-Yes, and I object ta
the printing of the evidence, because it is
absolutely ex-parte and most extreme. It
means the sending aut of statements which
are exceedingly partisan and were secured

such matter broadcast ta the people of
Canada.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-If the evidence
wbich bas been taken before the commnittee
is as extreme as the criticisin of it, then 1
should say it would not be worthy of printing.
Hon. Mr. BELL-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I arn afraid, bowever, the cap is on the wrong born. 1
think the criticism of the hon. member is
most extreme, and therefore the evidence
must be worthy of printing to find out who
is right and who is wrong. tWe now bave
his views on ' Hansard,' and the men who
gave evidence will be said to bt± men who
did not know what they were talking about.
T had no idea of supporting this motion,
but I will support it for that very reason,
so as to have the evidence printed and find
out who is righit in the matter.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR-I was a member of
this committee, but, owing to tbe meetings
of otber important committees beld at tbe
s;ame time, I was not able to be present at
many of its meetings. I was present this
morning wben the chairman read the report wbicb he intended to present to the
House, and I objected to one word in that
report, wbere the Chairman said ' A lot of
valuable information. ' I contended the
word 'valuable' sbould not appear in tbe
report. I also objected Vo paving witnesses
whbo were coining bere especially for the
purpose of promoting the Grain Bill.
Hon. M-Nr.
BELCOURT-That wvas a covernmnft Bill.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR-I object to the word
'valuable' appearing in the report. I say
that it is not 'valuahie' information, and
I object to its being printed until a]l the
evidence is taken and it can be printed in
a pamphlet by itself and distributed. 1 arn
sure that if I had had an opportunity of
calling a few witnesses from my constituency the evidence would be quite different
from that which. is proposed now to be
printed. The evidence should ail be printed
after the evidence on both sides has been
heard.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-I arn sure the hon.
gentleman who bas just resumed bis seat
iwou1d not wish to be unfair to witnesses
wbo were examined by that comniittee. It
so happened, that a measure in which. they
were interested was hein- discussed at the
time tbey were bere, and therefore thcy
did, no doubt, busy thernselves to endeavour to bave the measure moulded to suit
their views; but it was clearly brought out
and stated in the cornrnittee that, whlle
some of these gentlemen were corning to
Ottawa anyway on a mission mentioned
by my hon. friend, others, belonging to the
same organization distinictly and po>sitively
stated that tbey were not coming to. Ottawa on any such mission, and had no
intention whatever of coming until the receipt of the eummons to appear before the
committee.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR-The other miembers

Hon. Mr. YOUNG-I should fancy the
committee did not know wbat the movements of these gentlemen in the wvest

having the measure here under their consideration, they devoted some tirne to it,
it is no reflection, and should not be a reflection on the witnesses. As to the statement by the bon. gentleman from Pictou

examlned, but, apparently, they did flot
have them, there. The committee would
have gladly heard them. As to the printing, there has been enough said now ta
!ead me ta think the Hou.se would desire
ta read the evidence, sa as ta see whether
it is ai that extreme character which my
hion. friend suggests. It is printed in galley
form, it ia nat voluminous, and the
printing af it in a pamphlet will make it
valuable for haon, gentlemen who, wish ta
rebut that evidence an some future occasaion, if they see fit. There is a clause in
the report recamrnending that a cammittee

Hon. Mr. POWER-I sympathize ta a

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The Senate has
a reputation for passesaing peculiar qualifications for making disinterested investigations into a public subi ect,. and when
this proposai to investigate the question
reierred ta was before the Senate, it was
thought that bath sides ai thia very important question wauld be not only submitted
ta the Senate, but whatever publicatian
was made ta the public would be a representation or presentation ai bath aides ai
the case. When this question came before
the Senate, xny recollection is that the resolution maved by the hon, gentleman froîn
Russell (Han. Mr. Edwards) was amended
ta read: 'And also into the gairi or bass
sustained by the faîlure ta secure access ta
the markets ai the United States,' showing that bath aides ai this question were
ta be fui.ly investigated and reported upon.
Naw what do we findP We find in this report a praposal ta bring dawn ta thie Chamnber a representation made by men who hald,
extreme views upon this question, saine af
whose utterances are nathing short of being revalutionary. I venture ta say that
moderate minded men, reading the statenieut ai saine ai the mnen before this coinmittee as ta the candition of affaira in the
Northwest, would regard that country as being- in a state ai revolution. Is it desîrable
that that prerentatiara ai the case shaîl be
printed and distributed, nat only ta the
people ai Canada but ta the people ai this
continent? I do nat wish ta state that the
publication af 3,000 copies ai this rQpart,
which. is not only a one-sîded repart, but a
report ai the evidence ai men who hold extreme views upan this subject, will be uaed
for political purpases, but I think it undoubtedly will. I do not wiah ta; say that

opportunity was given to gentlemen who,
1 think hon, gentlemen of this Buse will
agree, would not hold the same views as
those expressed by the gentlemen who
wexe examined before the oommittee.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Were they Liberal
members?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-There are no Liberal members from Blritish Columbia.
Therefore, I think the imputation on the
acting Chairman was not fair. With regard to the printing of the report, I think
the opinion expressed by the hon. member
from De Lorimier is good.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-For my part 1
confess I arn a littie diffident about voting
for the distribution of this literature without both sides being heard. I suppose it
is because I arn a lawyer that I dislike to
have one side of the case only presented
to à jury. Why not print simply the number of copies required for the members of
the two Houses?
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-That is ail that was
intended, ten copies for each member.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-It is not necessary to print 3,300 copies. It makes just
this difference, that in printing just the
number of copies required for this 1-buse
and the Coinmons you get away from the
charge of trying t-o distribute one-sided
information.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The leader of the
House asked this side of the House to
play the game fairly. I can tell him
straight from here that I play the game
no other way. There is no unfairness in
the report, and the hon. gentleman's appeal to this side of the House to play the
game fair, if it went broadcast, as it wil
go in the debat-es, would create the impression that we are playing the game unfairly. 1, for one, would not be a party to a
game of that kind. On the other hand,' I

involving millions, some of which are flot
even before us in print. Now is that playing the game fair? I say it is not; so that
when the hon, leader of the House asks
as to play the game fair i.n a small raatter
of this kind, he should look to bis own

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I had not the advantage of hearing the
preliniinary discussion, but I would just
say to imy hon. friend opposite that I enitirely agree with him that the Senate ought
te preserve a reasonable impartiality in
dealing 'with all these matters. I have
just looked over the report, and find that
it does not offer any conclusion whatýever.
There la flot a sing-le suggestion in it, not
a line to which my hon. friend can possibly
take exception, nor 'do I understand that
he has taken exception; all he takes exception to is that such evîdence as has been
received should be printed. Whether ten

a correct form in the hands, at ail event-ý,

for this reason-garbled reports o! this, te

the past have ignored the evidence and
statements made by the Northwest to such
an extent that in 1885 it caused a rebellion.
The public should know, and eastern politicians should understand and be e-ducated
by this evidence which lias been adduced.
I can quite appreciate the attitude of hon.
gentlemen on the other side, because I
think it would be impossible to get any
levei headed business man west of Lake
Superior, regardless of politics, to give any
evidence as to the pffect of the defeat of

Hon. Mr. WATSON-He w-as a member

'which they could not back up with evidence. Therefore, I say that evidence

Hon. Mr. POPE-I have been interested
in the discussion -which lias taken place
with reference t-o the committee. Permit
me to say that this is the finst time I was
ever on a special committee of this character. I do not know what the custom
and rule has been in the manazemient and
conduct of those committees. but our
nulîngas have been very inregular, and
the committ'ee has Ibeen managed in a
veny unsatisfactony way. Perhaps it was
unavoidable. For instance, w'e did not
neceive notice. As a rule I did not receive
my notice until about haîf an hour after
the meeting was over. I zot rny notice
this monning after the committee had
held its meeting. I asked the Chairman

Hion. Mr. DANDURAND-The hion, gentleman is not an eanly riser.
Hon. Mr. POPE-Not this mnorning;
I heard the birds sing before I went to
bed, and I did not think it was necessary
to rise and hear the rooster cnow. With
refenence t-o calling these witnesses, when
we had the finst meeting of this committee
the resolution upon which the committee

MARCH 30, 1912

was based was read, and we decided then
and there that the coninittee would resolve itself into three parts. The first part
o! thie resolution deals with taxation, and
the next wvit-h reciprocity, and the third
with regard te trade between the provinces.
We thought at that time that we should
tuke up that resolution as it was printed,
and deal with the firat part fiast; that was
the incidents and demands o! taxation ini
Canada. We came to that decision, and
we were sent homne to incubate. We asked
the chairman o! the comxnittee what that
resolution meant, and he said, « Well, 1
do nût know.' We said, 'Did you no.t write
it?' He îeplied, 'No, I did not write it,'
and mnen ha informed u.s that tome hon.

resolution, I said to the chairman, 'I should
think very likely, because I have neyer been
in the Senate before, and 1 have neyer been
in a place on earth wheîe a similar resolution would be prepared,' and I accepted
his version that it was prepared by a senatoi, and probably a very old senater at
that. However, we took up this question
seriously from a taxation point o! view,
wrote the chairman that we should conaider the incidents and demands of taxation,
and the cost o! taxation from aîl the varioua sources frei which taxes are gatheîed
tcgether in the Dominion o! Canada, froni
t.he provinces, cihies, villages and municipalities. To this he agreed, and sent ont
through the secretary, some invitations te
the diff erent organizations whîch collected
taxes in Canada, in order that we might
get that information. It dragged along; I
met the chairman and said ' Are we going
to have any meeting this yearP' to whioh
he replied, ' I do not know how we can
very well. We will have to caîl a meeting

are the facts? The facts are that on the
15th day of -March, more than a week previous to that, these gentlemen unknown
to me, as far as 1 was a member of the
committee, had sent messages and assuned
the responsibility -of bringing these gentlemen from the west. Whether Mr. Lane
or Mr. Freamn, or any other gentleman, is
a good man or bad mnan, is a matter of
indifference so far as this paîticular point
is concerned. I say as a -member of that
committee I either was or was nfot entitled

to be
bringing any particular witness or assunhing any financial responsibility in
connection with that committee. Otherwise what is the use of my being a member
of the committee? Von may cail it a minority or a majority membership. what object is there in belonging to a committee
if you are not going to be consulted on veîy
important points of that kind. We had
$1,000; it has been expended, as the hon.
leader of the House has said, practicahiy
on this western aide. I have no particular
objection to that; 1 have no objection to
those western members coming down here,
and I would not be a bit afraid to make
a finding on a good deal of that evidence
given there, as far as politlcs are concerned; but it is iùot a question of polities, it
is a question of fair-play to the meinhers
of this committee and the people of the
country, to parliament and every one else,
but when you are going to publish the resuits o! the cornmittee, you should publish the whole resuits, send them to the
people and let them reach their own conclusion. When the hon, gentleman fîom
Portage la Prairie says we cannot bring
any evidence from the west against reciprocity, I desire to say he is very much
inistaken. I have had names wired me
from the west as soon as the report was
sent out in the press, but there la no ohject. I did not understand we were to have
a report. The Chairman did not tell me
we weîe to make a report o! the evidence
of these people and have it printied and
circulated in this country, and I want te

witnesses without consulting the committee. It is not a question as to whether they
are good or bad men, it la a question of

treating your eommittee falrly, and intelligentiy, and calling the oommittee together
at haif or three-quarters of an hour's notice is not a proper procedure. When the
hon. gentleman said the minority prevented the committee froin obtaining a quorum,
I can tell him. that hait of that evidence was taken when there was not a
quorum there. We did not prevent them
from getting a quorum.

UARCH 30, 1912
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARITWRIGHT
-I would ask the hion. gentleman wvhat
oLject, in his view, is served by creating
a special coimpany for the construction of
tilese bridges, in place of dealing directly
with the railivay company, 'who are 1 supliose, the ultimate owners P
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-ractically, the
cwnership of this road will pass into the
hiands of the provincial g-overnmient. Withi
respect to the dlaims on the bridiges, the
coinipany that bui]d theni will have very
littie if the road is constructed the way it
should be. It is simply a connection between the Grand Trunk Pacific at Grand
Falls down the valley of the St. John river.
There wvas a mistake made by the governiment iii accepting the baýck route; at the
time of the survey they made an error,
and the government was mnisled by the engineers. Realizing that mistake, the gavErnment oi New Brunswick has gone to the
«xtent of guaranteeing $25,000 a mile in
order that proper regard should bie had to
the interest of the people. The construction of this road would not have been
necessary if the report of the engineers hiad
been based on facts. This, parliament was
misled as to the two routes. The eng-ineers
laid upon the Table oi the House plans
showing that the back route to the province of New Brunswick would cost a littie
in excess of $6,000,000, that is, the portion
of the road from Grand Falls ta the citv
af Moncton; and thart down the valley of
tl)e St. John river it woul cost betweein
S7.000,000 and $8,000,000. It lias developed
since that the road through the back portion of the province wvill coat three tinies
that amounit, and it passes througli a section of the' country that at the tiniie, and
fur il future time, will have no local traffie ta an-y large extent. This proposition is
ont that the people ai New Brunswick reailize is 'necessary.
That section of the
country for nearly 200 miles on both aidles
of the River St. John was entîrely without
ailway facilities, and the feeling, in gelivral, of the people ivas very strong that
they should have a railway there. The
parliament of New Brunswick assumed a
debt of $25,000 a mile for this road, when
$3,000 a mile is the moat that hias beén
given as an ordinary subsidy. 1 thilnk

last session it wvas understood between the
late g-overnment and the representatives of
New Brunswick, wvho are taking a very
active part in the construction of this
branch line, that the governnîent would
assiat in the construction of thîree large
bridges that will cest. nearly $2,000,
000. The province of New Brunswick lias
ta assume a large liability if they construet these bridges of the character that
will be necessary in order for them to be
part of the railway that is proposed to be
built through New Brunswick. Why it la
a bridge company that la to build these
bridges I do not know; 1 know that these
bridges cannot be used by any other road
than this branch line; there is no other
railway that can -et on them. Lt may be
possible that some other railway will be
granted running riglits by the Intercolonial
railway; the Intercolonial railway is going
to take over the running of this road, and
they must be intending to allow other roads
to run over the track and charge themi a
toîl for using tlîe bridges.

SENATE
was under consideration. The late government made a proposition through the Minister of Public Works, that if the governnient of New Brunswick would encourage
the construction of a first-class road, equal
to the standard of the Intercolonial railway, that the federal government would
undertake to operate that road, under
lease, as part of the Intercolonial railway,
which would give the province a great
share of the net proceeds of the earnings
of that road and relieve the province of the
guarantee that they had given for the construction of the road.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-It is under tliat
saine arrangement now.
Hon. Mr. COSTIGAiN-The road wvas to
be constructed froni St. John to Grand
Falls, and the county of Victoria is just as
much interested in that road as the county
of St. John or the city of St. John, or the
county of York. There is nothing in the
Bill to show that the road will go to Grand
Falls. 1 do flot find any fault with the
general proposition that the line should
be worked by the Intercolonial railway and
becomne a branch of the Transcontinental
railway, if connection is made at Grand
iFalls. What I find fault with is that it
provides that these bridges may be built
by a company. It does not say they shall be
built. This government would only be
liable for their portion of the subsidy if the
agreement was signed by this governinent
for the construction of these bridges; or,
in other words, the road may start at St.
John, and corne as far as Fredericton or
Woodstock, or a littie further than Woodstock and stop there. I understand that
unless the road is const.ructed froni St.
John to Grand Falls that the agreenient
between the two governments would fali to
the ground. I think we are bound to finish
the whole road to Grand Falls.
Hon. 'Mr. THOMPSON-If they do not
do so it will be the greatest calamity that

in the federal treasury. Why did Prince
Edward Island corne this year? Because
they know there is a large surplus and
they say to themselves: ' Now is tflifiie
to apply.'
I contend that it is entirely
wrong that these people should be given
$ 100,000 a year more, unless they first show
to this House and to the country that inidividually they are contributing as much
iii the way of taxation as the residents of
other provinces, and they should show that
they impose taxes for the purpose of providing funds for meeting the demands of
their provincial treasury. Do they impose
taxes iii accordance with the methods
adopted by Ontario and Queébec? If they
do flot they should beg-in and do so and
they should co.llect from their own people,
flot until then have they any grounds whatever to corne to this parliament and ask
that their subsidy shouki lie increased.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Some four weeks
ago I ventured a remark that did noV meet
with the approval of the government for,
also of some of my friends on this side of
the House. I openly charged the government with bringing down enly xneasures
that had a partisan aspect and political
effect. The remark was made in reference
to the Tariff Commission's Bill which, to
xny mind, is concocted and calculated to
hamper the growth of any idea in'favour
of a reduced, tariff. Then they brought
down the Highway Bill which has nothing
to do with fedéral matters and does not
corne under féderal juricdiction. That was
another Bill concocted sud calculated to
build up a Tory fund that would simply
crush the Liberal party four years from
now. Just imagine a million dollars being
placed in the hands of Mr. Cochrane and
Mr. Rogers. I can see a sweep against the
Lîheral party. something the same as we
had in British Columbia the day before
yesterday, where the government are voting $ 12,000 a mile on a subsidy to a provincial road, which is another means of
purchasing the provinces wholesale. The
Manitoba Bill was a piece of legislation
which ivas a direct snub to Saskatchewan.«
And she was refused a hearing in the conference simply because it is a Libéral province. Now what do we fiad with reférence
to Quebec? We find a clause put in the
Hon. 'Mi. MeLMULLELN

Bill that we were fighting to have put in
the Manitoba-Keewatin Bill Vo, protect the
rights of the people of Keewatin.
They
have put in the Ungava Québec Bill a
clause to protect the interests of the squawvs,
papooses and inidians and they are forcing
Quebec to look after t.hein. That is simply a knock at Quebec because it la Liberal.
This government has been too busy to give
Saskatchewan a hearing, they have been
too busy Vo formulate a policy wîth regard
to impérial preference; t.hey have been too
busy Vo formu.late any policy *with regard
to the navy, and yet they have found tixue,
in the smaîl h<>urs of the session, to
bring down measures that have no
federal aspect whatever. Money is being
thrown out of the federal treasury into the
hands of the provinces in order to retain
votes. The constitutioîîal aspect of the
question lias been ably deait with by the
hon. senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand'). Apart from that 1 Fay it is
a direct purchase of the province of Prince
Edward Island. The hon. senator froin
Wellington (Hon. Mr. IMcMullen), has
made it clear that that money is flot needed in Prince Edward Island. 1 understand
that if they even put dowîi a plank in
Prince Edward Island it is charged up to,
the provincial governnîent.
The taxes
levîed on property down there do flot
amount to anything. They get more thaii
the other provinces in the initial subsidy,
and now this goverriment propose to give
them an extra $100,000 without any reason
or excuse except the onie that was given
yesterday by the leader of the government,
that it was to enable them to niaintain their
paupers. He stated that the cost of maintainîng the paupers was $50,000. The right
hon. leader of the opposition shows a very
marked dis-crepency in the figures givc-i
by the leader -of the House lu his statenient.
According to his figures the expenditure
for paupers is merely two or three thousand dollars. As- far as I know there are
no paupers on the island; there may be a
few aged and infirm, but their keep should
flot be eharged up to the federal government. The prosperity of the people of
Prince Edward Island is une of the most
remarkable things in the Dominion. Fifteen or sixteen years ago they were as poor

'MARCH 30, 1912,

their farnis were mortgza-ed as every registry orfice down there
wvill show. There w-as very littie money
iii the banks. and very few banks on the
island. A change came over the situation
there, as well as elsewhere. Owing to the
influence o! the Agriculture Departinent at
Ottawa the farmers changed their systemi
they did not grow s0 many potatoes but
went into dairying, with the resuits that
the butter and cheese that is shipped from
Prince Edward Island to the English market
is beating the famous Danishi butter and
cheese on the Engliali market.
That is the record that the larmiers o!
Prince Edward Island have securedl o! themselves during the past ten or twelve years
-they make the best butter and cheese in
the world. The result ia that banks by
the dozen have established on the island,
at places where there have beeni noue, or
very !exv, before. I have these facts froml
the manager of one o! the leading banks
iii Charlottetown. He says it is ainazîng
the amount of money deposited in the
banks, and that instead of the farmers o!
the island being mortgaged up to the
handle, ail their debts have been cleared
off sud they are storing away their money.
That is the fact and it is to their credit,
but it is not creditable to the Dominion
government to make paupers out of them
wvhen the contrary is the fact. That being
the case, 1 am prepared, with the hon.
mneiber fromi De Loriniiier, te vote for the
six monthas loist of this Bill, aud( I would
liave voted the saine w-ny in the case o!
inearly ail the other nieensûres devoting
iiîoney to the provincés. If it wvas to be
spent by the provinces I would not con'ider it so objectionable, but it is to remnain
iii the hands of the federal governmnent.
Ili the case of somne members of that government it would be suicidai te do that,
and the people would net thanik uis for
our liberality. The Liberals e!f the country
are looking to the Senate to support their
principles. I charged the governinent openly here with introducing ail this legislation
iii the last heurs o! the session for politi.
cal ,and partisan purposes, squandering the
immense surplus gathered by the Liberal
administration for their own ends as well
as for the benefit o! the public. I shahl

gentlema.n from St. John are the strongest
condemnation of this measure which could
be brought forward, when we are told that
the people in other provinces are to pay
for the paupers of Prince Edward Island
and for the education of the children Of
Prince Edward Island. When those are the
reasons brought forward, I say that this
Hanse and the country are disgraced by
their deliberate and wanton violation (>

into.Hon.
Hlon. Mr. WÂTSON-There is probably
s.,me excuse for sonie hon. gentlemen who
voted against the amendient ta-day, because the presnt government have evidently
adopted a new principle in legisiation; that
is, without sticking ta the constitution at
ail, a number of gentlemen who now ccupy the tireasury benches-and it la somewhat new to themn-found. about $40,00,00
which they had ta get rid of; they proceedcd t-o divide it up, and I suppose that some
of the hon. members who voted the $100,000 for Prince Edward Island have came
ta the conclusion tha-t they, along with the
other provinces, are entitled to their share,
and their ehare la $100.000 added ta the
subsidy. We passed a Bill to-day which is
a direct grant ta New Brunswick of $ 1,600,000. We have had before us last night a
direct grant to British Columbia of $6,200,000, to build a provincial railway, of
which the federal government hiave~ no confrai. Manitoba, contrary apparently ta ail
precedents, received $2,000,000 during the
session, and $2,000,000 is given ta Ontario
ont of the jack-pot o! a treasury, ostensibly
for the consideration of them havîng built
a ra.ilroad some yeaîs aga, whch is ane of
the most profitable assets Ontario passesses. The railway la now in aperation,
apens up a ricin portion o! the country, and
I understand the profits o! that îoad are
about 20 per cent. The excuse la made
that because thev did flot get a subsidy

200 miles. If there is a beit of land 300
miles wide running from the foot of the
Rocky mounitains which is tributary to
Hudson bay, and if it he truc that Hudson bay is navigable during as inany
months as is Lake Superior, then the route
to Hudson bay, by rail fromn Edmonton
and by water to the Nottaway river and
by rail to Quebee will be shorter by five
hundred miles than the southern route via
Port Arthur.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-Yes, I tliink
that was thec view taken by the Quebec governrnent, that that link was a more important one, and that although grain could
be shipped by Hudson straits for a couple
of rnonths of the year, probably most of
the grain vould find. an outlet by way of
the Nottaway river to Quebec.

a great deal of grain will go by that particular route for some considerable time.

can it be expected that the passenger service is going to be transferred to Hudson

Hon. Mr. WATSON-We are not interested so much in the passenger as in the
freight service.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-The wheat o! the
Northwest cannot be carried across the
ocean by a freight service. That wheat goes
now as ballast at a very low rate of ireight.

A QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE.
BRt. Hon. Sir RICH-ARD CARTWRIGHT
-I do flot think the Senate is properly
treated in having the desks ai those of us
who take some interest in the affairs of
this body removed when we are going ta
have considerable debate. I can carry
things in my head as well as most men,
but I do not choose always ta go inta disichel may involve
cussions of matters
serions questions withaut having sasse
papers ta refer ta, and one af two things
ought ta have been donc: Prorogation
should have been postponed until these
matters could have been disposed oi decently and in arder, or we should have been
leit in possession of the material which we
may require ta carry on any discussion.
It does not appear ta me that the Senate
is being treated with proper respect in
having aur desks remaved, particularly the
desks ai myself and my hon. friend oppasite, until the 'business ai this sitting at
any rate la dîsposed oi. I do not approve
ai it.

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-1 amrn ot going to be made a single and
solitary exception. Having put in a protest
I waive my right ta have my desk, but I
do not th-ink it is respectful ta the Senate
that these things should be removed. I
hope nothing will occur ta prevent our
passing the Supply Bill this afternoon,
thoughi I arn not quite sure. I desire ta
cail the attention af my hon. friend ta
another matter, ta which he may or xnay
flot be in a position ta give an answer,
but probably he will be able ta furnish an
answer at three o'clock. We have passed
an Act recently which appears ta me ta be
in direct conflict with an Act of the imperial parliament. Do rny hon friend's
colleagues propose ta get that Act of the
imperial parliament removedP Without
venturing upon an opinion on the point of
law, rny impression is very strang that if
the Act ta which I allude, increasing the
subsidy af Prince Edward Island, is brought
before the courts in any shape, that the
courts would have ta decide that, under
the imperial Act, which cannot be altered
by us, is ultra vires, void and waste paper.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I amn unaware
whether the attention of the gavernment
was directed ta the point that was taken
by my right hon. friend an that subjeet.

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTVýRIGHT
-Can rny hon. friend abtain the information by three o'clock P
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-If the legal obstacle which. my right hon. friend has
pointed out be a valid one, I suppose the
parties would have recourse either ta the
courts or ta secure such legisiation as has
been intimated. Ba far as the passage of
the grant by this parliament la concerned,
it stands upon aur statute-boaks. If it can
be paid over ta Prince Edward Island it
will be paid in pursuance af that Act. If
the imperial legisiation stands in the way
of it being paid, it simply remains ta be
saîd that something else will have ta be
dane. I presume whatever is done will be
done legally. If the Act has the effect my
right hon. friend has pointed out, I apcan rcadily prehend there will be no defiance of any

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Does the hon. leader
of the government nlot think that the government of the day is the custodian, not
only of Canadian laws but of imperial.
laws, and that the goverfiment of the day
should introduce no legisiation antagonistic
te either Canadian or imperialistic lawP
He says the attention of the governmnent
was net directed to the point. it is net
the business of anybody to direct attention
te any point; it 15 up to the governinent
to safeguard these rights and Canadian interests. I think the point raised by the
leader of the opposition is wefl taken, and
if this measure were brought into the
courts of the country or before the Privy
Council, it would be set aside as ultra
vires, and as a violation of the imperial
Act, and now the leader of the gevernment
here says the attention of the government
was not directed to it.

objections made by my hon. iriend and one
or two of his supporters. The demand was
that information as to the amount of money
actual]y expended and other things which
certainly do corne up in the case of mergers, should be included. Some parts which
were contentions and might involve more
or less delays were struck out at the Table
here. The other is information which is
found I think in the census returns, but
is prqctically useless for the public or for
the uovernment to form any decision upon,
by reason qf the fact that those census leturns necessarily are two or three years
after date, -sometimes five or six years after
date. The information wanted, which the
House can judge of for itself, is informat;on which can be very readily obtained in
connection with those inquiries which these
gentlemen must make, and it la simply information which. the public should have
when a proposition is made to increase taxation.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED -When this matter
was under discussion I stated the reasons
why the amendments proposed by my
right hon. friend along the line indicated
were regarded as objectonable by the goverament. They propose to enlarge the
scope of the commission beyond the point
that it was contemplated the commission
should make inquiry into. It was thougbt,
particularly by the Department of Finance,
that making it obligatory on the commission to obtain that information would interfere with the purpose the commission
has* in view, name]y, to obta.in information strictly for the purpose of
dealing with the tariff. I can quite appreciate the force of what my right hon.
friend bas said as to the necessity of parliament beingc seized with that class of information, but it should come through the
Census Bureau.

if the operation of this road, notwithstandiing its having been built by the Ontario
goverriment, should not be successful, if
it should have been a failure, the central
government would undoubtedly have come
to the assistance of the province, as it bas
on other occasions, and have assisted lu
the building of this road to the extent of
the subaidy now asked for. Because the
province bas made a auccess, I do not say

whether the road is really a profitable
one.

granted a subsidy for a similar purpose to

-that as it is a necessary link lu the opera-

tion of the National Transcontinental railway, bringing it into touch with the settled
portions of Ontario, that alone should be
a gr.ound for the assistance wbich is now
provided for in this Bill. Let us assume
for, a -moment that thîs road was not buiît,
and that it was simply a road projected for
the purpose of developing the resources of
that northern country, as it bas already
done, the settlemnt of the dlay beit, and
of the minerai resources in that northern
country, and the promoters of such a road
would make application to this government, 'would this government hesitate to
place it on an equality with the other roads
which have received similar assistance?
Not for a moment-this government, and
the late government, would have assisted.
There is another consideration ln addition
to those 'which. 1 have mentioned, and
which will possib'ly appeal to my right
hon. friend more strongly than any of the
others, and that la that lu the distribution
of the railway subsidies the province ol
Ontario shculd not be overlooked. This is
a~ aubsidy looking particularly to the development of a railway enterprise which,
possibly, .may yet be in its iufancy. The
Temiska.ming and Northern Ontario la but
a small factor of the road which it will
become eventua:lly. It will eventually probably reach the shores of the Hudson bay
and open up that uortheru country to an
extent almost unlooked for. But there.is
no reason why the province of Ontario
should not be placed in the saine position
in the distribution of r.ailway subsidies as
the other provinces of the Dominion, notwithstanding the fact that the government
has built this road and bas been <perating
it successfully.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-Will the subsidy
apply to-the new parts of the railway or
to the old?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It applies to the
old and to the branches. The branches
are mentioned on the back of the Bull.
Hon. Mr. TALBOT-If we grant this subsidy to this Ontario road, will that place
the road under the Railway Act, and under
the control of the Raîlway Commission as
to ratesP The argument that I have used
ail through the western part of the coun-

SENATE

try in favour of giving subsidies to railways was that by doing so we had the government control of the rates to be charged.
If the Railway Commission is to have control over the rates on that road I might
feel inclîned to support this measure.
Otherwise I doubt if I would. The hon.
gentleman said that certainly Ontario
should receive the saine consideration as
some of the éther provinces do in this way,
and I think it is right. Although the government has not said s0 openly, ifs actions
have indicated that the provinces that are
friendly to the present government are certainly being well treated. Anybody would
notice that by glancing over a few of the
Bis that have corne through in the last
few days; the province of British Columbia is receiving $6,000,000; New Brunswick,
$1,600,000; Prince Edward Island is receiving an annual grant of $100,000; Manitoba, $2,000,000; and now we have the province of Ontario aiso asking money.

of the fact that parliarnent is about to
vote a bonus or free gift of over $2,OO0,OOO
to Ontario on behaif of a certain raîlroad,
if that railroad would thereby, as a consequence, corne under the Railway Coinmission. The leader of the goveriment in
this House immediately stated that it
-would not.
That was hie first answer.
'Then the right hon. leader of the opposition said: ' But the work is declared to, be
of national advantage to Canada.! Then
the hon. leader of the governiment said:
' Well, if that be the case, I presume it
will have to come under the commission.'
Are we passing legisiation and laws on
presumption? Even with the hion. leader,
-able man as hie is, too able, his presumptions do not amount to anything. W~e
want our laws in black and white. He
has not given an answer. I think this
ies lip-shod leis1ation. The Jhon. leader
of the goveriment is from the west. He
.appealed to this House to rrant to the
poor province of Ontario a -bonus, a free
gift over $6,400 peri mile on nearly 300
miles. Does the hon. leader of the government know the condition of thing-s in the
province of OntarioP Does hie Dlot kniow
that Ontario neyer piled up one dollar of
debt on behaîf of railways? Is hie not
aware of that fact?,
Is he not aware of the fact that the entire
provincial debt of the province of Quebec
was due to subsidizing railways almost to
the extent of $33,000,000, while the province of Ontario neyer piled up one dollar
.of debt on bchaîf of its railway systemneyer as long as the Lîberals were in
power? Now my hon. friend makes. a plea.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS.

to us to grant to thiis rich provinice a bonus
for -a road whiichi is paying actually, according to the hion. member from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Jaffray), large dividends. The
government muet take many of us here as
peop'le who know nothing, as long as they
bave friends to serve, but I a&m not one
of that kind. I know sornething of the
history of the country, and when the bon.
gentleman makes an appeal of that kind
to the House I do not know whether hie
does so for want of respeet-it cannot be
want of respect, because the hion. member
is too rnuch of a gentleman for that-but
iA is not according to the facts and not according to the necessîties of the situation.
The province of Ontario is not entitled to,
one cent on this road. It has made a paying investinent and is not in the sarne position as Prince Edward Island- There is
reither necessi-ty nor justification for the
expenditure. The Ontario governrnent hias
been amply justified in the construction of
the road by the large returna they are getting frorn it. As the hon. member frorn
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Jaff.ray> said, if that
railway were sold to-day it would bring a
good profit to the province. Ail these measures which have been brought down in
the past ten days have but one object and
purpose in vîew, that is te fatten the fund
of the Conservative party for the next general election, two or tLhree years from this.
All their donations -out of the national
treasury have been made to their friends
in the several provinces, and I have neyer
seen, in the history of the British Empire or the history of Canada, wliere a Liberal rnajority bas helped a Tory minority
to carry their measures. The hon, leader
of the governinent rnay be proud ef his
work. He is meek when it suite his purpose and hie uses the iron hand in the velvet glove when necessary. He is a most
astute politician. He has pulled the wool
over the eyes of the senators, just as he
did in the case of the hon. Tuember from
Russell (Hon. Mr. Edwards) who has' admitted that hie voted for a most improper
measure, simply because the leader o! the
Heuse made out that the people of Prince
Edward Island 'were paupers. Now hé sets

Brunswick, and says: ' If you vote $100,000

bridges over the St. John river.' What is
the resuit? Representatives of one province

of the situation, according to their own admission? The point I want to make is this:

for the government to see that legisiation
is brought in at the next session,
providing that any railway that applies
to the Dominion of Canada for a
subsidy automatically cornes under the
control of the Railway Board, and
under the control of the Minister of Railways of Canada. It would place the whole
matter in a very rnuch more satisfactory
condition, and would, in the long run, I
think, be very much for the benefit of the
general public.
They would then have
only one ]Railway Board to deal witéh, and
they would only have to uunsider what the
findings of that board were with regard to
the question of rates.
lI British Columbia 1 think we are going to have a great
deal of trouble and bother over that question, and the people ini lhat particular case
have not got what they think they have,
but only time will show what the result
will be. I think the saine question applies
to this railway that is now before us, and
I simply want to put myseif on record
that 1 amn sorry I did not take a more decided action with regard to the Bill of the
British Columbia Railway Company the
other day.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-There are, it strikes
me, other resens why this subsidy shou]d
nlot be granted. Not later than this rnorning we passed a Bill giving the Grand Trunk,
railway running rig*hts over this road, and
the sum mentioned was $300,000 of a subsidy to this road. I have read somewhere
-although I have flot time to put my hand
on the authority just now-that the actual
cost of that road when first started was
$15,000,000, and, the sum of $20,000,000 wvas
offered to the Ontario governrncnt for the
road. Two million more have been spent
on the road niaking the cost $ 17,000,000
and I amn told they could to-day seil the
road for $25,000,000.
Why should the
Dominion government grant a subsidy of
$2,000,000 to a road that is flot only paying
its way but is paying a dividend? You cannlot call it a baby industry; it is already
established and doing- a large business. TaIking about provincial subsidies, my right
hcn. friend from Hastings (Hon. Sir Mackenzie Bowell) has corrected his mistake.

provinicial money-not one sing-le farthingof federal subsidy vas granted to the
road. After the road was in operation,
the then governiment decided it was
highly indecent for a local geverniment
to own a road, and they sold it to
their own friends for $7,000,000.
It cost
$14,000,000, and whien rny hion. friend

of this Bill.
I absolutely disagree with
hon. gentlemen on 'the other side of the
House.
Hon. Mr. KERR-Thet is strangae.
Hon. Mr. POPE-Not strang-e-it would
be peculiar if I did. In the first place, the
fact that this road is a success, has netiling to do with the question.
What particularly pleases me, is that it is a government-owned railroad operated by the province of Ontario. I amn absolutely opposed
to company owned railroads. I arn ini faveur ef goverument ownership of railroacls,
and it is a great pleasure for me to vote for
any measure tending in th at direction, no
niatter how indirectly it may corne. If the
people are going to have an opportunity ef

So wvhen the United States had a total
population four times as great as ours
their expenditure was just about one-haif of
ours to-day and their total taxation about
one-haif

the taxation which

the

govern-

ment of this country tell us is necessary
to carry on the aff airs of the Dominion.
Nnw, if anybody complains, as possibly he
might complain, that these were old times
and rooney is not worth as much to-day as
it was then, I say it is true, but that is n
sort of an explanation of the enormous
disparity to which 1 have referred; and as
1 mentioned some timne ago, but the thing is
worth repeating to-day, t.he total taxation
oi the Ujnited States is now a little under
six hundred million dollars, for a population of nînety-four millions. The annual
charge per head for ail kinds of federal expense, army, navy and the big pension list,
is something like $6.40 per head, while our
taxation amounts, according to the state-

SENATE
ments laid on the table of the House, to
considerably over one hiundred million dollars and our charge per head to something
very like $14 or $15. Nor is that the least
part of it. In addition to that, as everybody knows, in this country while taxation
is extrernely heavy in sorne parts it is extrernely light in others, and the consequence is that certain portions of this Dominion are enormously taxed, perhaps as
heavily taxed as any portion of the Britishi
Dominions, flot excepting England. itself.
Now there is one other remark 1 have to
make with respect to this measurethat is, the gross partiality with which
these estimates have been prepared. As
has been pointed out time and again,
and is apparent in every line of these
estirnates and every statute we are
about to be called upon to sanction,
wherever the governrnent have friends the
government make donations, and generous
donations too. Where the administration is
in the handa of gentlemen of the Liberal
party, then the governinent can see no occasion whatever for bestowing any portion
of thîs huge surplus at ail. What has heen
given to Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec or
Nova Scotia? Turn to the other side of the
picture and you find Prince Edward Island
donated $100,000 a year, equal to about
$3,00,000 if it were capitalized. We find
.New Brunswick well considered. a very, I
will flot Say inequitable, but a very liberal
allowance made to 'New Brunswick for the
administration of a railway they are about
to build, and we have lately been called
upon besides that to vote one million dollars, or more, for the purpose of construeting three bridges for their benefit. We
proceed now to my own province, Ontario.
Well, the good intentions of the government
have not borne exactly the fruit they desired, so we wiil say nothing about it.
When we corne te Manitoba we find that
they are presented out of the treasury -with tu-o millions odd, and in
British Columbiia thére is at least six
millions of a free donation on the part
of 'this generous govern ment to gentleý
men who are politically in accord with
it. Now 1 mention that to start on. What
else have they done? They have, in the
±irst place, succeeded in absolutely tearing
up the British North Arnerica Act. There

is not a sing-le solitary portion of the federal compact, as it stood a matter of six
months or a year ago, which these gentlemnen have not completely destroyed. They
have put an end to the arrangement that
was made between the provinces, have defied even an imperial Act in their legislation, and I greatly doubt if they have done
that legally; I arn very rnuch inclined to believe, on the contrary, that
if the matter can corne bef-ore the courts it
will be foiind that these gentlemen have
grossly exceeded their legal, as well as
their moral right, in what they have done.
They have pretty well succeeded in getting rid of the large surplus which they
did not create, but which they found
ready for thern, and if, as I fear, the resuit of some of the legîislation that we;
have been putting through will be te bring
forward a hiuge host of demanda from the
other provinces, which 1 see no reasonable
hope of deferring or refusing if they are
brought forward, they will have positively
by one of these Acts made provision to
increase our fixed charges in a way which.
will practically nearly double the national
debt of Canada. I arn not going to dwell
furt-her on the case of our friends in Prince
Edward Island except to rernark this, 'that
I believe if 1 could get the exact statistics from the post office authorities 1 would
be able to show that that excellent little
island is a larg-er depositor per head-I believe it is-in the gevernment and post
office savings banks than any other province in this Dominion.
Having deait -%ith w-hat they have sutceeded in doing, I wish to say a word or
twvo as to our outlooek for the future.
I
have before me a very remarkable statemient which wvas laid before the Hlouse in
a report presented by my hion. friend from
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power).
It is one
which I purpose commenting on more
fully on a future occasion and it is one
%vhich no inhabitant cf Canada, if lie will
take the trouble te study it and see what
it involves, can fail to admit is a staternent
whicb calls for the most serious consideration on our part. The relative increase
of the urban and rural poulation during
the last decade is shewn in the following

argument could be brought forward to show
more conclusively the enormous niischief
brought to Canada by the introduction of
the wretched farce known as the National
Policy than the condition Ontario found itself in in the year 1901. In the decade ending that year that great and rich province
barelv increased by sixty-eight thousand
souls, and that increase, paltry and poor as
it was, had taken place under the late government, and not un-der their predecessors.
Tfo men w~ho know wliat the real condition
of things is, nothing could show more conelusively the mischievous character of the
policy I have characterized than thé condition to which Ontario had been reduced
in the year of grace 1901. Now, 1 say those
thing-s require consideration and 1 hope my
lion. friend will flot give up until lie lias
probed that matter to the very bottom.
Thle hion. gentleman wants to know why I
think this disastrous and disgraceful state
of things in the distribution of population
lias occurred in .Canada? 1 will tell hlm.
For three and thirty years since the Mackenzie administration was defeated, the
farmers of Canada have been penalîzed for

iprîvA.-ztd classes,
as the hon. zentiemian knov.- riLht weli.
There is but one thing more to which 1
shall cali attention and it is this: If there
be one thing that ought to be clearer than
another to every hon. gentlemnan who has
taken a share in politics during the last
tive and twenty years, it is that the whole
of the present prosperity of Canada-and
1 make that statement with ail possible
emphasis-is entirely dependent on the
development of the Northwest, and the
Northwest development was due entirely to
the action of the late government. Here
we have a case in which the present pros-,
perity of Ontario-and it is very considerable-the present prosperity of Quebec, and
in many parts it is very considerable, we
have that due wholly and entirely te the
development of the Northwest. 1 have
shown
how
completely
Ontario
had
been reduced to a condition of atrophy
until after the year 1901, when it began to
feel the effect- of the revival in the Northwest. Then, I say, our prosperity, such
as it is, is due te the Northwest, and the
largest iactor in the prasperity of the Northwest has been the huge influx of capital
from the United States within the last six
or eeven years. Perhaps hon. gentlemen
are not aware of the enormous a.mount of
capital which has poured into that country from the United States ever since the
years 1904-5. They will find in my hon.
friend's report wvhen it reaches us, a detaîled statement showing that %vithinthose
five or six vears, somethin like six hundred million dollars of United States capital has been brought into this country and
to that-thouzh. I do flot sav the entire
prosiperitv of the Northwezt is due te
that-I say the phenomenal
prosperity
which has attended it is main'y due. And
how have thesze gentlemen repaid it? I do
flot know a case of more selflsh stupidity
than that which has been displayed, I regret te say, by a majoritt. of My own
countrymen in the province of Ontario in
dealing- with the provinces of the Northwvest. First of ail, not content with exacting from them an enormous federal taxation, they have allowed them to be pillaged

ers in Ontario and Quebec, and to crown
ail, when there wvas an opportunity o! confe-ring- a great benefit on the Northwest,
when there wvas an opportunity of providin.- them with a market which would have
broken, to a large extent, the effects of the
xnisfortunes which overtook many o! them
owing to the inclemency of the season this
last year these gentlemen deprived themn at
one blow of the market which might have
saved them, and also took away from the
maritime provinces the sole chance in a
lifetime of recovering the prosperity whichi
they once enjoyed and cf which they have
been deprived cf late. What is the true
course that statesmen should pursue under such circumstances?
What is the
course rny hon. friend opposite <Hon. Mr.
Lougheed) would pursue if he 'were leader
cf the government--and he would make a
much better leader than the present'one?
Why, they ought te admit at once that they
had, whether rightly or wrongly, heen instrumental in inflicting great injury on the
Northwest by depriving them cf the right
of entry te the huge market at their doors
waiting for them, and they would pre.
pare, by reducing the heavy burden of
federal and other taxation now resting on
them, to make such paltry compensation
as it was possible for them to make for
that error. That is the true course. I amn
quite certain if I could hypnotize my hon.
rriend and make him state the thougahts
that he entertains on this subject, that is
the course he would advise. and possibly
he may succeed in bringing it about yet.
0f
There is one thing I wish te add:
aIl the absurdities that can be well crowded into a document like this, it does seexn
to rme that the most absurd propo'saI is
that we should expend hundreds of thousands o! dollars for the purpose o! trying
to extend our trade and commerce in the
remotest corners of the earth and shut the
door te the greatest trade we could reasonably hope to obtain with a hundred millions cf the rich-es-t and best custemers l

toba and to, make financial provision oinmensurate with the requirements of its enlarged area, will, I amn sure, be 'welcomed,
alike by the present inha.bitants of that
province, and by those whio dwell in the added
territory now admitted te the advantages of
the Provincial etatus.
The enlarge-ment of -the limite of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec wUll undoubtedly
contrîbute to the progress and development
of those Nor'thern territories' which hitherto
have been little known and which will lieneforth form par.t of those great provinces.
Hlighly important and far-reaohing advanages ehould resuit from. the measure to aid
and encourage Agriculture in concerni 'with
the several provincial governinents, whieh I
doubt not ivill materially contrîbute ta the
development and progress of that great basic
industry.
Most compreThe Act respecting GTainhensive measure--will, it is he.ped, assist the
farmer in the marketing of his produce. as
well as in obtaining better prices, thus relieving himi of disad-vantages under 'whioh he
has hi-therto ]aboured.
Gentlemen of -the Hanse of Commons:
I thank you in His Majesty's na.me for the
liberal provision you have made for the -tequirement6 of the Publie Service.

Gentlemen of the Blouse of Cousinons:
I amn glad, at 'this comparatively early
period of the seaeon, ta be able te, relieve you
f roin further attendance in Parliarnent.
The diligenoe with which you have applied
yeurselves to your publie dutie-s, calls for
my warm acknowledgments.
The Act -te extend the boundaries cf Mani-

Honourable Gentlemen of the Senate:
