OPENING OF FOURTH SESSION
TWENTY-EIGHTH PARLIAMENT

Parliament having been summoned by Proclamation to
meet this day for the dispatch of business:
The Senate met at 10.30 a.m., the Speaker in the Chair.
Prayers.

COMMUNICATION FROM GOVERNOR GENERAL'S
SECRETARY
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have

received the following communication:

GOVERNMENT HOUSE
OTTAWA

February 17, 1972
Sir,
I have the honour to inform you that His Excellency
the Governor General will arrive at the main entrance
of the Parliament Buildings at 10.35 a.m. on this day,
Thursday the 17th of February, 1972, and when it has
been signified that all is in readiness, will proceed to
the Chamber of the Senate to open formally the
Fourth Session of the Twenty-eighth Parliament of
Canada.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Esmond Butler
Secretary to the Governor General
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

At 11 a.m. His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate Chamber and took his seat upon the
Throne. His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and, that House
being come, with their Speaker, His Excellency was
pleased to open the Fourth Session of the Twenty-eighth
Parliament of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
This reunion of your two Houses with the Representative of the Crown marks the beginning of the Fourth
Session of the 28th Parliament of Canada.

25312-1

Before proceeding to the business of the new session I
should like to thank you in the name of our Queen and on
behalf of all Canadians for your efforts and accomplishments during the long Third Session which began the 8th
of October 1970 and was concluded only yesterday.
During that period there was a continuing celebration
of centennials connected with the foundation of the
Canadian Confederation. Manitoba and the Northwest
Territories concluded ceremonies which marked the 100th
anniversary of their incorporation into the Dominion. The
admission of British Columbia, which gave Canada its
place on the Pacific Ocean, was commemorated in 1971
with much enthusiasm and a multitude of ceremonies and
projects. As in the year before, our gracious Queen and
other members of the Royal Family marked the event
with an extensive tour, much to the delight of British
Columbians and Canadians generally.
It gave my wife and me much satisfaction to take official part on several occasions in the British Columbia
celebrations, as well as to travel abroad on behalf of
Canada to The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and
Iran, in response to invitations from the heads of these
States so well disposed towards Canada.
Since last I addressed you some 16 months ago, events
in Canada and elsewhere have continued to demonstrate
the turbulence of this age of changing values and shifting
attitudes. We have witnessed with sadness outbursts of
violence beyond our shores as despairing men and women
have chosen to settle their differences through the use of
force, extending in some cases to actual war. We have
witnessed as well a period of international economic
uncertainty which affected all of the industrialized
nations of the world and which has made us increasingly
aware of our dependence on a strong economic base in
the pursuit of our social goals.
We learned in months gone by that Canada was not
immune from internal pressures. In October 1970 one of
the most difficult national challenges in many years was
met calmly, with discipline, and with the strong support of
the people of Canada. There were sad moments but there
were also memorable examples of resoluteness and
courage.
More recently, we learned from another type of challenge, this time of an economic nature and coming from
without rather than within, that Canada and Canadians
possessed the stamina and the resilience to overcome this
form of adversity as well.
Throughout, pressures for change around the world
emphasized to us that the excitement and the promise of
modern technological achievements become hollow and
mocking to those who find in society little understanding
of their hopes and little provision for their needs. In a
period dominated by bigness, in an increasingly impersonal social system, one of the major challenges facing
government is to remove the impression of isolation
which so often surrounds men and women, depriving
them of their sense of worth, of accomplishment, of fulfil-

SENATE DEBATES

ment, and removing from them their identity as
individuals.
Isolation takes many forms in Canada-physical distance, social stigma, economic deprival. In each of those
forms it represents a degree of rejection, of exclusion, of
estrangement. This country fails in its essential purpose if
it does not ensure that its most precious resource, human
talent, is not wasted away. Our challenge is to remove the
barriers that create isolation, to permit each Canadian to
detect-even if not always able to fulfil-his own potential, to ensure that his image of Canada is one of promise
and compassion.
Every one of us is enriched through involvement in this
stimulating process we call Canada. Our goals and hopes
are bound up in the restlessness and vitality of this rich
land. We in this place have a special responsibility to help
bring these goals and those hopes within reach, to make
real the Canada of which our forefathers dreamed: a land
so large that some of it will remain always serene and
unspoiled; a society which believes in the dignity of every
single individual; a community which husbands its
resources and shares them justly among this generation
and those to follow; an enterprise which permits and
provokes each Canadian to contribute his skills and his
talents.
There will be opportunity in this session of this Parliament to pursue these ends. The Government will lay
before you proposals to continue the development of our
national wealth, to deal more compassionately with those
in our midst who require help, to involve more Canadians
in the ferment and satisfaction of community activities, to
protect our natural heritage, and to strengthen our sense
of identity and our image of ourselves.
Economic security is one of the most effective forces
with which to counter social isolation. Job opportunities
must be found and income uncertainties overcome if all
Canadians are to share in the richness of this land. To
permit the protection and enhancement of those values
and those rights which distinguish Canada as a human
place, a sound economy is absolutely essential. The attainment of such an economy retains a high priority in the
Government's continuing program. The social phenomenon of economic instability is present today in every
industrialized country. We are fortunate that its ill effects
have been less pronounced in Canada than elsewhere.
Our success in increasing our real gross national product,
in the creation of new jobs, and in the maintenance of
price stability bas been achieved through a policy which
encourages an economic environment within which business and all elements of society are able to benefit. At the
same time the Government bas worked to strengthen and
promote the economies of the less developed regions of
Canada. Simultaneously, a range of programs has been
introduced to deal with the specific problems of those
localities and individuals affected by unemployment at
different times of the year.
Unemployment continues to be a matter of intense concern to the Government and will remain a primary focus
of attention and action. Co-operation with the business
and industrial communities will be extended even further
to ensure a favourable business climate. As the economy
continues to gain momentum, the private sector will be
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

February 17, 1972

able increasingly to provide jobs for those Canadians in
need of them. The Government will nevertheless redouble
its efforts to make sure that as many jobs as possible are
available and that the fullest possible use is made of the
skills and initiatives of those who are seeking work. It will
at the same time continue to exert its influence to prevent
the erosion of incomes through the maintenance of reasonably stable prices of the goods and services required
by Canadians.
Our economy is dependent, as are the economies of all
industrialized countries, on the imagination of entrepreneurs and their use of research and innovation, as well
as upon a rational industrial strategy. You will be
informed in months to come of government proposals for
improved policies in these areas which will be of immense
importance to the long term development of our country:
of policies for the use of science and technology designed
to contribute not only to industry but to the qualitative
improvement of the life of Canadians, of an industrial
strategy prepared for the peculiar character of the
Canadian economy. The basis of each will be spelled out
as the session proceeds.
For more than a decade an issue which has attracted
increasing interest and growing debate in this country has
been that of the control of our economic environment.
The debate has emphasized the dual aspects of Canada's
identity and of economic benefit for Canadians. Further
steps will be taken towards the resolution of this issue.
These policy proposals have been designed with a blend
of realism and imagination, as Canada itself was designed
more than a century ago. They are intended to permit this
country to attain a degree of leadership and independence
in selected fields of endeavour while reducing overall
Canadian vulnerability to events both expected and unexpected from beyond our shores.
A further imperative in the structuring of strong internationally competitive industry is the development of a
modern and workable competition policy. The development of such a policy, designed to achieve an efficient and
innovative economy, capable of rapid growth and dynamic change, must proceed through consultation with all
sectors of Canadian society. During the coming weeks the
Government will continue this consultative process and
will place before Parliament a revised policy reflecting
the informed and constructive comments received and
assistance gained.
A major factor in the strength of the Canadian economy
is provided by exports. The Government will pursue vigorously the initiatives it has taken throughout the world to
develop and maintain Canadian markets. Those advantages already gained by ministerial missions to other
countries will be enlarged in a number of ways. One of
these will involve the provision of better credit facilities.
The private financial sector will be encouraged to involve
itself increasingly in export financing. The Government
will continue to develop programs to strengthen secondary industry. Closer scientific and technological co-operation with other countries can be expected. Trade negotiations will seek to enlarge opportunities for Canadian
manufacturers and the consultative machinery with the
European Economic Community and its member states
will be strengthened. Negotiations will continue with the

February 17, 1972
February 17, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

United States so as to extend the benefits gained by each
member of the world's most important trading
partnership.
Policies designed to promote a related, yet distinct,
sector of the economy, tourism, will be revealed in coming
weeks.
A basic building block in the growth of Canada's
national wealth has been the performance of our resource
and energy industries. Over the years they have opened
new frontiers and stimulated the development of the
sinews and muscles of Canada; they have accumulated
capital for reinvestment, enhanced the scientific and technical skills of Canadians, and accounted for a healthy
export surplus. A continuation and strengthening of government-industry relations is necessary in order that such
areas of challenge as environmental impact and the
increasing demand both within Canada and abroad for
resources and energy be fully addressed.
The competitive requirements for northern development will continue to be recognized; development will not
be permitted at the expense of the northern peoples and
the northern environment. To ensure the involvement of
the residents of the north, and their participation in the
design of their own future, there will be continued support for the development of local government in the
northern territories.
Canada's primary food producers-our farmers and our
fishermen-form one of the traditional and still basic
strengths of our economy. Their continued productivity
and livelihood is of immense importance to the Government and to the country. Improvements and achievements
of the past several months will be strengthened and continued. Measures already undertaken and which have
substantially improved prices to fishermen-upwards of
50 percent in some cases-will be extended, ensuring that
the benefits of price support for fish products go to the
fishermen themselves. Wheat farmers will be assured of
an increased return equivalent to the higher price for
wheat consumed as food by Canadians. To avoid distortions in food prices, the cost of this program will be borne
by the Treasury rather than by the consumer; to avoid
distortions in production, a formula for distribution will
be proposed which relates payments to grain acreage
rather than to actual wheat production. The Government
will assist further the position of farmers and fishermen
through the implementation of several programs. It proposes the establishment of new national marketing agencies and the implementation of a small farm development
program. The recent extensions of fisheries closing lines
will permit the Government to engage more actively in the
management of its marine resources so as to increase the
supply of fish available to Canadian fishermen in the
waters off our coasts.
Both the effectiveness and the quality of any program
for the provision of services to Canadians depends
increasingly upon a harmonious fiscal relationship
between the federal government and the governments of
the ten provinces. Legislation will be introduced, therefore, proposing the renewal and improvement of equalization arrangements, increasing to 100 percent the level of
stabilization of provincial revenues, and a number of
other items. These will include the administration on
25312-11

behalf of requesting provinces of succession duties and
gift taxes, the extension for two years of the transfers to
provinces respecting post-secondary education, the provision of a five-year revenue guarantee to provinces to
protect their income tax revenues under the new system,
and the sharing with provinces of the special tax on
undistributed corporate income.
As a further protection against the isolation of individuals caused by economic deprivation, the fundamental
reform of protective measures which commenced last
year with the new Unemployment Insurance Act will continue. A new Canada Labour Code, reflecting the many
representations received in past months, will be introduced as will important amendments to the Fair Employment Practices Act. The Canada Manpower programs will
be improved and additional steps will be taken to make
the training and placement services adequate to the needs
of specially disadvantaged people whose particular problems present challenges which cannot be met with the use
of regular program resources or techniques. For those
persons seeking to further their education, the loan limits
under the Canada Student Loans Act will be raised, permitting students to borrow more within a given year and
increasing significantly the total amount available under
the program.
The isolation which is a product of social injustice is
less well understood than that which comes from economic denial. Nevertheless, its consequences dare not be
ignored by any society. The irony of isolation in an urban
surrounding cannot be resolved by any single act. One
essential, however, is the provision of adequate housing of
high standard to all Canadians. More dwelling units were
started in 1971 than in any single year in our history,
including a record number for lower income families. It is
clear, however, that Canada's housing needs cannot be
met only through increases in scale. What is required, and
what the Government will be proposing, are fresh concepts, continuing research, and imagination in neighbourhood improvement with emphasis on the need for lowcost housing.
In order to achieve our goal of full participation by all
members of society, all barriers leading to isolation must
be removed. We cannot invite respect for our laws and
support for our institutions from persons to whom they
are irrelevant or ineffective. Government activities must
reflect the needs of all Canadians, not only the favoured.
A giant step in this direction was taken with the adoption
last session of tax reform legislation which spreads more
evenly the burden of social services on those Canadians
best able to bear it. Another step, and long overdue,
consists of policies to ensure the equality of women in
Canadian society. These will be announced this session.
Protective steps will be proposed in a number of areas
of wide concern to Canadians-the non-medical use of
drugs, compensation for victims of crime, and the protection of privacy. Progress toward more humane treatment
of offenders will continue with further reforms in the
penal and parole systems. Amendments will be proposed
for reforms in the administration of the criminal law. The
Government is committed as well to federal participation
in legal aid subject to satisfactory cost-sharing and
administrative details being worked out.

SENATE DEBATES

It is the view of the Government that the most important single factor in the attainment of individual dignity
and active social involvement is the assurance of a secure
income. Considerable progress towards the goal of a total
income security program for all Canadians is achieved in
the new Family Income Security Plan bill which will be
presented for your consideration. The emphasis in this
plan is on protection and is consistent with the Government's belief in the strong sense of self-reliance of
Canadians.
The pride with which Canadians regard this country
and which inspires them to identify with it springs from
many sources. Some of these are physical in nature, some
cultural, still others are economic. Canadians find in the
vast spaces of this land, in its rugged coasts, in its throbbing vitality and in its serene tranquility something of
themselves. It is the intention of the Government that
immense areas of Canada be preserved in their natural
state for the enjoyment of this generation and of generations to come. For the first time some of the grandeur and
the wilderness which is Canada's north will be guaranteed
perpetual preservation through incorporation into the
National Parks System. You will be asked to approve
legislation which will create three new parks north of the
60th parallel, each as large and as spectacular as any in
the world. These three parks, plus the seven new parks
created since 1968, mean that for the first time in our
history every province and territory will include within it
a national park for the benefit of our people.
Companion legislation will be introduced to provide
wildlife habitats and to protect certain endangered wildlife species.
While taking care to preserve for the future, we should,
wherever possible, preserve and restore those achievements of the past which are an essential element in our
self-understanding as a people. You will be asked to consider, therefore, a bill creating and endowing a corporation to be known as Heritage Canada which will go far to
ensure the preservation of items and collections from
Canada's past and to make these accessible for the enjoyment and understanding of Canadians in all parts of the
country. Heritage Canada, complemented by a broadened
National Museums policy, will demonstrate the achievements of our fore-fathers and their successes in overcoming physical isolation and in converting dreams into
reality.
Still another form of isolation springs from indifferent
communications services. It is a matter of concern to the
Government that at this moment many communities do
not receive the national broadcasting service and that
some one million Canadians in 260 communities receive
no television service in their own language. The Government proposes, therefore, that the C.B.C. be authorized to
extend its services in a comprehensive fashion and to
utilize the capabilities of Canada's pioneer satellite communications system to assure within a five year period
that at least 98 percent of Canadians are served.
The standards against which a society is judged by
others and by history are often those chosen by the society itself. The image it projects, the values to which it
adheres, the treatment it accords the disadvantaged in its
midst; these are matters for each society to determine,
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

February 17, 1972

and in determining to be judged. In our relations with one
another, in federal-provincial relations, in Canada's relations with other countries, our values are both guides and
distinguishing features. Canada is committed to the betterment of life for all, to the resolution of differences by
reason not force, to the practice of tolerance, to the
acceptance of love and understanding as the most important of human traits. The Government, therefore, will
continue to participate fully in international efforts for
peace and for the well-being of people everywhere. It will
continue to do what it can on behalf of the Canadian
people to assist those who are afflicted by calamities, both
natural and man-made.
The fluidity in world affairs marked by events in the
past months and those expected in the near future present
to us an opportunity to deepen and enrich our relationships with our old friends and to seek and strengthen
friendships with others both within and without the councils and agencies of the United Nations. Isolation within
the international community is as barren and damaging
as is isolation within a domestic society. The visits to
Canada in 1971 of such distinguished Heads of State and
Government as the Presidents of Yugoslavia, Nauru and
Niger, and the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom,
the Soviet Union, Ceylon, Ghana, Malaysia, Fiji, Senegal,
and Israel illustrate the universality of Canada's attitude
to the world.
Canada's lines of communication and understanding
continue to stand open in all directions. In particular, our
ties with our friends in the new Europe and our attachment to the United States remain of the greatest importance. A United States which is strong, dynamic and outward looking is vital to the success of Canada's
international endeavours and to our ability to contribute
to the well-being of fellow Commonwealth countries and
of those states in receipt of Canadian economic assistance
including the fellow members of l'Agence de Coopération
culturelle et technique des pays francophones to whose
important conference we acted with pride as host last
autumn. The Government and all Canadians anticipate
with considerable pleasure the visit to Canada this spring
of the President of the United States and Mrs. Nixon.
Our age is marked by inconsistency. Within our societies, the trend all too often is toward increases in size and
of impersonality in human relationships while on the
planet itself the speed of communication has created a
new intimacy among nations. In these circumstances,
there is both challenge and opportunity for governments
and for individuals. Canada is seized of the challenge. The
Government pledges itself to turn the opportunities to the
benefit of individual Canadians.

POVERTY
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE
Hon. David A. Croll moved, with leave of the Senate:
That a special committee of the Senate be appointed

He said: Honourable senators, this motion is in the same
terms as in the Second and Third Sessions of the Twentyeighth Parliament.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would remind honourable senators that all these motions are debatable.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The motion is in the same terms with the
exception that the name of the late Senator Roebuck is
eliminated.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why is this committee being
reconstituted?
Hon. Mr. Croll: It is essential for this reason, that we
have unsatisfied commitments and obligations. Our first
printing was sold out and a second printing is in process
but will not be ready until about March 10. I think the
second printing will also be sold out eventually.
The documents involving the research material are
being catalogued for the library and the Archives. This
also gives the house an opportunity to continue with the
debate. I know that ten or twelve members have indicated
their desire to participate in the debate. I hope that many
more will.
Some members require information from time to time
and certain material bas been supplied to them. There is

February 22, 1972

no doubt that others will require material and information as well. It is for these reasons that we require the
committee to be reconstituted.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: I agree with the first purpose

indicated by Senator Croll. If there is something that has
to be done by the committee to complete its work then it
should be reconstituted. As far as continuing the debate
on the report is concerned, that motion is superfluous,
because any honourable senator can draw the attention of
the house to the report, and there is no need to reconstitute the committee for that purpose.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If it is only for terminating its work that
it is necessary to reconstitute the committee, then I am in
full agreement with the motion, but I do not think the

second reason really applies.
Motion agreed to.

LABOUR RELATIONS
DISPUTE BETWEEN TREASURY BOARD AND THE
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL
WORKERS-QUESTIONS
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I should

like to ask some questions of the Leader of the Government. I apologize for not giving him notice before, but if
he wishes he can take this as notice now. I should like to
ask a number of questions concerning the continuing
anarchy being perpetrated against the Canadian people
and the economy of Canada by small groups of trade
union members allegedly in the name of collective
bargaining.
When the air traffic controllers' strike was on, and these
people naively thought they could compel the Prime Minister to recall Parliament in order to deal with the strike,
the Prime Minister is reported to have said that he
believed in letting the collective bargaining process run its
course. In the light of that statement I have four questions
to put to the Leader of the Government.
First, does the government not think that the so-called
collective bargaining process has just about run its course
so far as the IBEW is concerned?
The President of the Treasury Board is reported to have
said that the government has asked the Public Service
Staff Relations Board for permission to prosecute the

leaders of the union and the designated personnel who,

for nearly three weeks, have been flagrantly breaking the
laws of Canada.
Second, how is it necessary for a sovereign government

to have to ask one of its creations for permission to
prosecute common law-breakers?
Third, granting that this supreme authority, the Public
Service Staff Relations Board, deigns to give the Government of Canada permission to enforce the law of Canada,
will the government prosecute these people to the full
extent of the law, under which they are liable to fines of
$100 per day?
Finally, does the government contemplate repealing the

section of the Public Service Staff Relations Act which
gives public servants the right to strike?

DEBATES

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I shall have to
take these questions as notice, as Senator Cameron sug-

gested. I shall reply to them as soon as possible.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I would have
asked almost the same questions as Senator Cameron,
had he not done so. However, perhaps the government
leader can give a short reply at the present time to the
question: When does the government intend to do something about the awful situation that exists presently with
respect to air traffic?
Hon. Mr. Walker: There is an election coming up.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Let me tell what happened to me
tonight. I left Quebec at 5.15 p.m. to arrive here at 6.25
p.m. on a flight going from Quebec via Ottawa to Toronto.
As I entered the airport I heard an announcement over
the loud speaker to the effect that travellers on flight 379
to Toronto would have to wait until 10.30 p.m. This situation has existed now for two weeks, and I wonder when
the government will begin to look after the well-being of
the people of Canada.

Hon. Mr. Walker: After the election.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The government leader bas nothing to
say?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I would point out that my friend did
not ask a question; he simply made a speech.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Of course I asked a question. I asked
when the government is going to act. To me the answer is
quite clear-the government is simply going to do nothing,
as usual.
Hon. Mr. Martin: My friend bas answered his own question, if that is the reply he wants.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the
session.

Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold moved, seconded by Hon. Renaude Lapointe:
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Roland

Michener, Chancellor and Principal Companion of the

Order of Canada, upon whom has been conferred the
Canadian Forces' Decoration, Governor General and
Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
May it please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects,

the Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled, beg
leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has
addressed to both Houses of Parliament.
He said: Honourable senators, it is indeed a privilege for
me to be given the honour of moving the motion for the
Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. As a

SENATE DEBATES

relatively new senator, having been summoned to this
chamber last November, I have been greatly impressed
with the dedication of my fellow senators to their duties
and responsibilities of government. I came to this chamber at a most interesting time, since there was a very great
deal of activity during the period of November and
December. I was privileged to participate in the tabling of
the reports of certain Senate committees, first that of
Senator Croll's Special Committee on Poverty, and then
Senator Everett's National Finance Committee report
entitled "Growth, Employment and Price Stability." Since
that time we have received copies of Volume II of the
report of Senator Lamontagne's Special Committee on
Science Policy. I think all honourable senators will agree
with me that these are very important documents and the
work that has gone into their preparation bas made a
significant contribution to the well-being and development of Canada. I believe they have greatly enhanced the
reputation of this upper chamber. It was a privilege to be
present as a member of this chamber when these reports
were tabled and to participate in the discussion of them. I
was impressed by the reception which was given these
reports across the nation.
I also had the opportunity of receiving my baptism by
fire when the controversial Bill C-259, to amend the
Income Tax Act, was considered and debated. At times
the debate was heated; nevertheless, I believe the Senate
performed its duty in respect to that legislation. The
debate on the Farm Products Marketing Agencies bill also
added to the excitement of the period. It provided an
opportunity for becoming acquainted rather quickly with
many of my colleagues, including both supporters of the
government and those worthy honourable senators who
sit opposite. I especially appreciate the leadership given
by the Leader of the Government, the Honourable Paul
Martin. I have known the honourable senator for many
years. When I am in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, many
people ask after Senator Martin, and they ask me to pass
on their regards to him. He is a respected Canadian, an
outstanding parliamentarian who is dedicated to the service of his country. It is a privilege for me to serve with him
on the government side of this chamber. I was impressed
by the advice he gave me when I became a member here.
He was convinced of the importance of the Senate as part
of the Parliament of Canada, and he advised me to speak
up and to bring before the Senate important items of
interest to the citizens of Canada. He indicated that as
Leader of the Government he was anxious to ensure that
the Senate fulfilled its proper role in Parliament. I hope I
will be able to live up to his advice.
I should also like to comment on the leadership given by
my colleague on the opposite side, the Honourable
Jacques Flynn. I have enjoyed him very much. He is a
clever debater, an entertaining speaker, and a gentleman
of good humour who carries out his duties in an exemplary manner.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I also express thanks to His Honour
the Speaker for the guidance and counsel he gives in his
difficult role in maintaining proper procedure and order
in this chamber.
[Hon. Mr. Buckwold.J

February 22, 1972

The Speech from the Throne, delivered by His Excellency the Governor General last Thursday, is a wide-ranging
human document, basically concerned with people and
their well-being. To me the whole tone of the message
contained in this Throne Speech is found in the following
excerpt:
In a period dominated by bigness, in an increasingly
impersonal social system, one of the major challenges
facing government is to remove the impression of
isolation which so often surrounds men and women,
depriving them of their sense of worth, of accomplishment, of fulfilment, and removing from them their
identity as individuals.
Isolation takes many forms in Canada-physical
distance, social stigma, economic deprival. In each of
those forms it represents a degree of rejection, of
exclusion, of estrangement. This country fails in its
essential purpose if it does not ensure that its most
precious resource, human talent, is not wasted away.
Our challenge is to remove the barriers that create
isolation, to permit each Canadian to detect-even if
not always able to fulfil-his own potential, to ensure
that his image of Canada is one of promise and
compassion.
* (2030)

In my opinion the key word in this whole statement is
"isolation." The objective of the Government of Canada
as outlined in the Throne Speech is the elimination or
minimization of isolation in the Canadian nation. The
word "isolation" is used eleven times in the Speech. Webster defines it as a state of being set apart from others. A
government concerned with people is to be greatly
admired for using this approach which represents, I
believe, a major step in achieving a just society.
Honourable senators, let me discuss in general terms
this isolation to which reference was made, and how absolutely essential it is that action be taken to change the
present situation. I shall deal first with economic isolation, the setting apart of people who seek employment and
cannot find it. This is indicated as one of the top priorities
of proposed government action. Every possible means will
be taken to stimulate the economy in order to provide jobs
for our people. Admýttedly, we have heavy unemployment
today. There is no greater tragedy in the life of any
individual than to be unable to find gainful employment.
It is not easy to be a statistic, and statistics become impersonal in relation to the tragedy of the individual who is
unemployed.
The government has been accused of deliberately creating unemployment. I suggest that it is irresponsible to
make such a statement. There has been a tremendous
growth in our work force. In a recent address Mr. Fred H.
McNeil, the Executive Vice-President and General Manager of the Bank of Montreal, said:
We have a labour force growing at almost twice the
rate of any other industrialized nation. During the
present decade, in fact, it has been calculated that
more people in absolute numbers, not percentages,
will enter the work force in Canada than in the United
Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands
combined.

February 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

That is a pretty impressive statement. Mr. MeNeil
continued:
In order to reduce our unemployment to a respectable
4 per centAnd even 4 per cent is too much.
-next year and to provide jobs for new entrants to
our labour force, our GNP would have to grow by 12
per cent, or more than double what is, in fact, likely.
So I say that we should be fair in assessing the tremendous achievement of the government in providing new
jobs, as represented in the increase in the labour force
during 1971.
Several years ago I had the privilege of serving on the
National Productivity Council. At that time the great challenge facing the Council was in the necessity in the following five years, the period from 1960 to 1965, to create one
million new jobs for Canadians. It seemed to be an impossible objective. I point out that a huge number of jobs
have been created in the past five years, resulting in the
addition of both men and women to the labour force in
Canada.
We read all kinds of newspaper reports, and I suggest
that very often the press is unfair to the government in its
presentation of the facts. I should like to pass on to
honourable senators a refreshing editorial which
appeared in the Saskatoon Star-Phoenixon February 17,
1972, under the heading "Figures Incompletely Reported".
It states in part:
Unemployment figures for January were factually,
but incompetently, reported last week by a Canadian
Press writer. The figures themselves were correct
enough, but they were arranged in an order which
buried the significant facts and gave undeserved
emphasis to subsidiary information. In newspaper circles such writing is criticized as "Backing into a
Story".
I assume Senator O'Leary is well aware of this. The
editorial continues:
As a result, those who did not read the entire report
were left with the impression basic employment in
Canada had worsened within the last 12 months;
whereas the official statistics indicated some improvement in it. True enough, January unemployment was
worse than December's by 1.6 per cent of the labour
force. But this is an entirely normal difference, resulting every year from the stoppage of many types of
work in colder weather.
This should have been noted at the beginning of the
report. Even earlier than that and with more emphasis, it should have been shown unemployment last
month was not quite so bad as it was in January, 1971.
These are the only two months which may, with fairness, be compared; not this January with this December, but this January with last January. True, the
improvement was small; but it was an improvement,
not a loss as the CP report's leading paragraph
implied. The decrease in unemployment was only 0.3
per cent in gross, and 0.2 per cent by seasonal adjustment; but it was there.
The editorial, in the last paragraph, says:
Percentages are misleading; whole numbers are
facts. And the basic fact in this case is that almost a
25312-21

quarter of a million more Canadians were employed
this January than in January, 1971. Statistics Canada
clearly showed this: 246,000 more in the labour force,
plus 3,000 fewer unemployed, adds up to 249,000 more
jobs filled this January than one year ago. That is the
information which should have led off the CP report
and been reflected into the headlines, instead of the
misleading percentage figure which appeared.
The Star Phoenix is not always so favourably inclined
editorially to the policy of the present government. It is
refreshing to find a newspaper-this is the first time I
have seen it-indicating that perhaps the Canadian people
should be given a more unbiased report on statistics
regarding the labour and unemployment situation.
This provides an occasion for me to compliment the
former Minister of Manpower and Immigration, the Honourable Otto Lang, for doing an outstanding job in a
difficult portfolio. I doubt whether any man has had to
face greater pressure than did Mr. Lang while occupying
that position. He is now the Minister of Justice, and the
Honourable Bryce Mackasey has taken over his former
duties. I am sure that Mr. Mackasey will fulfil the duties
of his office as well as his predecessor.
* (2040)

Economic isolation, which includes occupational isolation, must be reduced. When I refer to occupational isolation I refer to low income families, farmers, fishermen,
and to all those people who do not enjoy the best things of
life that Canada has to offer. I am not in a position to say
too much with respect to fishermen, but if some of you
would like to fish in northern Saskatchewan I can say you
will find there some of the best sport fishing in Canada.
I can talk about farmers, however, and I now have an
opportunity to discuss briefly the tremendous impact on
the Prairie provinces of the two-price system for wheat.
This program has often been discussed in this bouse. I am
sure my distinguished colleagues, Senator McDonald and
Senator Argue, have often indicated their support of this
much sought after and long awaited government program. Such a program has been a long time dream of the
Prairie farmers, and now the federal government has seen
fit to institute a program whereby the grain consumed
domestically-and this amounts to about 64 million bushels of wheat a year-will bring a price of $1.05 a bushel, in
addition to the normal market payment. This will be paid
on an acreage basis, as indicated in the Speech from the
Throne, and will not be added to the price of bread. It will
be subsidized by the treasury of Canada and, in my view,
quite rightly.
It may be a difficult thing for many of our eastern
citizens, and perhaps our eastern parliamentarians, to
understand and appreciate how important this is to the
farmers' living. The cost-price squeeze is a real thing. I
can tell you a short story I heard the other day which
illustrates this point. A farmer went into a hardware store
and purchased a hammer for $2.98. A week later he
returned to the store and purchased a dozen hammers,
and a week after that he purchased 50 hammers. The
merchant finally asked him what he was doing with all
those hammers, and he said he was selling them. The
merchant asked, "How can you do that when you are
buying them at the retail price? How much are you selling

SENATE DEBATES

them for?" to which the farmer answered, "I am getting
$1.98 each and they are going like hotcakes." The merchant then remarked that that was not sound business, to
which the farmer replied: "I know, but it is still better
than farming". That is the type of story they tell out west.
I should take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the minister in charge of the Wheat Board, the
Honourable Otto Lang, for finally achieving this long-time
dream of Prairie farmers. It is one of the most welcome
items in the government's program as far as western
Canada is concerned.
The elimination of economic isolation will also be greatly assisted by the enactment of the Family Income Security Plan. This is a very advanced form of social legislation
which will greatly increase the amount of the allowance
going to those families who are in the most need. Additional federal money in the amount of $150 million will be
put into the total program in order to eliminate, as far as
possible, that part of the economic isolation which is
referred to in the Speech from the Throne.
The Speech also referred to the isolation of social injustice, and in my view it is a compassionate kind of reference. It specifically mentioned housing, and the fact that
some Canadians do not have adequate housing due to
their low income. I am delighted to hear of additional
programs to provide housing for low income families.
Such programs have been carried on quite effectively in
the last few years. I am proud to note that in Canada in
1971 we had a record number of housing starts, a good
number of which represented an innovative and, I believe,
an imaginative program of housing for low income
families.
Honourable senators, perhaps I may digress slightly at
this point and speak for a moment about the Minister of
State for Urban Affairs. I do not wish to belabor this
point, but I feel that this whole question of urban affairs,
part of which embraces this housing problem, is a subject
which should be considered in depth by this chamber. I
believe that there is an important role for this chamber to
play in participating, perhaps by way of a standing committee on the affairs of the urban communities of Canada,
and by taking an active part in an advisory, consultative,
or a fact-finding way, in order to assist the Minister of
State for Urban Affairs in his work in this important
portfolio.
I hope I have an opportunity at some time in the future
to discuss this in more detail. We do have a serious problem in urban affairs in that the municipalities are creatures of the provinces, and the provincial governments
are very zealous in their control over the municipal governments in their respective provinces. They hesitate to
allow too much federal participation in urban affairs. As
a matter of fact, at least two of them are very much
against any consultation at all.
I believe the Senate bas an important contribution to
make in this regard, and in due course I hope I will be
able to make a proposal for a standing committee on
urban affairs for consideration by this chamber.
In closing this aspect of my remarks I quote from N. H.
Lithwick's book Urban Canada,in which he states:
[Hon. Mr. Buckwold.]

February 22, 1972

A meaningful urban policy framework can be developed only in the light of a national consensus about its
problem, the objection, and the priority. To date there
is no evidence that such a national urban policy is
being contemplated, and the degenerative processes
now under way in our major metropolitan areas are
encountering a serious policy vacuum.
I believe this chamber can make a contribution in that
regard. Mr. Lithwick indicates that by the year 2000, metropolitan Toronto will have a population of 6,500,000, metropolitan Montreal a population of 6,300,000, metropolitan
Vancouver a population of 2,482,000, and metropolitan
Ottawa a population of 1,616,000.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What about St. John's?
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: St. John's will probably make its
way too, Senator Flynn.
I point out these figures to indicate to my colleagues the
importance of urban affairs in the development of
Canada, and the role which the Senate can play.
The isolation of social injustice will also be mitigated
through legislation in the field of women's rights and
improvements in the Criminal Code to make for more
humane treatment of offenders in our penitentiaries, and
improvements in our parole system.
Those are the types of isolation referred to in the
Speech from the Throne, and I believe the government is
trying nobly to overcome them. The Speech from the
Throne also refers to communication isolation which will
be reduced by improvements in the service provided by
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Finally, honourable senators, I come to the major topic
of international isolation. Canada should not set itself
apart in its relations with other countries of the world,
and the Speech from the Throne indicated, I believe very
accurately, Canada's concern for the rest of the world,
and especially for our relationship with our neighbour to
the south. I am sure our trade relations and problems with
the United States will be debated at great length in the
future, and we shall have many debates on foreign investment in Canada. My only comment at the moment is that I
hope that when a policy does come forward it is carefully
thought out. This is a very complex matter which the
Government of Canada will have to consider. We should
remember the old saying: Marry in haste, repent at leisure. We must balance our need for growth capital and
our absolute dependency on the amount of growth we
need in order to provide employment for our people
against that form of nationalism, which is also, I believe,
worthy of serious consideration.

Honourable senators, I have referred to many of the
objectives indicated in the Throne Speech which will go
towards the elimination of isolation in Canada. They
represent a challenging and meaningful national program
for Canadians.
The opposite of isolation is togetherness, something
very much needed in this country. I sense in this speech
the very able hand of our esteemed Prime Minister, to
whom Canadian unity has always been a major aspiration. When we eliminate that form of isolationism, and
various kinds of human isolation that I have referred to,

Februarv 22. 1972

SENATE DEBATES

we can move towards this togetherness, and thus take a
great step forward in our objective of Canadian unity.
Former Prime Minister Pearson once said, "There is only
one kind of ctizen in Canada-and that is a first class
citizen". This is the theme of the Speech from the Throne.
These are difficuit times, nationally and internationaily.
I arn positive that Canadians wiIl, as they have aiways
done, rise to the occasion, and continue to build in this
country a society that offers opportunity for ail, security
for those who need it, and a future unequalied anywhere
in this wide world.
Honourable senators, it is my pleasure to move the
Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.
[Translation]
Han. Renaude Lapointe: Honourable senators, in doing
me the honour of asking me to second the motion for an
Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, my
leader showed confidence in me. I am deeply touched and
I want him to know how grateful 1 amn. On this the first
opportunity I have to speak in the Senate, I wish first of
ail to pay a sincere tribute to the Speaker of the Senate,
the Honourable Jean-Paul Deschatelets, for the warm and
cordial simplicity of his welcome, for his integrity and his
unerring judgment, for the able, impartial, friendly and
very informai way he fuifils his important duties.
To the stature of the Leader of the Government in the
Senate, the Honourable Paul Martin, who so ably represented our country with dignity on every international
scene, and who continues to promote its interests with
unflagging energy, the timid praise of a newcomer can
add nothing. Stili, may I thank him. on behalf of each of
us, for the vigour with which, verbaily and through the
newspapers, he stood up for the Senate against the
attacks and criticisms to which it was subjected late last
year, and for the clarity with whîch he explained the role
of the Senate in the study of the most controversial bis of
the last session. The vast extent; of his knowledge, the
resuit of a long and solid experience in public and
diplomatic life, deserves aiso to be mentioned once again.
I also salute the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,
the Honourable Jacques Flynn, who preceded me in journalism. As a witness of his activities in Quebec, I was later
able to appreciate from afar, on many an occasion, his
forceful interventions in the Senate.
Finally, I beg of ail my honourable colleagues to believe
that their welcoming wishes reassured me, and that they
can depend on my wholehearted co-operation. The recent
achievements, outstanding in every respect, of the honourable Senators Croil, Davey, Lamontagne and Everett
honour this august assembly and we are proud of the
interest their work has awakened.
Succeeding the Honourabie Thérèse Casgrain, whose
dynamic personality and lively career earned her an international reputation, is no easy task; replacing her is
impossible. Havîng left the Senate while still full of energy
and drive, the one I once called the "Peace fighter" will
certainly not cease to fulfil a very useful role within the
Quebec and Canadian community. I here express my
admiration for her and extend to her my best wishes.
Brilliantly analyzed by my colleague Senator Buckwold,
the Speech from the Throne bas philosophical and social

rather than political implications. Senator Buckwoid's
speech and mine are strangely similar, even though we
only met tonight. This proves that French-speaking and
English-speaking people are quite alike.
The Speech from the Throne emphasizes the feeling of
loneliness of the individuai in an increasingly complex
and impersonal system.
The concern of the government which would like to
dispel that painful feeling and make each citizen understand the meaning of its personality and its own value is
underlined throughout that significant document.
In a country such as ours, designed for giants, must we
be surprised if the human being sometimes feels Lilliputian? Must we be surprised if he experiences more strongly than elsewhere an inner feeling of helplessness which is
clashing with an opposite feeling, that of boundless hopes
commensurate with the country where he is living?
Whether he is the victim of geographic remoteness, whether he is discriminated against on account of the group to
which he belongs or whether he is affected by economic
deprivation, that Canadian feels outside the stream leading his more fortunate fellow citizens to progress and
some kind of happiness.
Removing the barriers raised by those various forms of
physical, social or moral loneliness is one of the main
objectives set by the government for the years to corne.
At the present time, we are quite ciearly conscious of
one of the most painful feelings experienced by that large
percentage of people reduced to inactivity. Not only the
unemployed cannot play their part in the development of
the country, but the economic circumstances compel them
to iead a parasitic life deeply undermining their energies
while iowering a little more each day their pride and
self-confidence. Unemployment is in fact a phenomenon
that goes beyond the individuai's understanding and that
leaves him. helpiess, iooking for an answer that does not
come. A government that recognizes this unfortunate reality will naturally give high priority to the creation of more
jobs. But can such a government undertake this alone? To
give new impetus to the economy, the government must
establish dloser co-operation with the business world and
with industry-which can also create jobs-and, while
asking business leaders to be more daring and more
imaginative, it shouid aiso propose to them, without delay,
an industrial strategy which takes into account the needs
of the country, as several Canadian experts have recently
suggested.
The isolation in which the poor find themselves is no
less distressing. Those particularly unfortunate people
have long realized that they cannot, even with the greatest
good will, take advantage of the present provisions of
Canadian Manpower programs. The time bas long corne
for the training and placement services created by that
department, which for many years have been the object of
some criticism, to be changed in order to meet the real
needs of those people.
In the same way, the isolation of the worker, who has a
family and who, in an urban environment, finds it very
difficuit to find decent housing for his wife and his five or
six children, may give rise to indignation and rebellion
when he walks past apartment buildings which are for-

SENATE DEBATES

bidden to him because of their design and of excessive
rents. Although 1971 has been a record year with regard
to the construction of housing for low-income families, the
need for low-cost housing remains acute, not only for
those families, but also for the aged and the pensioners,
and it is fortunate that the government is determined not
to neglect this sector.
To destroy all barriers that make for isolation, such is,
as we have already stated, the main theme of the Throne
Speech. I feel that it is my duty to congratulate the government for the results already achieved in two fields of
importance for the future of the country, that of bilingualism in the federal services and that of the promotion of
women, especially within those same federal institutions.
* (2100)

[English]
In July 1969, the Official Languages Act was proclaimed. Less than three years later, its implementation
has already brought concrete and irreversible results. The
Language Commissioner's report of his first year of activity is both interesting and encouraging. And the Chairman of the Public Service Commission has equally done
his share to reach the goal set by the government.
The courage, one might even say the pluck, with which
the Chairman of the Public Service Commission set
things straight a month ago on the question of bilingualism in the federal service deserves praise. Not only did he
label as a lie charges that the merit principle is being
disregarded in an attempt to populate the service with
French-speaking employees, but he added that the
French-speaking citizens have not had an even break in
the past and that they occupy at present only 18.2 per cent
of top positions in the Public Service, although they constitute about 28 per cent of the nation's population. It was
good to hear him repeat that the government has set a
program not only of gestures but of substance, that he will
not settle for token bilingualism and that the commission
bas a duty to reflect the dual character of Canada in the
government staff. Since the commission accepts the interpretation that the Public Service should be functionally
bilingual, this means that bilingualism must become an
element of merit for certain positions in certain areas of
Canada.
But why should someone be afraid? Only about 15 per
cent of all positions are affected by the language policies
and most of them at all levels will continue to be filled by
unilinguals. Since proportionately few positions have so
far been declared bilingual, even in the higher categories,
one has indeed to use misrepresentations of facts to draw
the conclusion that any significant number of promotions
have been blocked. In spite of some reports to the contrary, we like to believe that the majority of Englishspeaking Canadians understand the real intentions of the
government and that with a better training of the younger
generations the task of giving a truly bilingual character
to the Public Service will gradually become easier. Another barrier will thus have been removed.
No one ignores the difficulties that the drive towards
bilingualism is creating here, as well as in other parts of
Canada. But the purpose the government has set for itself
is to make this capital a focal point of our national life not
only, as the Prime Minister said recently, in a political
[Hon. Miss Lapointed

February 22, 1972

sense but in every sense. Those few years during which
the bilingualism and multiculturalism policy has been
working through the governmental services, as well as
through the activities of the National Arts Centre and
other institutions, have already permeated the atmosphere of Ottawa. They have given this city a different
image, a different quality, which is beginning to be felt
and appreciated by many of the national capital's former
detractors.
On the other hand, and in answer to many requests
dealing with the decentralization of federal activities, the
government is contemplating the relocation of some
Ottawa-based operations, the first being the moving to
Winnipeg of the coin-making division of the Royal
Canadian Mint. That kind of decentralization has been
suggested many times. Although this will inevitably put
an end to a cherished tradition and disturb some established routine, we sincerely believe it is a sound decision.
In a land so vast, as I said before, there exists a feeling of
isolation. Not only has it to be eradicated, but it bas to be
replaced with something. Especially at both ends of the
country, the sense of belonging has to be stimulated.
Every region should be able to develop that sense better if
it is invited to collaborate in a more concrete way in the
country's administrative doings.
Since its accession to power, the government has proceeded to many nominations which were well received
and which indicate clearly its intention to giving larger
responsibilities and higher ranking positions to women
who aspire to them. Actually, there are some 46,000
women in the Public Service. While they fill only one per
cent of the jobs at the executive level, 80 per cent are in
the lower levels of the administrative support category.
One foresees that in the next decade, more and more
university-trained women will be seeking positions and
demanding equality of pay and promotion. Today they
represent one-third of the university graduates, and by
1980 they will form 45 per cent of the total. Why should
Canada deprive itself of such talent and knowledge?
The Public Service Commission is carrying out its decision to open more senior positions to women, and it will
search even more outside the service for capable women
to compete for positions in the senior levels of management. However, at the lower levels and in every field of
activity, women are still asking for a better supervision
and observance of the law against sex discrimination.
Much remains to be done in job classification as well as in
hiring, firing and promoting, to guarantee the equality of
status to which they are entitled under the law. This is
why they are expecting the rapid implementation of the
recommendations of the Bird Report.
* (2110)

Among the institutions which should lead the way in the
drive for equality of opportunities, some universities are
guilty of practising wage differentials between the male
and female professor. Statistics Canada figures of 1969-70
reveal that male professors receive 7.9 per cent more than
their female counterparts, male assistant professors 4.7
per cent more, and male lecturers and instructors 8.7 per
cent more. Such a situation is no longer tolerable.
The Speech from the Throne well indicates that the
government, in order to achieve its goal of full participa-

SENATE DEBATES
EAE
SNT

tion by all members of the community, will adopt new
policies-which it admits are long overdue-to ensure the
equality of women in the Canadian society. This does not
come as a surprise, since the Prime Minister's speech of
March 1971 hinted that some measures had already been
taken and that the government intended to improve the
situation still further.
[Translation]
Every woman in Canada possesses skills, competence, energy, knowledge and abilities which are often
under-utilized because they are all too often underestimated in their importance.
And the Prime Minister added:
Yet in Canada we have permitted ourselves to develop attitudes which are hostile to the reception of
women into a number of professions and trades and
into politics. In the result each one of us, men and
women, are demeaned.
The Prime Minister also recognized that political parties
share the responsibility for this promotion. He even stated
that he would give unqualified support to women nominated in federal ridings and he invited county organizations to give serious consideration to potential female
candidates. Events have since proved the sincerity of the
government. It is up to the population to do the rest by
changing traditional attitudes.
Speaking for the women of Canada, I thank the same
government for the impetus it has given to the cause of
equal opportunities for women and their fulfilment in
keeping with their aptitudes. Women's organizations
which yearly submit briefs containing many suggestions
and remarks urge him not to slacken his efforts toward
this worthy goal.
Nor should there be any question of isolation for
Canada in the field of international relations. As a result
of a review of external policy undertaken in 1968, Canada
bas considerably extended its horizons and has brought
about a dramatic change of its trends.
Having, as a journalist, fought for recognition of mainland China and its entry into the UN, as well as for a
keener sense of our interests on the other side of the
Pacific, I could not but rejoice over such decisions. We
now have an altogether different outlook on the position
occupied by this country in the world today and some
bold action will have been adequate to confer on Canada
an enlarged stature. To state that the action taken by
Canada was enough to influence the evolution of the
foreign policy of our neighbours would no doubt be presumptuous. However, at the time of our first advances in
1968, few observers could foresee that the President of the
United States and the President of Communist China
would today engage in a dialogue in Peking.
So it is that after having almost exclusively considered
Europe and the United States, with which we still keep the
closest political, economic and cultural relations, we now
consider our nation as part of America and not only
North America, through our new status as a permanent
observer in the Organization of American States and our
full membership in several of its agencies. We also consider ourselves as a nation of the Arctic after the visit of the
Prime Minister and the Minister of Indian Affairs and
Northern Development to the Soviet Union, the signing of

a protocol on consultations and the conclusion of agreements on scientific and technical exchanges with that
country, not to mention the energetic laws that we have
passed to protect our northern heritage. We also consider
ourselves as a nation of the Pacific by virtue of our
increasing exchanges with Japan and our diplomatic and
trade relations with the People's Republic of China, to
name only these two far eastern states. This new balance
in our foreign contacts, this new place for Canada in the
world furthermore includes the strengthening of political,
cultural and economic ties, not only with African members of the Commonwealth but also with those of the
francophone community, which is certainly more in keeping with our interests and our bi-ethnic reality.
Under the influence of events, laws and institutions tend
to change. An American clergyman wrote that, like
clocks, laws must sometimes be cleaned, wound up and
set. Is not the supreme test for a government the capacity
to concile continuity and change? This twin function of
the law which, on the one hand, reflects and confirms the
stable elements of a community and, on the other hand,
can be a powerful and yet peaceful instrument of social
change is the only one that can enable us to achieve a
superior degree of order as well as justice.
From the moment of its election, this government has
attempted this with foresight. After rationalizing some
parliamentary procedures, it produced a host of new policies and impressive legislation, many of which are directed toward improving the condition of the working class. It
was creative and inspiring; it fostered contacts with the
people; it implemented its policy of participation by publishing white papers and by initiating bold and imaginative programs such as Opportunities for Youth and Local
Initiatives. But above all, it met the anxious expectation of
the Canadian people who had asked it in 1968 to hold a
restless Canada together.
0 (2120)

Of this restless Canada, the most restive part is
undoubtedly Quebec. Even though a minority has so far
accepted the theory that its social development depends
on the conquest of its sovereignty, the question of whether
Quebec will find its identity inside or outside the Canadian federation has not been settled yet, and 1972 will probably be another year of confrontation that will hopefully
remain verbal between federalist and separatist forces in
that province where the events of the 70's still hover.
Of these two groups, the federalist bloc turns with concern to the central government. It expects some actions
that, by their psychological impact, could help improve
the climate. Of course, federal grants to sustain employment are welcome and the provincial government has no
hesitation about signing agreements that bring millions
from Ottawa to Quebec. Helpful as they are, these millions will not be sufficient to better Ottawa's image, nor,
in our opinion, will the adoption of excellent measures
such as legislation to improve the equalization system, to
reduce the tax load of low-income earners or increase
loans to students. What Quebecers value most is some
compromises between the two levels of government on
many specific issues, of which the welfare policy of that
province is one of the most crucial.

SENATE DEBATES

As is generally the case with Canada, Quebec is
experiencing a curious phenomenon, that of achieving
one of the most impressive economie advances in developed countries while registering at the same time a high
rate of unemployment. Its economy which is based, as we
know, on fragile structures, has resulted in unemployment for 170,000 Quebecers during part of last year and
has been a fertile ground for those who claim that Quebec
would be better off if it had control of its own affairs. The
average unemployment rate in the province has been 8.3
per cent compared to 6.4 per cent for Canada as a whole.
Capital investments in the manufacturing sector have
declined by 7.3 per cent in 1971 and amount to only 38.7
per cent of the investments in Ontario.
Separatism, violence, and social strife are political and
social factors which account for this decline. The Premier
of Quebec himself has admitted that the province is still
paying the price of the 1970 October crisis in terms of
diminishing investments and growth. The exodus of companies' head offices to other cities is a fact and the situation has on the whole deteriorated, particularly in the
pulp and paper industry on which a large part of the
Quebec economy depends with the result that the situation has become even more difficult.
The solution of most of Quebec's problems, including
the separatist menace, is to be found in a strong economy.
Since many of its industries are seasonal ones, since its
small towns often are totally dependent on forestry and
mining industries, since many secondary industries are
not big enough, it is more necessary and more urgent than
ever to give priority to regional development, to rationalization of existing plants and to the establishment of
highly technological industries.
In order to keep alive such an important economy as
that of Quebec, it is necessary to finance there quite a lot
of public works. This has been done mainly through the
federal and provincial governments which injected last
year more than $1 billion into that province. Moreover,
everything shows that further injections will be needed if
Quebec is to make it.
Let us not forget that about 40 to 45 per cent of the
amounts earmarked by the federal government for incentive programs are paid to the Province of Quebec. For
instance, Ottawa has financed the best part of a $125
million order for the building of ships for France. And
few weeks go by without the federal government
announcing the distribution of additional millions in
grants and loans to corporations already established in
Quebec or about to settle there. However, those incentives
are artificial in the sense that some day Quebec will have
to be on its own as far as its economy is concerned. Even
though all these projects greatly contribute to the creation
of short term jobs, the overall political climate remains
unchanged and there is little actual planning to restore
confidence in a short term improvement.
Like the governments of not-so-favoured provinces, the
Quebec government fears any control of foreign investment. It cannot afford, say its spokesmen, to discourage
such investment for ideological reasons. In fact, the
screening of incoming capital might interfere with the
government's priorities, namely the creation of jobs and
[Hon. Miss Lapointe.]

February 22, 1972

the promotion of fast-growing manufacturing industries
where foreign investment is an essential factor.
Will the policy contemplated by the federal government
allow Quebec to reach simultaneously its objective of
economic independence and that of growth and development in the field of employment? We shall know in due
time. However, for many people the long-term policies
which will ensure a well-balanced development are the
same which, in the short run, will tend to limit the inflow
of capital and to increase unemployment. It seems that
the people and the government of Quebec are not at the
moment prepared to pay for the price of such an otherwise advisable action.
However, a price which all Canadians, including Quebecers, are prepared to pay is the price which will permit
them to safeguard their natural, historic and architectural
heritage before it slips through their fingers forever. The
concern shown by the government to improve the quality
of life for Canadians, in this age of leisure, is reflected in
the projects and achievements which follow.
* (2130)

[English]
The proposed legislation, to be known as Heritage
Canada, intends to set up a broadly based corporation
with the same degree of independence as the Canada
Council, to preserve individual buildings, groups of buildings and areas of historical and natural value which are
nationally significant. This is a timely initiative which
would fill a gap in the preservation program of the
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development
in complementing the work being done by the National
and Historic Parks Branch. A substantial federal endowment grant would be sufficient to enable the corporation
to make a satisfactory start, and any expansion would
have to be realized with the aid of financial and other
contributions from the public.
Apart from that project, we note with interest the creation of three national parks above the 60th parallel, one in
the Yukon, two in the Northwest Territories, including
one along the famous South Nahanni River, which brings
to ten the number of parks developed or set aside under
the present government, and to 28 the total number of
these natural havens. More important still is the fact that
for the first time outstanding natural areas in every province and territory are represented in Canada's national
parks system.
The importance of preserving lands in remote areas for
the benefit of the future generations who may face pressures yet unforeseen, combined with unforeseen travel
and leisure facilities, must not be underestimated. At a
time when the need for these natural reserves in Canada
was far from evident, the originators of the first national
park in Banff gave proof of their foresight. After 30 years
of near inertia, now in a feverish race against time the
present government has organized the framework of an
outstanding national parks system. But much remains to
be done since Canada will need at least 60 national parks
by the year 2,000.
* (2140)

The third realization consists in the transfer to the conservation program, which includes the National and His-

toric Parks Branch, of eight canais with important historie links-three in Ontario, four in Quebec and one in Nova
Scotia. Under that program the Canais Branch plans to
work closely with the provinces to develop the recreational potential of these waterways and to protect their natural and historical values.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, during the last four years, the
government endeavoured to accelerate smoothly the evolution process in Canada. It wanted to make of it a laboratory of individual freedom as opposed to mass mentality;
it wanted to make of it a more generous and more open
society able to promote joie de vivre and respect for all
aspects of human dignity; it wanted to make of it a better
balanced country, more assured of itself and of its destiny. It worked resolutely so that millions of men and
women of different origin, language, culture, history and
traditions would have the impression of being more justly
treated and would feel more at home everywhere in this
country. Such great social, linguistic and geographical
diversity does not help in any way the governing authorities in their work, but the challenge is worthwhile. The
coexistence of various elements, even if some clashes
occur, can only enrich the Canadian heritage and bring
new drive in this country which was meant for an exceptional role in this world.
Heraclitus said:
Where there is no struggle, there is decay; an unshaken mixture rots.

In spite of economical difficulties in 1971, which followed political hardships in 1970, is not Canada in general
a country where one lives a better life? Such is the result
of a statistical survey recently published in The Economist. And for the manner in which the government did
foster development, control the rate of inflation and fight
the effects of the American dollar crisis, London's Financial Times even awarded it its economie Oscar at the end
of the year.
Everywhere Canada is recognized as an historie
achievement. It always was and still remains an act of
faith and tolerance. However, the answer on which hangs
its invnediate future, as well as its most remote future,
will be provided not by politicians, sociologists, economists, experts or journalists; it will be provided by those
millions of almost anonymous individuals who, having
been free to state and even to cry out their grievances in
any circumstances, will on second thought recognize the
efforts made by the government to push them ahead,
despite unavoidable obstacles, on the road to social and
economic progress. Even those who in La Belle Province
flirt with sovereignty will think it over, we believe, before
dropping the substance for the shadow.
For those reasons, among many others, I support with
pride the motion of Senator Buckwold, for an Address in
Reply to the Speech from the Throne.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE--MOTION FOR ADDRESS
IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed froin yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Buckwold, seconded by Hon. Miss Lapointe, for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, the Speech
from the Throne delivered on the occasion of the opening
of the fourth session of the 28th legislature-a session
the duration of which no one can foreteil, but which
according to a generally held opinion will oertainly be
the last before a general election-is somewhat akin to
the speech which opened the last session and wherein a
new style and a new approach were introduced.
The underlying idea seems to be that this document
should, in some respects, expound a political doctrine of
some sort analyzing the philosophical and economic
aspects of our modemn society. Such a formula would
appear somewhat conceited, though possibly more interesting than the usual listing of the blls the governinent
intends to subinit to Parliament.

The leitmotiv or slogan, this year, is isolation-isolation created by social injustice; isolation created by economie difficulties; isolation created by geographical background. It would seem that ail there is ta do to straighten
out the situation is ta introduce legisîntion and Canadian
society will undergo a substantial if not complete change
for the better.
Jacques Maritain said:
One is always somnebody's Oriental.
Along this poetic vein, may I suggest that in that case,
one is always isolated from someone.
However, one should not confuse isolation and isolationism because, while the government pretends ta fight
isolation, one is nat sure if at the same Urne it wants ta
oppose economic and political. isolationismn.
Another prominent feature of that Speech from the
Throne, perhaps the last ta be prepared by this gaverament-and I think that most Canadians hope so-is ta
give credit ta the governiment for ail the good things
which happened during the past few years. It tries very
hard ta have us believe that ail the government's administrative or legislative undertakings have been sound and
successful. On the'ather hand, it also suggests that the
variaus problems facing the country cannot be ascribed
ta the blunders and omissions of the government, but
merely ta conditions prevailing in ail industrialized
cauntries, some compelling and unavoidable conditions for
which the government should flot be held responsible.
1 amn not saying this lightly; I invite anybody with
a minimum o! objectivity ta rend and reread the Speech
from the Throne and find out that such is the meaning
Of it.
What I intend ta demonstrate today is that, in practicaily ail fields, no matter how many laws were passed
and how much Urne the goverument and Parliament
spent trying ta improve the situation, little-tao littlehas been achieved. This government has shown itself ta
be particularly inept; its failures are much more numerous than its achievements, and in most cases the fault is
but its awn.
It is not a Speech from the Tbrone that can change the
government's performance-and neither can a cabinet
shuffle that is no more than a musical chair game. Incidentally, when the Prime Minister makes changes in
the cabinet he should occasionaily give up his post ta
become an ordinary minister. That would be a real
cabinet shufile.
[Englshl
Honaurable senators, the government leader, it is well
known, greatly appreciates dedication ta, duty and an
unquestioning willingness ta serve the cause with meal.
Who among us wiil ever forget that rousing speech
Senator Buckwold made in the course of the debate on
the Incarne Tax reform bill? How edifying it was ta
learn that he was prepared ta make ail the sacrifices
necessary in the way of time and effort ta deal with
that 700-page bull in the 12 days, counting Christmas
day çtnd New Year's day, the government had allowed

us. How touching it was to learn from the senator with
the rolled-up sleeves that he was willing, magnanimously,
to overlook the cavalier fashion in which the Senate
was being treated by the government. How well do I
remember the admiration in the eyes of the government
leader as he listened with rapt attention to the words
of Senator Buckwold. So, it came as no surprise to me
that Senator Buckwold had been chosen to move the
motion presently before us.
This bill, containing some 700 pages, was passed ini
less than a day by the Standing Senate Commuittee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce, under the experienced
chairmanship of Senator Connolly, with some prompting
and coaching from Senator Martin.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (O±tawa West): To which coachlng
are you referring?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I did not say he was coaching the
chairman, because that would be useless; I meant the
committee. In any event, it did not detract one iota from
the significance of Senator Buckwold's stirring efforts
last December. Again yesterday, Senator Buckwold
acquitted himself of his most important task with dloquence. I congratulate hlmn without reservation. His
erudition is surpassed only by his devotion to Liberalism
-with a large "L". 1 have but one friendly warning for
the senator. The government leider with whom he has
had so many heart-to-heart talks-and this is what he
mndicated last evening-has a reputation for taking
advantage of senators who are zealously disposed to
defending the government. So, if he should find bimself
being lavishly complimented by the government leader,
he may rest assured that he is about ta be assigned some
thankless task which more experienced Liberal colleagues
have refused.
[Translation]
As regards our new colleague, Senator Renaude Lapointe, I was very happy, for her and the Senate, when
the Prime Minister invited her ta sit in this house.
As she pointed out herseif last evening, I became
acquainted with her at the beginning of her career in
journalism in Quebec City at the time 1 was leaving that
career myseif ta go into law.
Like all those who f6llowed her successful career in
Quebec City and later on in Mantreal, as editorlal writer
at La Presse, I recognize what a contribution she can
make here with her clear mind, her great learning and
excellent judgment. The speech she delivered yesterday
testifies to that.
On the other hand, I am sure she will forgive me
for simply adding this: in her editorials--which I always
read diligently-whenever she criticized a Liberal government, it was always in a spirited way, of course, but
without ever concluding that it should have been replaced! In that respéct, she has not changed and she
probably neyer will.
I arn not asking hier ta change for she will soon learn
that in this house, there are many members who are
making a valuable contribution while remaining extreme-

SENATE flEfATES

ly faithful to a political party. That is not anyway the
main problem of the Senate or of the senators.
I will conclude what I have been saying about Senator
Lapointe by telling her that she is replacing Senator
Thérèse Casgrain of whom we were all very fond. As
for me, I am certain that Senator Casgrain is as happy
as we are that her successor is Senator Lapointe.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Very good.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Unfortunately, perhaps this is the
last session that Your Honour will be occupying the
chair since it is our practice that the Speaker should
serve for only one Parliament.
If I wanted to blame you for something I might say
that you take your responsibilities too much to heart.
You have a fantastic talent for defusing explosive
situations and, as far as I am concerned, to prevent my
saying more or less malicious things which come to my
mind in the heat of debate. I am sure that, in this connection, the government leader is quite grateful to you.
I am also grateful since one seldom regrets not having
made certain statements while the reverse is often true.
[Englishl
Honourable senators, I would not want to return to
the subject matter of the Speech from the Throne without assuring the Leader of the Government of my traditional co-operation in the discharge of his duties as they
pertain to the Senate.
I fully agree with those who claim that the Senate
owes much to Senator Martin for the new and improved
image that many people now hold of the Upper House.
His balance sheet should, quite properly, show more
assets than liabilities in this respect. But, however much
this may be true, I feel I must again remind him that
he has a serious conflict of interest to resolve in his
double role as member of the Senate and Leader of the
Government. The doctrine of cabinet solidarity does not
permit of his leading the Liberal members of the Senate
into an objective study of government legislation, and
the Senate, we will all agree, is supposed to be more
objective than the other place.
I keep raising the point because the instances have
been many wherein the leader on the government side
of this chamber has shown himself to be more a member of the government than of the Senate.
The way in which he arranged for Bill C-259, that
exercise in fiscal confusion, to be bulldozed through
this chamber during what should have been the Christmas recess, without any discussion on the principles of
the bill and without the possibility of any serious consideration being given to much needed amendments, is
proof of the fact that his first allegiance is to the government, not to the Senate.
Almost every Canadian daily newspaper I picked up
towards the end of December-they were published
towards the end of December but I saw them only late
in January when I returned from my trip to Europe[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

seemed to carry a letter to the editor from the government leader trying to justify why the government had
treated the Senate with such disrespect. I was not in
any way convinced by his arguments, and I doubt
whether any other reasonably-minded Canadian was.
* (1420)

Changing the subject for a moment, I have been told
that Senator Martin has been appointed Chancellor of
Waterloo Lutheran University.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I congratulate him on his appointment, and on the laudable sense of ecumenism he displayed in accepting the appointment. Would that he were
as non-partisan in matters political as he appears to be
in matters theological.
Honourable senators, in last Thursday's Speech from
the Throne the government, as I said earlier, attempted
to take credit for all that has happened since April 1968
which could be in any way construed as having been
beneficial to the country. With equal vigour it sought to
deny responsibility for the failure of so many of its
plans, projects and measures.
The Speech from the Throne suggested that legislation
to be presented to Parliament during this session would,
on the long-term basis, be most beneficial. The expression "long-term basis" is an obvious feint calculated to
direct attention away from the dismal performance of
this government over the past four years, and away
from its lack of immediate solutions to the problems
affecting us now.
The present Minister of Finance informed us not so
long ago that the government was not interested in what
happened yesterday or in what is happening today, but
only in what might happen tomorrow. Such a desire to
forget on the part of this administration can easily be
understood. However, it is doubtful whether the electors will be quite so willing to forget what has happened
during the past four years, nor will they be willing to
overlook government inaction in the face of immediate
problems, nor, for that matter, will they be content
to hope for a better tomorrow made up of vague
promises.
If, after four years, the government has not succeeded
in providing proper leadership, and has failed miserably in charting a satisfactory course in the affairs of
this country, why should anyone believe that it will be
able to do so if given a new mandate? A new mandate
would serve only to prolong the agony of those who
deserve a better government.
Honourable senators, the business community, with
abundant reason, lacks confidence in the government. As
a result, capital investment is almost at a standstill, and
expansion is not taking place at a rate anywhere near
satisfactory.
The confusing tax reform bill, foisted on the business
world supposedly to alleviate inequality and promote
stability, the proposed amendments to the Canada Labour
Code, the proposed Competition bill, the establishment
of the Canada Development Corporation, and an expected

February 23, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

screening agency for foreign investment have flot been,
and are unlikely to be, conducive to restoring a proper
relationship between business and government.
The government's overail economic direction has been
profoundiy disappointing. The use of restraint and relaxation has been awkward, and the attempt to introduce
voluntary limitations on prices and wages was naïve,'
singuiariy iacking in imagination, and demonstrated a
poor understanding of market economics.
Further, there is growing resentment among ail businessmen and, I would add, ail citizens who have had
direct dealings with this government, due to the increasingly frequent incidences of bureaucratic bungling.
The influence of a hamn-handed ubiquitous government
seeking to regiment, control, and, supposedly, streamline is manifesting itself everywhere, and the resuit is
everywhere deplorable. The sad state of present businessgovernment relations has led to confusion and frustration in the business world.
This administration is top heavy with men who long
ago cast their lot with the noisy anti-capitalîst forces
of the left. The supposed conversion of those sages to
big "L" liberals, only a relatively f ew years ago,
has not been followed by any convincing change in their
outlook. They remain substantially what they were. The
Lîberal party has changed to some extent. Its president,
one of aur colleagues, referred to it in a recent speech
as the "people's party," and the business world has
every reason to fear that change in nomenclature. It is
indicative of a f ar more profound change in philosophicai
orientation.
Far from eliminating confusion and uncertainty, last
year's tax reform has contributed to it, and it will
inhibit business efficiency and entrepreneurship for a
long time to come. A large number of the provisions of
the income tax reform act of 1971 are next to impossible
to understand. Those entrusted with the responsibility
of advising corporations in the matter of taxation are
now having nightmares.
But that was not the only piece of deficient and illadvised legisiation this administration concocted seemningly with a view to victimizing business. This government's anti-business bias was manifest in the Competition
bill it presented in the last session, and wiil blunderingly seek to re-introduce this session, with likely very
little change. Certain measures proposed in that bill
would have rendered illegal long-standing practices based
on sound economics, and I cite as an exampie the proposed tribunal with its virtuaily unrestricted diacretionary powers, and the proposed shift in the burden of
proof from the Crown, where traditionally it has rested,
to the accused. That is presumed guilt instead of presumed innocence.
As a resuit of this chronic mishandling, the state o!
our economy is a disaster. The Science Counicil of Canada
has pointed out the urgent need for a new economic
strategy, one which would ensure a more effective and
profitable use of skilled manpower and natural resources.
But this governiment's past performance indicates that
such a policy is likely to be a long time in coming.

However, our economy needs help now. Measures calculated to impart new growth and ta convince industry
that the government is aware of the need for change
must be implemented inimediately. What we need is a
significant reduction in corporate as well as personal
taxes. This would demonstrate the government's awareness that the private sector holds the key to sound and
lasting economic growth.
Tax cuts alone, however, wiUl nat; suffice. This crusading administration wiil have ta cease in its attempts
to force the private sector ta meet the political and social
objectives of governiment. It is the proper function af
private enterprise to generate economic growth and, by
s0 doing, ta create employment.
0 (1430)

The creeping socialism which characterizes most a!
this government's legislation will stifle growth and eventuaily plunge us into an economic crisis, which crisis wili
provide apparent justification for further government
intervention in aur economy, and we will then be an
our way towards a brand of authoritarian statism most
o! us, I presume, do not want.
Honourable senators, accarding ta the Prime Minister
aur chronie unemployment problem would be greatly
aileviated, if not; entirely eradicated, were people ta
take the trouble ta answer the want ads in the country's
daily newspapers, and were they wiiling ta move ta
those centres where jobs are available. So much for that
problem. Such quasi-solutions are ail too typical of this
administration.
Two years ago, it set about, li an iU1-conoeived attack
upon inflation, slowing down the economy. The outeome
was disastrous-18 months of massive unemployment,
a condition from which we have yet ta recover. The
mast recent unemployment figures, whether adjusted or
unadjusted-I wiil leave it ta the Leader of the Government ta explain ta us the intricacies of the adjustment or
non-adjustments; hie has always been a specialist li this
field-indicate quite clearly that this administration is
stili not producing jobs at a rate anywhere near that
required ta keep abreast of the rapidiy expanding labour
force.
As a matter of fact, there is significant evidence ta
show that the government's economic poiicy is, in some
areas, having quite the opposite eff ect. It is destroying
job opportunities by indirectiy forcing the ciosure of
certain plants. The figures reieased in January reveaied
an unemployment rate of 7.7 per cent in the country as
a whole. In the Atlantic region, the rate rose ta 12.9
per cent. In Newfoundiand and Prince Edward Island
over 18 per cent of the labour force was unempiayed. In
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick over 10 per cent were
out of work, and in Quebec 9.8 per cent.
These statîstics do not include those who have given
up trying ta find work-those who are no longer eligible
for unemplayment insurance, and who have iearned from
experience how tataliy useless the Manpower Department is in heiping people ta find jobs. There is no way of
determining how many have been driven ta this degree
of pessimism and despair, but it is quite ikeiy that they
represent a significant number.

22

SENATE DEBATES

What it all boils down to is that the rate of growth of
employment in Canada is simply insufficient to meet the
demands of a growing labour force, and to reduce unemployment. By no standard is the 1971 employment
growth rate of 2.5 per cent acceptable. It is lower even
than the 1965-70 average rate of employment growth of
2.8 per cent.
The federal government must cease to hinder our
economic recovery with its contradictory budgetary
policies, its confusing and frustrating legislation, and its
wasteful make-work programs. In short, this government must learn to mind its own business, and cease
its authoritarian, unwarranted and unwelcome intrusions
into the market place.
But unemployment is not our only major problem.
This government is losing the battle against inflation
also. The inflation rate is gathering speed. The 4.9
per cent increase over the last twelve months must be
compared with the 1.6 per cent increase for the previous
twelve-month period. This rise in the cost of living,
which is the result of rising prices for food and housing,
will strike with a vengeance at those Canadians with
low and medium incomes who spend a large part of
their revenue on such necessities. It should be possible
to reduce the pressure of inflationary consumer demand
by increasing the availability of goods, and it should be
possible to increase the availability of consumer goods
by productively employing the unemployed. Unless this
government can be made to understand that it is responsible for much of the inflation that plagues us today, we
are fated to repeat the same costly mistakes and suffer
the same dismal consequences.
The excessive spending of this administration over
the past four years has been, to my mind, the principal
cause of the rampant inflation which was temporarily
arrested at the cost of such incredible unemployment.
But the government is quite unwilling to accept its guilt
in this area. It prefers to lay the blame on the doorstep
of labour when it is playing up to business, and on the
doorstep of big business when it is playing up to labour.
If they are worried about votes, private enterprise
suddenly becomes the ogre-a den of thieves, unscrupulous tyrants, who are seeking to exploit all those sweet
electors. If it is campaign funds the Liberal Party is
looking for, then inflation is blamed upon those greedy
unions clamouring for unreasonable wage settlements.
This government would appear to have a vested interest
in permitting the cost of living to rise. Inflation will
help finance those grandiose spending programs which,
particularly when they are directed towards the poor,
have so very little significant effect. Inflation bas done
more to widen the poverty gap than any other single
contributing factor.
If the government persists in refusing to curb its
spending, then there will remain only two ways of
controlling inflation. It will either have to slow down
the economy and create further employment, or have
recourse to compulsory price and wage controls which,
as the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

February 23, 1972

advised us a short time ago, would serve merely to
aggravate the problem.
To make matters worse, in the midst of our most
deplorable economic situation, the federal government
comes down with a bad case of nationalism. It toys with
the idea of splendid economic isolationism. How else can
one explain the government's attitude with regard to
Denison Mines, Home Oil, the tax reform legislation, the
Competition bill, and what we know as the Gray Report?
This attitude points to a government bias against the
movement of investment into and out of Canada, a sort
of monetary apartheid, which seemingly extends only to
the United States. The upshot of it all has been that the
flow of funds into Canada, in certain areas, bas begun to dry up. This we cannot afford. This is tantamount to economic suicide. Canada very simply bas not
the capital resources to finance its own growth in the
future.
* (1440)

Admittedly, the degree to which foreigners have assumed dominant roles in some major Canadian industries
makes us unique in the world. Nowhere else is this
the case. But then the fact to be borne in mind, and
which seems to have escaped those alarmists looking for
cheap emotional issues, is that we are unique in the
degree of geographic and economic intimacy which we
share with a larger, wealthier neighbour. The extent of
foreign investment in Canada is a reflection of a combination of physical, social, political, and economic
relationships for which there exists no parallel anywhere
else in the world. We have plenty of resources, but we
need the capital to develop them and the markets in
which to seli them. To antagonize and alienate our
American neighbours is foolishly to jeopardize a market
of over 200 million people.
When one recognizes that foreign ownership of assets
is relatively meaningless given the fact that their administration is subject to Canadian law, it then becomes obvious that this administration's nationalism is
fundamentally socialism suitably disguised to render it
more acceptable. Granted, we must actively cultivate
domestic capital for domestic development, but this can
be done in a more positive fashion than by severely restricting or opposing the introduction of foreign capital.
Honourable senators, I should like now to say a few
words about federal-provincial relations. The relations
between the Government of Canada and the Government
of Quebec are no, better now than they were at the beginning of Prime Minister Trudeau's term in office. If
anything, they are worse. Yet Mr. Trudeau was supposed to be the man to keep Quebec in its place. He
would strengthen the central government; rule with a
strong hand. He knew what Quebecers wanted and needed. He was not going to waste time on academic revisions
of the Constitution, nor was be going to make concessions to any strident nationalists. He put down an
"apprehended" insurrection in Quebec with a great deal
of force, but, in retrospect, it appears much of it was
unnecessary and it is presently referred to mainly for
the political mileage that can be extracted from it.

Recent statements by Premier Bourassa and his ministers, especially Mr. Castonguay, the Minister of Social
Affaira, are indicative of the fact that Quebec is flot
satisfled with the approach being used by the federal
government in its negotiations on the subject of a new
Constitution. Quebec wants greater administrative freedom. It will not be intimidated by the arrogant and inflexible positions of the federal government, nor will any
of the other provincial governments--and I could name
many of them, but let me say that Ontario and British
Columbia are examples. Quiet diplomacy and a sincere
attempt at understanding are recluired to iron out our
constitutional problems. This has, unfortunately, been
lacking in the past few years.
I corne now to the Senate itself. The last session was a
productive one for titis house. We brought in for the consideration of the government and the people of Canada
oui 'flndings in those areas which we had set out to investigate-the communications media, poverty, the White
Paper on Taxation, the tax reform bill, science policy,
and growth, employment and price stability. While others
merely talked about the problems we faced in these
crucial areas, the members of this house, under the able
leadership of the committee chairmen, strove to flnd out
the extent of the problema and their real causes. This was
followed by some laudable attempts at flnding viable
solutions to those problems.
The recommendations we made, although I would flot
agree with ail of them-but then who does-were for the
most part sound, tempered, and practical. The Science
Policy Committee discovered that despite the government's efforts to expand the manufacturing industries,
total shipments by industry had remained relatively static
sînce the middle of 1968. Employment, the commîttee
found, was off some 120,000 jobs and the prime cause was
oui apparent inability to create new products. The committee's reaction was an encouraging one. Since we must
innovate or perish, then let us have a broadly-based drive
towards the creation of new products and services which
can be produced in Canada; let us have a shift in the
focus of the research effort from government to industry.
It is indeed inspiring to see that scientiflc investigation
stiil reveals the superiority of the private enterprise system in producing goods, which means keeping the
economy afloat.
The crux of the Poverty Commîttee's report was that
Canada's existmng social security system be junked, and
replaced by a guaranteed annual income. Aithough the
idea of a guaranteed annual income does not appeal to,
me philosophicaly, I might be willing to accept it as an

improvement over the present welf aie mess, if only 1
could convince myseif that the government would bring
in the guaranteed annual income instead of the numerous
and wasteful welfare measures we now have, and not in
addition to ail these handouts.
I am sure Senator Croil must have been dlsappointed to
learn from the Thione Speech that the government plans
to go ahead with its family income security plan since the
plan, from what we know of it, is in large measure a
rejection of some of the Poverty Committee's principal

conclusions. I would say that the Minister of National
Health and Welfare had a]ready made that decision when
he introduced his White Paper ahead of the recommendations of the Poverty Committee. I trust that Senator
Croîl remembers the occasion.
Probably the most înteresting, and certainly the most
revealing, of the Senate committee reports was that prepared by the National Finance Committee under the able
chairmanship of Senator Everett. That committee's look
at growth, employment and price stability in Canada
drove it to the conclusion that thia administration does not
act to ward off economic difficulties, but rather waits for
the worst to happen and then reacts with an expedience
that la alarming. It does not matter, the committee
learned, that the jobs created are only temporary; that
they are improductive; that much of what little value
they have is wasted in the absence of effective preparation or effective co-ordination with provincial programs.
The committee's probing revealed that tis administration is so jealous of its policy-setting functions that it
insista upon operating in a vacuum. No outside advice la
sought, the provinces are ignored, and the business
community looked down upon. The committee very
perspicaciously pointed out that we can again have a
prosperous economy, if only we can convince this government to retuin to commonsense guidelines in policymakmng and to stop following slavishly the dictates of
expedience.
e (1450)

To ita eternal credit the committee asserted its faith
in the free market as the most effective way out of the
economic quagmfre into which tis government has led
us. It displayed no sympathy for the atatist tendencies
of the present administration.
Oui special and standing committees have done excellent work, and at only a fraction of the cost of similar
reports by commissions or task forces. However, we
muat neyer torget that oui principal raison d'être is to
review legisiation. It is in the carrying out of that
responsibility that we failed so miserably last December.
The Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee studled
the government's White Paper on Taxation, and made
several reconimendations of major import. We also
studied in depth the technical aspects of the income tax
reform bill, and made numerous suggestions for improvement. As a matter of fact, we even went so f ar as to
draft speciflc amnendments to nine or ten clauses whlch

we conaidered unacoeptably deficient. The commlttee
unanimously agreed that without these particular amendments the bull should neyer be ailowed to pass.
What happened? The bill came to us with a deadine.
The government had unwisely commltted itself to bringing in the legialation before January 1 of this year--and
it is my view that that date was not important except for
tactical or electoral reasons-and we were to be forced
to rush it tbiough the Senate. And rush it we did.
The government leader, with the help of his aver-

whelming majority, made sure that no adequate discussion of the bil was allowed in conuuittee. No discussion
of the philosophy behlnd the bill was possible. We were
not able to discuss why many of the recomniendatiofli

24

SENATE DEBATES

we had made on the White Paper were not accepted or
translated into the tax reform bill, and neither were
we given a reasonable hearing when we attempted to
move the committee's own amendments which it considered absolutely essential. What we received instead
were the bland assurances of the minister-who bas now
been moved to another post-that he would look into
our suggestions for improvement and bring in an amending bill if he deemed it necessary.
We are here primarily to review legislation when it
comes to us, and to see that it is amended where deficient.
We are not here to be told that we will be given another
chance later when the government is in less of a hurry
and can take tirne out to listen to us.
It amuses me to contemplate how the huge Liberal
majority, so properly docile last December, would have
reacted had the same piece of legislation come, under the
same conditions, from a Conservative government. These
walls would have trembled from the roar of indignation
in this chamber. The Liberal majority would have
tongue-lashed the governiment mercilessly. The only
instances in the past thirty years of Liberal domination
in which this chamber has refused legislation from the
other place have occurred during a Conservative
administration.
If we give in to the lightly-veiled threats of the
other place-and here I mean the government-and servilely rubber-stamp any piece of legislation, be it of
major or minor importance then our success in special
investigations notwithstanding, we are guilty of a shameful dereliction of our primary responsibility. This chamber should resolve now that never again will this be
allowed to happen, and take the measures necessary to
ensure that it does not.
As to the appointments to this chamber made by the
present Prime Minister, I have but little to say. I have
no reason to believe other than that the people appointed
will be a credit to the Senate.
However, I must express my disappointment at the
fact that while the Prime Minister two years ago gave
every impression of being well aware of the need for
strengthening the Opposition in order to make the Senate
meaningful, he seems now, with his most recent appointments-all of whom are Liberals-to have given in to
pressure from various sources. In the past couple of
years the number of Progressive Conservative supporters
in this house has decreased by seven whereas the number of government supporters, already a huge majority,
has risen by more than 15.
This government's considered opinion is that there is
nothing wrong with the country that more government
intervention will not fix. Governiment intrusion is piled
upon government intrusion, bureaucracy upon bureaucracy, petty regulation upon petty regulation. The whole
exercise is stifling. We are wallowing in a quagmire of
useless rules and regulations, and the federal government grows ever bigger, more overbearing, omnipresent,
autocratic and impersonal.
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

February 23. 1972

And how does the individual emerge fron all of this?
How can we have governments offering to do all of
man's thinking for him, protect him against all the
vicissitudes of life, and still expect to have men of
quality?
Honourable senators, what this country needs is
smaller governments and bigger people; a return to the
principle that the government that governs least is best.
I wish I could have read that somewhere in the Speech
from the Throne. What I have read is exactly the
opposite.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, I bring my speech to a close by
saying that this debate gives the Leader of the Opposition in particular the opportunity to make a very general review of the policy of the governiment, and therefore to praise it a little-every government achieves
some good-and above all to criticize the errors and omissions of the government.
Even if some should disagree with me, I feel that,
under the circumstances, my criticism was very moderate
indeed. It occurs to me that, had I wanted to be mean
with the government, this government which for all
practical purposes is the same as the one we had in
1963, even though Mr. Trudeau succeeded Mr. Pearson,
had I really wanted to be mean I would have borrowed,
to describe it, the remarks the present Prime Minister
made about the Pearson government. I shall not quote
those remarks unless I am provoked into doing so.
I shall merely say that nothing in the line of electoral
political opportunisma resembles more a Liberal government than another Liberal government.
[English]
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, the Leader
of the Opposition will not expect me to subscribe to the
essentials of his speech today. I should like to have
found one or two places where he might have thought
that the government did something worthy of commendation. I, in turn, would like to have been able to find
with respect to his criticisms of the government something with which I could feel justified in concurring.
But search as I did, I searched in vain and I found
that in the characterization of the government's effort
by the Leader of the Opposition, he continued to repeat
what he said last year that the government was inept,
that it was not well led, that it was socialist, and that
it was leading Canada down byways of inferiority, and
so on. These are remarks which, understandably, are
often expressed by those in opposition. However, they
are generally mixed, on occasion, with some words of
appreciation for at least some t.ings which the government has done.
* (1500)

Hon Mr. Flynn: I complimented the government on
their selection of government leader.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Today, however, there was nothing
of that generous impulse which I usually recognize in
the Leader of the Opposition. So I must deal with him
on his own teris.

However, before I do that, I should like to congratulate
Senator Buckwold on his speech praposing adoption of
the Speech from the Tbrone. Senator Buckwold is a
businessman of great experience, and a distinguished
authority on urban affairs, having been mayor of his
city, and president of the mayars' association of our
country. His speech last night, as weil as the speeches
he has made on other occasions in this chamber, reveal
hlm to be a man of singular capacity, and we expect
from hlm valuable contributions to the Senate. I hasten
to add that the selection of Senator Buckwold as proposer of this motion had rlothing to do with lis good
judgment last December when the Leader of the Opposition was not present, and for a goad reason.
[Translation]
1 should like to tell Senator Lapointe that she lias
made a strong impression and to off er my most sincere
congratulations for the magnificent; speech she made
here last night.
She clearly demonstrated lier great talent and great
knowledge and we are ail certain that Senator Lapointe
wiil be an asset for the Senate. I wish lier great success
ln her new functions.
I only learned last niglit, by listening ta Senator
Lapointe's speech, that the Leader of the Opposition is
a former journallst. That, to me, is quite surprising news.
I now thoraughly understand why lie takes la this
chamber positions which I arn sure a lawyer, a good
Iawyer like the Leader of the Opposition, could neyer
take.
[English]
Senator Flynn made some comments about the Senate.
It is not my intention to reliash the events of last December and January. I arn rather surprised, for many reasons
which. I wiil not emphasize, that Senator Flynn thouglit
it desirable to refer to those events which engaged the
attention of many honourable senators, and I say this
most sincerely, no one more objectively than Senator Connoily (Ottawa West) who, in the absence of Senator
Hayden, performed lis responsibilities as acting chairman in a manuier which should have won from ail lionourable senators today, as it did then, our very warmest
appreciation and commendation.
Hon. Sonators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Martin: I should like to put on the record
wliat the Senate did in the Third Session of Parliament,
which camne to an end last week. My colleague, the
President of the Privy Council, on the last sitting day
prior to the adjournment for Christmas, put on the record
what liad been accomplislied in this house. I believe it
would be of value for us to recall what we did la this
house. At the time when the President of the Privy
Coundil made lis report, we la this chamber were
debating Bill C-176, "to establish the National Farm
Products Marketing Council. This, therefore, is the first
opportunity I have had to recail wliat we did liere durlng
the past session.

Honourable senatars, the third session was opened on
October 8, 1970, and was prorogued last week, 71 weeks
later. The Senate sat ln 46 of those weeks, in approx-

inuately the saine nuaiber as did the other place, whlch
sat 52 weeks. That was the fIrst session since the early
days of the Second World War to straddle tbree calendar
years. A similarly prolonged session occurred in 1940,
1941 and 1942. The session which lias just ended is the
third longest la Canada's parliamentary history.
During the session we introduced a dozen government
blills, eleven of whidli were subsequently passed by this
ciainber and by the other place. We received 48 gaverament bills, chiefiy money bis which liad been introduced
la the other place and whicli we deait witli and passed
here. This makes a total of 59 governaient bills whidli
became law duriag tlie course of that arduous session.
Six public bills introduced by mnembers la tlie House
of Commons were accepted by botli houses. Twa of aur
private members' bis were passed la this dhamber but
not by the otlier liause,. althougli three of out private
members' bills were endorsed by bath Houses of
Parliament.
Some of the public bis whidh were introduced la the
Senate and subsequently became law were the bill
respecting statistics of Canada, the bill ta amend the
Anti-dumping Act, the bll respecting weights and
measures, the bll ta provide for the abtaining of information respecting weather modification activities, and
the bill ta axnend the Copyright Act.
Honaurable senators, same bis which became law la
the third session have received considerable public attention. I reca in particular the Public Order Act, the
l
Goverament Organization Act aad the legisiation on
incarne tax refarai. With regard to, incarne tax reform
leglslation, the Leader of tlie Opposition is undoubtedly
riglit: we did receive mucli crlticism, particularly in the
newspapers. However, we have souglit ta put the record
riglit, and many newspapers have corrected even the
editorial position tliey adapted througli the inaccurate
reports of aur effort. That is something we will deai with
ia another place and at anotlier tirne.

In addition, I might mention the passage of the Cooperative Associations Act, the Tax Review Board Act,
the ameadments ta the Old Age Security Act, the
Regianal Development Incentives Act, the Export Develapment Act, and the Canada Shipping Act, the Textile
and Clathing Board Act, the Statutory Instruments Act,
the Consumer Packaging and Labeiling Act, the Unemplayment Insurance Act, the Pilotage Act, the Canada
Development Corporation Act, and the Employment Support Act.
Three Senate bills were amended la aur comnittees.
Five of our bills were amended la the other place. We
amended the Investmnent Campanies Act, the National
Enviroament Week Act, the Consumer Packaging and
Labelling Act and the Emplayment Support Act, ail of
which were originally introduced in the other place.

26

SENATE DEBATES

In common with the Leader of the Opposition, I would
be remiss if I did not mention the excellent reports
of our committees. I do not agree with him in his
concept of the contemporary role of the Senate. Of
course, our function under the Constitution is legislative.
It is also, however, open to us to use our time in
investigation, scrutiny, and exploration serving the nation, just as was done in another day to a greater extent
by royal commissions.
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce produced a report on the White Paper
entitled "Proposals for Tax Reform" which recommended, successfully as it later turned out, the abandonment of the integration principle originally put forward
in the Carter Commission Report. The committee produced three reports, as we know, on the 1971 tax reform
proposals of the government. The Senate debated these
reports, not for one, but for seven days, and the committee sat examining witnesses on the principle of the
bill for a longer period than did the other place. Unlike
the other place, it heard over 162 witnesses.
The report of the Special Senate Committee on Mass
Media was published in three volumes. These were debated over a period of 16 days in this chamber. Honourable senators are aware that the public debate is
still continuing on television, radio, and in the press.
It may not be without significance that in Ontario the
newspapers have actually set up a press council as was
recommended by the Davey committee.
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance,
under the chairmanship of Senator Everett, in a remarkable burst of energy produced a well received
report on Growth, Employment and Price Stability. That
report has had a strong impact in the country and the
recommendations contained therein and the evidence
adduced before the committee do not support the position taken by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to
the government's program to control inflation. Senator
Everett's report was debated here for five days, and I am
sure that the debate will continue in this session.
The Special Senate Comnittee on Poverty, under the
chairmanship of Senator Croll, produced its well argued
report on Poverty in Canada. This has been well received
by the public, and was debated over nine days in the
Senate. I do not agree with the conclusion of the Leader
of the Opposition, because if he will refer to page 4 of
our proceedings of February 17 he will find a paragraph
in the Speech from the Throne in which the Governor
General is caused by the Governpent to observe:
It is the view of the government that the most
important single factor in the attainment of individual dignity and active social involvement is the
assurance of a secure income. Considerable progress
towards the goal of a total income security program
for all Canadians is achieved in the new Family Income Security Plan bill which will be presented for
your consideration. The emphasis in this plan is on
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

February 23, 1972

protection and is consistent with the Government's
belief in the strong sense of self-reliance of Canadians.
In addition I may say that last week the Minister of
National Health and Welfare announced that three pilot
projects are now under way in western Canada in connection with the basic recommendation contained in the
report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty.
The Special Senate Committee on Science Policy produced the first volume of its report over a year ago. It
was debated for seven days in this chamber. The second
volume, as we know, was released one month ago, while
we were not sitting. The chairman of the committee had
obtained leave to issue a report during the period we
were not in session. That report will be debated, I anticipate, some time next week. It is a cogently presented
report, which has attracted wide attention. I look forward
to an important debate on this subject during the course
of this session. There is no doubt that the report of the
Special Committee on Science Policy, whether or not
one accepts its theses, has made a tremendous impact
not only in this country but, according to my examination
of the newspaper clippings, over almost all the Western
world.
We are not all competent technically-and certainly
I include myself-to make the type of assessment that
should be made. However, I am sure we will all endeavour to fully understand the implications of this
report and its meaning for some of our government
scientific institutions. We must consider the type of
development which will be required during the next
decade related to such proposals as are envisaged in
it with regard to industrial organization.
The Special Joint Committee on the Constitution has
worked conscientiously during the past session. I believe it will table its report very soon. I may say that
the members of that committee, according to my examination of the attendance and continuity of participation,
have made indeed an important contribution. I do not
know what the report will contain. There was an indication recently in the press, however, of some of its contents. In any event, I am sure that when we receive
the report there will be an opportunity to consider it in
the light of what we think should be done with respect
to Parliament itself, not only the Senate but the House
of Commons. There will also be opportunity to consider
other matters relating to the Constitution.
So, we can look back to nearly one year and a half
of productive work during the past session. I thank
honourable senators for their co-operation. I feel confident that these qualities which characterize senators
will be equally manifest during the coming session. It is
not our fault if our work is not properly noted. As a
matter of fact, it is not only the work of the Senate in
the debates in this chamber that goes unnoticed. I find
a great change in the treatment by the news media of
the work of Parliament itself. This is a serious problem
which should be examined by Parliament in co-operation with those agencies concerned with reporting to

the people on what is done ini the constitutionally established places of legisiative business.
( 1520)

The Leader of the Opposition said that nothing good
could be said about the government; that in the fields of
social welfare we were going either too far or, in some
particulars, flot far enough, that we were flot doing
enough in the matter of constitutional reform; that the
goverrnent had not taken sufficiently into account
problems that existed in one section of the country as
opposed to those in another; that we were not appreciated by labour; and that we had run counter to, the
Canadian business comxnunity.
The criticism levelled against the Canadian government is similar to, that levelled against governiments
throughout the Western world. The problems with which
we are faced at home find their counterpart in many
particulars ini other countries, including unemployment
and the like.
Concerning inflation, witnesses who appeared before
Senator Everett's committee stated that the problem had
been handled better by the present Canadian government than by any other government comprising the 18country membership of QECU. 1 believe that is generally
conceded, notwithstanding what the Leader of the Opposition said in a fit of political partlsanship, and in ternis
which were not really natural to him.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You would not do that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: 1 arn sure that most Canadians recognize that the difficult problem of controlling inflation has
been dealt with by the Canadian government as well as,
if flot better than, it has been deait with by any other
country in the Western world.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: For a while.
Hon. Mr. Martin: My honourable friend says, "For a
while." There are now signs that we are again moving
a littie toward inflation. I assure Senator Flynn that the
government is aware of this.
The Leader of the Opposition said that we had high
unemployment. He is quite right, but he failed to point
out that between 1965 and 1970 one million new jobs
were created in Canada, a figure which exceeds the total
number of new jobs created in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden and the United
Kingdom together, although those seven countries have a
population twelve times our own. In 1971, 200,000 jobs
were created in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: How many of those have disappeared?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No one will deny that the problem
of unemployment in Canada is a tragic one. ,No one 15
happy with unemployment. However, I would suggest
that the situation might be far more serious were it flot
for the government's programs designed to mitigate the
problem. For instance, the local initiative program alone
has created 82,500 new jobs this winter. The Department of Regional Economic Development earmarked $907
million over the past three years towards creating new

jobs in those regions which need themn most. This represents a major attempt to alleviate the severity of the
problem.
The Leader of the Opposition said also that the governiment had lost its courtship with the business community. An article appearing in the Bank of Montreal's
Business Review, dated January 26, 1972-this, I know,
will please Senator Cook.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Perhaps he wrote it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The article states:
The Canadian economy, in spite of many prophecies
of gloomi and doom, displayed a considerable resiliency as the year wore on.
It would appear that overail dernand, as measured by
gross national expenditure, will show a growth in excess
of 6 per cent ini real terms for the year as a whole, almost double the growth shown for 1970. The Business
Review goes on to, say:
However, despite the relatively poor demand conditions ini major markets, and the loss of price
competitiveness resulting from. the depreciation of
the Canadian dollar, it is expected that, for the
year as a whole, exports will show a growth somewhat ini excess of 5 per cent (compared with the
extremely strong 13.5 per cent increase in 1971).
What are saine of these other facts?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Are you satlsfied with

that?

Hon. Mr. Martin: I think that is a very good statement,
and one that does not help my honourabie friend's
argument.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Are you satisfied with that today?
Hon. Mr. Martin: One is neyer satisfied with imperfection; but there is a great difference between imperfection
and the charge of absolute failure which the Leader of
the Opposition has sought to level against the government.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I learned it from you.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You did not learn it as well as I
performed it. The national output increase of 6 per cent
in 1971 compared favourably with 3 per cent in 1970,
and 5 per cent ini 1969. This represented the fastest
rate of growth in any of the industrial counitries of the
world, including Japan. Stronger growth in production
and sales has been expected in the labour market, and
the employment trend has strengthened notably.
The increase in Canadian prices in 1971 was again the
lowest among major industrial countries, with. the broadest measure of price movements, the GNP price defiator,
showing an increase of 3.2 per cent. Employment for the
year rose more than 2.5 per cent, twice the rate of
increase in 1970.
There are further indications of strengthening economic conditions despite the regrettable level of unemployment. Spending on consumer durables made the

SENATE DEBATES

most impressive gain in recent years. The increase was at
least 15 per cent in value terms, a substantial rise in
automobile sales being a principal factor. The year 1971
was buoyant for housing. An estimated 235,000 new
homes were commenced, well above the previous record
of 210,000 in 1969.
It is true that stronger demand conditions in Canada
brought a sharper surge in imports, which were 12 per
cent higher than in 1970. The merchandise trade surplus
was in excess of $2 billion, down from the record high of
$3 billion in 1970. The balance on all transactions will
show a surplus for the calendar year 1971, though small
compared with the 1.1 billion figure realized in 1970.
* (1530)

The Bank of Canada's monthly Review of January
points out that the real output per person employed
climbed 4 per cent compared to a gain of less than 1.5 per
cent the previous year, and an average advance of 2 per
cent in the 1964-69 period. In 1972, notwithstanding our
problems with our closest neighbour, exports seem likely
to rise by 7 or 8 per cent-this, of course, assumes a
strong United States recovery-while imports will advance by 11 or 12 per cent in response to strong domestic
demand.
I feel that my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Flynn), in
trying to assess the reaction of the business community
of Canada, should have taken into account this type of
supporting evidence on which the businessman himself
relies so greatly. The Economist of London, in its long
survey on Canada of February 12, a few weeks ago,
stated:
There is nothing here to suggest that a floating
Canadian dollar will be a weakening one-quite the
reverse, unless inflation rips out of hand expanding
energy and resource exports and a steadily improving performance by Cankadian industries suggest that
Canada's external balance could in future be as often
in surplus as in deficit. This is a change around of
primary importance for the strength of the Canadian
economy.
I can only say that these references to bodies and
institutions that have analyzed our situation do not
support the pessimism-the most desperate form of
pessimism-which I have heard from the Leader of the
Opposition in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You should have listened to yourself
some years ago.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Well, in those days there was some
justification. As the honourable Senator O'Leary would
remark, the Canadian people corrected that situation so
that we could rectify matters.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: They will certainly do so again.
Hon. Mr. Martin: My friend said that this government
was inept and had not one good thing to its credit. I
thought he would have at least given this government
credit for some small event or some small achievement,
but I heard no word of commendation from him. My
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

honourable friend feels the Leader of this Government
and the members of this government are of no value.
He did have something good to say about the Leader
of the Government in the SenateHon. Mr. Flynn: I never said that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -but in a very restricted context,
setting the Leader of the Government in the Senate
quite apart from the government itself.
What are the facts? We now have 600,000 more places
to live than we had three years ago, and in those same
three years, more low-cost public housing was built
than in the previous 20 years. Surely that is something.
We now have laws that state that working people
must be treated fairly. They must receive a minimum
wage of $L.75 per hour in industries governed by federal
regulations. Women now get maternity leave, and someone who cannot obtain a job can receive as much as $100
a week for up to 50 weeks. We now have laws to make
sure that we get a fair deal when we buy something, and
laws to protect us from dangerous products and dishonest advertising.
We have had strong laws applied and passed when
they were needed to maintain the basic security of our
country. We now have laws that make it a crime to
spread hate literature. We are getting reforms to make
sure that there is not one law for the rich and another
for the poor.
We now have laws that make things easier for poor
people, the businessman, old people and young people.
Plans have been started to cut taxes for poor people
and corporations. Pursuant to Bill C-259, about which
the Leader of the Opposition spoke generally, both at
the outset and at the end of his speech, 700,000 people
were taken off the tax roll.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is not true.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And over 4J million people were
given substantial tax reductions.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is a 1969 estimate.
Hon. Mr. Martin: My honourable friend says that that
is not true. I will allow him to reply to this.
Plans have been started to increase family allowances
where they are most needed and to help businessmen
set up businesses that will employ more people. Laws
have been passed to provide more money for pensioners
and veterans. People receiving old age pension assistance
today in one form or another, whether in every case it
is satisfactory or not, are recipients of the most generous
scheme of its kind to be found in any country of the
world. There have been some complaints about the
social benefits, but those who believe in them recognize
the extent of the government's accomplishments in this
area.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Senator Croll says it is

a mess.

Hon. Mr. Martin: My honourable friend says that
Senator Croll says it is a mess. The Leader of the Opposi-

tion quite properly attacks titis point in an attempt ta
needie Senator Croil and myseif when the real fact is
that the mess is ini the mind of the Leader of the
Opposition.
Our young people have been given the opportunity ta
prove that they cmxi use their own imagination and energy
through Opportunities for Youth. Let ne one ridicule that
program, as several honourable senators last year did.
That program is self-propellung and has given a great
demi of work to many of our young people at a tine
when work for them as for other people is Bo essential.
We now have programs that help give the people of
the poor parts of aur country the same advantages and
opportunities enjoyed by people in the affluent parts. We
now have laws that say that people cmxi demi with the
government in either French or Engllsh, the officiai
languages of titis country.
[Translation]
I noted last night what Senator Lapointe said on this
subject anid I believe the gavernment's bilingualism
program represents one of the most important instruments ta guarantee the unity of aur country.
I believe that when the Leader of the Opposition in
the Senate speaks about the Prime Minister, he sbould
be fair and recognize the great contribution he bas made
in this field.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I did mention it at the time. It need
not be discussed for years.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am taking due note o! what you
said today.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I did so at the time the legislation
was passed. I even recommended it before he came into
power.
[En glish]
Hon. Mr. Martin: We now have programs wbich provide real support and encouragement for ali culture
groups in our country. We now have laws ta ensure that
all of us and our children will have dlean air to breathe,
clean water ta drink, and more of Canada's natural
beauty kept safe in national parks for everyone to enjoy.
We now have laws that have established Canada's rights
in the Arctic and extended Canada's rights, inciuding
flshing rigbts, in the oceans aroumd us.
So, honourable senators, I believe that the government is nat deserving of the indictmnent the Leader of
the Opposition made in bis speech today, in what he
believes te be a pre-election session. By the way, I do
not knaw where be gets bis information. Hie provoked
me to give an accaunt o! the government's stewardshlp,
wblch I would have given ini any event, in the event
that the Leader cf the Opposition was a better prophet
than I now tbink he is.
e (1540)
The Leader of the Opposition did nat say anything
about Canada-United States economic trade relations.

Perbaps be wiil reserve this for some otber occasion. This
is an important matter, but as be bas not dealt with it
I suppose there is no need at titis particular moment for
me ta do sa.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am just hoping that everything is
impraving.
Hon. Mr. Marin: I think the situation is normal. Tihis
does not; mean ta say we do not bave problems with the
United States. These we have. A country wbose people
have $11 billion invested in the United States, as Canada
has, in a country wbose people in turn have $35 billion
invested in Canada, in itself, particularly a great country
like tbe United States with its large population, does
create problems far Canada, just as undoubtedly to a
lesser extent; some o! aur palicies create situations of
cancern ta the gavernment and people o! the 'United
States. But there need nat be any doubt about titis. Our
relations are normal. Our relations are good. Tbey bave
a very serious international indebtedness problem,
wbicb we bave recagnized and wbich other countries
have recognized.
Our discussions with regard te the production and
sale of automobiles is in respect o! an agreement the
negatiations for which began over a year mgo, and are
campletely unrelated ta the events that began with the
imposition a! tbe 10 per cent surcharge by President
Nixon ini the middle of August last. Hawever, there will
be an oppartunity te say something about that later.
I want te say that, although I was not a member of
the delegation, I bave beard that the members of the
Senate wba attended the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group meeting last week did us honour.
We will look forward ta a repart next week fram that
delegatian, to, the extent that it can report on tbe
valuable and, I am sure, impartant discussions wbich
Senator O'Leary, His Honour the Speaker, Senators
Connolly, Hayden and MacnaughtanHon. Mr. Flynn: And Senator Beaubien.
Han. Mr. Marin: -and Senator Beaubien took part ini.
Senator Beaubien is tbe last man I should forget whenever I come ta a group in wbich he is included, for
reasans that are well known ta him and that have ta do
with a date appraximate te December 25 last. He will
always be almost the first foar me te mention.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What about yeur black list.
Hon. Mr. Marin: WeUl, you are on that.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I know tbat, but I amn speaklng cf
people on your side.
Hon. Mr. Marin: Oh, we bave ne black list here.
Last night Senator Lapointe spoke cf the situation in
the Province of Quebec. She spoke et the separatist
mavement. I suggest ta the Leader af the Opposition that,
politics aside,--and I think I amn ini a position te say titis
-at tbe present time ini or country ne man i s better

SENATE DEBATES

endowed to deal with that situation than the citizen of
Quebec who happens to be the Prime Minister of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Martin: I can assure the Senate that that is
my sincere conviction, based upon my association with
him in government during the past four years.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would say that is a very courageous
assertion.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Well, it is my view, which I give
quite sincerely, and I think I cannot be accused of prejudice in giving it.
Last night Senator Lapointe mentioned that the Speech
from the Throne reminded us of our responsibilty
towards other countries in the world. Canada's international responsibilities are growing. Our relations with
Eastern Europe are extended; our relations in Africa, as
she mentioned last night, have expanded; our relations in
Asia are increasing. In re-reading her speech I could not
help but note with great interest the importance she
attached to the visit of the President of the United States
at this time in Peking. That is a welcome and important
visit. I am sure that most people in the world welcome a
closer relationship between the most powerful country in
the world and the most populous country in the world,
just as they welcome closer relations with and better understanding between this most powerful nation and the
Soviet Union, Japan and other countries.
It remains the policy of the Government of Canada to
do all it can, not only to further our domestic interests
but, as a member of NATO, as a member of the United
Nations, as a member of the Commonwealth, to promote
international collaboration. Through active effort in these
bodies we believe we can make our best contribution to
peace in the world.

Leave having been given to revert to Notices of
Motions:
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable senators, yesterday, February 22, the Report of the Parliamentary
Librarian was laid on the Table by His Honour the
Speaker. Unfortunately, I was called out of the chamber
at that time, and when I read the Minutes of the Proceedings of February 22 I was surprised that no motion
had been made for this report to be published in our
records. For all the years that I have been a member of
the Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament-which
goes back a long time-and for many years before that,
as long, I am told, as Confederation has been in existence,
the Report of the Parliamentary Librarian, which he is
required to make to Parliament by law, has become part
of the records of Parliament and has been printed.
This report contains valuable information, and I understand that copies have always in the past been sent to
libraries throughout Canada. It is always used when
librarians from other countries come to Canada and visit
our library, or write for information about what we are
doing in our library. For this reason it is a very useful
document.
Because I am a member of the Joint Committee on the
Library of Parliament and am deeply interested in the
work of the library, with leave I move, seconded by
Senator Inman:
That the Report of the Parliamentary Librarian
tabled by the Honourable the Speaker on Tuesday,
February 22, 1972, be printed as an appendix to the
Minutes of the Proceedings of the Senate of this day
and form part of the permanent records of this
house.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED
MOTION
The Senate resumed fromn yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Buckwold, seconded by Hon. Miss Lapointe, for an address in
reply thereto.
Hon. Hervé J. Michaud: Honourable senators, it is within
the constitutional role of the Senate to maintain constant
alertness to the well-being of minority groups of the country. In this respect I feel that I must put before this
chamber at this time the condition of one economicaily
disadvantaged group which is due to the inability of that
group to share equally with other Canadian citizens in the
wealth and the riches of the country.
In a comprehensive report by the Canadian Council on
Rural Development, entitled Rural Canada 1970: Prospects and Problems, many of the problems of rural
Canada are dealt with in a very thorough way. In my
preliminary remarks I should like to echo some of the
views expressed in that report. In February 1969, the
Canadian Council on Rural Development held a seminar
at Geneva Park near Orillia, Ontario, to discuss the basic
issues in rural development. Grass-roots people from
every part of Canada, many of them farmers and ail of
them involved in some way with the business of agriculture or with the fishing industry, attended that seminar.
Discussion on every aspect of rural life lasted three days,

SENATE DEBATES

following which a report was published. In the introduction to that report we can read the following:
In very simple terms, the participants felt themselves
threatened. A combination of economic circumstances and apparent government disinterest had
combined to place in jeopardy, not only their economic destiny but the institutions of which they were a
part and, indeed, their very way of life. In speech after
speech, the note of crisis came through loud, clear and
unmistakable.
* (1410)

The word "crisis", it is noted, is not too strong to
describe the situation now facing rural Canadians. Important segments of the society, including many farmers
from all parts of Canada, see themselves somewhat abandoned by a society almost totally committed to the industrialization of the Canadian economy. Farms are deserted
at such a rapid rate in certain areas that trade and professional services have become no longer viable, educational
services have to be curtailed, and whole communities
often dating back many generations are faced with the
danger of total disappearance.
The agricultural problem, of course, is not a problem
existing in Canada only; it is common to nearly every part
of the world. It is one of the prime concerns of the European Common Market. Some of the developing countries
of the Commonwealth are also in the grip of this problem,
having difficulty in marketing their domestic farm
production.
The fact remains, however, that Canada is faced with a
serious situation in agriculture, and its depressing effects
are gradually penetrating the general structure of the
whole national economy. The rural poor, forced by economic circumstances to emigrate to the cities, because of
the difficulties they find in adapting to the urban environment and in acquiring industrial skills, may rapidly come
to represent a new substratum of the urban poor. Twentysix per cent of Canadians live in rural areas. Obviously,
all of them are not poor, but many-far too many for such
an affluent nation as Canada-exist in relative material
deprivation. I should state here that while the national per
capita income in 1970 was $3,700.00, the farmer's per
capita income was $770.00.
Of course, a reasonable movement of population from
the country to the city is not necessarily a disaster. Mobility is, in fact, an essential aspect of modern society. The
question is not so much whether there should be a flow of
population from rural to urban areas, but how great and
how rapid a flow is desirable in social and human terms.
Above all, there is one obvious conclusion, and that is that
poverty in rural Canada does, in fact, exist. Dr. D. L.
McQueen, director of the Economic Council of Canada, in
giving evidence before the Special Committee on Poverty
said:
The greatest incidence of poverty and the highest per
cent of poverty is definitely found in rural areas.
The conclusion is also unavoidable that the most striking
disparities in Canadian incomes are not so much between
provinces as between the agricultural sector and the
nonagricultural sector, in every part of the country.
[Hon. Mr. Michaud.]

February 24, 1972

As noted in Rural Canada 1970: Prospects and Problems, the United States Advisory Commission on Rural
Poverty sadly reported to President Johnson:
The people employed in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and mining supply the products and materials for
our food, shelter, clothing and manufacturing industries. It seems ironic that those closest to the mainsprings of our economic development are those most
adversely affected by it. They have borne the brunt of
the forces of technological development. Often their
increased productivity has been rewarded by lower
incomes.
The approach to industrialization, on the other hand,
should also be made with caution. As again noted in Rural
Canada 1970, it is certainly true that a correlation exists
between national wealth and industralization. However, to
identify industrialization with development is a vast oversimplification. In many parts of Canada the real opportunity for growth exists in the primary sector of agriculture, logging or the fishing industry. To many of those
charged with responsibility for development programs at
municipal, regional and even provincial levels, the entire
exercise resolves itself into a naive effort to "get some
industry in". What industry? Too often the answer is:
"Just industry, any industry."
* (1420)

This simplistic approach to development certainly creates a general picture of hustle and bustle, which may be
superficially impressive but can only constitute a recipe
for economic chaos. It cannot be stated too emphatically
that economic development is an infinitely more complex
and sophisticated process than "just getting industry in."
Canada's economy is one which relies on vitality and
growth in manufacturing and the primary sector. In some
parts of the country the growth potential is in manufacturing, while in other parts the primary sector has by far
the greater potential.
If those responsible for the formulation of development
plans, because they must inevitably focus much of their
attention on the promotion of industrial growth, come to
dismiss social or ecological considerations as of secondary importance, the net result of their efforts in the long
run may be a deterioration of the quality of living.
In his intervention on this particular subject on December 7, Senator McGrand stressed the importance of a
more rational development of our national resources as a
means to alleviate rural poverty in Canada. Citing numerous examples from various countries of the world, Senator McGrand indicated the many benefits that would be
derived from the rational reforestation policy he had
advocated. His contribution in that regard is highly
commendable.
It is within that concept of the fuller development of our
natural resources that I would like at this time to deal
with the farming problem as it particularly applies to
Kent County, New Brunswick. Kent County is basically a
rural county. Its three basic natural resources are agriculture, fishing and lumbering, agriculture being recognized
as the most important throughout the years. Recently,
however, agriculture has been fast declining and unless
drastic measures are undertaken immediately to revitalize

February 24, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

that sector of the local economy, agriculture will soon
reach the point of total extinction.
Statistics in this respect describe a grim picture indeed.
According to census figures, in 1951 some 15,000 people,
out of a total population of 27,000 in Kent County, were
living on farms. In 1966, 15 years later, the number of
those living on farms had dropped to close to 4,000 representing a decrease of at least 10,000 people during that
period of time.
This serious situation is reflected also in the acreage of
land under cultivation. The 1951 census reported a total of
267,000 acres under cultivation. In 1966 the acreage had
dropped to 138,000 acres, representing a decrease of
almost 50 per cent since 1951. I suspect that the 1971
census figures, yet to be released, will reveal a larger
decrease in both farm population and acreage.
While visiting the farming areas of the county recently
in company with another farmer I made an actual count
and learned that under 100 farmers are making their
living from farming in Kent County. To make matters
worse, only a few of those who remain are under the age
of 50. It has become obvious therefore that the younger
generation has rejected agriculture as a profitable way of
making a living. What will be the end result if the present
trend is allowed to continue?
According to projected figures issued by NewStart, a
federal research agency now piloting its own project in
Kent County, by 1980 the population of the county will
have decreased to 15,000, representing a drop of almost 50
per cent in the total population over 25 years. It is estimated that in recent years about 1,000 people have been
leaving the county annually, these being mostly young
people in their productive years and who, for the greater
part, leave the county permanently to seek employment in
the New England states.
In the light of those circumstances, one might wonder
what is likely to happen to the political and social structure of the county, and its regional identity, in the years
that lie ahead. The same concern applies also to those
human values which will be wasted as a result of the
widespread disruption which will follow, and to the
declining equity in farm land and farm property in the
area.
According to information which I have obtained from
pertinent sources, including the Farm Credit Corporation,
land in eastern Canada purchased for agricultural use
usually sells for between $100 and $200 per acre. That
same type of land in my home district is no longer sought.
There is no demand for agricultural land in my section of
the country, and anyone who wishes to liquidate a piece of
farm land generally has only one recourse, which is to
offer that land for reforestation purposes to one of the
lumber companies which in that case usually pay in the
vicinity of $10 or $15 per acre. That is the only outcome
for anyone having farm land to sell in that area.
0 (1430)

Let us now take a look at another group of figures
supplied by NewStart with respect to the general economic picture of the region. These figures are related to what
are called economic indicators and are taken from 22
communities in Kent County, which cover the county in

25312-3

its entirety. The highest per capita income from those 22
communities stands at $1,957 and the lowest stands at
$908. The poverty line set by the Special Senate Committee on Poverty in Canada stands at $2,140 per capita.
Included in the per capita incomes that I have mentioned
is the surn total of transfer payrnents accruing in the
region, such as unemployment insurance, family allowances, pensions, social assistance, and the like. These
transfer payments equal 39 per cent of the total income of
the county. If it is assumed that 11 per cent of the actual
earnings of the county's population is now coming from
outside the county-and this seems to be a fair estimateit can be further assumed that the county is self-supporting to the level of 50 per cent only of the essential living
requirements of its present population.
Honourable senators, it is not with a light heart, believe
me, that I have proceeded to expose before this house
conditions of such widespread deprivation affecting an
area so close to me. The most startling paradox in Kent
County, New Brunswick, is that so much want-20 per
cent of the total population received social assistance
during the last fiscal year-could exist in the midst of an
abundance of agricultural resources which is being abandoned at an increasing rate every year. Surely there is
something basically wrong with a system which allows
such deplorable conditions to exist.
May I reveal at this stage that I have given some thought
in the past to moving a resolution for the appointment of a
subcommittee of the Senate to inquire into the whole
matter of land use in Kent County. The county has a great
deal of good land. There is a local population of over
20,000 people to be supplied with food which is presently
being imported, for the most part. The area is situated at
the doorstep to Moncton, a city of some 60,000 people
which, as the designated growth centre, holds promise of
an increasing market in the years ahead. However, had I
moved that resolution I suspect some honourable senators
might have argued that it would have been improper to
appoint a committee to look into a local situation which is
not of a general or national character. But who knows
what a pilot project of such character might reveal? Who
knows that the farmland conditions that exist in Kent
County do not also exist, in whole or in part, in other
areas of Canada, and that a remedy, if one was found, for
the conditions that exist in Kent County would not also
become applicable to conditions existing in those other
parts of Canada?
In the Speech from the Throne the government
announced its intention to establish a small farm development program. This is welcome; it will be a key weapon.
By this legislation the government will be seeking to solve
a problem that has long been at the root of agriculture's
main difficulties. Therefore, it is appropriate that the
problem should be fully assessed, in order to ensure that
it is dealt with effectively. A Senate committee, such as
the one I have in mind, could, I submit, facilitate attaining
both an assessment of, and an equitable solution to, that
problem. At some future date I may seek to ascertain the
views of this house by moving that a committee be
appointed to make a pilot study of the problem of small
farms, with particular reference to Kent County.

SENATE DEBATES

In conclusion, may I say that out of my concern for the
future of an area to which I feel so deeply obligated, it is
my earnest desire at this time to become of some assistance, in any little way, in those common efforts which
have been and are yet being made, with a view to finding
an equitable solution to what undoubtedly is a very difficult situation indeed.
The motto of the Acadian festival held at Caraquet,
New Brunswick, last summer was the following: "Où il
n'y a d'espoir, le peuple meurt"-"Where there is no hope,
the people die." Nothing is more profoundly needed in the
hearts of those for whom I have just spoken than hope.
* (1440)

[Translation]
Hon. Raymond Eudes: Honourable senators, at the start
of my remarks, I join the Leaders of the Government and
of the Opposition who spoke before me in congratulating
Senator Buckwold who moved the Address in Reply to
the Speech from the Throne as well as Senator Renaude
Lapointe who seconded the motion.
Both of these senators, drawing on past experience
acquired in the course of their careers, and each in a
characteristic style, marked the debate in a most meaningful fashion.
These two honourable senators will, we are sure, make
valuable and efficient contributions to our debates.
As usual, the criticisms of the Opposition in this house,
and more particularly in the other place, followed by
commentators of the media, both printed and electronic,
voiced their customary censure of the Speech from the
Throne.
It was taxed with being vague and a tissue of pre-election, inexplicit proposals, none of them clearly defined.
Who could expect a government, within a Speech from
the Throne which normally comprises a few thousands
words, to analyze in depth all problems facing the nation
and suggest there and then, in an explicit synthesis, the
measures to be brought before Parliament in order to
solve each and every one of these problems.
In fact, even though it would have been more proper for
the Opposition to show more objectivity, it was perhaps
for the best. The Opposition has its function to perform,
and this function of censure, finally, sometimes becomes
an incentive for the government to improve its policies.
Without ascribing this beneficial effect to the criticisms
formulated by the Opposition, I submit that this Speech
from the Throne stands as a continuation of government
policy. The goal it set itself during the election campaign
before the general election of 1968 and the opening of this
28th Parliament is getting closer, that is to establish a just
society through every available means.
Having pointed out that events during the last session
had demonstrated to what extent values are changing and
attitudes shifting, having recalled that we had gone
through a period of international economic uncertainty
which affected all of the industrialized countries of the
world, the Speech from the Throne underlined the extent
of our dependence on a strong economic base to achieve
our social goals.
[Hon. Mr. Michaud.]

February 24, 1972

This speech then revealed the main objective of the
government, and I quote:
One of the major challenges facing government is to
remove the impression of isolation which so often
surrounds men and women, depriving them of their
sense of worth, of accomplishment, of fulfilment, and
removing from them their identity as individuals.
Expressed perhaps in different terms, this main objective shows that the government is seeking its goal, that its
policy is guided by the same ideal: to establish a just
society.
This just society, as stated in the Speech from the
Throne, must therefore remove completely the social, economic, racial, religious, cultural and intellectual disparities isolating the individual from the society in which he
lives.
The government must undertake to remove all barriers
leading to isolation, in order that each citizen may freely
exercise his rights and that his human dignity be upheld
and acknowledged.
The entire Speech from the Throne is based on the
respect of the individual and his human personality.
The government intends to submit to our attention
about thirty measures to free the individual from such
isolation.
I will only briefly discuss the following measures which
are dealt with in this excerpt from the Speech from the
Throne:
The Government will lay before you proposals ... to
deal more compassionately with those in our midst
who require help, to involve more Canadians in the
ferment and satisfaction of community activities.
It is the view of the Government that the most
important single factor in the attainment of individual
dignity and active social involvement is the assurance
of a secure income.
Security of income, means of livelihood or subsistence
without apprehensions about the future are, without
doubt, the basis of a just society, the most efficient tool to
fight social isolation.
Indeed, how can we imagine that a man capable and
anxious to work but who has become unemployed and is
unable to provide his family with food, clothing and lodging or another who does not enjoy the same standard of
living as his neighbour can consider themselves as useful
members in good standing of a just society.
The government is aware of such conditions when it
states in the Speech from the Throne thatUnemployment continues to be a matter of intense
concern and will remain a primary focus of attention
and actionadding that it willredouble its efforts to make sure that as many jobs as
possible are available and that the fullest possible use
is made of the skills and initiatives of those who are
seeking work.
The government is committing itself, although it warns
that we must not confuse unemployment and poverty,
when in the same speech it states more or less in the
following terms:

Februarv 24, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

As a further protection against the isolation of
individuals caused by economic deprivation, the fundamental reform of social security legislation is essential. Employment procedures and programs must be
reviewed and improved, in order to make training and
placement services adequate to the needs of disadvantaged citizens.
The personal dignity of the individual as well as his
participation or involvement in the just society remain
illusions without income security.
To achieve this end, that is to protect against isolation
the victims of poverty under its multiple and often hidden
forms, and to replace them in the context of a society
which attempts to be just, the government has a tool
whose value is unchallenged, that is, the report submitted
by the Senate Special Committee on Poverty.
The members of this committee spent three years studying this problem. Eight hundred and ten witnesses were
heard, 209 briefs were compiled and studied, most of them
bolstered by statistics, from organisations and individuals, from all classes of society, and from all parts of this
country.
The report of this committee, tabled in this house on
November 16, 1971, has since been praised by the press,
radio and television, by responsible citizens' committees
concerned about human dignity, by the poor and the
public in general. It has created such an interest that the
first printing of this report has been exhausted for more
than three months.
This government has been so inspired by this report,
that it seemed to have ignored a priori, judging from
legislation that it intends to put before Parliament in the
course of this new session, and which deals mainly with
income security, improvement of employment programs
and services, review of the social security system, legal
aid for the poor, etc.
Without claiming to be a miracle solution to the problem
of poverty, this report is much more than a laudable
effort. It remains the only global study undertaken in this
country on this problem as a whole, and represents, as I
said, a document whose value is unchallenged.
Reputable editorialists have claimed that a royal commission of inquiry on the same subject would have sat
longer, would have cost the taxpayer much more, and
would have been hard put to present as complete and
comprehensive a report as that tabled by the chairman of
the committee, Senator Croll.
To free the poor from their isolation from society is one
of the priority goals the government has recognized in the
legislation it will introduce in Parliament during the current session. That was precisely the purpose of the surveys made by the Senate Committee on Poverty.
Indeed, what is poverty? To start with, we agree with
the usually accepted definition: whoever lacks the necessities of life: food, lodging, clothing, is poor.
Reflection, however, proves this concept incomplete.
Studying the briefs submitted to the Senate committee by
groups and individuals from different regions, with different backgrounds and mentalities and hearing the witnesses in the field considerably changes the dimensions of
that preconceived concept.
25312-31

Often, from our point of view, we consider to be poor a
man who is quite content with his lot. On the other hand,
we often consider to be well off someone who complains
about his misfortune.
The poor in Labrador and the poor in Whitehorse, the
poor in a large city and the poor in a small fishing village
need not necessarily show the same characteristics.
The objective aspect of poverty, which is computed on
paper by specialists using impersonal statistics and defining as poor a person whose income is less than a certain
sum, must be supplemented by aspects of subjectivity and
relativity, which are more intangible and more difficult to
grasp.
Subjectively and relatively, poverty varies among
individuals on the basis of education, environment, occupation and age.
So, we are always surprised at the difficulties that
authorities have to face in their efforts to eliminate slums.
Families living in dilapidated houses without the most
basic sanitary facilities had to be forcibly evicted and
relocated in accommodations with all modern facilities.
Why? Because they would not part with their old possessions, they would not break with a past, however miserable, to which they were devoted.
* (1450)

Some people who do not own a car can easily do without it. Others feel poor and frustrated if their car, television set, refrigerator, et cetera are not of the most recent
colour and model.
Some who live in comfortable houses but surrounded
with neighbours who have heated garages and swimming
pools feel poor and humiliated, whereas their house
would be considered luxurious if it were moved to a more
modest part of town.
Some people feel poor when they lose their jobs because
they can no longer afford the same standard of living.
Others who have been unemployed for years are satisfied
with their lot. They receive social welfare benefits, their
families have the necessaries of life and they have more
leisure than their neighbours who must work for a living.
They may even refuse a job, because it would not pay
much more than what they are getting in benefits.
Thus we see that poverty is objective and subjective at
the same time, because it has various aspects.
Since it is difficult to define poverty with mathematical
precision, the report of the Senate Special Committee on
Poverty, which I mentioned earlier, has considered as
victims of poverty all persons suffering from some kind of
misfortune: the unemployed, people without a steady job,
the disabled, the old and, generally speaking, people without income or people without a sufficient income.
If it is difficult to define poverty, it is even more difficult to determine its causes which are as numerous as
they are confused and unforseeable.
Some of them, such as physical deficiencies, unemployment, inflation, may be detected easily. Others, such as
ignorance, laziness, incompetence, are much more difficult to assess.
There is, for instance, much ignorance about the levels
of jurisdiction-federal, provincial or municipal levels-

SENATE DEBATES

which causes delays and inefficiency in the administration of the various security programs established to help
the needy.
There is also the ignorance of the heads of family who
are not able at all to administer their budget.
There is the ignorance of many people who get tempted
by an advertisement leading them to buy immediately
expensive items they do not really need and pay for them
later. Those people often forget that the interest often
amounts up to 24 per cent of the purchasing price.
An unbelievable number of needy people have no idea
of the benefits they are entitled to, the conditions under
which they can be eligible, or where or to whom they
should apply.
We must admit that, because it comes under three different jurisdictions, our welfare system is of a complex
nature and is difficult to understand and administer.
This system gives the poor the basic necessities without
encouraging able-bodied people to earn their living which
would restore their dignity as productive and useful members of society.
Moreover, since the introduction of the various welfare
measures, the ministers responsible for administering
them frequently have to change the procedures as regards
conditions or payment, while the number of needy people
or recipients increases steadily.
Today people wonder whether this welfare system,
which costs about $6 billion a year, fully achieves its
purpose.
It is criticized mostly for failing in one very important
respect, which is to encourage, to incite people to work.
Does it not seem to invite idleness in many cases, not so
much because of the bad faith of recipients but because of
its own shortcomings?
Every day there are newspaper advertisements for jobs
which nobody applies for. This paradox is easy to explain.
The unemployed who accepts temporary employment
runs the risk of being deprived of his welfare benefits for
weeks once he leaves the job. It is easy to understand why
he wonders whether it is not more profitable for him to
live on welf are than to work. And this may soon result in
the working man despising the unemployed.
Yet, in spite of its deficiencies and its complexity, our
social security system is one of the most advanced and
comprehensive in the world.
Surely, it must be improved, cost less to the taxpayer,
and above all prove itself more just and efficient in order
to remove those barriers which keep the needy in
isolation.
The briefs and testimonies gathered by that Senate
committee supply valuable data on the whole problem of
poverty, on our system of social security and on the
suggestions offered to fight the scourge of poverty.
The report which has been submitted forces us to
reflect on the problems of our unfortunate fellowmen and

February 24, 1972

to feel deeply that people are not always responsible for
what happens to them.
Why are some born rich and others poor? It would be
useless to wonder who is responsible for poverty.
One fact remains. Poverty is everywhere. Our country is
known in the whole world as a free country and we
actually enjoy more freedom than probably any other
country; it was said recently that Canada was one of the
countries where it is easier to be happy; it is a country
with huge and diversified resources such as mines, forests, fishing, agriculture, which spreads from one ocean to
another, and offers limitless opportunities.
And yet five million out of our 22 million citizens are
considered to be living below the poverty level.
Eight people out of ten among those living on welfare
have no other income. Sixty per cent of those living below
the poverty level are receiving no social benefits and are
active members of the labour force who receive a salary
barely in excess and sometimes less than the benefits they
would get from social welfare.
Of course, there will be always poor people among us.
However, let us not forget that we are all inter-dependent
brothers and equals before God and men. The whims of
fate and the contingencies of life are only responsible for
our various circumstances. Let us not allow such differences to turn into an insurmountable obstacle.
Let us not say out of indifference or cowardice that
whatever we do poverty will never be eliminated. Of
course not. Poverty will never be completely eliminated
but it could be reduced.
There is a more couragous approach which would be to
tackle, examine and analyze this problem and then suggest solutions to solve it. This is exactly what the Special
Senate Committee on Poverty had in mind and, as we can
see from its report, this is what it believes it has done in
spite of its deficiencies due to human nature.
The duty of each and everyone of us, of every citizen
conscious of his obligations and responsibilities toward
his neighbour, is to continue through a massive effort the
fight already underway against this plague that is
poverty.
This is one of the tasks that the government committed
itself to undertake in the current session- to bring back
stability between the income of individuals and a normal
cost of living or, in other words, to remove the victims of
poverty from their isolation.
Let us hope the government will be successful at this
task which is a difficult but never completely impossible
one.
It will have moved one step closer toward eliminating
the barriers of isolation which deny the poor access to and
participation in the just society.

REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS

MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SENATE MEMBERS TO
JOINT COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Paul Martin moved, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(h):

That the following senators be appointed to act on
behalf of the Senate on the Standing Joint Committee
of the Senate and House of Commons on Regulations
and other Statutory Instruments, namely, the honourable Senators Fergusson, Forsey, Goldenberg, Grosart, Haig, Lafond, Molson and Rowe; and
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to
acquaint that house accordingly.
He said: Honourable senators, in view of the importance
which I am sure we attach to this matter, I should like to
say something about this motion proposing that eight
senators, from both sides of this house, should be nominated to the Standing Joint Committee on Regulations
and other Statutory Instruments. I believe that this joint
committee, representing as it does both Houses of Parliament, is an important committee. In the years ahead I
anticipate that it will come to have a considerable impact
on the operations of government. We do not think of it as
a significant but ad hoc special joint committee, such as
that on the Constitution. Nevertheless it will have an
ongoing task; its work will never be over; there will
always be more important matters to probe. Like other
standing joint committees, this joint committee will take
its place among the permanent features of Parliament.
* (2010)

Honourable senators will recall that parliamentary consideration of this proposal goes back to the early days of
this Parliament. A Special Committee on Statutory
Instruments was established in the other place, and
brought down a number of reports. The third and most
significant of these was completed towards the end of
1969. I am sure the house will understand my saying that
the committee owed much to its young chairman, Mark
MacGuigan, who, although a novice to Parliament, had
already shown his wisdom in seeking the nomination and
securing election to one of the finest constituencies in
Canada. I think it will be generally recognized that as
chairman of this committee, he has made a notable contribution to the liberty of the subject in Canada.
The report which he presented to Parliament, and
which we have discussed, stressed the responsibility of
the executive to Parliament for delegated legislation as
well as for the enactment of statutes. This was to be done
in four ways:
(1) it proposed that the government consult fully with
the public and with parliamentary standing committees
before making regulations;
(2) it proposed an extension of the ambit of the present
internal scrutiny of regulations by the Privy Council
Office and the Department of Justice before making
regulations;
(3) it proposed full publication of regulations after they
had been made, with certain limited exceptions;
(4) it proposed the establishment of a new parliamentary standing committee, and regulations to provide for
public scrutiny of those regulations.

SENATE DEBATES

On February 19, 1970, I moved, seconded by the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn):
that the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs be instructed to consider and
from time to time report on procedures for the review
by the Senate of instruments made in virtue of any
statute of the Parliament of Canada, and to consider
in connection therewith any public documents relevant thereto.
My purpose in introducing the motion was that the Senate
could thereby study the recommendations of the third
report of the Special Committee on Statutory Instruments
of the other place. The Senate might accept these recommendations; the Senate might vary these recommendations; or the Senate could produce an entirely new report
if it believed this was necessary. I was convinced that the
Senate had a role to play in the statutory instruments
field. Likewise, this was the view of the Leader of the
Opposition and practically all who spoke in that debate. I
recalled that both the British House of Lords and the
Australian Senate had committees of their chambers
which were concerned with delegated legislation.
I mentioned at that time the recommendation of the
committee that there should be an expansion of the legislative section of the Department of Justice, since the
draftsmen were overworked. This was a view shared by
many members of this chamber, and a point emphasized
by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.
The next stage in this process occurred on June 16, 1970,
when the President of the Privy Council explained that
implementation of the recommendations of the Special
Committee on Statutory Instruments would require three
different actions. First, this would require legislative
action by Parliament to replace the existing Regulations
Act by a new Statutory Instruments Act; second, a
number of cabinet directives to implement several of the
recommendations, which could not be dealt with by general legislation; third, amendment of the standing orders
for the purpose of establishing a scrutiny committee to
review regulations. He went on to say:
During the next session of Parliament the government
will recommend that such a scrutiny committee be
established and that by the proposed statutory instruments act all regulations, with the single exception of
regulations the disclosure of which would be injurious
to international relations, national defence security or
federal-provincial relations will stand permanently
referred to such committee.
The opposition leader in the other place, outside the
bouse, affirmed that this represented almost complete
compliance with the report of the committee.
On June 17, the then Minister of Justice, and his associate deputy minister, testified before the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. There
has been a certain amount of turnover in the membership
of the committee since that time, but those senators who
attended that hearing will recall that it was a fruitful
meeting. I think a number of the senators may have had
in mind the disadvantages of each chamber having a
separate committee on Statutory Instruments, and I
believe that the minister also thought that a joint committee would be preferable.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

February 29, 1972

The Statutory Instruments Act, Bill C-182, was sponsored by the Minister of Justice, passed through both
Houses of Parliament, and received royal assent during
the past session. It was proclaimed to come into force on
the first day of January, 1972. The act entailed amendments to the Interpretation Act, the Canadian Bill of
Rights, the Defence Production Act, and the Export and
Import Permits Act. The Regulations Act was repealed.
The coming into force of the act, together with the statutory instruments regulations, implements to the extent possible those recommendations of the report of the committee of the other house that were capable of being dealt
with by general legislation.
On October 14, 1971, the other chamber passed a motion
to amend their standing orders to provide for a joint
committee involving twelve representatives from that
house. We amended our rules on October 12, 1971, to add a
new subparagraph (d) of Rule 67(1) providing for the
appointment of eight senators to the joint committee.
The new legislation is intended to provide the general
public with a greater measure of protection against the
violation of the rights of the citizen in a free society. The
joint committee is one means of providing that protection,
since the committee is to be empowered to review regulations and other statutory instruments.
a (2020)

It is also provided that there shall be an internal review
of proposed regulations by officers of the Privy Council
and the Department of Justice before they become law.
Another provision of the act gives the public a statutory
right to examine and obtain copies of most regulations
and other statutory instruments.
The act goes beyond the federal government, to the
extent that federally incorporated companies have to
examine their position to ensure that they are acting in
compliance with the act. Failure to register a regulation in
compliance with the act means that the regulation has no
legal force or effect.
The coming into force of this Statutory Instruments
Act, and the creation of the Standing Joint Committee on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments, is an important achievement for Parliament and an important safeguard for the general public. Much of the work of the
committee will be undertaken far from the public limelight, but the effect of its work should prove far-reaching
and long-lasting. I believe that many will look back upon
this period as an important stage in the development of
democratic control and the commencement of a new era
in subordinate legislation.
I commend this resolution designating certain members
of the Senate to the joint committee, and I propose that if
we so agree a message accordingly be sent to the other
place.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I am pleased
that this Standing Joint Committee on Regulations and
other Statutory Instruments will soon be operative, as the
need for such a body is great. We, as parliamentarians,
are entrusted with the task of making laws which affect
the whole of Canada. No one else has that responsibility.
We must bear this fact in mind when delegating authority
to subordinate bodies.

SENATE DEBATES

For reasons of administrative efficiency, we delegate
power to certain arms of government to draw up regulations to statutes. Unfortunately, in the past we have not
paid sufficient attention to the way in which subordinate
legislative bodies have carried out their tasks.
There have been instances in which the regulations did
not reflect the spirit of the law. We have had examples of
authoritarian and capricious regulations which imposed a
serious and unnecessary burden upon the citizen and
which represented, indeed, legislation by order in council.
Delegated authority has given government the opportunity to incorporate into the law under regulations items
which Parliament would never have tolerated had they
been presented as part of the actual bill. For these reasons, we need a parliamentary body to oversee the work
of those responsible for drafting regulations.
Successful administrators do not assign tasks and then
completely disregard the manner in which they are carried out; yet Parliament has done this for too long. I am
pleased that we are now accepting the full scope of our
responsibility as legislators and will look into the manner
in which delegated authority is used. We must protect the
human rights and civil liberties of Canadians and also the
rights of Parliament. Power to delegate legislative
authority could be used to put an end to constitutional
government. Parliament, which means the majority, could
delegate its law-making power to another body, and parliamentary government would then be suspended. This is
an extremely dangerous area, especially in these days
when executive branches of government are striving to
increase their powers of legislation.
Those of us who cherish freedom, those of us who fear
statist governments, those of us who do not want to see
the authoritarian we stopped at the front door sneak in
the back, welcome the institution of this joint committee.
It will have to acquire experience before it really becomes
effective. However, I feel sure that the members representing the Senate on this committee will make a significant and useful contribution. They will be free to do so
because neither the Leader of the Government in the
Senate nor the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate will
be members of that joint committee.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I should
like to take part in this debate for a few moments. There
an
is in the current issue of The Parliamentarian article
on the House of Lords by Lord Shepherd who was Chief
Whip during the days of the Labour government in England. Lord Shepherd was in Canada as, I believe, the
leader of the British delegation for a while at the 1966
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meeting.
In this learned and sophisticated article he discusses in
a general way the powers and functions of the Lords, and
he makes a particular point of the importance which the
Lords attach to their scrutiny of subordinate legislation.
This has been a problem, of course, in Britain for a long
time and they faced up to it much more quickly, I feel,
than we have in Canada. We have not been oblivious of
the importance of it. One only has to look at the regulations extant under the Income Tax Act to realize how
important regulations are. Or one can look at the numerous boards, committees and administrative tribunals that
are issuing orders constantly. The volume of subordinate

legislation and the volume of decisions which bear upon
life in the modern state is something to appall the ordinary layman. No one person can be an expert in all areas
of this field.
There is one aspect, however, of this matter that I
should like to refer to. Before doing so I should say that I
feel the interest of the citizen, the position of the common
man in the face of the proliferation of subordinate legislation, is a responsibility for Parliament to protect. Through
the establishment of this committee, under the aegis of the
bill passed by Parliament some months ago, Parliament
will go far towards discharging that onus.
There is another area of legislation, and I intend to ask
the Leader of the Government a question about this
because I am not sure of the ground upon which I am
proceeding. When the War Measures Act is invoked at a
time of national emergency, the amount of subordinate
legislation enacted is enormous. Parliament generally
knows nothing about it. I believe Parliament realizes in
such circumstances, because of the security element that
is involved in wartime operations, that many of those
orders must be secret. The security of the state is
involved. I wonder what the position of this committee is
in respect of such orders made under a bill like the War
Measures Act. I should think that while the act is in force
it would be possible to say that the orders are secret
orders and should not be examined, but would have to
stand the test of examination when the War Measures Act
has been revoked. While it is important to remember that
this committee will be a further protection for the rights
and liberties of the individual, we should also, I submit,
bear in mind that there are occasions of emergency and of
crisis when it is perhaps not desirable that every regulation made should be open to scrutiny, even by this committee or by Parliament.
* (2030)

Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, the Leader
of the Government, in introducing this motion, left two
very important questions unanswered. One was referred
to a moment ago by Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),
namely, the status of those statutory instruments that may
be invoked or put into operation by the government but
are not referable under the act to this committee. The
other question, of course, refers to the very limited
powers of this committee, which as I understand it are
merely to review. Under the act, as I have read it, the
committee does not even have the power to report.
As Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) pointed out, there
may be matters which it would not, in his view and in the
view of others, be advisable to refer to this joint committee. I hope the Leader of the Government will have a
better explanation of this than I have received to date. I
suggest that this committee will be in the position of
having certain statutory instruments referred to it, but
having no idea whatsoever what other statutory instruments may be in effect about which it knows nothing.
I would therefore ask the Leader of the Government if it
is the intention of the government in the implementation
of the act, following the resolution that has just been
proposed, to indicate to the joint committee on a confidential basis the headings, at least, of those statutory instruments about which the committee knows nothing. If that

SENATE DEBATES
is not done, I suggest the work of this committee will be
largely a farce. If the committee is merely dealing with
what the government says are the statutory instruments it
is entitled to look at, then the committee is not looking at
the whole problem of statutory instruments.
It amazes me that this committee has powers so limited
that all it is empowered to do under the act is to review.
As I understand it, there is not a word in the act that says
what the committee can do after its review. This committee can talk forever. It is not even required to report. If it
were to report, to whom would it report? It is a joint
committee. Does it report to both houses and say, "We
don't like this statutory instrument"? Does it have any
power in any way to bring pressure on the government to
change its ways and to alter this unconscionable process
of government by executive without reference to the
normal process of parliamentary legislation?
I would ask the Leader of the Government to take those
two questions into consideration and, if not now, at least
in due course give this chamber a rather more explicit
indication of the scope of activities that this important
committee is expected to undertake.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senators, speaking as a layman, I would like to mention one thing to the
Leader of the Government, the Leader of the Opposition,
and all who participated in the debate when this matter
was discussed in the Senate some time ago.
On many occasions, lawyers have spoken to me and
complained about the multiplicity of laws and regulations.
Only last week, in the City of Saint John, a distinguished
member of the legal profession complained bitterly about
this. He spoke about the great volume of legislation that
was being passed, and how difficult it was for him to keep
himself up to date. He then referred to the multitudinous
regulations.
I want it to be known that this is regarded as a very
urgent matter. I am sure the proposal will be endorsed by
the people generally, and that it is a step in the right
direction.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Goldenberg, debate adjourned.

LOCAL INITIATIVES PROGRAM
NOVA·SCOTIA APPLICATIONS-QUESTIONS
Hon. John M. ,Macdonald: Honourable senators, I have a
few questions I should like to put to the Leader of the
Government. I realize that the answers cannot be given
this evening, but perhaps he will obtain them and give
them in due course. The questions are:
1. What projects have been approved under the
Local Initiatives Program in the Province of Nova
Scotia?
2. What is the amount of the grant involved in each
case?
3. Who actually received or is to receive the grant?
4. How many jobs is each of these projects supposed
to create?
5. How long will these jobs last?
6. What project applications emanating from Nova
Scotia were rejected?
7. Why specifically was each rejected?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I shall certainly take notice of those
questions and shall try to give replies as quickly as
possible.
LABOUR RELATIONS
DISPUTE BETWEEN TREASURY BOARD AND THE
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL
WORKERS-QUESTIONS ANSWERED
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, a week ago
Senator Cameron asked me four questions. The first was:
Does the government not think that the so-called
collective bargaining process has just about run its
course so far as the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers is concerned?
The answer is:
The collective bargaining process is unlikely to run
its course in any final sense. That process appears to
be widely acknowledged in Canada as being the most
effective means available to determine terms and conditions of employment. Its application in the Public
Service of Canada has enjoyed far more success than
failure, since over 250 collective agreements have
been signed without disruption difficulties as a result
of direct negotiation. Strikes and threats of strikes
have been few.
The second question was:
How is it necessary for a sovereign government to
have to ask one of its creations for permission to
prosecute common lawbreakers?
* (2040)

The answer is:
The Public Service Staff Relations Board is a creation of Parliament, not the government. Having
recourse to such a tribunal is a common requirement
in most labour legislation across the country. Resort
to the institution of prosecution should not be precipitate and it should be instituted after other methods of
ensuring compliance with the legislation have failed.

Februarv 29. 1972

SENATE DEBATES

It should be recalled in this instance that the government, through the Treasury Board, was one of the
parties to the labour dispute.
The third question was:
Third, granting that this supreme authority, the
Public Service Staff Relations Board, deigns to give
the Government of Canada permission to enforce the
law of Canada, will the government prosecute these
people to the full extent of the law, under which they
are liable to fines of $100 per day?
The answer is:
The maximum fine for each offence is $100, not $100
per day, for employees convicted of violating the act.
There are stronger penalties for the union and union
officers who violate the act. Application has already
been made to the Public Service Staff Relations
Board for permission to institute proceedings to
prosecute those who in the opinion of the employer
have violated the act. Hearings will be conducted
shortly by the Public Service Staff Relations Board.
The fourth question was:
Finally, does the government contemplate repealing
the section of the Public Service Staff Relations Act
which gives public servants the right to strike?
The answer is:
The Public Service Staff Relations Board held in
1970 that sections 6 and 101 of the Public Service Staff
Relations Act when read together may be interpreted
as conferring upon employees the right to strike.
There is no express provision in the act that confers
on public servants the right to strike. The minister
responsible for the Public Service Staff Relations
Board commissioned a study of the workings of the
Public Service Staff Relations Act and that study bas
now been turned over to the President of the Privy
Council who was recently appointed minister responsible for the Public Service Staff Relations Board for
his consideration.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Honourable senators, I wish to
thank the Leader of the Government for his courtesy in
replying to the questions I put the other day. But I would
suggest that the time has come when this chamber, or
some other place, should take the necessary steps to clear
up the ambiguities which exist with respect to the right to
strike. Even today 32 flights out of Montreal were cancelled while some 20 flights were cancelled out of Toronto.
These cancellations are caused by one small group of
people. It is high time this was stopped.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I merely wish to
state at this time that I had some supplementary questions
to put to the Leader of the Government. However, in view
of the incident that occurred yesterday in the other place,
I am afraid of the qualifications that might be put on my
questions, so I am going to refrain from putting them
today. But that fear will soon disappear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I can only say that I do not understand
the observation.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 24, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's
speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of
Hon. Mr. Buckwold, seconded by Hon. Miss Lapointe, for
an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Guy Williams: Honourable senators, first I want to
express my thanks and appreciation of my good fortune
for the privilege of being appointed to sit in this place of
high honour and dignity, full of long and lasting traditions
of the Crown. My family joins with me in saying "Thank
you." You have extended congratulations to me and have
wished me well. This gesture has helped me to adjust to
the many responsibilities of this Upper Chamber.
I must say at this time that I have enjoyed the debates
since my appointment, and I believe I have learned a
great deal from them. I expect to learn much more as time
goes on.
I wish to dwell at some length on the Speech from the
Throne and the aspect of isolation in its many forms,
particularly the isolation of the first citizens of Canada,
my people. I would be remiss if I did not voice the effects
of this isolation along with the effects of your civilization.
In order to do that I shall take you back to a period of
history which existed more than two centuries ago.
The culture of the Iroquois tribes differed considerably
from that of the nomadic Algonquin bands. The Iroquois
were, first, largely an agricultural people. Their villages
were permanent fixtures in the forests, which were
cleared to plant gardens and accommodate the deer that
browsed on the fresh growth. The fiercest of the Iroquois
were the Mohawks, who lived along the Hudson River in
New York. West of them were the almost equally fierce
Oneida, and then came the Onondaga, a relatively peaceful tribe. Further west were the Cayuga, a small group,
while the most westerly Iroquois and the most numerous
were the Seneca, who harassed the Indians living along
the Ohio River and its tributaries.
At approximately the year 1570 these five tribes formed
the Hodesaunee or League of Five Nations. This group
became known as the Six Nations when the remnants of
the Tuscaroras were admitted in 1722. This confederacy
was to last a full two centuries, finally breaking up at the
time of the American revolution when most of the
Mohawks, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca sided with the
British against the Tuscaroras, and the Oneida on the side
of the revolting colonies in 1776.
Although legendary as to its origin, the confederacy
probably received its impetus from the probings of the
French ships into the Gulf of St. Lawrence early in the
sixteenth century. Although there is no record of direct
contact between them and the Iroquois at that time, the
Iroquois could hardly have been unaware of the white
intrusion just beyond their borders. Cartier, for example,
sailed up the St. Lawrence River, and probably reached
the vicinity of Montreal 35 years before the league was
allegedly formed.
* (2050)

The League of the Iroquois deeply impressed the white
settlers, and some historians believe that it was one of the

SENATE DEBATES

models on which the Constitution of the new United
States of America was based. Apparently the league
somewhat resembled the union of the 13 colonies in
organization, but some contend that it could more accurately be compared to the United Nations. The league did
not deal with internal problems of the member tribes, but
solely with the external affairs of war and peace. The
league had a constitution that was orally transmitted, but
it could not levy taxes and it lacked a police force to carry
out its decisions.
The hereditary leaders, the Council of Sachems, also
translated as the Confederate Lords or the Confederate
Council, could not interfere in the affairs of individual
tribes-an arrangement similar to the limited power the
first United States central government once had, under its
Articles of Confederation, over the internal affairs of the
13 states. Each tribe had its own Sachems but they were
also limited in other powers; they dealt with relations
between clans but not with clan matters themselves. The
emphasis was on equality between individual tribes.
Democratic as the Iroquois system might have appeared
to early settlers, it too suffered from the shortcomings
that have existed in other power structures. The 50
Sachem titles were rigidly controlled. Only males belonging to certain matrilineages within each tribe could hold
the Sachem or lordship titles. When a Sachem died his
successors could be selected from only the matrilineage
holding that title. Furthermore, the women were the ones
who did the choosing. If the Sachem selected failed to
perform his duties or to respond to the wishes of the tribe,
he was removed and replaced. While the women did not
themselves rule, they had the sole power to appoint and to
remove from office.
Now we come to the Great Laws. The Constitution of
the Iroquois League is known to the Iroquois as the Great
Binding Law or the Great Immutable Law. In Iroquois the
term is Ne Gayanashagowa. Transmitted orally from one
generation to another, its knowledge has been preserved
by a collection of wampum, string bead belts. Each bead
served to recall a law or regulation. Not until recently
have the Iroquois attempted to put their code in written
form. The version of the constitution now held authentic
by the Iroquois in New York and Ontario was drafted into
the English language by Arthur C. Parker, of distinguished Seneca-Iroquois ancestry. Consisting of 117 separate sections, it makes provision for the whole spectrum
of inter-tribal relationship and social intercourse. The prefatory articles of the Great Immutable Law are not too
dissimilar to the preambles preceding the constitutions of
modern states.
The constitution allocates specific duties to each of the
five member tribes. The Onondaga-the Fire Keepers
who looked after the Council Fire-were charged with the
responsibility of calling the Confederate Council into session after they had duly considered the necessity of bringing a matter before the Confederate Council. Under the
constitution the Mohawk Lords were appointed as leaders
of the Five Nations Confederacy with a deciding veto
power. The Mohawk Council was divided into three sections for deliberative purposes, with the third having the
responsibility of monitoring and ensuring the exactitude
of the discussion.
[Hon. Mr. Williamsd]

February 29, 1972

Section 5 of the constitution says in part:
The third party is to listen only to the discussion of the
first and second parties and if an error is made or the
proceeding is irregular they are to call attention to it,
and when the case is right and properly decided by
the two parties they shall confirm the decision of the
two parties and refer the case to the Seneca Lords for
their decision. When the Seneca Lords have decided in
accordance with the Mohawk Lords, the case or question shall be referred to the Cayuga and Oneida Lords
on the opposite side of the house.
Section 55 provides for dissolution as follows:
Every five years the Five Nations Confederate Lords
and the people shall assemble and shall ask one
another if their minds are still in the same spirit of
unity for the Great Binding Law and if any of the Five
Nations shall not pledge continuance and steadfastness to the pledge of unity then the Great Binding
Law shall dissolve.

An interesting provision in Section 75 resembles that of
the accepted international right of asylum:
When a member of an alien nation comes to the
territory of the Five Nations and seeks refuge and
permanent residence, the Lords of the Nation to
which he comes shall extend hospitality and make
him a member of the nation. Then shall he be accorded equal rights and privileges in all matters except as
after mentioned.
Interestingly, a process of referendum for gravely
important matters was also provided for by the constitution. Section 93 states:
Whenever a specially important matter or a great
emergency is presented before the Confederate Council and the nature of the matter affects the entire body
of Five Nations, threatening their utter ruin, then the
Lords of the Confederacy must submit the matter to
the decision of their people and the decision of the
people shall affect the decision of the Confederate
Council. This decision shall be a confirmation of the
voice of the people.
Honourable senators, I have referred to only small portions of the 117 sections of the great law established by a
primitive people. I ask you: Did isolation defeat the Six
Nations way of life? I believe so. If there had been no
discovery of this continent by the Europeans, this wonderful form of government may have extended to the entire
continent just as the Inca and Aztec civilization was
moving northward. Unfortunately, the Spanish conquistadors destroyed that civilization just as the newcomers
divided the Six Nations, introduced firearms, and nipped
that wonderful effort of a primitive people in its bud, so to
speak.
This is the glorious past of the Six Nations, honourable
senators. They are still living in isolation, more so than the
other nationals of this great Canada. I want to see extension of this just society, this affluent society, to the Indian
people. Canada is resource rich and can well afford a
fixed income for the adult Indian as he has no future,
jobwise or otherwise. He is isolated, and robbed of his
pride, his self respect, his heritage, and his freedom to

I fished most of my life. I know something about salmon
and herring fishing. In addition, for a number of years I
have been a member of the Advisory Committee to the
Department of Fisheries under its minister in negotiating
fishing treaties with other countries, namely, the United
States and Japan. We have no treaty with Japan at the
present time but that country still adheres to and respects
the area of abstention on the ocean in not coming east of
the 175th meridian of west longitude. This is an area of
intermingling of Canadian and Asiatie stocks of salmon. I
also had the privilege of sitting in on the negotiations with
Russia in 1971.
For many years the Indian fishermen enjoyed isolation,
security, and plenty of salmon to harvest. Then came an
end to the rowboat and sailboat era. Powered fishing
boats gave fishermen greater mobility. Improved equipment was introduced from time to time, such as mechanized net pullers, and today they have electronic equipment such as radar, depth sounders, ship-to-ship and
ship-to-shore radio communications, electronic fish finders, and many other navigational aids.
But the Indian fisherman did not participate in these
changes. He was crowded out. He was left behind in the
way of government assistance in the form of subsidies
and legislation making possible bank loans for maintenance and other needs. It must be remembered that the
old Indian Act, revised in 1952 after nearly 80 years without a revision, placed the Indian in a position of being a
ward of the government. He did not qualify for loans to
improve his equipment as did other nationals in the industry. This situation has forced him to carry on his fishing
efforts with obsolete equipment. Sometimes his boat is
not seaworthy.
He bas survived nearly 100 years as a fisherman on that
coast. Today the government is helping with a program
known as the Indian Fishermen's Assistance Program, to
the amount of $4.6 million. This five-year plan is now in its

that he is being educated and trained, and learning the
ways of this just society. I am very sure of this. Many of
my people will not agree with me on this statement, but I
repeat that I am very sure this is the way it is going to be
in the future.
I left my own reservation in 1944. We have five children.
They went to schools in the municipality where we lived,
Richmond, British Columbia, and they are all doing well
today in their chosen lines of endeavour. I must remind
you that it is not easy for Indians to win competitive jobs
or employment. They are usually told, "Don't call us, we'll
call you", and that is the end of that application. That is
isolation in its worst form, tinged with discrimination.
When they give their racial origin as Indian, that is it!
I say to you, honourable senators-and this is from my
own experience and observation--give an Indian the
same tools, the same training, equal opportunity without
segregation, and he will prove himself capable and efficient. This is exactly what the Armed Forces of Canada
did in World War II. The Indian was a good soldier. If he
is given opportunities similar to those that the army gave
him, he will be a great asset to this just society and
Canada.
Today he is suffering in poverty. He lives in below
standard housing, sometimes lined with cardboard. He is
generally in poor health, suffering from malnutrition and
many other ailments possibly caused by his poor environment. In spite of his difficulties to adjust to this society,
this new way of life with its many restrictions, he is now
emerging into your society. Possibly up to one-fifth of the
Indians in British Columbia, 47,000 of them, have moved
off their reserves to seek employment, and to enjoy to its
fullest extent the benefits of this society.

should be charged. They say, "We are Canadians; give us
justice, not discrimination."
Three or four years ago in Quesnel, a town not far from
where the preceding incident occurred, a young Indian
woman joined three young white people in a beer parlour.
Later that evening she left the beer parlour in their company, was stripped naked and attacked. Her dead body
was found on a garbage dump in the town. The sentence
imposed on one member of the group was very light, and
the other two received fines.
Those are examples of the problems facing Indian
people in this great country of Canada, in this so-called
just society.
Honourable senators, I shall later give notice in the
proper manner that I will introduce a motion asking this
chamber to set up a special committee to inquire into and
report on the circumstances surrounding these particular
incidents, and similar incidents of injustice which have
occurred throughout the country. I am confident that the
members of this house, with their well-known interest in
justice, will demand a full and impartial inquiry into these
tragic events. I regard it as my solemn duty to bring these
matters to your attention.
I do not propose to end my speech in the traditional
manner, but will adopt the form of conclusion used by my
own people and say: Honourable senators, I have spoken.

CANADA-UNITED STATES INTERPARLIAMENTARY
GROUP
FOURTEENTH MEETING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Leave having been given to revert to Inquiries:
Hon. Jean-Paul Deschatelets rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Fourteenth Meeting of the Canada-United States
Interparliamentary Group held at Ottawa and Montebello, 16th to 20th February, 1972.
He said: Honourable senators, we have followed with
great interest the speech of my colleague, the honourable
Senator Williams, who preceded me.
I shall be brief in my remarks for three reasons. First, I
like you; secondly, I did not participate in the discussion
at the Canada-United States meeting; and thirdly, at the
conclusion of my remarks I shall request that the report
of the meeting which will provide honourable senators
with the composition of the delegations, the program, and
a general outline of the different topics discussed, be
printed as an appendix to Hansard.
This was the Fourteenth Meeting of the Canada-United
States Interparliamentary Group. Honourable senators
will recall that it was scheduled to take place a few
months ago. However, it was delayed at the request of our
American friends because of pressure of business before
both houses of the American Congress.
The delay was accepted with regret, it being recognized
that a similar situation could affect the Canadian delegates at a future conference.
[Hon. Mr. Williams.]

February 29, 1972

The meeting was held in Ottawa and Montebello from
February 16 to 20. I acted as co-chairman, with my colleague the Honourable Mr. Lamoureux, Speaker of the
House of Commons. I should like to make a few observations on this important meeting, and I understand that my
fellow delegates in this chamber who attended the meeting will make their own observations.
The Canadian delegation from the Senate comprised, in
alphabetical order, the honourable Senators Beaubien,
Connolly (Ottawa West), Everett, Hayden, Macnaughton,
O'Leary and myself. For discussion purposes, the conference was divided into two committees. One dealt with
trade and economic affairs. I had the honour to preside as
co-chairman over this committee with my American colleague, the honourable Senator Church from Idaho, and,
later on, the honourable Senator Hollings from South
Carolina.
0 (2130)

The second committee dealt with defence and security
matters. I believe we had only one representative on this
committee but a very distinguished one in the person of
the honourable Senator O'Leary. This committee was
chaired by the Speaker of the other place, the Honourable
Lucien Lamoureux, and Congressman Gallagher from
New Jersey.
As has been the practice over the years, a joint communiqué from the four co-chairmen was issued to the
press. There is also a report which embraces the whole
aspect of the conference and this is the report which, at
the end of my remarks, I intend to request be printed as
an appendix to Hansard. This will be the Canadian
report; there will be an American report prepared by the
two American co-chairmen. These reports do not refer to
any specifics, of course, as these meetings are held in
camera. I feel that the report is an important document,
and I hope all honourable senators will take the opportunity to read it. The primary purpose of the CanadaUnited States meetings is to promote better understanding between delegates of both countries with respect to
mutual problems, and they at least make aware the general thinking of parliamentarians with respect to such
problems.
The meeting scheduled for last May having been postponed, the arrangements for the latest meeting resulted in
less travelling and fewer social events, so that we had
more time for serious discussion.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank those
colleagues of mine in the Senate who took a very active
part in these discussions. I should also like to thank my
distinguished colleague from the other place, the Honourable Lucien Lamoureux, for his immense contribution to
the success of this meeting. Also deserving of my thanks
at this time, of course, are the two American co-chairmen,
Senator Church and Congressman Gallagher, both of
whom co-operated with us in every respect. I should also
put on record at this time, on behalf of all delegates, our
appreciation of and thanks to Mr. Ian Imrie and his staff,
and Mrs. J. Renton, Colonel A. Fortier, and Mr. Marcel
Nadeau of the Senate staff, for their excellent organizational assistance.
Before concluding I should like to outline what I feel are
four important precedents which, in my view, will give a

February 29. 1972

SENATE DEBATES

new dimension to this interparliamentary group. As I
have said, these are in camera meetings and for many
years only delegates attended them. There may have been
a few exceptions, and if so Senator O'Leary will correct
me. At a meeting in Washington two years ago, at which I
was leader of the Canadian delegation, we were discussing technical problems with respect to energy. As might
be expected, we did not have all the answers. Consequently, we agreed to invite an expert from the American
government to sit with us in an advisory capacity. I
believe that was the first time such action was taken. In
any event, I feel it would be useful in circumstances
where we are dealing with technical problems to have on
hand an expert who could give us some guidance. Perhaps some of my colleagues will disagree with me on that
point.
In my view another precedent was set when a special
meeting of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group was held November 11, 1971. This meeting was
held at the request of the Canadian delegation to discuss
the 10 per cent surcharge on imports that had been
imposed by the Government of the United States. The
practice has been to hold meetings each year alternately
in Canada and in the United States, but as a result of the
November 11 meeting it was agreed that if at any time one
group wished urgently to discuss any problem of mutual
importance, it should approach the other group regarding
the possibility of holding a special meeting. This agreement forms part of the report that I will ask to have
placed in Hansard.
a (2140)

There is one thing that took place at the last conference
here that I should like to outline. As you know, there were
discussions in two different committees in Ottawa, and on
the Saturday there were discussions in Montebello. We all
agreed, I believe, that one of the most important issues
was that of trade between Canada and the United States,
but there were, of course, other important matters discussed such as those concerning defence and external
policies. Defence was one problem that everyone felt
should be discussed in depth.
It was suggested, for the first time, that we could have a
plenary session of both committees with the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce. This took place in the
Railway Committee Room. I attended most of the meeting, which I think went on for a little more than an hour.
In my view, the importance of this is that the American
delegates, representatives of both houses, had more information from the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce on Canadian problems and the Canadian perspective than they ever had before. This is a precedent that I
hope can be repeated when there is a trip to Washington
another year.
In the light of this it can be said that this Interparliamentary Group is not only more alive than ever, but that
its basic concept or charter has been enlarged to permit
more meetings than the earlier conference originally
planned. These changes will, I think, permit a much better
understanding than before. It can be said, therefore, that
this latest meeting of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group was-this is my view, at least-one of
the most successful. However, I must confess that I have

attended only three or four. This interparliamentary
group is now, I think, unique among our parliamentary
associations.
When our American friends left Ottawa at the end of
the meeting we were all conscious of the fact that, even if
we had not settled one specific problem-and there are
important problems between Americans and Canadians
today, and there will be more tomorrow and after tomorrow-at least we had had the great satisfaction of being a
group representing all parties in both countries, who had
found a very effective mechanism for a better understanding and a lasting friendship between our two
countries.
These are the only observations I wish to make at this
time. I know that my colleagues who follow me in this
debate will have much more to say, because they took
part in the discussions. Even though the discussions were
held in camera, it is possible, I think, for my colleagues to
at least express their views on the topics discussed.
Having said that, may I ask that the Report of the
Fourteenth Annual Meeting of the Canada-United States
Interparliamentary Group, which is signed by Speaker
Lamoureux and myself, be printed as an appendix to the
Debates of the Senate of this day.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
[For text of Appendix see pp. 47-51]
Hon. Alan Macnaughton: Honourable senators, you will
be glad to hear that my remarks this evening will be brief,
instead of the usual torrent of words, perhaps leading
nowhere.
I listened with great interest to the remarks of His
Honour the Speaker, who led our delegation in a very
distinguished way. I have for many years been a member
of this interparliamentary group. I must say there has
been a certain amount of continuity of membership,
which I think is important on any committee. Furthermore, it helps one make many personal friendships which
in time of need prove valuable indeed. I have in the past
spoken several times on this subject, and I will not delay
you for long this evening. However, I do wish to illustrate
the importance of this group.
On the delegation there were two new faces, namely, the
honourable Senator John J. Connolly and the honourable
Senator Douglas Everett, who brought their experience
and knowledge, and proved most welcome additions, and
in their own ways made very special contributions. The
honourable Senator Salter Hayden, of course, will speak
in this debate. He was one of our leaders on trade matters.
The honourable Senator Louis Beaubien brought his
practical experience to apply to trade matters. As for the
honourable Senator Grattan O'Leary, who is in effect one
of the patron saints of this organization, he brought light
and levity, along with a great deal of wisdom, when we
celebrated his birthday twice in one day.
*

(2150)

Honourable senators, there are two organizations to
which I should like to call your attention. The first is the
Inter-Parliamentary Relations Branch, which works for
both Houses of Parliament. It was set up for that purpose
and I think it bas proved its worth during the years. We
owe a debt of gratitude for the organization of this confer-

SENATE DEBATES

ence to its chief, Mr. Ian Imrie, and Miss Jean
Macpherson.
The second group to which we should pay tribute is the
Parliamentary Centre, who were responsible for organizing the brief, and preparing us for discussions with our
American confrères. I must say that for the excellent
briefing we received our thanks are more than due to the
many capable people, drawn from the different departments of government, who came and spoke to us. This
briefing-which was extensive and very good in my case,
and I am sure that applies to other senators-broadened
our understanding on many of the problems of the
present time that prove difficult to solve so far as our
country is concerned.
Two years ago in Washington, energy seemed to be the
big problem before this interparliamentary group. The
Assistant Under-Secretary of State for energy problems,
Mr. Philip Trezyse, appeared and explained his point of
view. This, as His Honour the Speaker has said, did create
a precedent because it was the first time that a non-parliamentary person appeared before this group.
Honourable senators, you will recall that in August
1971, when President Nixon imposed the 10 per cent surcharge and introduced the DISC program, we were faced
with considerable difficulties. Following that introduction, a special ad hoc meeting was held in Washington on
November 11, at the request of the Canadians. At that
meeting the Americans received us graciously, as usual.
We had the opportunity of bringing to their attention the
reasons why we thought the 10 per cent surcharge and the
DISC program should not apply to this country. I should
note, in passing, that the Americans also have their problems in the matter of balance of payments and the need
for energy resources.
To my way of thinking, communication is the name of
the game. For example, the Honourable Jean-Luc Pepin,
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, spoke to the
joint group for over one hour in the Railway Committee
Room on Canada's position on the trade negotiations
which, up to the moment, have not been concluded. He
spoke directly to the American delegates in plain terms.
He explained the Canadian attitude, and made a decided
impression on them. They found that he was not just a
functionary, that he knew whereof he was speaking. I
think he convinced a great many of them. In any event,
this was a direct approach, and is one more step in the
recognition of the general principle that when things get

February 29, 1972

rough our interparliamentary group is there for special as
well as annual meetings.
As honourable senators know, it was during January
1959 that the present Governor General, the Right Honourable Roland Michener, and Senator Aiken of Vermont
started the Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group. During thirteen years the group has shown great
ability in adapting itself to the changing requirements on
both sides of the border. Therefore, my conclusion is that
the Canada-United States group offers an important
means of direct communication between members of the
Canadian Parliament and members of the United States
Congress-an advantage few other countries, if any,
enjoy. The group can be convened quickly and used for
dealing with special problems on either side of the border.
Is it not better to be on good terms with our cousins and
neighbours to the south, than to worry about events in
outer Mongolia? The Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group has proved its worth. Long may it
flourish.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, may I ask Senator Macnaughton a question? He said that at the last
meeting in Ottawa, the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce spoke to the delegates. At the meeting in
November, did any member of the American government
appear before the committee, or has it been a practice at
any other meeting for members of either government to
appear?
Hon. Mr. Macnaughton: No, this is something entirely
new. At the November meeting I do not remember any

outside member of the Government of the United States
appearing before our committee, nor do I remember any
member of the American civil service appearing. We had
but one day in Washington and it was completely utilized
by the delegates, both American and Canadian. I felt that
the fact that Mr. Pepin came was unique. It was a precedent. I do not say it should be followed on every occasion,
but when there are such emergencies what better can you
do than have such a person as the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce speak with authority and knowledge on a subject he knows so well, and with his persuasive qualities really impressing our American friends?
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, for Hon. Mr. Beaubien, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

APPENDIX
(See p. 45.)
REPORT 0F THE FOURTEENTH ANNUAL MEETING 0F THE CANADA-UNITED STATES
INTERPARLIAMENTARY GROUP
A number of special circumstances have surrounded
the holding of the Fourteenth Meeting of the CanadaUnited States Interparliamentary Group, in Ottawa and
Montebello, from February 16th to, 2Oth, 1972.
First, it is remembered that the Fourteenth Meeting had
originally been scheduled to take place in May, 1971, but
had to, be postponed at the last minute when it became
clear that a sudden surge in important legislative business
would prevent the delegates from the United States Congress from leaving Washington.
As it turned out, 1971 did not elapse without members
from both sides of the Group coming together for discussions. The opportunity arose from last summer's international monetary crisis and from the steps taken immediately by the United States Government to remedy this
crisis and to restore the United States serious balance of
payment situation to, a healthier and more stable position.
The increasingly grave impact which these steps were
having, on the Canadian economy prompted the Canadian
Co-Chairme'n of the Group, the Speakers of the Senate
and of the House of Commons, to request from the United
States Co-Chairmen, Senator Frank Church and Congressman Cornelius Gallagher, a special meeting of the
Group to consider these urgent matters. The United
States Co-Chairmen agreed without hesitation and
offered to host such a meeting in Washington. A Canadian
parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker of the House
o! Commons, then left for the United States Capital for
the one-day meeting whîch was held on November 1 lth,
1971. This precedent in the Group's history was looked
upon favourably by ail delegates at the 1972 meeting. It
was agreed that if at any time one side wishes urgently to
discuss any problem of mutual importance, it should
approach the other side regarding the possibility of holding a special meeting. This decision will undoubtedly lead
to increased use of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group as the only instrument of joint consultation that regularly brings together the lawmakers from
both countries.
Although the opportunity was missed last year to host
the United States delegates in a more gentle season, the
February 1972 dates have proven very timely, falllng as
they did in the middle of a nçw important phase in the
United States economic re-adjustments and in the current
round of trade negotiations between the United States
and Canada.
The Fourteenth Meeting also coincided for the first time
with the opening of a new.session of the Canadian Parliament. The United States delegates and their wives were
invited to the Senate Gallery to listen to the Speech from
the Throne read by His Excellency the Governor General,
the Right Honourable Roland Michener.
Composition of Delegations
In addition to the two Co-Chairmen, Senator Frank
Church (Idaho) and Congressman Cornelius E. Gallagher
(New Jersey) and Senator George Aiken (Vermont),

SENATE DEBATES
Relations Branch in co-operation with the Parliamentary
Centre for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, over the
two weeks preceding the meeting. The delegates had sessions with officials from the Departments of External
Affairs; Finance; Energy, Mines and Resources; Industry,
Trade and Commerce; and the Environment; as well as
from the Working Group on Foreign Investments and the
Canadian International Development Agency.
Proceedings
The Fourteenth Meeting was formally opened by the
four Co-Chairmen in the Railway Committee Room of the
Parliament Buildings on Thursday, February 17th, at 9.45
a.m. The Right Honourable the Prime Minister and Mrs.
Pierre Elliott Trudeau came in immediately following the
opening plenary session to meet and chat with the United
States delegates and their wives.
The proceedings were then adjourned to Friday, February 18, when both Committees met all day in the Parliament Buildings at Ottawa. They concluded their business
on Saturday morning, February 19, at Montebello,
Quebec.
The Committee on Trade and Economic matters met
under the joint chairmanship of Senator Church and
Speaker Deschatelets. Representing the United States
Congress were Senators Hollings and Stevens, and
Representatives Johnson, Kyros, Meeds, Pickle, Harvey,
McEwen and Horton. Representing Canada were Senators Beaubien, Connolly, Everett, Hayden and Macnaughton, and from the House of Commons, Messrs. Breau,
Burton, Danforth, Fairweather, Francis, Kaplan, Leblanc,
Pringle and Trudel.
Report of Committee I: Trade and Economic Matters
"Discussion focussed on two major themes: economic relations between Canada and the United
States, and mutual problems and challenges in the
field of pollution control and abatement.
"On the first theme, discussion naturally centered
initially on recent inconclusive trade negotiations
between the two countries. On the Canadian side delegates stressed the importance of adopting a longer
perspective, of not giving undue importance to trade
figures for only the last two years and the need to take
account of the total balance of payment picture.
United States delegates placed their main emphasis
on the urgent need for the United States Government
to take immediate action to overcome the present
excessive balance of payments deficit. Delegates on
both sides appreciated the opportunity to have a
report from the Honourable Jean-Luc Pepin on recent
trade talks between Canada and the United States
and to question him about future perspectives.
"There was a broad discussion of the energy relationship. United States delegates noted the growing
shortage of energy sources in the continental United
States, while Canadian representatives observed that
under any conceivable Canadian policy existing
reserves in Canada would not permit the export to the
United States of oi and natural gas in sufficient quantities substantially to satisfy United States future
needs.
"In connection with the question of the possible
shipment of oil from Alaska, United States representatives described recent United States legislation
establishing shipping safety standards, the special

design features being built into the tankers for this
route, and the possibility of developing satellite computerized shipping controls analogous to modern airline guidance systems. It was agreed that in situations
of this kind, it was essential that the two governments
should consult closely and take account of the effect
of any proposed actions by one country on the other.
"The foreign ownership question was also briefly
considered. Canadian representatives gave their
several opinions on the subject. United States delegates expressed the hope that Canadian legislation
would not have a disoriminatory character which
would cause resentment in the United States and
affirmed that they respected absolutely the right of
the Canadian Government to take any decisions
which they wished to affecting the terms and conditions for investment by non-residents in Canada.
"In the course of discussion on pollution control and
abatement problems, there was general agreement
that the 'in-house' staff of the respective sections of
the International Joint Commission should be
strengthened. There was also some support for a
proposal that a joint regional office of the International Joint Commission should be established with its
own staff and with power to report directly to the two
governments regarding the effectiveness of pollution
abatement programs in the lower Great Lakes."
The Committee on Defence and Security Matters was
co-chaired by Representative . Gallagher and Speaker
Lamoureux. Senators Aiken, Cooper, Cook and Stafford,
and Representatives Randall, Stratton, Pepper, Morse and
Smith were representing the United States Congress. Sitting on the Canadian side were Senator O'Leary, and
from the House of Commons, Messrs. Baldwin, Brewin,
Carter, Honey, Nowlan, Stafford, Tétrault and Yewchuk.
Report of Committee IL: Defence and Security Matters
"After a brief description of the main features of
the Canadian aid program (approximately half a billion dollars for the fiscal year 1972-73 exclusive of any
military aid), the Canadian delegation expressed concern over the widening gap between rich and poor
countries, and stressed that no durable peace could be
expected as long as this gap persists.
"The Canadian delegation also expressed the view
that aid could be made more effective by a shift to
more labour-intensive projects and by relating the
overall terms and amount of aid to the development of
balanced trade between all nations.
"The Canadians also saw as important a decrease in
the ratio of military to economic aid.
"Both delegations recognized the increasing interest
in multi-lateral aid among recipient countries,
although it was suggested by some members of the
United States delegation that this form of development assistance should be considered more as a type
of international banking transaction.
"The United States delegation also noted that the
Congress has taken a first effective step towards separating military and economic assistance by authorizing the first for one year and the second for two years.
"The United States delegation informed its Canadian colleagues that considerable disillusionment has
manifested itself in both Houses of Congress with
regard to aid as a means of winning friends, although

SENATE DEBATES

it was clear that such aid had generally proven successful so far as a means of achieving relative peace
and stability, if not friendship, and that it was likely to
continue getting adequate support on these as well as
on humanitarian grounds.
"Both delegations agreed that bilateral aid does not
always yield its intended economic results because of
the extreme difficulty on the part of the donor country on retaining an adequate measure of guidance or
control over the implementation of economic assistance programs. As an example of this, a member of
the United States delegation cited the Alliance for
Progress where lack of control has led to waste and
where attempts to keep a guiding hand in development resulted in political resentment.
"Both sides agreed with the view of a member of the
United States delegation that the political, social and
cultural dimensions of development are as important
as its economic dimensions, and that a prerequisite of
effective aid is a proper understanding of existing
social, cultural and political infrastructures in recipient countries-an example of this being the rejection
by the World Bank under purely western economic
criteria of the Tanzania-Zambia railway project, and
its subsequent takeover by the People's Republic of
China in the light of largely local, social and political
factors.
"On the matter of European security, both sides
agreed that the basic principle behind NATO was to
foster a climate enabling détente to take place; that
Canada's small physical participation was nevertheless one of the main psychological buttresses of the
Organization; and that any Canadian trend toward
disengagement would be likely to spark similar
demands in the United States, thereby seriously
threatening the Organization's potential.
"It was noted however, by both delegations, that as
Europe grows closer and stronger and stands out
more and more by itself as a force for the preservation of freedom, this tends gradually to relieve the
Organization's non-European members of part of
their share of the collective defence burden.
"The political implications of the enlargement of the
European Economic Community were also discussed.
A majority of delegates from both sides felt that Britain's entry was now a foregone conclusion in spite of
the recent tight vote at Westminster on the principle of
entry. One Canadian delegate cautioned, however,
that a clause by clause study in the British House of
Commons might result in rejection of some of the
terms of entry. In any event, it was thought by both
sides that the United States and Canada should start
considering what trade re-alignments, particularly in
the Western hemisphere, might be called for as a
result of Britain's entry in the EEC. This might take
the form of similar "common market" arrangements
within North America, or between all the Americas,
accompanied by a development of their trade potential with Pacific rim markets.
"In this connection, the Canadian delegation
observed that while such solutions obviously merited
some attention, their possible political implications
were likely to cause certain alarm among Canadian

public opinion, and that the present climate suggested
that this matter be approached with the utmost caution and discretion.
"On the subject of relations with Communist China,
a Canadian delegate pointed out that trade relations
had preceded recognition of Communist China by
some years. On the other hand, he noted that in the
case of France and Great Britain recognition had not
resulted in any increase in trade between. Communist
China and those countries. As another example, he
noted that the Soviet Union had had close relations
with Communist China and had extended that country large amounts of economic aid. Ideological difficulties had brought a setback in its trade with Communist China. These varied patterns point out the fact
that the Communist Chinese are very pragmatic in
their external relations. He concluded his remarks by
sketching the general character of Canadian credit
arrangements with Communist China.
"This expression of views led United States delegates to wonder if the Communist Chinese would ask
for credit and whether the granting of such credit
would result in causing new trading concerns to
Canada.
"One of the Canadian delegates then enumerated the
real and potential benefits that Canada enjoyed with
Communist China in addition to trade. Specifically,
he mentioned tourism, scientific exchange and the
expansion of trade in such items as machinery and
pulp and small motors. He also pointed out that the
consumer market in China was exceedingly small and
that that country encouraged self-reliance of its
people.
"A United States delegate raised the question of
what recognition of Communist China would do to
U.S. relations in the Pacific area, notably Korea,
Taiwan and Japan. He regarded consideration of this
situation as basic to any alterations in U.S. relations
with Communist China.
"On the question of India, Pakistan and Bangla
Desh, a Canadian delegate opened the discussion by
sketching briefly the situation between East and West
Pakistan and, as a result of a recent visit to that area,
noted the extent of the humanitarian problem which
has arisen from the conflict between the two wings of
Pakistan. The problems that still remain for Bangla
Desh are those of diplomatic relations, entrance into
the United Nations and other international agencies
and, finally, the refugee problem.
"The United States delegation agreed that the problems enumerated are basic by pointing out that in the
case of the United States there was some disillusionment arising from the inability of the United Nations
to move more effectively in resolving the conflict
between East and West Pakistan. Some United States
delegates also commented that this is only the most
recent divisive problem in the Asian sub-continent
and that there are possibilities of further political
re-arrangements as a result of the instability in that
area. By way of illustration, it was poinfed out that the
West Bengalese may be attracted to Bangla Desh. In
short, what we are envisaging here is perhaps the
beginning of long-tern alterations in South Asia."

Program
The United States delegation was greeted at the plane,
at Canadian Forces Base Uplands, at 6.30 P.M. on
Wednesday, February 16, 1972, by Mr. Speaker and Mrs.
Jean-Paul Deschatelets and Mr. Speaker and Mrs. Lucien
Lamoureux. The party then proceeded to the Officers
Mess at the Base, where the Canadian delegates entertained their United States colleagues prior to accompanying them to the Chateau Laurier Hotel.
Upon arrival at the hotel, all delegates and wives met at
an informal buffet dinner held in the Chateau Laurier
Drawing Room.
The following day, after attending the official opening
of the Fourteenth Meeting and the Opening of the Fourth
Session of the 28th Parliament, the United States delegates and their wives were the honoured guests at a luncheon given by Speaker Deschatelets and Speaker Lamoureux in the Confederation Room, West Block, Parliament
Buildings.
From the West Block, the United States delegation proceeded to Government House where, following a brief
tour of the Public Rooms, they were received by Their
Excellencies, the Governor General and Mrs. Michener. In
the evening, the Canadian Co-Chairmen again entertained
at a reception and dinner in honour of the United States
delegation at the Rideau Club.
On Friday morning, both Committees adjourned shortly
before eleven to allow the United States delegates to view
the Speaker's Parade and then proceed to the Speaker's
Gallery in the House of Commons, for formal recognition
from the Chair and Question Period.

Representatives.
"The delegation, led by Senator Frank Church and
Congressman Neil Gallagher, is in Ottawa to attend
the fourteenth annual meeting of the Canada-U.S.
Interparliamentary Group. I know it is the sense of
this House that over the years this group, this association, has made a valuable and indeed a positive and
significant contribution to the maintenance of cordial

"On behalf of all honourable members I extend to
our distinguished visitors and friends a most hearty
welcome and express the hope that their stay in
Canada will be interesting, enjoyable and fruitful.
"Some honourable Members: Hear, hear!"
Following this visit to the House and a zhort tour of the
Parliamentary Library, separate lunches were held by Mr.
Speaker Deschatelets and Mr. Speaker Lamoureux, in
their respective Chambers, the first for the United States
Senate delegates, the other for the United States House of
Representatives delegates.
Ladies Program
While their husbands were busy conducting business on
Friday, the wives of the delegates proceeded to the
National Gallery of Canada to see the Gallery's newly
acquired collection of 18th and 19th Century religious
articles from Quebec, and to attend an hour-long showing
of films by the National Film Board of Canada in the
National Gallery auditorium.
A scenic drive along the Ottawa parkway system followed, ending at the Green Valley Restaurant where
Madame Jean-Paul Deschatelets and Madame Lucien
Lamoureux entertained at a luncheon in honour of the
visiting wives.
Immediately after lunch, the ladies had a few moments
in the Green Valley Gift Shop before boarding their bus
for Montebello, Quebec, where they were joined by their
husbands at the conclusion of the afternoon Committee
meetings.
Montebello
On Friday evening, both delegations were entertained at
a reception, at the Château Montebello, by His Excellency,
the Honourable Adolph Schmidt, United States Ambassador to Canada.
While the last Committee meetings were in progress on
Saturday morning, the ladies had an opportunity toivisit
the Louis-Joseph Papineau Manor House on the grounds
of the Château Montebello, after which they joined their
husbands at a lunch given by the Canadian delegation in
honour of the United States delegation at the hotel.
Both Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning were
free, with all participants taking full advantage of the
various recreational activities that were offered: sleighrides, snow-mobiling, skiing, skating, toboganning, swimming or watching the Curling Bonspiel which was taking
place at the Château Montebello that weekend.
A raging blizzard on Saturday prevented a Toronto
light-rock and folk singing group, the Stampeders, from
reaching the Château Montebello, where they were to
provide post-dinner entertainment at the buffet dinner
held that evening in the hotel ballroom in honour of the
United States delegation. A dance and dinner music
group from Ottawa did make it, however, and served the
guests a wide variety of mood and dance selections well
into the night. In the absence of the Stampeders, the
evening's proceedings were interrupted at coffee time for
a spirited two-hour round of curling on the Château Mon-

Ballroom.
Saturday's storm also prevented a group of strolling
troubadours from leaving Montreal Sunday morning to
entertain at the farewell luncheon held that day in the
hotel by the Canadian delegation, in honour of the departing U.S. delegates. The previous evening's dance group,
which had conveniently been prevented from leaving
Montebello by the same storm, was therefore held over to
stand in for the stranded Montreal group.

Immediately after lunch both delegations boarded
buses for the trip to Canadian Forces Base, Uplands,
where the Canadian Co-Chairmnen and delegates waved
good-bye to their United States colleagues, as they departed for Washington, under a minus 40 degree chili factor.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the

opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Buckwold, seconded by Hon. Miss Lapointe, for an address in
reply thereto.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, I wish to
congratulate the mover of this motion, Senator Sydney L.
Buckwold, and the seconder, Senator Renaude Lapointe. I
feel that they did an excellent job with an insufficient
subject matter, and that is their privilege.
I will not discuss the entire Speech from the Throne,
which the Leader of the Government did in a very efficient manner, but I should like to discuss a subject which
has affected Canada during the last 12 to 18 months. I
refer to the series of strikes-rotating strikes, slow-down
strikes, and so-called study sessions-which have affected
essential public services in this country. It must be clearly
understood that my remarks apply only to essential services under federal jurisdiction, and I shall attempt to
define those services later.
0 (1410)

Before I proceed I want it to be strictly known that I am
not a labour expert, as are some members of this chamber. The suggestions I offer are meant for the protection
of the innocent public, who are not involved in and should
not suffer from strikes, slow-downs, study sessions or
obstructive tactics employed by union members of essential services. I should like also to indicate that my suggestions are premised on the fact that both sides to an agreement will bargain or negotiate in good faith. I will come to
that later.
My suggestion would be to amend appropriate federal
legislation to include as federal public servants the
employees of certain essential services. A quick glance
would include the RCMP, penitentiary guards, ship pilots,
harbour masters, employees of airlines and supporting
services, of rail systems and supporting services, and all

telephone, telegraph, radio, television and postal
employees.
When I mention time, either weeks or months, it is
entirely flexible, but I would suggest that two months
before the expiry of a contract each party would inform
the other of whatever changes the union or the employer
wanted. This would avoid what has happened in the air
controllers strike. The union presented their plans to the
Treasury Board, which did not make a counter offer. It
was not made until the union president announced to the
public what they were asking.
This discussion would continue during a time which I
would term a talking period. Should a solution agreeable
to both sides not be found, a conciliation officer would be

appointed. I mention this talking period because in many
contracts certain subjects are acceptable to both sides.
This includes interpretation of contract terms or certain
aspects which are not subject to strike. This conciliation
officer would then attempt to negotiate a settlement
between the two parties. If that failed, which I do not
think would happen in many cases, a board of arbitration
would be appointed, one member by the union and one by
the employer which, in this case, is the federal government or its arm. The federal Minister of Labour would
appoint a chairman if the two parties failed to appoint a
neutral chairman. Discussion would then continue on
major issues in dispute.
At that point, whether it is after two or three months or
two or three weeks-time is not important in this casebinding arbitration would take effect. During the discussion period, from two months prior to expiration of the
contract and during the period of conciliation and arbitration, no strike, slow-down, or rotating strikes would be

held, and any award granted would be retroactive to the
expiry date of the previous contract. If this procedure

were followed, innocent people would not be faced with
chaos or loss of revenue.
One might say that airlines are not essential. That might
be true. We still have railroads, trucks, cars and buses.
However, let us consider the supporting services. Forget
for a moment the $1 million per day that Air Canada lost
in the recent strike. But what about the suppliers of food
and gasoline, airport taxi operators, and travel agents? A
travel agency might have arranged a trip from, say, Win-

nipeg to London, England, via Montreal or some other
point. Then the strike takes place and difficulty is encountered with each leg of the journey, and hotel accommodation is lost, and so on. When this happens the travel agents
have to try to make alternative arrangements to the satisfaction of their customers. This creates many problems
and often results in cancellations.
Furthermore, in Canada our mail goes by air. A letter
posted in Ottawa on Monday reaches me at home in
Winnipeg on Tuesday. During the air strike my mail was
delayed one day and sometimes mort. It is true that we
can live with that kind of service, but why should one
small group of union members-approximately 2,200 in
the case of the air traffic controllers-be allowed to completely disrupt airline service?
A week later, after binding legislation saw the air traffic
controllers back on the job, we were faced with a strike by
a group of electrical workers. They have not stopped the

SENATE DEBATES

airlines from operating, but they have caused delay, confusion and chaos. Pilotage and harbour facilities have
also been affected by this strike. Some of these technicians hold essential positions. In many cities these men
have stayed on the job, but in several cities they have quit.
What is likely to be the effect of this?
0 (1420)

One effect of this airport slow-down or strike, whatever
you wish to call it, is that the hotels, at least in my city, are
running 25 to 30 per cent occupancy. Winnipeg is not the
biggest city in the country but it is an important one. This
strike is causing loss to innocent people, companies and
corporations. Now, if this suggestion is taken up and we
have this arbitrary solution, what would be an effective
penalty? How would we force people back to work? There
has to be something in our legislation or in labour agreements which makes it difficult for a small group of
individuals to adversely affect federal services. Honourable senators, I feel it is high time that the government of
this country took notice to this effect.
Hon. Edward M. Lawson: Honourable senators, I think
the remarks by my honourable friend Senator Haig warrant some comment from me, so that we do not indulge in
the very dangerous practice of oversimplifying the problem and trying to oversimplify the solution.
Senator Haig suggests that the proposal he outlines, and
I think he sincerely puts it forth, would eliminate the
possibility of disputes such as we now have with the
electronic technicians. In my experience, that would
simply change it from a legal strike to an illegal strike.
The federal government, through legislation, granted
the federal civil servant the right to strike, and it appears
now to be conditional on them never exercising that right.
If you measure the record of federal legislation since its
enactment with its option to opt for binding arbitration on
a voluntary basis, and that is the key word, or opting for
the right to strike, the record of federal civil servants
exercising those options, and more particularly, the right
to strike, is a record, I think, probably better than exists
anywhere in North America and perhaps in any other
country.
The easy solution seems to be that we must go to binding arbitration in order to solve labour-management conflicts, and we will live happily ever after. Well, Australia
went to binding arbitration; they adopted that instant
solution to all labour-management problems, but unfortunately the record shows that the number of man-days per
capita lost under the Australian system is higher than is
the case in Canada or in the United States. In other words,
binding arbitration as a solution is not the instant answer
or the instant cure-all that eliminates all labour-management conflicts. It has, in fact, proven to be an ineffective
vehicle.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: No one has suggested that it was
the instant solution.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I am suggesting it will not work.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Mr. Meany suggests that it might work
and he hopes it will work.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I should like to deal with that as we go

along.
[Hon. Mr. Haig.]

March 1, 1972

Hon. Mr. Walker: Well, let us hear you.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: It has been suggested that we model
the Canadian system after the Swedish system because
they do not have all these conflicts. Sweden has a system
of binding arbitration and it worked very well for many,
many years. However, we have to compare apples with
apples. The Swedish system has about 95 per cent of the
blue collar workers organized and about 75 to 80 per cent
of the white collar workers organized. So, you have this
heavy concentration of an organized work force resulting
in a strong central body with some authority to influence
trade unions. This was an effective system until it developed a few flaws. I heard a Swedish expert in labour
relations remark, "There is a snake in every paradise.
Even under our system we pay a price." Well, the rate of
inflation in Sweden is running about ten per cent a year,
so we now find that the Swedish system is not such a
model one after all.
There is no simple, easy, magic solution to solve these
problems. I have experienced the discomfort of the air
strike perhaps as much as anybody because of the distance I travel. The solution is not to take away from that
group of workers the right to strike. I think it is time for
the federal government to consider that they granted by
legislation the right to strike, to inquire what the experience has been and how the situation can be improved.
As a trade unionist, I always become concerned about
the image of trade unions when one small group strikes
and settles, everything is back to normal, but a couple of
weeks later another small group strikes, with the same
inconvenience. In this area there is some resistance from
the labour movement, but I think we could justify the
federal government, through the Department of Labour,
saying they would issue fewer certificates and more multiple union bargaining certificates. Perhaps there could be
one for the unions on the ground and another for those in
the air in order to avoid the repetitive situation of strike
settlement by one group being followed by a strike of
another group a week later. It could be dealt with on the
basis of multi-union bargaining, with one set of negotiations, so that if the industry was going down it would go
down as a whole.
We have had experience in the shipyards of British
Columbia whereby of twelve unions bargaining together
eleven would agree, but the twelfth would want ten cents
an hour more, and the whole thing closes down on strike.
That was solved in British Columbia by the co-operation
of the unions and legislation, so that now there is one
bargaining certificate for all unions, and they stand by a
majority decision. It has been very effective in solving the
problem. That is the type of area we need to examine.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Was that arrangement between the different unions achieved by agreement
or as a result of legislative action in British Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Lawson: It was a fair combination of both. The
eleven unions who agreed were so upset with the twelfth,
which was always holding out, that they proposed to the
provincial government that the certificate be imposed on
all of them. In response to the request of the unions, the
provincial government imposed it on all and it solved the
problem.

March 1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Most jurisdictions have a provision whereby there are
two, three or four months in which to make submissions
for changes. We developed a system whereby a mediator
was involved from the first day; the parties would try to
resolve the issues, and if after a certain period any were
outstanding the mediator became the arbitrator and made
a binding decision on the outstanding issues. There was a
30-day time lirit within which the parties could vary the
arbitrators decision, but if it was not varied within the
30-day period the decision became binding. That type of
systern will work, not with imposed arbitration but where
there is voluntary consent of the parties to have that type
of formula, and where the parties agree to accept that
type of mediation.
There is one tendency that concerns me in Canada, in
both provincial and federal jurisdictions. A dispute we
can see developing is allowed to happen and continue for
a number of weeks, causing considerable irritation and
inconvenience, and then someone blows the whistle and
we send for our colleague Senator Goldenberg, or somebody of his calibre, to attempt to mediate a settlement at
that stage.
* (1430)

I have often said that we would be better off to have a
stable of competent mediators who would be instantly
available and become involved from Day One, not after
we have suffered all the inconvenience for 30 or 60 days.
We should have people of the calibre of the Goldenbergs,
people who have been involved, who have a successful
record, who have the reputation that breeds confidence
among the parties concerned. They should be involved at
the outset, not after it has gone on for a period of time.
I propose that we have a number of these people and
that they should be paid $40,000 or $50,000 a year. I know
that some would raise their voices and say that this would
be a terrible price to have to pay. But when you measure
their cost against the hundreds of thousands of dollars
wasted, they would be worth it-even if they were able to
settle one dispute.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: That is practically the only position
that this government bas forgotten to open.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I think they should open it. I am not
projecting anyone to the position and I am not taking
political sides, but with the amount of waste involved in
national industrial disputes we could still afford to pay
these mediators handsomely. After a period of time they
would develop an expertise in settling disputes and, even
more important, the parties involved would develop confidence in those particular individuals. If a dispute
occurred in some major industry, in the pulp and paper
industry or in the airlines, they could send for Senator
Haig or some mediator who has the confidence of the
parties, and he would come in right from Day One and
assist the parties to resolve their dispute.
In my experience I have found that most major disputes, except where new groups are being organized, are
rarely caused by the economics of the situation. There are
particular problems and anomalies which occur through
the life of a contract and the employees are waiting for
the negotiation time to get even, when all these differences will be taken care of. The only other thing would be
to have an agreed arbitrator or arbitrators solve these

little grievances and problems during the life of the
contract.
I have given some illustrations of what collectively lead
into strike conditions and what can be offset by eliminating other multi-problems. In my own organization we
have collective bargaining with the dairy industry. We are
now in our fifty-third year of collective bargaining, without a single man-day having been lost as a result of a
strike or a walkout. Surely Parliament is not going to
impose legislation on that body? They have an enviable
record of good contracts and good working conditions.
They have developed their own system to resolve any
differences.
Unfortunately, there are people who have some influence in these matters, and they say that it is a healthy
situation to have a major strike from time to time. I recall
that when there was a major strike by the auto workers in
the United States I voiced my concern about the waste of
millions of dollars, the salaries being lost, and so on. I was
told by some American economic experts that this was
healthy for the United States economy, that this strike in
auto production had a healthy, deflationary effect on their
economy.
But we have to be careful if we urge the solution of
labour disputes by arbitration. If we take away from
trade unions the right to strike, we may then have to take
one step further and consider total control of prices and
profits, of interest rates and all things which flow from
that. Then one is really talking about yet another step, one
that would lead us to the type of controlled society we are
not really too keen on. All I am urging is a note of caution,
not to move too quickly.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You do not have to worry about that
with this government; they will not move too quickly.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: Perhaps we could speed them along
the way by offering some constructive suggestions. I have
always found a great willingness on the part of ministers,
in the areas I have dealt in, to respond to constructive
suggestions. Perhaps I have not been giving enough of
them.
Trade unions have to be concerned when there is a
strike. They look at it as a two-party conflict, their side
and the other side. It seems to me that every conflict
involves us. As a transportation union, we are involved
with everyone else. We cannot avoid that, because there is
some contact with the community as a whole. We can no
longer say that we are preserving and exercising our
rights, especially if we are doing it at the expense of
others. We have to concern ourselves as trade unionists
that in the exercise of our rights we are not injuring the
rights of others, or perhaps we will have this great wave
of legislation, which will not solve the problem, coming
down upon us and we will have deserved it.
I think it is healthy to have constructive proposals. As
Senator Haig says, there is some merit in having the
proposal so long as we do not go too far.
Hon. Mr. Walker: If my friend would be good enough to
answer the question he said he would answer, what is his
view as to the attitude of that great labour leader, Mr.
Meany, and also what is his view of the striking power

SENATE DEBATES

which the people have indulged in so often in the essential
services?
Hon. Mr. Lawson: It is difficult to commentHon. Mr. Walker: Not a bit.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: It is difficult to comment on Mr.
Meany.
Hon. Mr. Walker: You said you would.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: And so I will. I will be very happy to.
Mr. Meany is not my favourite labour leader. However, I
think there is merit in his statement that a method must
be found to minimize the impact of strikes. I can go so far
as to agree with that part of Mr. Meany's proposition
about voluntary arbitration, where the parties consent. I
do not agree with that part about binding arbitration
being imposed, which is said that Mr. Meany suggested,
although I am not sure that he did.
On a voluntary basis I think it has considerable merit.
On the question of strikes and the damage they do, I am
already on public record. Before Mr. Meany thought it
was politically wise to make a similar statement, I went on
public record to say that a strike on the part of trade
unions is nothing more than a public declaration that we
are not intelligent enough, mature enough or reasonable
enough to resolve our differences. I make no apology for
taking that position.
But while saying that, it is not easy to find a simple
solution that could apply generally to the question of
withdrawing from essential services; nevertheless, if you
give the right to strike, you give with it the right to
exercise it. The legislature saw fit to give to the federal
unions the right to strike. They did it, one would think,
with the full knowledge that some of those groups would
exercise the right and that if they did it would cause some
disruption in the economy and it would cause some concern, some loss of revenue and all of these things. They
must have been aware of that when they granted that
right. If they did not intend for it to happen, then they
should have been less hasty in granting that right.
I am not suggesting they were hasty. I think it was a
wise decision on the part of the federal government to
grant bargaining rights to federal civil servants, including
the right to strike. The record, as I said at the outset,
justifies that position.
I know that in British Columbia our premier has never
seen fit to grant bargaining rights to civil servants. His
position is that civil servants have a duty to perform and
should not be given the right to strike, and that the government as a whole is an essential service. Therefore, for
those collective reasons, he has not given the civil servants
the right to bargain collectively or the right to strike. He
has not even gone so far as to grant binding arbitration.
But it is just a matter of time until he will have a strike on
his hands. Perhaps not this year or next year but in two or
three years, without any legislation and because these
people have been told that they have not the right to
strike, and because they have not even been given the
right to binding arbitration, which they are prepared to
settle for now, the Premier of British Columbia will have
a strike on his hands-perhaps an illegal strike, since
there is no legislation covering it.
[Hon. Mr. Walker.]

March 1, 1972

Surely this would have been a fine opportunity to say to
those people, "You now are willing to settle for binding
arbitration. We will give it to you and we will solve it in
that way." But here you have a provincial jurisdiction
refusing to go even that far, and it is going to be faced
with a strike.
The question of essential services is a matter of definition. I believe Senator Haig raised the question of whether
the airlines comprised an essential service. Well, I think
you could argue both sides of that. I would be prepared to
argue that with the change from a railroad philosophy for
cross-country travel to an airline philosophy, a strong
case could be made for the airlines being an essential
service. Certainly, a few weeks ago at the opening of
Parliament there could have been a shocking predicament
had the airlines totally shut down, because nobody would
have been able to get to either house to talk about legislation or peoples rights and concerns, and nobody would
have been present to make decisions. Surely, with that
type of situation, one could make a case of the airlines
being an essential service.
On the other side you have people arguing that the
airlines are not an essential service because we still have
the railroad lines, automobiles and these other modes of
travel. There have been too many cases of that sort of
thing in both our history and the history of the United
States-particularly in the American history. You may
recall that they had a major shutdown of airlines in the
United States. Air transport had been classified as an
essential service, but the nation was able to function with
minor irritations and so the conclusion was reached that
after all it was not an essential service.
0 (1440)

The most recent example was the waterfront shut-down
which went on for so many days and which affected the
country so adversely. On the one hand you could say that
it was an essential service, but since the country continued to function you could, on the other hand, say that it
was not an essential service. I think we have to go beyond
these particular definitions. The trade unions have to
extend their viewpoint beyond that. We have seen the
effect of that waterfront shut-down on exports to other
countries, and I feel that this question of the ability of a
country to engage in foreign exports is something that the
trade unions should be aware of.
There is also the consideration of our ability to receive
incoming materials. We have to consider the other effects
as well. I know that the reputation of Vancouver as a
reliable port was adversely affected with the shutdown on
the British Columbia waterfront. Fortunately, as a result
of the longshoremen's strike in the United States-and I
suppose this is an example of the statement that in every
evil one can find some good-the reputation of other ports
has become so bad that shipping is now returning to
Vancouver. We have to look upon this situation as involving something more important than the dispute of one
trade union, or one local of a union or one group of
industry or management. We have to find another forum
where we can all sit down and concern ourselves about
the rights of the workers, the rights of the particular
industry, the concerns of government and our reputation
throughout the world. We have to concern ourselves about

March 1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

our abilities to import and to make deliveries on time. All
of these things will have to be part of the consideration
given to the situation.
So, honourable senators, I hope I have -answered the
question asked. I agree with some parts of it, but with
other parts I do not agree.
Hon. Paul Dearuisseaux: Honourable senators, in my
speech today it was my intention to discuss this question
but from a different angle. I appreciate what has been
said by Senator Haig and Senator Lawson. They touched
on particular points, and in my remarks I shall try to
place myself in the position of the Canadian layman.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, I subscribe to the remarks and
congratulations addressed by the speakers who took part
in the debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from
the Throne to our genial Speaker, the Honourable JeanPaul Deschatelets, to the Government Leader in the
Senate, the Honourable Paul Martin, and to the leader of
the Opposition in this chamber, the Honourable Jacques
Flynn.
I also add my congratulations to those who have spoken
before me during the debate, namely, Senators Buckwold,
Lapointe, Flynn, Martin, Michaud, Eudes, Williams, Haig
and Lawson.
For my part, I should like to be as brief as possible and
limit myself to comments which I consider to be important as they bear on certain specific points.
[English]
Today I want to mention a few points concerning unemployment, the announced introduction of legislation in
connection with the Canadian Labour Code, the
rumoured policies of the government with respect to foreign control of Canadian industry, and the role of the
Senate. Not forgetting what has been happening in many
other countries, and being quite aware of the efforts of
the Canadian Government to remedy the situation in the
best possible way and the fact that many new jobs have
actually been provided for Canadians, the high level of
unemployment in Canada still is the shame of this nation
and a challenge to our governments, provincial and federal. It still exists in spite of governmental efforts to reduce
its present dangerous level. I believe it is wrong to say that
there must be an available labour force reserve for our
labour markets. It has become evident that much more
must be done to combat unemployment effectively and
permanently. I, for one, question the value of the temporary measures because they are in many cases too indirect, too unstable, and offer little in the way of a permanent solution. What is necessary, it seems to me, is the
assurance of steady work providing decent wages, that
will by itself steer the economy of the nation and provide
the necessary incentives for the economic development in
Canada, which is also a better way of providing more tax
revenues to the governments to meet their present needs.
The labour-management situation in Canada is in my
view a real mess. There is unnecessary chaos and hardship caused to the general public by the rash of strikes
taking place in Canada. Recently the air traffic controllers strike hurt the public economically and socially. This
strike should never have occurred, as its settlement

proved. Then we had the air technicians strike which
lasted some 20 days. It affected the economy, and was at
the point of creating unparallelled transportation chaos
for most of our citizens. We must ask ourselves if these
strikes created a fair situation for the public of Canada,
and if they are to be permissible in the future. Other
strikes affecting the welfare of the Canadian public are
now being organized to follow those which have just
ended. If all future labour contracts are to run for periods
of 24 months or less, the public must of necessity be
resigned to constant possible recurrences of this chaos
every few months. Is this a fair and acceptable situation
for Canadians?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is accepted by the government
anyway.
* (1450)

Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I do not accept it.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am aware of that, and neither do I
accept it.

Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I feel the public will not accept
it either, and I do not think the government is solely to
blame.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If you do not think so you should not
say so. From your remarks I feel you meant to blame the
government, and you should not be afraid to do that.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I blame the government only in
respect of the ways in which the laws can be improved,
and I intended to state that. Now and again, it is quite
usual to hear these comments. We criticize one side or the
other, and I feel this is quite admissible. If the general
public is asked I feel they will also indicate this.
In Quebec we have had strikes of policemen, firemen,
airline workers, postal workers, prison guards, teachers,
dock workers, hospital workers, telephone operators, and
CBC radio and television workers, and many strikes in
industrial plants within just a few months. Is this acceptable to the public taxpayer whom we represent in
government?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Do you mean in Parliament?
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I shall continue. You are better
able to criticize along these lines than I. In any event, I do
not choose to do so.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am not criticizing. I amrnmerely changing a word.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It must be the election fever.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Who is talking about election fever?
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I have stated this and I am
speaking as a Can'adian at this time.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am also. I am merely suggesting that
"parliament" and "government" are two different terms.
They are not the same.
Hon. Mr. Denruisseaux: Well, if the other side does not
speak loudly enough, perhaps they should.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is the point I am endeavouring to
make also.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: All the Quebec civil servants,
and all welfare department employees, hospital

SENATE DEBATES

employees, school personnel, hydro employees, and liquor
board employees, under the guidance and co-ordination
of three labour leaders, are planning a simultaneous
strike in March. This will involve about 250,000 public
service employees in the Province of Quebec. Is this a fair
treatment of the citizens who will suffer? Is this acceptable as a new way of life in our day? Is this even necessary for the workers?
In a land committed to ensuring law and order, must we
tolerate to an ever increasing degree illegal slowdowns of
work and study sessions which force the hand of the other
side, sabotage and destruction of public and private property in an endeavour to demonstrate to management a
capacity to go further, criminal assaults, illegal picketing,
defiance of court orders, lockouts, and the firing of union
activist employees. There is no longer law and order in the
field of labour management relations, and there must be a
full reconsideration of all its aspects. It is a wonder that
we have been able to maintain economic stability through
all of this.
There is growing public concern about these situations.
There is general uneasiness about the hesitancy of our
representatives in government to deal with these problems in a straightforward fashion because of their fear of
pressure and political embarrassment. Is this a fair attitude? There is mounting public indignation at the attitude
of the federal and provincial governments which avoid
considering the right to strike in certain public areas. So
far, too many in governments and political parties have
disregarded their real duties and have not taken into
account the rights of individual Canadians. They have not
given priority consideration where it appeared to be due.
In my view, too many of the present labour laws, both
provincial and federal, are archaic, obsolete, ineffective
and in some cases, unfortunately, they serve against the
best interests of both labour and management, and most
assuredly they serve against the best interests of the
Canadian public.
I do not wish to cite as the perfect example what was
done in the United States in an endeavour to correct
similar situations, but in that country there exist certain
laws to curtail the wholesale abuse of the public. The
Taft-Hartley Act can be invoked to stop certain strikes for
a certain period of time. Such a law does not exist here. It
was enacted in the United States because tens of thousands of people who had no part in the disputes were
suffering needlessly. This type of law has been found now
to be ineffective. The President of the United States has
been trying for the last two years to impress upon Congress the need for new legislation in this field. What is
being proposed now is a three-member arbitration board,
appointed by the Department of Labour, to hear all the
issues and present a settlement which would be binding
on management and union for a period of at least 18
months. No strike or lockout would be allowed from the
day the legislation was enacted. Canada should examine
such legislation more closely because of what is happening here.
In Quebec the provincial government may very soon
have no alternative, in avoiding a general breakdown, but
[Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux.]

March 1, 1972

to declare strikes illegal. This is indicated by the
rumoured general strike of public servants in Quebec
sometime in early March.

(1500)

We have in Canada a complex system created by the
Constitution which gives similar powers in respect of
labour to the federal and provincial governments as it
does in other fields, which may necessitate special
arrangements at times. This complex distribution of
labour powers should now be re-examined. The present
laws do not sufficiently take into account the rights of
individual Canadians who lose because of the striking
attitudes of labour, or the lockout attitudes
of
management.
In some cases the present laws appear to be somewhat
influenced by pressure groups, party votes, and party
politics. In my opinion, some of these labour laws are so
contrary to the best interests of the general public that
they call for immediate changes and basic amendment.
This is an area in which the Senate could do much to
help demonstrate and clarify the haze and confusion
which exist whenever there is a discussion of labour laws
in connection with public rights. It is an area wherein the
recommendations of a Senate committee could help settle
intelligently some of our major labour problems.
I do not wish to take political sides. I believe I am
stating the case of Mr. Canadian, who has transcendent
rights which should not be buried, as they are, in secondary considerations. Without wishing to abuse the facilities
of the Senate committees, I suggest strongly that the
Senate should constitute a special committee to carry out
a broad study of labour-management problems. Such a
committee could attempt to arrive at an acceptable formula to reduce the number of strikes, hardships, and
displays of violence which occur in our labour disputes. It
could formulate a just approach to all these problems,
which would provide the government, the workers, and
management a fair basis for faster and longer settlements. I can visualize such a committee comprised, for
instance, of Senators Goldenberg, Lawson, Forsey,
Giguère, and others who are experienced in labour-management relations. There are still others who are
experienced in all areas of industrial, financial, and commercial management. As I look around this chamber I see
many other honourable senators who have had direct
experience in the civil service and government labour
relations. The combining of their experience in an attack
on these problems would, I believe, serve Canada well. I
am sure the services rendered would be of the highest
importance to our citizens.
I believe also that only the Senate can conduct such a
study to the satisfaction of all, because its members are
not elected and have no fear of group pressures. The
findings of such a committee could have greater value
and more effective results than those of a royal commission, because of the diversified qualifications and experience in this field of its members.
I do not consider strikes and violence to be at all necessary for the settlement of disputes and differences
between labour and management. The present methods
are, in my opinion, passé. This is the thinking of a great
many Canadians and of Mr. Meany, President of the

March 1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

American Federation of Labour to which are tied many
Canadian unions. It is the thinking of a surprising number
of unionists, who are the direct and immediate sufferers
from all the consequences of our archaic ways. A trade
union recently founded in British Columbia now includes
in its constitution a provision that its members will never
strike, although this position is opposed by old-line unionists. I refer honourable senators to page 6 of Canada
Month of January 1972.
A growing number of Canadians now question whether
the strike weapon in the hands of key public servants is
justifiable. The recommendations of such a Senate committee as I have suggested could be used as the basis for
amending legislation, and for creating modern labourcapital legislation which would bring peace and tranquility to relations between governments, management and
labour. This would assure improved productivity which
would further the expansion of our trade and commerce
outside Canada on competitive terms, and give the public
a well-deserved and well-earned period of stability.
The findings of such a committee would also be of great
help to the individual provinces in establishing a uniform
consideration of the problems. It would also assist in their
consideration of appropriate corrective legislation.
I wish to make only one or two further observations. No
nation has helped more than the United States to make
Canada, which had the human energy and natural
resources, what it is today-one of the most desirable
places in which to live in the world.
I have failed to find clarification in the Throne Speech
of policies regarding foreign investment in Canada,
foreign-owned companies, and foreign control of Canadian companies. It is the understanding, and I rely on the
words of the Leader of the Opposition given in the Senate
recently that we are now in a pre-election session. 1
understand some of the political arguments and reservations on policies in respect to such a subject in such
circumstances. I am, however, of the opinion that Parliament would better serve Canadians by discussing now an
important and consequential issue before it goes to the
people through one-sided political platform approaches.
Disregarding political considerations and political
embarrassments, I believe the public is entitled to hear
the views expressed and discussed by Parliament on any
issue of far-reaching importance, in which questions of
foreign investment and foreign control should be
included.
* (1510)

We have done well with our exports, particularly over
the past decade. Credit for this outstanding success,
despite all that has been said, lies with the policies and the
direct assistance of the government. Let us not forget that
fact. That success is due also in great part to our multinational corporations which have developed worldwide
market facilities for the sale and distribution of products
manufactured in Canada. Were there any hesitation in
stating clearly the government's policy, or if restrictions
were placed by the government on the presence of multinational corporations in Canada, our favourable export
trade position would change rapidly for the worse, and
our favourable trade balance would be reduced to a con-

59

tinuous series of unfavourable results which would greatly tax the economy and diminish the pace of our progress.
On January 1, 1972, Business Week published figures
about Canada, some of which were recently quoted by the
Leader of the Government. In 1971, according to the best
estimates, Canada experienced a rise in prices of 3.8 per
cent, representing the lowest rise among 12 of the most
important trading nations. By comparison, in Japan the
rise was 4.6 per cent; in France, 4.3 per cent; in Great
Britain, 9 per cent; and in Sweden-that much publicized
state which, with all its present difficulties, is now on the
brink of a deep economic depression-6 per cent. That
represents a commendable achievement for Canada.
Of the 12 trading countries analyzed, the 1971 percentages of real growth placed Canada in fourth position. This
again represents a remarkable achievement for a nation
of 22 million. In looking at the record of real growth
increase over the 10-year period from 1960 to 1970, it is
reassuring to see that Canada occupied third place in the
world for growth performance. Only Japan and Italy did
better. During that period we experienced a real growth
increase of 285 per cent, while that of the United States
was 111 per cent.
The policies of the government are not perfect and often
invite strong criticism. Indeed, I have freely criticized
them myself. However, the government is responsible for
much of the progress that we have enjoyed over the past
few years.
My reaction to what occurred last December in connection with the tax reform legislation is that the Senate
should never again forfeit its right of action granted by
the Constitution; it should exercise that liberty for as long
as the Constitution exists. The Senate should never again
act against its better judgment, as I believe it did in
rushing the passage of the tax reform legislation on
request and under pressure, even though it had studied
the bill for many months while the legislation was being
debated in the other place.
Those in authority responsible for the tax reform legislation ill-timed its presentation to the house, incorrectly
estimated the time necessary for full discussion of the
legislation, and did not take into account the role played
by the Senate in constitutional affairs. It is to our shame,
as members of this chamber, that we surrendered the
most elementary basic principles necessary if the Senate
is to function within the terms and spirit of the Constitution. I am sure that honourable senators share my view
that the incident will serve as a warning that nothing
similar must be allowed to occur again.
It is necessary to find solutions to several problems
other than those already mentioned, the most important
of which is ways and means of stimulating the Canadian
economy and reducing the present unacceptable level of
unemployment.
The Throne Speech has given rise to optimism in many
important fields. In general, I liked it for its indication of
what the government wishes to accomplish, and for the
peace and tranquillity it offered to all in the pursuit of
daring goals. With the co-operation of everyone, Canada
will experience an upsurge in its economy which will
bring greater benefits to all its citizens. It will be pleasant

SENATE DEBATES

to co-operate in attaining that ideal objective, whether or
not an election is forthcoming.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I should like to ask three or four
questions of Senator Desruisseaux. He mentioned a provision in the constitution and by-laws of a union in British
Columbia to the effect that it would never strike. Is that
union a hospital union in British Columbia?
0 (1520)

Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I made reference to Canada
Month of January 1972, at page 6. It is a union of hospital
employees.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: Are you aware that the person who
organized that union, and who is posing as the business
agent, is really a company lawyer by the name of Terrence Wolfe?
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: No, I am not.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: He is a company lawyer, and he is the
author of that document.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I read Canada Month and I was
prudent in quoting what I read. I requested those listening
to read it, and that is all I can do.
Hon. Mr. Walker: His name might have been Fox.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: You also made reference, senator, to
American legislation. Were you referring to the transportation bill proposed in the United States?
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: The legislation to which I
referred is now pending before the United States Congress. It has been held in abeyance for two years in spite
of the recommendation by the President that it be passed.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I have two other questions, senator.
You made reference to violence, and the breakdown in
law and order. Were you referring to a specific area?
Surely you were not referring to the whole country.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I do not feel I should have to
enumerate the different areas, senator, but if you wish
some examples I can give you quite a number.
What I said was that whenever there is a settlement all
charges are dropped, and there are no prosecutions.
Surely you have read accounts of what happened in
Quebec, or what has happened on the docks.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I am concerned, senator, that the
impression has been left by your presentation that this
violence, and breakdown of law and order, applies generally across Canada. There may have been some instances
of this in the Province of Quebec, but it has certainly been
at a minimum across the country. We have had strikes in
British Columbia, but when we strike we do so in the
spirit of love and understanding.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I must reply to that remark. I
am not letting you get away with that.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: We have seen trouble in the
Maritimes, in the central parts of Canada, and in the west,
but I would hesitate to put one against the other to point
out a specific area as being worse than another.
[Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux.1

March 1, 1972

Hon. Mr. Lawson: I raise this issue in all seriousness
because whenever acts of violence have taken place in
British Columbia, the individuals concerned, almost without exception, have been prosecuted according to law,
and prosecuted severely.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Like under Duplessis.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I have one further question, senator,
regarding your comments with respect to reviewing the
right to strike of public servants. Assuming that you were
able to take away that right to strike, what would you do
when the truck drivers refused to deliver the jet fuel?
How would you deal with that situation?
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: C'est une hypothèse. I have
simply tried to put before this chamber the facts, and I do
not think anything bas been denied. My only hope is that
we can do something about it. I am not taking sides, as I
said earlier. The privilege of organizing labour is an
important privilege, and I simply do not want us to lose
control over labour.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: Thank you, senator.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I am pleased that I
was not called out of order when I opened my remarks
concerning labour. This bas been a most interesting
debate, and tomorrow I think I will present a motion.
Hon. Frederick William Rowe: Honourable senators, I
regret I have to commence my first address in this historic
and honourable bouse with a small apology. As you all
know, I come from one of the more favoured parts of this
great country of ours where we have a fairly benign
climate. Indeed, it might be called a semi-tropical climate.
It takes some time to become climatized to the severe
Ottawa winters, and I am still suffering from this one. I
regret I am not able to speak to you as I would normally
want to.
I should like, first of all, to congratulate Senator Buckwold and Senator Lapointe for the very able, excellent,
and eloquent way in which they performed the important
tasks of moving and seconding the Address in Reply. I
congratulate also those honourable senators who have
spoken in this debate. I have not had an opportunity to
hear all of the speeches, but what I did hear were most
illuminating.
At the outset, in my first speech in this chamber, I wish
to express the great honour I feel as a result of being
summoned to this chamber. As a member of the Senate I
shall have an opportunity. I hope, of serving in some small
way my native province, and, to the best of my ability, the
country of which I am proud to be a part.
As a Newfoundlander and a newcomer, I pay my
respects to the distinguished Newfoundlanders who have
served and who are presently serving in this chamber.
The Province of Newfoundland has never lacked able and
dedicated representation in our nations capital, in either
this house or the other place. Our problems have been
heavy ones and, in some cases, unique ones. It was important, therefore, that Newfoundland's representatives be
insistent, articulate, and dedicated individuals. We have
been most fortunate in this respect, and continue to be so.
For example, if I may single out one individual, in the
person of the Honourable Donald Jamieson, Minister of

March 1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Transport in the present administration, Newfoundland
has a spokesman who surely must be numbered among
the ablest Canadians in public life today.
In my first speech I intend to devote myself to what I
feel are national problems, rather than provincial or local
problems per se. Some of the matters I intend to deal with
are highly controversial and, indeed, are problems which,
whenever they are under discussion, cause a reaction that
is likely to be emotional rather than intellectual. The
statement and recommendations I shall make will not be
made lightly. Perhaps I can best explain my position by
saying that as the father of four sons, all of whom are
relatively young men, and the grandfather of six children,
living not only in Newfoundland but also in the Province
of Quebec, I could not approach this problem lightly.
* (1530)

Finally in that regard I must say that the views I
express are entirely personal, and should not be construed as necessarily representing those of any group or
party with which I was or am now associated.
Honourable senators, I shall try to say a few words in
French, not to show that I know that language well,
because I do not. Unfortunately my knowledge of French
is mostly academic, derived from my study of that language for several years at university. My knowledge of
oral French is necessarily limited because of lack of
opportunities to practise it. However, I do want to express
my sincere interest in the cause of unity and fairness in
our country.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, I should like to say a few words
about bilingualism. Ninety-eight per cent of the population of Newfoundland is of English, Irish, Scottish or
Welsh origin. Therefore, I speak without serving a provincial interest and I see a united and growing Canada in
satisfactory terms.
I suggest that common sense, practical sense and morality above all require, if our Constitution is to be more than
a piece of paper, that we make every effort to ensure that
after a reasonable period of time, all Canadians will be
able to express themselves in either French or English. In
the light of what happens in many medium-size countries
of Europe, where people often use two or more languages
fluently, there can be no objection as to the practical
character or the cost of this objective.
If this is to happen, and it must be our deepest desire, it
is possible for most Canadians to be bilingual in twenty
years from now.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudière): Very good.
Hon. Mr. Howe: Thank you.
[English]
In case any of my English-speaking colleagues may not
have grasped all that I wanted to convey in my imperfect
French, I will paraphrase what I said in English. Ninetyeight per cent of our people in Newfoundland are
descended from English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh settlers. We do not locally, then, have any problem, if I may
use that word, in respect of bilingualism. English has
always been the one language there. In expressing my
views on this matter, therefore, I have no provincial axe to

grind, but I do have the desire to see Canada united and
growing in matters that really count.
I believe that common sense, common expediency and,
above all, common morality-if the Constitution is not
just a piece of paper-demand that we make every effort
to see to it that, within a reasonable lapse of time, every
Canadian will have a working knowledge of the English
and the French languages. In the light of what has happened in several smaller countries of Europe, where the
people are often proficient in even more than two languages, any objections on the grounds of practicality or of
cost are totally invalid. If we really want it to happen, if
we want Canada to be bilingual-and we should want that
to happen-in less than 20 years from now it is possible
for the great majority of Canadians to be bilingual.
I want to speak about youth. Youth has always tended
to be rebellious, more so in recent years than perhaps at
any time since the days of Socrates. This spirit of rebellion has manifested itself in extreme forms. We have seen
violence at our universities, some of it completely senseless and completely incomprehensible. We have seen our
young people adopt bizarre forms of personal behaviour,
bizarre ways of self-expression, and so on.

But I think we must keep a sense of proportion in this.
We must remind ourselves that those young people
responsible for the worst violence that has occurred in the
United States and, I am sad to say, here in Canada, or in
some of the universities of Europe-and I happened to be
in Paris during the period when there was some extreme
violence there-and those young people who exhibit
bizarre forms of self-expression, particularly those who
are so physically filthy as to be offensive to ordinary
people, represent only a small fringe of the rebellion.
They represent what I would call the lunatic fringe of this
spirit of rebellion. The vast majority of our young people
are not anarchists or fools, but they are in a state of
rebellion, and let us make no mistake about that. The fact
that a student may be leading a superficially normal existence, applying himself or herself to study, recognizing the
rights of others, and conducting himself or herself in
acceptable ways, in no way eliminates the fact of
rebellion.
Young people are in rebellion against our hypocrisies,
our mythologies. They know that some of the things we
have tried to cram down their throats are an insult to their
intelligence. They are in rebellion against our stupidities
and, above all, against our scale of values, and the corruption of those values-values which glorify economic
growth at the expense of our environment; values which
place a premium on the actual possession of physical
things, as manifested by the fact that television, which
should be a tremendous force for valuable information, is
monopolized by the one message "Consume", a message
which has been largely responsible in recent years for
turning sizeable portions of our environment into cesspools and garbage dumps.
I might interject at this point to say that not many years
ago while at the University of Toronto it was a great
pleasure for me to swim in Lake Ontario during the
summer. No one in his right senses would swim there now
or in other lakes in proximity to centres of population.

Honourable senators, I should like to say a few words
on the problem of drugs. University students knew that it
was stupid to treat marijuana and heroin and other hard
drugs on an equal basis. That is why for every student
who has been unfortunate or stupid enough to tamper
with heroin, there are a hundred who have used, and
continue to use, marijuana. They told me years ago they
recognized that the criminality with respect to marijuana
was not in its use, but in the actions of a society which put
persons in jail for as long as five years for smoking a
substance which they believed to be no more harmful
than the tobacco their fathers, mothers, and neighbours
used. Now, after hundreds of young lives have been blasted, not by smoking marijuana but by prison sentencesand I am thinking not just of Canada because we do not
live in a vacuum-a most distinguished commission,
appointed by the President of the United States to explore
marijuana and the legalization of it, and composed of
highly competent and eminent scientists and impartial
psychiatrists, some of them noted conservatives in their
respective fields, has recommended that marijuana be
legalized in the United States.
Last month my wife and I visited several large cities in
the United States. For some years we have been going to
New York and Boston, where we have relatives and
friends, and further south to Washington, and so on. This
time friends warned us against doing something we have
always liked to do-going out at ten or eleven oclock at
night for a pleasant walk along some of the streets. Their
reason for so warning us is almost incredible. The streets
of these cities, where seven or eight years ago we would
have been surrounded by a multitude of people, are now
empty at ten oclock at night. The reason? If you go out on
these streets-and a good example is the streets of Washington, the capital city of the United States-at night for a
stroll, there is an almost 100 per cent mathematical probability that you will be robbed without violence, muggedrobbery with violence-seriously injured, or murdered.
In Florida a woman drove up to a supermarket at noon
to go shopping, and as she was about to get out of her car,
while surrounded by other people in the area, a man
produced a gun and demanded her handbag. She said
that she had only nine or ten dollars in it, and added that
even if she were killed for it he was not going to get that
handbag. He fired three bullets into that woman's brain,
and then took the handbag. That happened the other day.
The majority of these robberies by violence, often
involving murder, are being committed by the victims of
hard drugs, usually heroin. The astonishing thing to me is
that society has, with few exceptions, closed its eyes to the
simple fact that the victim of hard drug addiction, especially heroin addiction, when deprived of his drugs
becomes a maniac no more responsible for his actions
than the most serious psychopath confined in our mental
institutions. Because these victims will go to any extreme,
including murder, to satisfy their craving they have
become the victims of criminals who exploit their needs
by supplying them with drugs at prices which the proceeds from ordinary thievery and pilfering-and prostitution, in the case of girls-are unable to meet.
(Hon. Mr. Rowed

March 1, 1972

So the cities of the United States-and let us have no
doubt that increasingly the cities of Canada will become
the same-are studded with homes and apartment buildings that are armed fortresses, protected by dogs, guns,
chains, and security guards, and inhabited by people who,
with good reason, live in daily fear for their lives.
But security guards, dogs, and chains do not deter the
drug maniac. Clearly there is only one solution to this
problem. The lessons that we learned from alcohol, and
our attempts to control it a few years ago, are relevant
today. Largely because of an emotional response on the
part of a number of groups in our society, prohibition of
alcohol was attempted. What prohibition did, for example,
in the United States and to a lesser extent elsewhere, was
not to cure or prevent alcohol addiction but rather to
provide a fertile ground for a perpendicular and horizontal growth of organized crime, and for the elevation of
criminal elements to a pinnacle from which all attempts to
dislodge them have since proven futile-at all events in
the United States. Prohibition did not prevent people
from using alcohol, nor did it prevent alcohol addictionan addiction which, incidentally, happens to be far more
destructive of human life, in terms of actual numbers,
than all other addictions in our society, with the possible
exception of tobacco addiction.
I am thinking of the outright loss and shortening of
human life, and where the numbers are important. This is
another one of the hypocricies for which our young
people indict us. They know that, yet we have given a
five-year sentence to an 18-year old girl for smoking one
marijuana cigarette, while we have given a two-year sentence to a man for driving an automobile while drunk and
killing several innocent people.
Our present laws-and I am thinking not only of the
laws of Canada but of our western society-will not prevent heroin addiction. They have not prevented it. Our
method of restricting the supply of heroin increasingly
forces addicts to resort to crime, including murder, in
order to get the drug. If there is one thing that should be
absolutely clear to all of us, it is that the heroin addict will
get heroin, or the hard drugs, even if it involves the
murder of his own family.
Surely the alternative to meet this completely impossible situation is obvious. Just as with alcohol it became
necessary for the state to take over its control and supply,
so the control and supply of heroin must be taken over by
the state which, in our case, would be the national
government.
* (1550)

Given a choice between having a young man resort to
the murder of innocent persons or giving him a free
supply of heroin while other help and treatment are being
concurrently administered, surely there can be no doubt
as to the sensible and logical procedure to follow. I have
said "young man" but the same remark applies to women.
Only a couple of weeks ago at the Americano Hotel in
New York, one of the great hotels in the United States, a
man returning to his room was killed on his very threshhold by two women both reportedly looking for money to
buy drugs.
Since putting these words on paper I have had an
opportunity to look through the last copy of the New York

March 1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Times. I found in it something incredible. I am not an
expert on these matters, and I speak only as an ordinary
citizen. I read that within recent weeks a number of
prominent citizens of the United States, persons actively
and officially concerned with this problem including the
police commissioner of New York himself, have come out
in favour of and are, in effect, advocating the same thing I
am advocating, namely, the free supply of heroin to all
addicts by the state so that they do not have to resort to
murdering people, committing prostitution, robbery and
other crimes in their attempts to get sufficient money to
satisfy the demands of the organized gangsters who are
supplying them with the drugs.
The adoption of this recommendation would almost
automatically eliminate one of the most serious aspects of
the present hard drug situation-a factor which is ignored
by the majority of our citizens-that in order to meet the
ever-increasing financial cost of his addiction the addict
has to resort to seducing his friends, his neighbours, his
peers, and other young men and young women, including
children. He seduces them into the habit in order to give
himself the chance to meet the cost, or some of the cost, of
his own addiction, and by selling to the new addict he
becomes a pusher himself. So we have this vicious, everexpanding, ever-enlarging deadly circle.
This whole sorry business has not yet reached the stage
in Canada that it has in the United States, but we would
be naive indeed to assume that Miami, San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and other American cities will
continue to enjoy a monopoly on the present unbelievably
high murder and assault rates. We have a chance-a little
breathing space, you might say-to profit from what has
happened in the United States, and we have a chance also
to provide an example which I have no doubt at all the
United States and other countries will eventually follow.
If I may just summarize the matter at this point, I think
we should do two things in Canada. We should separgte
marijuana entirely from the hard drugs and legalize its
use, and we should set in motion an inquiry to devise
formulae whereby the state will supply hard drugs where
such action is necessary in order to protect the public
from the insane depredations of those who are hooked on
hard drugs.
We cannot, of course, escape the hard fact that we lie
cheek by jowl with the United States. It must be conceded
that the success of any program in Canada would
undoubtedly be jeopardized if the United States continued its present irrational approach to the hard drug
problem. And let us face up to the fact that it is an
irrational approach. After all, it is not the first time that
that great country, a nation for whom we have the most
profound admiration, respect, and friendship, has been
guilty of an irrational course of action. But I, personally,
do not think that the United States will continue its
present course, especially if Canada should change its
own course.
It is infinitely preferable that any study we might undertake should be undertaken jointly with the United States,
and even more preferable still that it be done on an
international basis, possibly through UNESCO or some
other agency of the United Nations, In any event, Canada
can take the lead in this matter.

As far as marijuana is concerned, my personal feeling is
that within a year of the coming presidential election in
the United States the use of marijuana will be legalized in
that country.
Finally, in case there is any doubt on this matter of hard
drugs, I point out that how to control and eliminate the
hard drug traffic is one of the most serious problems
facing our whole society today. This traffic in drugs is an
evil so great in its potential that it imperils the very future
of our society.

I should like now to say something about penal reform.
In recent years we have seen significant reforms adopted
in Canada, and the present administration has indicated
its intention of continuing this work. I think in all fairness-and I do not say this in any partisan sense-that it
has to be said that much of the progress made has been
the result of the courage and intelligence of the Leader of
the Government in this house, in both his present capacity
and his previous capacity as Minister of Justice. But after
allowing for what has been done, or the progress that has
been made, I must state with all the emphasis I can
muster that I am convinced that much of our Criminal
Code and our penal system continue to be barbarous and
useless.
Historically, penal systems in our society have been
based on four principles. There has been the principle of
revenge, retaliation, or punishment. They all mean the
same thing. There has been the principle of rehabilitation-putting the criminal in prison and attempting to
bring him out a better person. There has been the principle of deterrence-if you make an example of a person
another person will take due notice. And there has been
the principle of the protection of society-innocent people
must be protected.
When the question is put to us, most of us take the
position, rightly or wrongly, that the principle of revenge
is no longer acceptable. That position is reflected in our
attitude towards capital punishment, and that attitude is
being felt increasingly all over the world. It is not for any
love of the Mansons of this world that we refuse to put
them to death. If we do so refuse, it is because we feel that
it is morally indefensible to kill them. I should say that at
least some people feel that it is morally indefensible. Not
all people feel that way.
* (1600)

Our penal system as an agent of rehabilitation is a
tragic farce. It is a joke, and it has never been anything
else but that. Indeed the net result of our penal program
has been to degrade and brutalize those unfortunates who
were victims of it. The vast majority of those who have
served time in prison have come out more anti-social than
they were when they went in, and it goes without saying
that they come out-and I think this testimony should be
given on behalf of our penal system-with more skill and
greater ingenuity to enable them to continue their antisocial behaviour.
In reading through the nlustrated London News over
the weekend I carne across the words of Lord Stonham,
one of the leading students of the British legal system and,
in fact, the minister of state responsible for administering
that system for some years, who said:

SENATE DEBATES
Prison can make criminals of offenders; it cannot
make them decent citizens. As an instrument of
rehabilitation the prison has failed.
The trouble, I would suggest, honourable senators, lies
deeper than the medieval treatment of our prisoners
which still goes on in many of our penal institutions. In
the lifetime of my grandfather people by the hundreds,
including children, were hanged by the neck until they
were dead for offences which today would draw at best
only fines, and at worst only a suspended prison sentence.
I am absolutely sure that just as we now look back almost
with disbelief over the past 150 years and view with
horror the fact that our ancestors would hang children for
picking pockets or the father of a family for poaching a
rabbit for himself and his family, or that within the lifetime of some members of this house people were kept in
jail indefinitely simply because they owed money and for
no other reason, so our grandchildren, alive today, will
view with equal incredulity the fact that their grandparents could have been party to the imprisoning of fellow
human beings for actions which are in many cases the
results of inherited mental factors or environmental conditions-in other words, accidents of birth entirely beyond
the control of the individuals concerned. And yet, honourable senators, we put them in jail. I shall come back to this
in a moment.
As far as the deterrent factors are concerned-and I
know there has been some controversy on this point-my
view is that experience has shown that the effect of capital punishment or imprisonment is, at the most, minimal
in its effect in deterring others from following similar
courses of action. In fact, in the minds of many people its
effect is non-existent. There is the classical example of
children picking pockets at public executions while their
friends were being hanged for picking pockets. The man
who kills his wife in a fit of insane jealousy-and this is
something that happens every day in our society-is no
more likely to be deterred by the consequences to his own
person than is the heroin addict who must get a fix. But
individuals and society still have to be protected. To
return to those unfortunate wretches in the United States,
we cannot have the Mansons, the Specks, the Boston
stranglers letting loose their savagery on other human
beings. If we do not execute them then we must keep them
in custody, and we are morally bound to treat them for
their illnesses.
Putting a sex deviate in jail merely because he is a sex
deviate per se is only now partly recognized, at least in
Canada, as being useless, stupid, and inhumane. We have
relaxed the laws. This house has been a party to the
relaxation of laws in respect of certain forms of sexual
behaviour; but other forms of sexual behaviour still result
in imprisonment because they offend our sense of moral
values and not because they harm anybody. So long as
those people do no harm to other human beings, we have
no moral right to legislate their behaviour, and I suggest
we have no moral right to put a sex deviate in jail simply
because he is a sex deviate any more than we have the
right to put a man in jail simply because he has six fingers
on his right hand. Again I stress-because I know that I
can easily be misconstrued, misinterpreted, or misrepresented on this point-that this has nothing to do with the
[Hon. Mr. Rowed1

March 1, 1972

fact that society must be protected from those who would
threaten the physical and mental well-being of others,
especially children.
I believe that Canada should lead the way in a program
designed eventually to abolish or drastically modify our
present penal system on the grounds that far from doing
what needs to be done, it has become a costly liability to
our society. It should not be beyond our ingenuity to find
far more effective deterrents to anti-social behaviour than
imprisonment has shown itself to be. But the present
system, as we know it today, can only be abolished or
diminished if there is a simultaneous increase in facilities
for custodial and remedial treatment of those who,
because they are a physical threat to the rest of society,
cannot be permitted to enjoy personal freedom.
Vast sums are now being spent to keep offenders in jail,
and this figure is increasing astronomically every day. I
read in an article a few days ago that the prisons in
England, even with the number of new prisons being
built, are still inadequate to deal with this problem. They
still have there 5,000 more people than they can find
accommodation for in spite of the well-known overcrowding. This situation is true all over the western world. If
some of the vast sums of money now being spent to
provide these prisons and to keep offenders in jail were
applied to the detection of psychological abnormalities
and behavioural problems at the school level, and if this
were followed by adequate professional treatment with
institutionalization where necessary, there would be a
steady decrease in the number who, as things are now, are
mathematically certain to end up in our jails-unfortunately, after they have worked their havoc on innocent
fellow human beings.
* (1610)

If such an inquiry as I have suggested were undertaken
by this house or any other body, I feel it should include a
study of the role of law-enforcement agencies in the light
of modern problems of unprecedented complexity. No
one in his right mind would suggest there is a simple
answer or a simplistic approach to this problem. Of
course, there is not. What is needed is a complete review
of the Criminal Code of Canada as well as our method of
enforcing that code.
Honourable senators, perhaps the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee which is looking into the matter
of parole could have its terms of reference enlarged to
enable it to consider some of these matters I am hinting at
today. No matter how this matter is approached, the
important consideration is that something be undertaken
by responsible authorities, preferably under the aegis of
one or both of the legislative bodies which comprise
Parliament.
I wish to say a few words concerning labour relations. I
regret I was not here when this discussion began. I did
hear the latter part of Senator Lawson's remarks, and I
was very much interested in the eloquent way he presented them. I was also interested in the points made by the
honourable senator who spoke immediately prior to me. I
will try not to repeat the points which have previously
been made. What I have to say on this matter will be said
with the full realization that, taken out of context, some of
my remarks could be used to brand me as anti-labour. In

March 1. 1972

anticipation of this, I can only say that my whole background ought to give the lie to such a charge.
The strike as an economic weapon has increasingly
become blackmail against the whole community. In a
society which has reached the maturity of ours in other
directions, the strike ought to be considered as both
unnecessary and immoral. I interject at this point that this
is not in any way an indictment against the various groups
who have taken this action. This is not a criticism of any
particular action. I am criticizing the entire principle and
philosophy of strikes. We are aware that most strikes are
destructive in one way or another, and that the final result
is usually only what could have been arrived at in other
ways with far less suffering, especially to the families
concerned.
There have been strikes which have lasted three
months, six months, and even nine months. In my old
constituency last year there was a strike which lasted nine
months, and everyone in that community was out of work
and families and children suffered. The final result could
have been arrived at in other ways with far less suffering
for everyone concerned. When we talk about the inconvenience and hardship imposed on the public generally,
let us not forget that the ones who suffer the most are the
wives and children of those directly involved in that
strike.
The strike should be abolished. I repeat, I am not saying
that the demands of one group or another are necessarily
extravagant or improper. I am not passing judgment on
those demands. I would not presume to do that. What I am
indicating is that the strike, as an instrument for achieving the desired ends of various groups and segments of
our society, is a relic of economic barbarism and its continued use must inevitably lead to economic and social
chaos and anarchy. We have seen this increasingly over
the past several years. I am not speaking solely of
Canada.
What about the demands and aspirations of the different groups who have legitimate demands? How can these
demands be met? I do not pretend to offer any pat solution. But I do know that the society which has produced
the technical miracles of our age over the last 100 years
has completely revolutionized our entire concept of social
justice. We need only to think of what is being done for
the aged, the handicapped, the mentally ill, and the welfare children, as compared to what was done, or not done,
a hundred years ago. Our society has done this. Our
society has made medical care available to the vast
majority of the people. Surely that society does not lack
the wit, the ingenuity, and the intelligence, as well as the
good will and compulsion, to devise procedures to ensure
that the legitimate needs of all people making up our
society are achieved without resorting to the use of a
weapon so crude, so wasteful, so anachronistic, and so
unfair to innocent people as the strike has proven itself to
be. A device or instrument of this kind is no longer acceptable to our society.
The strike is not a democratic instrument. It is legitimate and we cannot criticize any group of people who
have taken this action. If the Parliament of Canada gives
people the right to strike, then it must expect that those
people will take advantage of that right. Otherwise it

25312-5

DEBATES
would be meaningless. The strike is not a democratic
instrument. I believe it is a perversion of democracy.
However, our labour groups and others have had to use
this means simply because no other acceptable or effective procedure was available to them.
I do not need to remind honourable senators of the
simple and obvious fact that the Senate has rights and
privileges under the Constitution. It also has responsibilities, a fact which was particularly recognized in recent
years when this body initiated major studies of, and inquiries into, important aspects of our whole society-such
matters as poverty, taxation, scientific development, mass
media, and so on. These inquiries have produced information, and have come to conclusions of incalculable value
to our nation and, indeed, to the entire world. We do not
reach the millenium overnight, but this does not mean
that the work of Senator Croll, Senator Davey and other
honourable senators is of no use.
The fact that the Senate is increasingly pursuing these
matters is not to be wondered at. One of the first impressions I had when I came to this chamber, and upon
looking at the ParliamentaryGuide, was the reservoir of
distinguished Canadians in one field or another. We have
here a reservoir of experience and expertise which cannot
be found elsewhere in all Canada in this form. This is an
obvious fact, which seems to escape our notice.
0 (1620)

Consider, for example, the fact that in the field of
labour relations, which we have been discussing today,
one of our Newfoundland senators, Senator Dugganwho I regret is not present-has spent most of his life
wrapped up in the cause of labour as a respected labour
leader, in addition to being a respected citizen. We have
Senator Lawson, whom we have already heard today and
whom I have no doubt we may hear again with respect to
some of these matters. He is an active labour leader of the
highest calibre in the whole of Canada, and also a
member of the Senate. Is there anyone in Canada who has
the experience of Senator Goldenberg in mediating and
arbitrating great labour issues? Then I think of another of
my compatriots, Senator Forsey, who, like Senator Goldenberg, is a man not only of national but international
reputation in these matters. They are, incidentally, great
friends of labour.
I stated, honourable senators, that an alternative must
be found for the strikes which are frustrating and, indeed,
paralyzing our society in so many ways. Again, I am not
thinking in terms of Canada alone. We only need to look
at what happened in one of our mother countries in these
last few months to realize the significance of what I am
saying. Strikes are frustrating and paralyzing, and they
inhibit what should be the legitimate growth of society.
I am going to suggest that here again is an avenue of
inquiry in which this historic constitutional body could
very well utilize that reservoir to which I referred. Why
should there not be a Senate committee of inquiry into the
whole field of labour rnlations, with a specific goal in
mind, namely, an alternative to the strike as an instrument of economic policy?
Honourable senators, I apologize for delaying you so
long, but I wish to speak of the abuse of financial power
in our society. This is a problem which must become of

SENATE DEBATES

increasing concern to all of us. It is the abuse of the
principle of free enterprise by the big moneyed interests
in our society. I realize and appreciate that Canada is as
much a victim in this matter as it is an offender.
The abuse of big money-and I will explain what I mean
by big money in a moment-results in antisocial behaviour which, in the final analysis, can have a more serious
effect on our welfare than does the criminal behaviour of
individuals and organized crime groups. Parts of the
United States are threatened and pressured by the Mafia,
organized groups. They are also threatened by the actions
of big money-great respectable corporations, some of the
greatest in the world.
How many lives have been blasted, how many children
poisoned because the manufacturers and purveyors of
medical drugs, of all things-drugs supposed to help
people, to save human lives-were willing to put them on
the market improperly tested? The historic case, of
course-and we remember it so well because it involved a
former citizen of Canada-was that of thalidomide, in
which manufacturers privately and quietly fought tooth
and nail to discourage those whose duty it was to protect
unsuspecting mothers and unborn children from the
improper use of that drug. We know the pressure that was
brought to bear on that woman-who should certainly be
included in any hall of fame that Canada may have-a
Canadian doctor who advised the authorities and fought
against those great powerful interests.
There is an article in the weekend edition of the New
York Times, a responsible newspaper, which indicates
that some of the leading drug manufacturers have been
supplying "speed", of all things, to the black market
directly and indirectly, in some cases in the United States,
and in other cases to Mexican interests who then channelled it back into the United States for criminal use by
addicts.
What else but rebellion and hostility could we expect to
find in our young people when they became aware a few
years ago of the reaction of the largest and wealthiest
corporation in the world to the investigations by one
individual, when that individual pointed out that the lives
of thousands of unsuspecting human beings who had
bought cars in good faith were in jeopardy and peril
because of lethal defects in those cars? What was the
reaction of that great corporation, that great example of
free enterprise? It was: "Go to work on that fellow. Find
out what you can about him and his private life. See if we
can get something on him." Without any doubt in the
world, and this came out in the congressional inquiry, the
reason behind it was to get something on Ralph Naders
private life. "Find out if he is a homo or if he has ever
been a found-in in a brothel, so that we can shut him up."
That was not specified, but everyone knows that that was
behind it. That was the reaction of the greatest corporation in the world. Then we are surprised that our young
people are cynical and look askance at a society that
would at least condone that sort of thing.
What can we expect from our young people who know
that the great tobacco companies of the United States and
Canada-and I will choose my words carefully here-have
been permitted to spend billions of dollars during the last
few years for two reasons. One is to seduce young people
[Hon. Mr. Rowe.]

March 1, 1972

into smoking by linking up smoking, cigarettes especially,
with romance, glamour, athletic prowess and, of course,
sex. They have spent that money in a determined and
unremitting effort-I say unremitting because this week
they have been at it again-to seduce our children and
grandchildren into smoking. These great examples of free
enterprise, with billions of dollars at their disposal, are
doing just that.

Secondly, they are making every effort to invalidate and
discredit the legitimate findings of every learned and
scientific body over the past 20 years that has inquired
into the harmful effects of the use of tobacco. Such findings have shown beyond any shadow of doubt that smoking is harmful. In saying this, I am not advocating prohibition of smoking or of the sale of tobacco, but
investigations have shown that smoking is indeed harmful, and that an excess of it is the main cause of lung
cancer, emphysema, and other terminal diseases. These
large companies have spent billions of dollars in an effort
to discredit those legitimate findings.
Action taken by*the United States government last year
to prevent tobacco advertising on television represented a
major step forward. However, those same companies
went ahead and spent $250 million on advertising their
products in newspapers, magazines and periodicals. That
can be verified by looking at any popular American or
Canadian magazine, including Life and Time.
These large companies admit that they spent last year
between $200 million and $300 million in an effort to
seduce our children and grandchildren into smoking.
They are not trying to seduce those of us who are in our
fifties or sixties, but they are interested in the young
people. The question which might very well be asked is
how much have they contributed towards finding a cure
for the disease of cancer which they have helped cause? I
do not wish to be morbid, but how much are those companies spending today to ease the lot of the thousands in our
hospitals and other institutions who are slowly dying
because their lungs cannot supply the oxygen they need.
This is an actual fact. I have seen some of these hospital
cases with my own eyes. How much have these large
companies spent towards alleviating the suffering of
those who are in hospitals and institutions as a result of
using their products?
Can we expect anything but cynicism and outright
rebellion on the part of our young people when they see
such atrocities being perpetrated against society by big
moneyed interests, with little or no interference from a
society that is prepared to send an 18-year-old girl to jail
for five years because she smoked a marijuana cigarette?
I do not believe that prohibition of tobacco would be
any more effective than was prohibition of alcohol, but no
great corporation should be permitted to operate against
the interests of society in general. Pressure by legitimate
interests have been brought to bear upon some companies
which have placed candied drugs on the market, drugs
which could kill children. Resistance to pressure that such
drugs should be placed in containers which small children
could not manipulate easily has been quite incredible.
There is also the matter of defective cars and the pollution of our environment. Big moneyed interests should not

March 1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

be permitted to continue these activities under the guise
of free enterprise or democracy.
We have permitted these major companies to accumulate large amounts of money, which is another way of
saying that they have acquired considerable power. Many
of them-at times I feel like saying most of them-cannot
be trusted not to put harmful and deleterious products
into the hands of unsuspecting consumers, including children. For most of them, profit-making takes precedence
over their responsibility towards society. In the interests
of democracy there should be more control exercised over
them.
Honourable senators, my roots lie deep in Newfoundland. My ancestors came there frorn Devon and Somerset,
England, in the 1600s. I have a deep and sentimental
attachment therefore to the land of my birth, where
throughout the centuries my people have eked out a living
despite almost impossible odds. I am proud of having
been a vice-president of what was known as the Newfoundland Confederate Association. The president of the
association was J. R. Smallwood. I take pride in having
helped persuade my fellow Newfoundlanders to become
part of the Canadian nation 25 years ago. I have never
regretted doing that.
On two occasions it has been my privilege to be vicechairman of the Canadian delegation to the UNESCO
conference which is held every two years in Paris. To date
all but two of the nations of the world have been represented at those conferences, and possibly all but one will
be attending the next conference. As I have met with
representatives of 130 countries, two facts have emerged.
First, no nation is held in more universal respect than is
Canada; secondly, it is the hope and expectation of other
nations that Canada, which so often in the past has
donned the mantle of leadership, will continue to play an
increasingly important role in the future.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Honourable senators, I am not rising
for the purpose of adjourning the debate. I wish to interject a point of view in order that the honourable senator
who has just spoken may feel reassured.
0

(1640)

Senator Rowe postulates two conclusions. First, he
believes in the legalization of marijuana, and, secondly, he
is against heroin. Before I come to a remark which he will
be interested in I should like to know if the basis for his
first conclusion is a personal opinion, or on what does he
base his belief in the legalization of marijuana?
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Honourable senators, I hope I made it
clear in my remarks that I am not a specialist. I do hold a
doctorate but it is not a doctorate in medicine or in any

25312-54

directly related field. I have been associated with young
people in various capacities-for example, as Minister of
Education on two occasions, as a university lecturer, and
in many other ways. As a result of these associations I can
say I have some knowledge of young people.
I have been following this marijuana question, as I
think all other interested parties have, for a number of
years. I have read everything I could with respect to it,
and I have discussed it with some world authorities.
Had I been asked this question three or four years ago
my reply would have been, "I do not know what the
solution is." Three years ago I did not know whether or
not the United States should be involved in the Vietnamese conflict. However, opinions do change over the
years and some of us have changed our opinion with
respect to the Vietnam war as some of us have changed
our opinion on this matter of marijuana. The conclusion I
have come to is that, all things considered, marijuana
ought to be legalized.
I wish we did not have marijuana. I wish we did not
have alcohol or tobacco. I am not a teetotaller or an
advocate of prohibition. I used alcohol and tobacco for
many years and my sons, I regret to say, are users of
tobacco. The point is that we do have these problems and
we have marijuana, and we must live with them. The
figures vary somewhat, but some indicate that as many as
12 million young people in the United States alone have
used marijuana, and I presume a comparable number in
Canada have. It is a problern we have to live with, and my
feeling, having looked at all the evidence and interpreted
it as best I can, is that the time has come when marijuana
ought to be legalized.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Thank you, senator. What I wanted to
elicit was whether or not you are basing your conclusion
on the recent findings of the commission in Washington.
That commission, by the way, was populated with sociologists and psychiatrists. In a report to be published in the
near future, the authoritative body of the American Medical Association is drawing conclusions entirely opposite to
what has been stated. I thought perhaps you might be
interested in that.
Hon. Mr. Rowe: In all fairness, I should say I am aware
that the majority of medical opinion up until now has
been against the legalization of marijuana. I am wondering, however, if medical opinion is likely also to be against
the use of alcohol and tobacco.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: I hope so, but I myself have used
both.
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Heath, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

SCIENCE POLICY
CONSIDERATION OF VOLUME II OF REPORT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of Volume II of
the Report of the Special Committee on Science Policy,
tabled in the Senate on Thursday, February 24, 1972.
* (1410)

[Translation]
Hon. Maurice Lamontagne: Honourable senators, first,
as chairman of the Special Committee on Science Policy, I
want to express my gratitude to members of the commit-

tee, and particularly to those of the steering committee, to
Senator Cameron, vice-chairman of the main committee,
Senator Grosart, chairman of the steering committee and
Senator Thompson. My colleagues, working in close cooperation, devoted much time to the common task which
culminated in the publication of Volume II of the committee's report. I also want to stress the invaluable contributions of Mr. Philip Pocock, our research director, Mr.
John Kettle, who edited the English version, Col. Jacques
Ostiguy, who carried out the functions of administrator of
the committee and those who, anonymously and voluntarily, made most useful suggestions and criticisms.
I finally want to thank the media in general and more
particularly scientific editors, to whom we are mainly
indebted for the wide distribution of the content of
Volume II of our report. No doubt partly because of that
publicity, like others of my colleagues, I have been literally swamped by large numbers of invitations from various
groups, academic, professional and industrial, who want
to hear more about the work of our committee. Of course,
my colleagues and I shall be unable to accept all these
invitations-particularly now that, as Senator Martin
mentioned, the Senate is in session-although we consider
that such meetings are highly beneficial and contribute to
more ready acceptance of our recommendations. I also
want to point out that there have been favourable comments on our Volume II in foreign scientific journals, for
instance, in the United Kingdom and in the United States.
I wanted to make a brief reference to these articles and
invitations to show that the response to our report has, on
the whole, been very favourable. Other members of the
committee will have the opportunity to speak more fully
of this response during the debate.
[English]
What is even more important is the impact that our
work has already had on government circles. I am personally convinced that without the publication of Volume I,
the Ministry for Science and Technology would not exist
today. I have been pleased to note during recent months
that the new ministry has been able to recruit part of the
staff it needs and to define its mission more precisely. Its
beneficial influence throughout government departments
and agencies is already being felt.
Moreover, I note that Volume Il has been subjected to
active and favourable consideration by many government
departments and agencies since its release on January 18.
Some of them have already acted on one of our specific
recommendations and have appointed a science policy
adviser for their own department or agency. I expect that
the Economic Council will soon accept in principle another of our proposals and decide to establish a special
committee which will be responsible for initiating multidisciplinary studies in the long-term future in a Canadian
and international perspective.
The Minister of State for Science and Technology, the
Honourable Alastair Gillespie, in a speech in the other
place last Monday, stated:

March 2, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

The Lamontagne committee report "Targets and
Strategies for the Seventies", the second report of the
committee, goes into rather more detail with respect
to the contracting-out principle. I should like to tell
the house that the Government of Canada supports
the contracting-out principle so far as research and
development is concerned, and will seek to advance it
wherever possible.
The impression I got from reading the Speech from the
Throne is that these few illustrations are just the beginning of the substantial impact that Volume II will have on
the development of a coherent and systematic science
policy for Canada. Let me give you some examples which
appear, to me at least, to justify that statement.
We stated in the conclusion of Chapter 16:
This broad review of the public environment surrounding industrial innovations and R and D activities has shown much that is rather unfavourable at
present in Canada. Most of the policies we have examined produce side effects that are harmful to the
industrial innovation process ...
In the Speech from the Throne we can read:
Co-operation with the business and industrial communities will be extended even further to ensure a
favourable business climate.
Three specific aspects of that climate are mentioned.
First, the encouragement of secondary manufacturing
industry, especially through trade policy. In that respect
the Speech from the Throne states:
The government will continue to develop programs to
strengthen secondary industry ... Trade negotiations
will seek to enlarge opportunities for Canadian manufacturers and the consultative machinery with the
European Economic Community and its member
states will be strengthened.
In chapter 16 of Volume II the committee states:
... government policies should be designed to encourage the secondary manufacturing sector to use its
stronger innovating capacity to penetrate international markets.
Also in chapter 16, under the head Trade and Tariff
Policy, we state:
It is time Canada re-examined its position. Instead of
preoccupying itself with obtaining the most favourable entry into foreign markets for raw materials and
primary products, the objective should be to reduce
obstacles to the sale of Canadian manufactured products in traditional markets and to develop new markets elsewhere ... The committee proposes that the
principle of equal rates of tariff on manufactured
goods should become the cardinal point of our future
trade negotiations ... Several members of the European Economic Community would refuse Canada's
full participation, though a special arrangement on
industrial products along the lines of the arrangements being discussed with Sweden and the other
countries could be explored.
Thus, the parallelism between the two documents is striking with respect to the emphasis on secondary industry, a
new orientation of trade policy and the exploration of a

new trade alignment with the European Economic
Community.
Secondly, there is the problem of competition policy.
The Speech from the Throne states:
A further imperative in the structuring of strong,
internationally competitive industry is the development of a modern and workable competition policy.
The development of such a policy, designed to achieve
an efficient and innovative economy, capable of rapid
growth and dynamic change, must proceed through
consultation with all sectors of Canadian society.
* (1420)

In its report the committee expressed its concern about
government proposals made last fall in this area. We said:
... the criterion of consumer benefit was too narrow a
basis for the proposed appraisal of business arrangements and practices, which must include their effect
on exports, incomes and jobs. We have here another
example of how the Canadian government, in its pursuit of a specific mission-the protection of consumers-can attempt to serve this purpose in isolation,
without taking proper account of the imperatives of a
broad industrial and technological strategy.
It appears that the government is now prepared to take
these imperatives into account. It accepts that the criterion of consumer benefit is too narrow when it states that
competition policy is:
... designed to achieve an efficient and innovative
economy capable of rapid growth and dynamic
change.
This was precisely the essence of the committee's
message.
Thirdly, there are the provisions of the Canada Labour
Code regarding technological change which were introduced last fall. With respect to these provisions we stated:
Since the committee finds that innovation in Canadian industry is essential to economic growth and
should not be blocked, it urges that collective bargaining in the matter of technological change should not
relate to the introduction of the proposed change as
such, but to the procedures and measures necessary
to assist the employees affected to adjust to the effects
of the change. Such measures call for action by the
employer, by representatives of the employees and
government.
It is interesting to note what the Speech from the Throne
has to say in this respect:
A new Canada Labour Code, reflecting the many
representations received in past months, will be introduced ...
However, the most important excerpt from the speech,
in so far as Volume II is concerned, is the following:
Our economy is dependent, as are the economies of all
industrialized countries, on the imagination of entrepreneurs and their use of research and innovation, as
well as upon a rational industrial strategy. You will be
informed in months to come of government proposals
for improved policies in these areas which will be of
immense importance to the long-term development of
our country: of policies for the use of science and

SENATE DEBATES

technology designed to contribute not only to industry
but the qualitative improvement of the life of Canadians, of an industrial strategy prepared for the peculiar character of the Canadian economy.
The committee has issued in Volume Il a direct challenge to:
... the imagination of entrepreneurs and their use of
research and innovation.
We said in Chapter 15:
For the first time in our economic history we must
become an innovative nation ...
because
technological innovation is recognized as an important determinant of economic growth.
We stated later:
Top management here must change its philosophy
and attitudes. It must forget the past and develop a
new outlook and strategy aimed at improving innovative capacity ... Industry must find itself a new vocation in the drastically changing world trading patterns
of the last part of the 20th century.
The report goes on to say:
The committee's recommendations and suggestions
will not only require a structural revolution in many
private institutions but also a conversion of their leaders to a new mentality and new attitudes. Canadian
society must become collectively more creative and
innovative. This large scale operation must be undertaken primarily by the private sector.
Moreover, the committee pointed out that this Canadian
innovation operation could not "be successfully carried
out by the private sector alone." We concluded that:
Canada needs a new national policy-a new national
industrial strategy-and the Canadian government
should use all the weapons at its disposal to implement it ...
Finally, we expressed our belief that:
The new industrial and technological strategy to be
implemented by the Canadian government should
create larger industrial units, encourage them to innovate, and build on our raw material base more effectively by requiring further processing in Canada.
In other words, as mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne, we recommended "an industrial strategy prepared for the peculiar character of the Canadian
economy."
My only intention in mentioning this close parallelism
between the new declared objectives of the government
and the main message contained in Volume II of the
committee's report was to give another illustration, following those given by the Leader of the Government in
this chamber, that the Senate, through its various committees, is providing a most useful service to the country and
to show that a well-known columnist seriously misinformed the Canadian public when he wrote that "in terms
of official policy, the recommendations of Senate committees are not worth the paper they are printed on."
[Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

March 2, 1972

The precise nature of the proposals announced by the
government bas not been defined yet. The Speech from
the Throne states that "the basis of each will be spelled
out as the session proceeds." I am convinced that as these
specific proposals are submitted to Parliament, the committee will want to scrutinize them in the light of the
recommendations and suggestions contained in Volume
II.
The members of the committee have agreed that we
should try to discuss the content of our report as systematically as possible and that four of us should be
assigned one broad area each to cover specifically at the
beginning of the debate. Afterwards, other members of
the committee and other honourable senators will be completely free, of course, to pick any topic they wish in
connection with Volume II. This arrangement could work
very well because our report covers four broad areas
which I propose to outline briefly in the order in which
they will be presented in the first phase of the debate.
First, we have devoted chapter 14 to the important topic
of basic research, both curiosity-oriented and mission-oriented. We propose a new target and strategy for this type
of R and D activity, and some organizational changes
which we believe could substantially improve our national
effort in this area. My speech will be devoted mainly to
this topic.
Secondly, we have devoted three long chapters to industrial R & D activities leading to economic innovations.
Senator Grosart, the chairman of the steering committee,
will cover this broad and important area. I will not
attempt to sum it up because even a summary of our
findings and recommendations would be too long.
Thirdly, another important theme of the report is the
growing impact that science and technology will have on
the future of Canadians and mankind as a whole.
Although we present the two faces of technology, we are
rather pessimistic about the long-term future, especially if
we let present trends continue to prevail. As this debate
will show, we are not alone in being pessimistic. We feel,
however, that it is not too late to act. This is why we make
a special plea to Canadians to invent their own future. To
achieve this, the study of the future must be greatly intensified in our country and the approach to be used must be
basically multidisciplinary, involving all the scientific disciplines. The committee is also firmly convinced that our
commitment to the future should not be left to experts
alone. It must be collective and action-oriented. Senator
Thompson will further develop this other general theme
of the report and explain the specific proposals that the
committee bas made in that respect.
* (1430)

Fourthly, we have been convinced all along that a
rational science policy had to be conceived and formulated not only in a national but also in an international
perspective. In other words, we must know as precisely as
possible what research and development projects and
programs are carried out in Canada and what results they
produce. Moreover, it has been estimated that our country
could at best contribute about two per cent of the world
research and development efforts.
We should try, therefore, to know what is being done in
this whole area by other industrialized nations, not only to

March 2, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

manage our own national efforts more efficiently but also
to use for our own national benefit what has been discovered or invented elsewhere.
This broad topic is a recurring theme of the whole
report, but it is covered more specifically in chapters 12,
13 and 17. Senator Cameron, the vice-chairman of the
committee, has developed a particular interest in this area
and will devote the main part of his speech to it.
Such are the broad topics contained in Volume II and
the approach we intend to use in submitting this report to
this chamber.
The committee has devoted part of chapter 12 and part
of chapter 14 of Volume II to the concept, the specific
features, and the organization of basic research in
Canada. The target and the broad strategy that we propose for this area correspond to the views presented to us
during our hearings. I will sum them up briefly.
We state that it is necessary to carry out basic research
in Canada in order to maintain a national scientific capability and to contribute as an advanced nation to the
extension of the international pool of basic knowledge.
Numerous empirical studies show, however, that the
results of basic research are free goods easily accessible
to all nations through scientific publications, and that a
long time interval is usually required before scientific
discoveries are transformed into successful innovations.
Dr. G. A. Harrower, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, Queen's University, told the committee that this
process "requires something like a 25-year lead time." Dr.
Herzberg confirmed this view in an interview which he
gave after he received his Nobel Prize. When he was asked
about the practical results of his lifetime work in the field
of molecular spectroscopy, he is reported to have said that
he could see a vague way for application in that knowing
more about free radicals one would know more about
chemical reactions, and knowing more about chemical
reactions should assist the chemical industry. He remembered that there was one case of practical application of
his discoveries but he had forgotten the details.
During our hearings it was repeatedly stated that the
relative share of the Canadian research and development
effort devoted to basic research was too high but nobody,
even in industry, recommended that this imbalance
should be corrected by reducing the level of public support in this area. Thus our specific recommendation that
the expenditures allocated to basic research should be
gradually raised to roughly $400 million reflects a broad
Canadian consensus. In relative terms, it would mean that
Canada's contribution would be more in line than it is
now with that of most other advanced nations, although,
in real terms, our quantitative effort would not increase
significantly after having been deflated by the inflation
and sophistication factors.
We also recommend that in attempting to reach this
target a strategy emphasizing quality rather than quantity
be adopted. In order to develop excellence, we suggest a
better program of post-doctoral fellowships awarded for a
maximum period of five years. This trial period would
give an opportunity to young Canadian scientists interested in basic research to develop and demonstrate their
ability in the area of scientific discovery. We propose that

research grants should be restricted to applicants who
have met international quality standards in their past
performance. This is the only way to improve the Canadian contribution to the international scientific pool. The
application of such a strategy would mean that a smaller
number of Canadian scientists would receive public support to carry out basic research, but that the applicants
who would meet the requirements of excellence could be
.more generously rewarded and subjected to less administrative controls. Our approach corresponds exactly to an
observation made by Dr. Herzberg when he said: "There
is a pyramid and not every one will come to the top." He
also pointed out that there were many useful tasks for
scientists, including administration, other than basic
research. This is precisely why we have insisted so much
in our report on excellence when scientific discovery was
involved and why pure scientists should remain free when
they meet this criterion of excellence.
On the whole, the committee's proposals regarding targets and strategies for basic research appear so far to
have received widespread approval. However, our recommendations dealing with the administrative reorganization of public support and of government intramural
activities in this area have met with greater resistance.
This was to be expected, of course, because proposed
organizational change is usually interpreted by those
affected by it as a condemnation or a destruction of the
past. We said in our concluding chapter:
We are also aware that our proposals will genuinely
disturb some dedicated Canadians that have served
Canada well in the past. Our intention in putting them
forward, though, was not to preserve the past, however great it may have been, but rather to prepare the
future.
* (1440)

And we noted with approval the criticism made by
Professor E. Miles of Princeton University when he said:
Unfortunately, governmental organizational structures and systems have a peculiar tendency always to
be out of date. Organizational forms never catch up
with the demands of the times.
Most of our critics-and they have been few up to now,
although some of them have been quite outspoken-have
taken an ambivalent position. They agree that Canada's
past performance in the research and development area
has not been very productive. For instance, one of our
critics said:
We have built beautiful race tracks, but we have no
horses, and nobody has had a chance to bet.
On the other hand, he apparently wants to preserve the
organizational patterns which have created this undesirable situation, and which can only continue to build more
"beautiful race tracks." He stated that although Volume II
was "heading in the right direction, it does wrong to the
existing organizations." On that ground particularly, he
found it "hard to be constructive about the report." I
personally find it hard to reconcile the need for a new
direction of our national R and D effort with the preservation of the organizational status quo. The same critic is
also reported to have said, "Pruning is better than cutting
down and replanting." I subscribe to that statement, and I

SENATE DEBATES

would now like to show that our proposals regarding
organizational changes involve a lot of pruning, but very
little "cutting down and replanting."
Let us look, for instance, at our proposal regarding the
creation of three granting foundations to be responsible
mainly for the development of a capacity for and the
support of curiosity-oriented research in universities and
similar institutions. These foundations-we prefer not to
call them councils because they would have no advisory
function-would cover the physical sciences, the life
sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. They
would operate under a Canadian Research Board, and
they would report through the Secretary of State.
I propose to deal first with the organization of federal
support for the social sciences and the humanities. At
present, this responsibility is assigned to the Canada
Council which also offers assistance to the arts. This
arrangement was made in 1957, and it was more practical
than logical. Indeed, it was mainly justified by the fact
that the council's annual budget was only about $3 million
at that time, and that the administrative cost of having
two separate bodies to allocate this small budget would be
too high. This practical justification does not exist any
more today. The Canada Council now devotes about $20
million annually to the social sciences and the humanities.
Moreover, experience has shown over the years that the
support of research in the social sciences and the humanities raised specific problems which were quite different
from those related to the support of the arts. For instance,
the decision to finance the development of an econometric
model is hardly comparable with the granting of assistance to an orchestra. Thus faced with this dichotomy, the
council was forced to divide its dual mission, to set up two
different kinds of advisory committees and, for all practical purposes, to operate under two separate budgets.
Viewed in that perspective, the recommendation made
by the committee to create a special foundation for the
social sciences and the humanities has the simple effect of
making explicit a division which is already implicit in the
organization of the Canada Council as it exists today. It is
not a destruction of the past, but the formal recognition of
an evolution which has already taken place. In addition,
the committee's reorganization plan implies that the social
sciences will be brought closer to other scientific disciplines, which is a distinct advantage which I shall explain
later.
This proposed change, therefore, can be described as
pruning rather than cutting down the tree. It is the result
of past growth and progress which now permits a better
division of labour. It was recommended by the Macdonald
group, composed of distinguished academics, in a report
prepared for the Science Council and the Canada Council
and entitled, "The Role of the Federal Government in
Support of Research in Canadian Universities". This
report said:
The mandate of the Canada Council to support
research in the humanities and social sciences should
be terminated.
Moreover, this separation is supported by the representatives of these two groups of disciplines. The executive
committee of the Humanities Research Council of Canada
states:
(Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

March 2, 1972

We recommend, therefore, that the humanities and
social sciences division of the Canada Council should
be recognized more formally as the funding organization for the humanities and social sciences, and put on
an organizational footing equal to that which exists
for the natural, physical and health sciences. We
therefore find ourselves in general accord with the
recommendation of the Senate Special Committee on
Science Policy that a separate 'foundation' for the
humanities and social sciences be established provided that the expertise and the administrative personnel
of the humanities and social sciences division of the
present Canada Council could be utilized by the new
body.
I fully agree that the expertise developed by the Canada
Council over the years should not be lost.
Hon. Paul Martin: What is the authority for that?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: This is the executive of the
Humanities Research Council of Canada, which is a private body representing all the humanities interested in
research in this field in our country.
The executive committee of the Social Science Research
Council of Canada makes the following statement:
The Canada Council in its present form is no longer a
satisfactory body for the social sciences. It must be
changed. The Canada Council should be split in two
distinct bodies, one for the humanities and social
sciences, and one for the performing arts. The
Humanities and Social Sciences Division should be
absorbed by a humanities and social sciences
research council as is now proposed. At present, the
Humanities and the Social Sciences Division is
responsible to an appointed council, many of whom
are not familiar with the social sciences or humanities. When one compares the nature of this appointed
council with that of the NRC or the MRC, one is
struck by the absence of professional expertise in the
appointed membership of the Canada Council.
* (1450)

And this other council continues.
Surely it is time that the important role played by the
Social Sciences and Humanities Division be recognized and that the division be put on an equal footing
with the physical and health sciences which have in
their own appointed councils (NRC and MRC) a high
degree of professional competence and expertise. . . A
separate 'foundation' for the humanities and social
sciences, such as is recommended by the Senate Special Committee (Volume II page 432), would meet this
difficulty.
Thus the Macdonald group has proposed the separation
of the Canada Council. The two main private bodies
representing the social scientists and the humanists in
Canada have come to the same conclusion. The Canada
Council itself, in its brief to the committee in 1969, suggested bringing "all the sciences together in fuller partnership", although it expressed the view then that this
idea might be premature. Thus, the committee's recommendation represents the consensus of those who have
studied the problem in depth, and who are directly

March 2, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

involved with research in the social sciences and the
humanities.
Another proposal made by the committee in the same
area is to separate the National Research Council's granting function from its research operation. This is not a new
issue. Back in 1951 the Massey Commission indicated that
there was already some concern in Canada about the
incompatibility of these two functions. In its review of
Canada's science policy published in 1969, the OECD's
examiners again echoed these worries when they wrote:
"And yet the constant, and sometimes conflicting criticisms of this body", namely, the NRC, "which are heard
throughout the country convince us that it is high time its
functions were reviewed." The examiners recommended
that the support of curiosity-oriented research in universities and similar institutions should be separated from the
council's laboratories and assigned to a special body.
In the same year the exhaustive study of the Macdonald
group came to the same conclusion and proposed that:
... the National Research Council be reconstituted so
as to have as its sole responsibility the support of
scientific and engineering research in universities and
related institutions.
The Macdonald study gave several serious reasons, which
I will not repeat here, to justify their recommendation.
They are indicated at pages 103 and 104 of that report.
Our committee was convinced by the arguments put forward by the Macdonald group and went on to say:
In addition to the reasons given by the Macdonald
report to support this suggestion, the committee was
told that NRC's board devotes about 90 per cent of its
time and attention to the distribution of awards and
grants, which means that the facts of life have already
imposed a separation de facto, thus leaving NRC's
laboratories without the direction Parliament thought
they should have.
I was told recently by a spokesman for NRC that, since
1970, 13 per cent of the board's time has been devoted to
the laboratories. In my view, this recent improvement is
hardly satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask if the NRC gave evidence on
this point before the committee?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I do not think that they gave
evidence on this specific subject before the committee.
However, I have received correspondence from members
of the board of NRC to that effect, and this later figure
that I have given came directly from an employee of NRC,
writing to me on behalf of the President of the NRC, Dr.
Schneider. So I think that the evidence, while it was not
given at our hearings, is pretty solid.
Finally, when Dr. Solandt commented on Volume II, he
is reported to have said, according to the Globe and Mail
of January 22, that "he agreed that NRC's function as a
fund-granting body to universities should be removed."
Thus, here again, the committee's recommendation has
already been made or accepted by most of the expert and
impartial observers, who have been asked to present their
views on this problem. The question which comes to my
mind is: How many times will this recommendation have
to be repeated before it is implemented?
25312-6

The third proposal made by the committee is that the
Medical Research Council be transformed into a foundation responsible for the support of all the life sciences in
universities and similar institutions. The present arrangement whereby that council is restricted to the support of
medical research, and NRC has the responsibility for
assisting curiosity-oriented research in the other life
sciences, including biology, is certainly confusing and
illogical. It can only lead to overlapping and imbalances.
We quoted Dr. E.W.R. Steacie, the former president of
NRC, who condemned the organization of biology in universities as being wrong and harmful. We believe that his
criticism also applies to the present organization of federal support for biology and the other life sciences and that
the need for the organizational change proposed in our
report is so obvious that it hardly requires further
justification.
I would like to emphasize again that our proposals
regarding the creation of those three foundations do not
represent a destruction but rather a normal extension of
the past. They are inspired by recent growth and progress
which have put the Canadian government in a position to
organize a better division of labour according to more
functional lines. For instance, to show the progress made
in this area in the last few years, in 1957 R and D expenditures spent in universities and other non-profit private
organizations and funded largely by the central government amounted to about $30 million, but in 1969, about
twelve years later, they had risen to approximately $325
million. Our recommendations simply recognize this spectacular increase and the organizational change which it
necessitates.
*

(1500)

I come now to our proposal regarding the creation of a
Canadian Research Board. This board would be composed of a full-time president with a small secretariat, and
the chairmen of the three foundations. In our report we
stress the necessity for those foundations to remain
autonomous in the distribution of their funds in their own
fields. However, it is widely felt that they should be
brought closer together to prepare their respective budgets, to share common services in order to reduce their
administrative costs, and to promote multidisciplinary
programs. The role of the proposed board would be to
achieve these aims.
The need for such restricted integration has been
expressed by many people. For instance, the Canada
Council, in its brief to the committee, stated:
Whether or not all aid to university research comes
under a single minister, the various agencies of the
government which share this responsibility will have
to develop closer and closer liaison in order to ensure
complementarity between services, and consistency
between programs, and in order to foster interdisciplinary undertakings.
The Macdonald group recommended that:
... federal research councils be organized in such a
manner that, when taken together, their terms of reference will encompass all disciplines recognized by
Canadian universities ...

SENATE DEBATES

and that:
... there be established an intercouncil co-ordinating
committee to be composed of the presidents of the
three councils, together with such staff and advisors
as they deem necessary.
The group also recommended the creation of:
... a Canadian universities research advisory committee to make available to Treasury Board advice on the
allocation of public funds for sponsored research in
Canadian universities.
I believe-and I am sure the committee agrees with
me-that this advisory committee proposed by the Macdonald group, working through the back door, would
seriously reduce the authority of the foundations and
would not have the same expertise as they would have to
give advice on the allocation of public funds.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: What would be the estimated cost of
setting up this proposed board?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: We believe it would not cost any
additional money. It would be composed of the chairmen
of the three foundations that we have mentioned, with a
permanent president of the board. Its objective would be
to organize the common services of the three foundations
so that the cost of administering them would be reduced.
The proposed board would not cost any more money. On
the contrary, it would enable the government to effect
savings. We feel that the proposed board, with an impartial president, would be in a much better position to fulfil
that role and to ensure effective co-ordination between
the foundations than if the three chairmen were left alone
as equals to decide on controversial issues.
While the Macdonald group relied on a co-ordination
mechanism, which in practice seldom works effectively,
the OECD examiners went to the other extreme and
recommended complete integration of the granting function. They said:
We are inclined to suggest that the balanced growth of
research in Canadian universities would best be
served by the establishment of a single comprehensive
grants agency, combining the functions at present
exercised by the NRC, the Medical Council, the
Canada Council ...
The committee believes that this complete integration is
unrealistic. While, in our view, there should be partial
integration to deal effectively with common problems, the
fact remains that the support of research in the physical
sciences, the life sciences, the social sciences and the
humanities raises enough different issues to justify three
separate foundations. Thus, the board proposed by the
committee stands between the two extremes recommended by the Macdonald group and the OECD examiners. It
provides a more effective mechanism than mere co-ordination to ensure closer liaison and the solution of common
problems. At the same time, it recognizes the specific
requirements of the three main categories of scientific
disciplines that full integration into a single agency would
tend to ignore.
The committee has recommended that the three foundations and the board should report through the Secretary
of State. At present, NRC reports to the president of the
Treasury Board, the Medical Research Council to the
[Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

March 2, 1972

Minister of National Health and Welfare, and the Canada
Council to the Secretary of State. This arrangement certainly does not provide for close liaison and more balance
between different areas of support. We have not yet found
anyone prepared to defend this awkward system. There
seems to be a consensus that if the three foundations and
the board are to be created, they should report through
the same minister.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Will the honourable
senator explain why the reports of the three foundations
should be made to the Secretary of State rather than to
the Minister of Science and Technology?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I was about to deal with that
very issue. As I said, there seems to be a consensus in
Canada that the board and foundations should report to a
single minister. The committee has suggested that the
minister should be the Secretary of State. Others have
proposed the Minister of State for Science and
Technology.
We justified our proposal by arguing that within the
Canadian government the Secretary of State was already
the minister responsible for university affairs, and that it
was therefore logical for him to have the ministerial
responsibility for federal funding of curiosity-oriented
research in universities. This is a pattern which bas been
found useful in many other countries and which has prevented interference with the allocation of funds from
ministers having a mission close to the curiosity-oriented
activities being supported.
It bas been argued, however, that this arrangement
would not be practical in Canada, because it would give
additional duties t a minister who already had extensive
responsibilities. My own experience, as former Secretary
of State reporting for the Canada Council, has been that
this specific duty did not require much time, provided
that the principle of ministerial non-interference with the
detailed allocation of funds was preserved.
* (1510)

The only other alternative which has been put forward
would give this responsibility to the Minister of State for
Science and Technology. Very early in its discussions, the
committee rejected the idea that the central machinery
charged with the broad formulation and control of
science policy should be directly responsible for any government agency carrying out intramural R and D programs or supporting extramural activities. This is a basic
lesson that our study of Canadian history and the experience of other countries has taught us. If that central
machinery is to achieve its essential mission effectively, it
must preserve by all means its impartial position and
avoid any real or apparent conflict of interest.
The Minister of State for Science and Technology, with
the advice of his staff, will have to pass judgment on
budgetary proposals approved by his colleagues. He
should not be placed in a position where he would have to
appraise and judge what he would have already
approved, if he were directly in charge of some government intramural or extramural R and D programs. The
committee arrived at this conclusion before the OECD
report on Canada's science policy was published. Its
views on this matter were reinforced, however, when the
OECD examiners recommended the appointment of a

March 2Mach29

1972

SENATE DEBATES

Minister for Science "without departmental responsibility."l

Hon. Mr. Martin: How many member states of the
OECD have separate ministries for science? I know Britain has one.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: It varies considerably from one
country to another, but I believe most members of the
OECD have a ministry for science dealing with the granting of moneys to universities.
Our recommendation respecting the proposed foundations and the Canadian Research Board does not mean
that the Ministry of State for Science and Technology
would have nothing to do with them. On the contrary,
once their budgets have been approved by the Secretary
of State, the Ministry would then have to review and pass
judgment on them in the light of the broader targets and
strategies defined for the Canadian government's participation in the overall national R and D effort. This twostage ministerial review is essential, if specific needs are
to be promoted and appraised in a broader perspective, in
order to arrive at a coherent and balanced policy for
science, technology and innovation. In other words,
microscopic and macroscopic evaluations must complement each other.
I now come to the last section of my speech, which will
be devoted to basic research performed by the Canadian
government. While we feel the bulk of basic research done
in Canada-let us say about 70 to 75 per cent to illustrate
the order of magnitude-should be performed by universities and similar institutions, we are also convinced that
government agencies have a complementary but important role to play in this area. Our report contains the
following observations related to that role:
First, we acquired the impression that the government
as a whole was performing too much basic research, and
as a result consideration should be given to the transfer of
some of it to universities.
Secondly, we stated that basic research in biology,
medicine and, more particularly, the social sciences had
been relatively neglected as compared with the physical
sciences.
Thirdly, we asserted that current intramural basic
research activities were often too dispersed and did not
allow for enough multidisciplinary programs.
Fourthly, we said that the dispersion of basic research
was an inducement for some agencies to neglect their
practical mission.
On the basis of these observations, which to my knowledge have not been challenged, we recommend the creation of three research institutes, namely, for the physical
sciences, the life sciences and the social sciences, which
would operate under the umbrella of a national research
academy. This academy could be called the National
Research Council, if there is a general desire to retain this
historic name. In outlining the role of the academy and its
three institutes we emphasize that they should carry out
"most basic research activities of the Canadian government." This would not entirely preclude other public
agencies with practical missions from performing some
mission-oriented basic research. We also recommended
that "a substantial portion of the work of the institutes be
25312-61

performed at the request of government agencies and
private firms on a fee basis." We did not say that these
institutes should be prevented from doing curiosity-oriented basic research, or even what Dr. Steacie used to call
"long-term applied work with no specific objective."
While we used careful language, our message was crystal clear. Our intention was to concentrate in those institutes the bulk of basic research performed by the Canadian government to complement what universities did not
do, and to meet the requirements of other mission-oriented public agencies. We expect that the immediate result of
this proposal would be that the academy, or the National
Research Council, would do more basic research than at
present, even the physical sciences, and it would be in a
position to tackle all kinds of multidisciplinary programs
which it cannot do now. It would also involve the transfer
of scientists now doing basic or long-term applied
research in mission-oriented agencies to the academy or
council where they would find a better climate to continue
their work. A complementary recommendation provides
for the transfer of National Research Council's laboratories dealing with specific and short-term industrial problems related to manufacturing to a new complex called
the Canadian Industrial Laboratories Corporation.
We were surprised at the reaction which this proposed
reorganization created in a few circles. It was said that we
wanted to destroy the National Research Council and that
in the new academy or council there would be no place for
such a great scientist as Dr. Herzberg, and that we wanted
to separate basic research from applied research.
Hon. Mr. Martin: He also took the same position.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I, of course, reject the first two
allegations as being completely unfounded. The purpose
of our recommendations in this area is to create within
the Canadian government a great centre of excellence for
basic research which would be unique in the world, and
which would faithfully reflect the dream of Dr. Tory and
Dr. Steacie, two very distinguished past presidents of the
National Research Council.
* (1520)

Indeed, if we go back to the memorandum prepared by
Dr. Tory in 1932, when he was president of NRC, and
which we reproduced as an appendix to chapter 3 of
Volume I, it is quite clear that what he really wanted was
to concentrate in NRC the great bulk of the basic and
long-term applied research carried out by the various
government agencies. It is also easy to see how Dr. Steacie
envisaged the main role of NRC. He wrote, for instance:
As far as the National Research Council is concerned,
the list [of activities] includes fundamental work, longterm applied work with no specific objective, work on
specific industrial problems, short-term industrial
problems (i.e. ad hoc investigations), investigations for
the services, consulting, testing, specifications and
miscellaneous inquiries. All of these are of importance, but it is essential, if the organization is to develop any reputation or scientific self-respect, that the ad
hoc problems and routine inquiries, shal not be
allowed to force real research out of the door. It is
very easy for this to happen, and in the case of many
laboratories of similar type in other countries, it has
happened.

SENATE DEBATES

He went on to say:
In my view, at least as far as the National Research
Council is concerned, long-term investigations, fundamental or applied, must constitute the major effort of
the laboratories, if they are to keep the scientific reputation they have earned.
We believe that that fear expressed by Dr. Steacie now
represents a real danger, and that NRC's recent attempts
to give more attention to what he called "short-term
industrial problems" might "force real research out of the
door." One of the reasons why the committee recommended that what Dr. Steacie described as "ad hoc investigations" should be transferred to the proposed Canadian
Industrial Laboratories Corporation is precisely to make
sure that good basic research will not be forced out of the
door, as Dr. Steacie feared.
A second reason is that if the proposed academy or
council is to increase its intramural activities, in basic
research and "long-term applied research with no specific
objective," as the committee recommends, and if at the
same time NRC were to expand its effort to solve "shortterm industrial problems," it might well become too big
an organization. This is another danger that Dr. Steacie
feared when he stated:
One must also try to avoid the stifling effects of bigness. The tidy mind whose ideal is "one big organization" is the worst foe of originality, initiative, and
scientific progress.
We have also been criticized for wanting to separate
basic research from mission-oriented applied research. I
believe that this criticism is unjustified for two reasons.
First, if bigness is to be avoided, the long sequence of the
innovation process, beginning with basic research and
ending with the launching of the innovation, must be
broken at some stage at the organizational level. Thus the
question arises: Should the break be made between basic
research and mission-oriented research or between the
latter and development work leading to innovations? We
have shown, especially in chapter 12, that there is a wide
consensus of opinion among experts in this field that the
link between basic research and innovation is not direct
and immediate.
An article which bas just been published, entitled "Success and failure in industrial innovation," bas again confirmed this view. That article is a summary of the Report
on Project Sappho soon to be released by the Science
Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex in Great
Britain. It states:
It has sometimes been suggested that a proportion of
basic research adds to the strength of an R and D
department. In about half our cases, basic research
was being performed in the firms (mainly in chemicals) but there was only a modest association between
successful innovation and the performance of basic
research by the firm. Casimir and others have suggested that basic science is a source of innovation that
cannot be ignored. The Sappho results do not contradict this but indicate that it need not necessarily be
conducted within the firm.
This conclusion indicates again that if an organizational
separation has to be effected, as it should be in most

(Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

March 2, 1972

cases, it is much more useful to keep mission-oriented
applied research with development work rather than to
locate it where the bulk of basic research is done. This is
precisely what the committee recommends, and we are
convinced that the few people who know something about
the innovative process would disagree with us.
This does not mean, however, that basic research and
the subsequent stages of the innovative process should be
entirely divorced from each other. On the contrary, we
propose that a substantial portion of the work performed
by the academy or council should be mission-oriented
basic research done at the request of other government
agencies, through contractual arrangements, and that
there should be frequent exchanges of personnel. These
organizational links would, in our view, prevent the
academy or council becoming an ivory tower, and at the
same time make sure that the other government agencies
would not unduly inflate their need for basic research.
Finally, I come to our recommendation that the three
research institutes should work under the umbrella of an
academy or council. This organizational integration is
already effected within NRC in so far as the physical and
the life sciences are concerned. But what about the institute for the social sciences? Having been an economist
myself, I am convinced that new break-throughs in the
social sciences would be greatly facilitated if they were
more closely associated with the other sciences. We have
quoted in our report Vassily Leontief, the great Harvard
economist, who holds the same view. Many medical
researchers now claim that several areas of interest to
them, such as the drug problem, also require the contribution of mission-oriented basic research in the social
sciences.
I would like to refer again to Dr. Steacie, who was not
only a first-class natural scientist but also a great humanist, who said:
The real situation seems to me to be that science is
one of the humanities, although technology is not.
Specialization is necessary and is intrinsically desirable, in spite of what the dilettantes say, but there is a
real problem in trying to maintain breath in spite of it.
* (1530)

On another occasion, he added:
A liberal education has already been broadened to
include economics and the social sciences, so why not
the natural sciences?
My own interpretation of Dr. Steacie's views on this subject is that if the different sciences ought to be integrated
in our educational systems and programs, this closer relationship should also be established in the area of research.
Dr. Steacie's thoughts about the integration of scientific
disciplines were very perceptive indeed, because they
since have become one of the main themes that are discussed today in the scientific world. For instance, Gabor
Strasser, in a recent article entitled "What is in Store for
our Scientific Technological Establishment," asserts that
"it is necessary to properly orchestrate the many disciplines" and that "superposition ... simply does not work."
Thus, my conclusion is that our recommendation to
transform NRC into an academy, where intramural basic
research in the physical sciences, the life sciences and the

SENATE DEBATES

March 2, 1972

social sciences would be concentrated, corresponds to a
new trend which will develop more and more in the
future, and would not result in the destruction of the
council. On the contrary, it is a reconstruction in the very
direction that past presidents of NRC really wanted but
could not follow because they felt that they had to hide, to
a certain extent, their interest in basic research and to
show that they were performing a useful and practical
mission. The implementation of our recommendation
would enable NRC, for the first time in its history, to
abandon this disguise and this false image. It would represent a most challenging mission, that of becoming a still
better centre of excellence for basic research with a wider
range of scientific disciplines, a greater institution of
which, I am sure, all Canadians would be proud. I am also
convinced that Dr. Steacie, as I have tried to show, would
have picked up that challenge with great enthusiasm and
would have been proud indeed to be the head and the
inspiration of such a unique institution.
To sum up, I want to emphasize again that the committee's proposals regarding targets, strategies and administrative reorganization for the carrying out and the public
support of basic research in Canada have received widespread approval from those who have studied our report
seriously and who are more interested in building for the
future than in preserving the status quo. We now hope
that those suggestions and recommendations will receive
immediate and careful consideration by the government. I
am very much encouraged by the following statement that
the Honourable Alastair Gillespie made in the speech to
which I have already referred. He said:
The Lamontagne committee has made a number of
recommendations with respect to basic research.
There are 45 recommendations in the second volume,
a significant number of which touch upon the question of basic research in Canada ... We will be very
much involved in developing criteria for federal support of basic research, and we intend to stress quality
rather than quantity.
This is exactly the expression we used in our report. He
continues:
The idea of centres of excellence has considerable
appeal to me and my ministry. The concept of centres
of excellence will be given a high priority.
And the minister concluded:
In the one minute left to me I should like to state that
the Lamontagne committee report, to which I have
referred several times this afternoon, will be given
very careful attention by my ministry.
I hope that this ministerial statement will be gratifying
not only to the Senate but more particularly to all members of the committee who participated in the preparation
of the report.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Cameron, debate adjourned.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Buck-

wold, seconded by Hon. Miss Lapointe, for an address in
reply thereto.
Hon. A. E. Haddon Heath: Honourable senators, I should
like to congratulate the mover of the Address in Reply to
the Speech from the Throne. I read Senator Buckwold's
speech with great pleasure. I am sure that all Canada will
benefit from his able advocacy from the west.
I read also with great pleasure Senator Lapointe's
speech in seconding the motion. It is a delight to have
such a worthy successor to Senator Casgrain in this
chamber.
The Speech from the Throne contains many points with
which the Senate is dealing right now, and I refer to the
three excellent reports presented respectively by the Poverty Committee, the Science Policy Committee and the
National Finance Committee. Almost every point raised
in the Speech from the Throne is covered in the recommendations and solutions presented to us by our
committees.
I assure the house that Senator Lamontagne and I are
not in collusion, but I, too, read Charles Lynch's column
in the Vancouver Province of January 24, in which he
wrote:
Because the Senate lacks power . .. its reports, though
prepared at public expense, have no more influence
on events than commentaries from non-governmental
sources.
Some honourable senators will be surprised to hear that
we lack power. One of the firm understandings some of us
have is that our duties and responsibilities here lie in
preparing legislation, and in amending legislation from
the other place. I feel, Charles Lynch to the contrary, that
the recommendations from the committees on Poverty,
Science Policy and National Finance mean we expect
action to result, by way of amending legislation coming
from the other place or originating here.
One of the points made in the Speech from the Throne
18:

Economic security is one of the most effective
forces with which to counter social isolation.
The Special Committee on Poverty made concrete recommendations on this very point. The Speech from the
Throne speaks of correcting "social injustice," and in this
area we have recommendations from the Poverty Committee which we will be discussing in due course.

To me last Tuesday's meeting of the Council of the
Canadian Bar Association in Montebello was extremely
helpful, because the panel dealing with poverty law had
as a participant Senator Carter, who was for a time
deputy chairman of the Poverty Committee. Senator
Carter was a real Daniel in a den of lawyers. He laid a
broad foundation for the day's discussion of poverty by
the Council of the Canadian Bar Association. One of the
points that he brought out so well, and one which cannot
be stressed too often-and I believe this is the Prime
Minister's definition-was that "poverty" is to be without
hope.
The Speech from the Throne indicates this in several
places, and it is a more difficult problem for us to deal

SENATE DEBATES

with than the sticks and stones of monetary policy or
economic support, but it is definitely a problem we will
have to tackle. It is perhaps the major challenge of our
time.
One of the interesting points in the Speech from the
Throne is the emphasis on the individual and the necessity for the individual to have a sense of identity and a
sense of worth. This is because the individual is being
threatened by "bigness". I think this was brought out very
clearly in the Speech where it says that our modern technological achievements become hollow and mocking to
those who find in society little understanding of their
hopes and little provision for their needs, and who are
dominated by bigness in an increasingly impersonal social
system. There is a danger of their developing a sense of
being overwhelmed and of feeling a sense of futility
because of big government, big business and big labour
unions.
One of the interesting sidelights in the report of the
Science Policy Committee is a reference to a company
making voltmeters. In order to give the man on the production line a sense of contributing to the whole process
of manufacturing, the company has given him the job of
assembling a voltmeter from start to finish. Perhaps, in
view of the assembly-line techniques we have come to
develop as part of our superior technology, we might
consider the step taken by this company to be retrograde.
On the contrary, it has worked very efficiently for that
particular company, and moreover each worker in that
company feels a sense of pride and association with the
company. That is something we should consider when we
deal with the recommendations of the Science Policy
Committee.
At page 365 of Volume II of that committee's report
there is the statement: "Innovation ... must work towards
improving the quality of life rather than increasing its
quantity." On page 363, the report asks the question: How
can the collision between nature and mankind be
stopped? It also asks how the collision between poor
worlds and rich worlds can be stopped. There, again,
concrete recommendations are put forward.
The report also quotes-and I rather like this-René
Dobos in these words:
Whether we want it or not we shall soon be compelled
to reformulate the philosophy of quantitative growth
which has governed the western world since the
industrial revolution.
There are so many constructive recommendations in
this report that I feel we shall be able to play our part
respectably when the time comes for creating effective
legislation along those lines.
Departing from the text of the Speech from the Throne
for a moment, but keeping in mind the concept of "bigness" and its problems, we might consider the contribution made by Eric Nicol, a columnist for the Vancouver
Province. Writing in the February 12 edition of that newspaper, Mr. Nicol contributes to this whole discussion a
few suggestions or ideas about what he refers to as the
"Little Revolution." He says:
Women's lib to the contrary, the biggest revolution
of our time-and it's just getting up a head of steamis the Little Revolution. That is, the revolution that
[Hon. Mrs. Heath d

March 2, 1972

will reverse the principle of growth that has dominated men's thought and action for the past thousand
years.
The revolution is dictated by the Earth's finite
resources of fossil fuels, minerals, water, breathable
air and the sanity that is dependent on having a few
trees between us and the nit with the transistor radio.
As one who has been anti-growth for some years (I
am five foot nine three-quarters and shrinking), I
invite you to speculate with me on what sort of training we must give the businessman, the engineer, the
adman, the teacher-in fact just about everybody
except the hippies who are the vanguard of the march
on the Bastille of Bigness-for-Bigness'-sake.
We shall have to:
Re-train the business executive to think small.
Teach the engineer to keep the production line
slowed down.
School the teacher to convey to his classes the mathematical concept that multiplication is morally wrong,
that to add is human, to subtract divine, and happiness is a square root.
Burn all industrial and economic graphs drawn to
show (a) increased production, (b) greater volume of
sales, (c) higher gross national anything.
He continues like this for several other points in his revolutionary platform, and then says that we shall have to:
Outlaw football, basketball and other spectator
sports that glorify the oversized. Subsidize midgets,
and the games midgets play (run-under-the-hurdles,
miniature golf, etc.)
Have the government take over advertising, commissioning the admen to write commercials for things
that cannot be bought and that belong to everyone.
Delight in a fresh, evening breeze. The smile of a
wanted child. The smell of the human body that no
longer needs lasting protection against nervous perspiration because there are fewer things to get nervous
about.
Such are a few of the possible skirmishes of the
Little Revolution. I hope you will agree that the Little
Revolution is the biggest thing since the Industrial
Revolution, the Reformation and the invention of
chewing gum all rolled into one.
Why not be the first in your block to form a revolutionary cell? Remember, no bucking for a larger membership. There's nothing wrong with a one-man cell,
so long as we get enough of him to make it us.
Mr. Nicol then concludes in two-point type, the smallest
type-face you can get, with the words "Think Shrink".
With an ability displayed only by the fine humorists, Mr.
Nicol has summed up perhaps the main problem touched
upon in the Speech from the Throne, and a problem with
which the Science Policy Committee report deals, namely,
that we have to rethink our concept of growth for
growth's sake and make sure that what we are building is
what we really want.

SENATE DEBATES

One item not mentioned in the reports of the Poverty
Committee, the Science Policy Committee, and the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance, but which is
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, is a project
designed to alleviate isolation in time as well as in space. I
refer to the Heritage Canada concept which will preserve
items and collections from Canada's past. It is important
to combat isolation in time for one simple reason, and that
is that tomorrow is today's dream while yesterday is
today's memory. We live not just today, but are part of
yesterday and tomorrow. For this reason I hope that we
shall find in Heritage Canada a concept worthy of our
support.

Honourable senators, I have touched on only a few of
the proposals in the Speech from the Throne, but I think it
is readily apparent that the Senate is, and will be, well
prepared to deal with the pertinent legislation emanating
from the Speech. Because we are not subject to the same
type of pressure that seems to be prevalent in the other
place, we need not mistake the urgent for the important,
and armed with our committees' recommendations we
should, I think, with profit to our country, always be able
to distinguish the important from the urgent.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Smith, for Hon. Mrs. Fergusson,
debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 7, at 8 p.m.

AGRICULTURE
DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING STANDING SENATE
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Hazen Argue moved, pursuant to notice:
That in the opinion of this House it is desirable, in
the interest of both eastern and western agriculture,
to establish a Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider legislation and other matters of concern to agriculture that may be referred to the said
Committee by the Senate.
He said: Honourable senators, I am pleased to move this
motion and to have it seconded by Senator Lafond. It is a
matter of importance that the Senate should consider the
establishment of a Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture.
Agriculture in this country faces a great many problems. Income from agriculture is low, and much of the
poverty existing in Canada is located in rural areas. There
is much in common between the poverty of the poor
associated with agriculture and that associated with the
poor who live in our urban centres. Both are exploited.
0 (2010)

I think it is appropriate that this motion is moved and
seconded by a senator from western Canada and a senator from eastern Canada respectively.
It is true that agriculture, as the years go by, becomes
relatively less important to Canada, but it is still of major
importance. Some two million Canadians obtain their
livelihood directly from agriculture, and some five million
are listed in the 1966 census as rural Canadians, so
agriculture itself still embraces a significant proportion of
Canadians. It is important, I believe, to have improved
legislation for agriculture, and to have improved consideration of that legislation by the Senate.
In the last few years a number of important pieces of
legislation dealing with agriculture have been passed by
Parliament. I have not carried out any research into legislation affecting agriculture back to the beginning of this
country, but I have extracted from the records the various
agricultural acts passed by Parliament over the last six
years. There have been some 19 pieces of legislation, and I
would think most of them are of substantial importance.

SENATE DEBATES

to time the Board was selling coarse grain to customers
overseas at a price lower than what they were charging
within Canada. Honourable Senator McNamara certainly
knows much more about this than I do, but the Canadian
Wheat Board, as I understand it, was following a policy of
domestic pricing for oats and barley in relation to the cost
of imported American corn. Therefore, it has been able to
maintain a price somewhat higher than the prices they
have to take on the export market.
But my main point is that this kind of conflict might be
resolved by a Senate committee hearing representations
from both sides. I should think that within our nation
there are methods by which we can work out prices and
costs and markets in such a way as to be fair to the
producers of western Canada and the producers of eastern Canada.
All of us know that in the House of Commons, especially those of us who have taken part in the debates in that
place over the years, political parties take partisan positions, and that to stay alive in the other place you assume
that your own party is always right and the other party is
always wrong. Thus, when some particular matter of
great public importance is referred to the agricultural
committee, a matter that may have considerable merit,

albeit one that may have considerable weaknesses, it gets
so torn about by partisan discussion in the committee that
as a result the committee itself is inoperative and it
becomes impossible for the required legislation to go
through the normal processes in the other place.
It seems to me that a Senate committee might give a
nonpartisan hearing, a fair hearing, to some of the important policy questions affecting agriculture. We might be
able to come up with recommendations from time to time
that would appeal to all interests concerned. We might do
justice to the agricultural producers, to the consumers in
this country and to Canadians generally.
In my opinion there are areas in which such consideration and study might be undertaken. There is the whole

question that has yet to be determined of a stabilization
policy for agriculture, which will remove some of the
insecurity in the production of agricultural products.
There is the question of the adequacy or inadequacy of
terminal facilities for grain on the west coast. Also of
increasing importance is the question of the possibility of

developing overseas markets for our agricultural meat
products. If such important large markets can be
obtained, that would relieve much of the pressure on
agricultural markets within our country.
Honourable senators, I am pleased to have presented
this motion to the Senate. I feel that there are a number of
reasons why, at this time, the Senate should give consider-

ation to the question of setting up a standing committee
on agriculture. In brief, I should like to summarize those
points.

First, the setting up of such a committee would enable
the Senate to make a more thorough and effective study
of legislation in the field of agriculture. It would remove
some of the pressure and embarrassment and the inevitable criticism that comes from dealing with important
legislation in a rush at the end of a session.
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

March 7 1972

Second, it would make for a realistic and practical
study of controversial questions that now get bogged
down in the highly partisan filibusters that have become
the hallmark of the Commons Committee on Agriculture.
The committee would, I believe, come up with constructive proposals of benefit to the agricultural industry
across Canada.
Third, on instructions from the Senate the committee
could initiate inquiries into issues that now threaten bitterness and division between eastern and western agriculture, as, for example, the whole question of feed grain
prices and transportation policies. This committee could
make recommendations that would be fair to both eastern
and western agriculture.
O (2030)

Fourth, it could conduct specific inquiries into serious
agricultural problems of a regional nature; for example,
those of Kent County, New Brunswick, already detailed in
the Senate by Senator Michaud.
Fifth, it could consider long-range policies in the interests of a healthy agricultural and rural economy.
I have pleasure, honourable senators, in moving this
motion.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Lafond, debate adjourned.
HEALTH. WELFARE AND SCIENCE
PROPOSED STUDY BY COMMITTEE OF
LABOUR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTES AFFECTING PUBLIC
SERVICES-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. J.Campbell Haig moved, pursuant to notice:

That the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science be instructed to examine and
report upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting
public services.
He said: Honourable senators, Wednesday last, March 1,
I made a speech in the course of the debate on the
Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. I was
followed by Senator Desruisseaux and Senator Lawson.
The theme of my speech was the question of strikes
affecting the public service. I shall repeat part of what I
said on that occasion. We have had several strikes in the
past few months and are threatened with several more;
moreover, strikes in the public service, in addition to
being a cursed inconvenience, which is a mild description,
are also a serious burden on the consumer, the economy
and, I might add, the innocent public. Procedures presently being followed to settle disputes and differences
between labour and management are not proving sufficiently successful in avoiding strikes-a fact that has
become evident in the past 18 months. Federal laws in this
area are far from clear owing to the fact that the Bryden
Commission restricted itself to studying, at length, the
effects of the Public Service Staff Relations Act. For
those reasons, and because we have worthy representatives of both labour and management in this chamber,
men with significant experience in resolving differences
between labour and management, and because a number
of senators have indicated a definite interest in the Sen-

7

ate's undertaking a study of this kind, and because a
formula must be found by which rational and honest men
on both sides can arrive at reasonable solutions to their
issues without recourse to strikes, which harm our economy and, at times, jeopardize the well-being of a vast
number of citizens, I move that this labour-management
question be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Health, Welfare and Science. Under our rules, subjects
affecting labour relations are usually dealt with by this
committee, but if honourable senators feel that such a
study should be made by a special committee of the
Senate, I would have no objection.
The ideal situation would be for this committee to look
into the various approaches which are followed in negotiating labour-management disputes, both in private
industry and public service. It would appear that some
are more successful than others.
Last week Senator Lawson of British Columbia said
that his organization has used the collective bargaining
method with the dairy industry for 53 years, without a
single strike. If this industry can negotiate without striking why cannot this method be applied successfully in
other areas?
What we must ascertain is why some collective bargaining procedures are resolved without strike action being
taken, while other methods seem to bog down and provoke costly work stoppages. Is it because some unions are
greedy? Is it because some employers are hard-hearted
and tight-fisted? Or is it because the machinery used in
certain cases is not efficient? We must also determine
whether federal legislation covering such matters is a help
or a hindrance.
Senator Martin's reply, as Government Leader, to Senator Cameron's question regarding the Public Service Staff
Relations Act, indicates that all is not as clear as crystal in
federal legislation pertaining to labour-management
relations.
I would suggest that the prime purpose of this committee, whether it be the Standing Senate Committee on
Health, Welfare and Science, or a special committee,
would be to study the various methods of resolving
labour-management difficulties to determine which methods are the most successful, and whether they might be
given universal application. To my mind, this is a positive
approach to the problem and one which would likely bear
more fruit than a study regarding the right to strike of
public servants who are performing essential services. I
do not go that far.
Honourable senators, a study of this kind is obviously
necessary as you look back over the past 18 to 24 months.
We have the talent which is required in this chamber. We
have men who are experienced in settling disputes
between labour and management. So I would say to you,
honourable senators, let us get on with it.

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I had the

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 2, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at
the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Buckwold, seconded by Hon. Miss Lapointe, for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable senators, like
those who have preceded me in this debate, I congratulate
Senator Buckwold, who moved the Address in Reply to
the Speech from the Throne, and Senator Lapointe, who
seconded the motion. Both senators are recognized as
valuable additions to this house, and both by their excellent speeches on this occasion have convinced their colleagues that the contributions to debates which we expect
they will make in the future will be most worth while and
will add greatly to the prestige of this chamber.
This session's Speech from the Throne pleases me,
because it opens up and puts great stress on the importance of a field scarcely mentioned in earlier years, that of
human relations within Canada. Previous Throne
Speeches have been mostly concerned with the improvement in the economic life of Canada, in ways to increase
our Gross National Product and with matters concerning
our relations with other countries. All these are very
important, but so are these humanitarian considerations
concerning the relations of Canadians with each other
and the quality of life in Canada, about which too little
has been said in earlier Throne Speeches. This Throne
Speech looks at conditions and at living within Canada.
The legislation outlined in it will take us a long way
toward the just society that we expect Canada will be in
the years to come.
Tonight I plan to limit myself almost entirely to references to the policies mentioned in the Throne Speech that
will improve the quality of life for Canadian women and
will ensure for them equality in Canadian society which,
as the Speech itself says, is long overdue. I also propose to
remind you of steps that the government has already
taken to make this policy effective.
To impress on the Prime Minister and members of his
cabinet of the urgency of legislation in this area, several
women's groups have recently made presentations to
them. On January 24 the National Council of Womenwhich ever since its founding by Lady Aberdeen in 1898
has been widely referred to as the parliament of women-

SENATE DEBATES
led by its president, Helen Hnatyshyn, widow of our
former colleague in this chamber, John Hnatyshyn, presented to the Prime Minister and the cabinet their annual
brief. It supported a number of the recommendations of
the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada.
In addition to such support they asked of the government
that steps be taken for the preservation and retention in
Canada of objects of historical and cultural value. They
will be pleased, as I am, that the Speech from the Throne
forecast the introduction of a bill to establish for this
purpose a corporation to be known as Heritage Canada.
This is something which is greatly needed if we are to
preserve the many irreplaceable objects which relate to
our Canadian history.
Also in January the national ad hoc committee on the
Status of Women, who claim to represent 40 organizations
with about two million members, led by its chairman, Mrs.
Laura Sabia, met the Honourable Bryce Mackasey, who
has responsibility for the government regarding the royal
commission recommendations. At that time they pressed
for action by the government in connection with 10 major
areas of concern, which were day care, family planning,
divorce, immigration, citizenship, women under criminal
law, appointment of women to boards and commissions,
equal pay, inclusion of sex and marital status in human
rights codes, and appointment of a federal council on the
status of women. Most of the matters referred to by this
group are recommendations of the royal commission.
This ad hoc committee plans to hold a national conference
in Toronto on April 7 and 8, when they will study what
further action they can take to improve the status of
women in our changing society.
On Monday February 28 a presentation was made to the
Prime Minister by the Canadian Federation of Business
and Professional Women's Clubs, led by their president,
Miss Charlotte VanDine. They stressed the report of the
Royal Commission on the Status of Women. They commended some of the steps which have already been taken
by the government to promote the equality of women, and
they urged further carrying out of this policy by the
implementation of the recommendations of the royal commission. This group dealt mainly with the matters of
economic employment and social conditions for women,
issues which the federation has promoted over the past 40
years.
* (2050)

I am told that both men and women throughout
Canada, through organizations and groups and as
individuals, are showing great interest in this area, and
many letters are being written to the Honourable Bryce
Mackasey, to other ministers, and to the Privy Council
Office, expressing their views on how equality can be
achieved. All these submissions are being seriously considered by the government.
I support the briefs which have been presented by those
women's groups which I have mentioned. I am anxious to
see further legislation passed which will eliminate any
discrimination against women which still exists in
Canada.
Although the Royal Commission on the Status of
Women in Canada was appointed by the previous government, there is evidence that the present government sup[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.]

March 7, 1972

ports its conclusions and recommendations. Members of
the government have shown, through their speeches and
actions, that the government is committed to a policy of
establishing equality between men and women, and has
already taken steps towards implementing that policy
wherever it has been able to do so without the necessity
for legislative action.
Ministerial responsibility for this has been assigned to
the Honourable Bryce Mackasey, and Mrs. Freda Paltiel,
of the Privy Council Office, has been appointed to act as
the co-ordinating link for the interdepartmental committee which the government set up to study the commission's report and find ways and means of implementing
recommendations contained therein.
The purpose of the committee was to study the commission's recommendations with a view to implementing
those aimed at the federal level. The committee made an
exhaustive study of both the recommendations and policies existing in all government departments to determine
whether those policies conformed with the recommendations.
All government departments were urged to examine the
procedures being followed, and to determine whether
they were contrary to the government's policy of equality
between men and women employees. If evidence of inequality existed, the departments concerned were asked to
make the necessary changes.
I understand that the interdepartmental committee submitted its report at the end of 1971. I do not know what
recommendations were contained in the report, but I trust
that the government has been urged to implement the
recommendations of the royal commission which have not
yet been implemented.
I hope also that the government has been recommended
to set up a human rights commission in accordance with
that outlined in Recommendation 165 of the royal commission, which states:
We recommend that federal, provincial, and territorial Human Rights Commissions be set up that
would (a) be directly responsible to Parliament, provincial legislatures or territorial councils, (b) have
power to investigate the administration of human
rights legislation as well as the power to enforce the
law by laying charges and prosecuting offenders, (c)
include within the organization for a period of seven
to 10 years a division dealing specifically with the
protection of women's rights, and (d) suggest changes
in human rights legislation and promote widespread
respect for human rights.
In addition, I hope that the government has been recommended to establish a federal status of women council
and that it will accept such a recommendation. The council would be directly responsible to Parliament, as set out
in Recommendation 166 which states:
We recommend that a federal Status of Women
Council, directly responsible to Parliament, be established to (a) advise on matters pertaining to women
and to report annually to Parliament of the progress
being made in improving the status of women in
Canada, (b) undertake research on matters relevant to
the status of women and suggest research topics that
can be carried out by governments, private business,

universities, and voluntary associations, (c) establish
programmes to correct attitudes and prejudices
adversely affecting the status of women, (d) propose
legislation, policies and practices to improve the
status of women, and (e) systematically consult with
women's bureaux or similar provincial organizations,
and with voluntary associations particularly concerned with the problems of women.

The Chairman of the Public Service Commission, Mr.
John Carson, is a strong supporter of equality as between
men and women in the labour force, and to date several
concrete improvements have been achieved in the Public
Service in that regard. The first of these is in the area of
administrative support staff. In this area two training
programs were launched in February of this year. Under

supporter, discrimination against women on grounds of
sex or marital status is out of date, and this change in the
National Housing Act loan regulations is a welcome one.
One of the recommendations of the royal commission is
that more women judges be appointed, and in that regard
women throughout Canada greeted with delight and
approval the appointment by the present government of
Réjane Laberge Colas to the Superior Court of Quebec,
Mabel M. Van Camp, Q.C., to the Supreme Court of
Ontario, and Janet Boland to the York County Court,
Ontario. We eagerly await similar appointments throughout Canada.
The royal commission and many women's groups who
presented briefs stressed that there should be more
appointments of women to federal boards, commissions,
corporations, councils, advisory committees, and task
forces. In that respect, at the meeting on February 28, to
which I referred earlier, the Prime Minister said that of
1,380 such appointments by his government up to the
middle of February 1972, 116, or 8 per cent, were women.
That is not to say that there were 116 different women
appointed, as some of the women were given two appointments. At the same time he admitted that this was not a
very high rate, although it is a higher rate than had been
in effect previously.
The Prime Minister also quoted from a United States
press release which indicated that in the United States,
over a period of three and a half years, only 200 women
were appointed to presidential advisory boards and commissions, so considering the number of advisory boards
and commissions in the United States and the size of their
population it would seem that the number of appointments made in Canada compares favourably.
Women are grateful for these appointments, and await
more with great interest. However, we do hope that in the
future there will not be only token appointments of one
woman to a board, but that all boards will be made up of
a fair proportion of women.
Another recommendation of the royal commission was
that women as well as men be admitted to the military
colleges operated by the Department of National Defence.
It is of interest here to note that Miss Flora MacDonald, a
former senior aide of our colleague Senator Grosart,
while in a position he held prior to his appointment to this
chamber, was in 1971 accepted into the National Defence
College at Kingston for an eleven month course preparatory to assuming an administrative position in the Public
Service. This is a noteworthy breakthrough for women,
and I hope it will open the way for the admission of more
women to our military colleges.
A further recommendation of the royal commission was
that sex typing of the occupations of employees working
in the Senate and the House of Commons be discontinued.
In accordance with this recommendation, His Honour the
Speaker of the Senate arranged for the appointment of
two girl pages for the Senate, although previous appointments to this position had been considered a prerogative
of the male sex. You may be interested to know that many
women have written to tell me they feel this is an important break in what had seemed to them an impregnable
wall which up to then had prevented females from holding such appointments. I trust that in future, women will
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.1

March 7, 1972

be considered eligible for any appointments, including
administrative appointments in both the Senate and the
other place.
* (2110)

There are other matters of particular interest to women
concerning which recommendations were made by the
royal commission, to which the government has given
considerable attention, such as the provision for day-care
centres and family planning. Although evidently the government has not as yet decided to follow the recommendations of the royal commission regarding day care, it has
become involved in day care to a considerable extent
through different departments.
I think this is not widely known, but I have learned that
during the past year the provinces, through the Canada
Assistance Plan, have claimed from the Department of
National Health and Welfare shareable costs for the purchase of day-care services for children for a total of $3.9
million. The Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
has recognized day care as a housing-related facility, and
has provided, in partnership with the provinces, some
capital assistance for these centres.
Under nonprofit and limited dividend housing programs, two centres have been funded in Regina and
Toronto as part of overall project costs. Under the Local
Incentives Program of the Department of Manpower and
Immigration, 80 projects for the establishment and
improvement of day-care centres have been approved at a
cost of nearly $2 million in federal funds. Assistance is
given to day-care programs also through the Department
of Regional Economic Expansion, the Department of
Indian Affairs, and the Department of the Secretary of
State. Thus, even though we have not followed the recommendations of the royal commission to really go into the
day-care business, we certainly have given a great deal to
help establish day-care programs throughout Canada.
There is also the matter of family planning, in which
people are greatly interested. Bill S-15, which was first
read in October, 1968, has led to the dissemination of birth
control information. In September 1970, the Honourable
John Munro, Minister of National Health and Welfare,
announced a federal program on information, training
and research in family planning. The announcement at
the time said in part that:
The government recognized and supported the right
of Canadians to exercise free individual choice in the
practice of family planning.
Since October 1970, following the report of a special
committee on the safety of contraceptives, the Department of National Health and Welfare has been engaged in
a Canada-wide family planning program, in co-operation
with the provinces and with voluntary and professional
groups. Last week the National Conference on Family
Planning was held in Ottawa, sponsored by the department, at which it was learned that in 1970 and 1971 the
Department of National Health and Welfare made grants
to two family planning organizations in the amount of
$550,000. The minister announced that for 1972 and 1973,
$1,050,000 will be available for family planning, approximately one-half of which will go to voluntary
organizations.

SENATE DEBATES

Besides the steps to implement the recommendations of
the royal commission which the government was able to
take without the necessity of invoking legislation, a
number of acts have been passed which are in accordance
with the recommendations and the requests that have
been received.
An act to amend the Canada Labour (Standards) Code,
passed in 1971, provided for maternity leave, and also for
payment by employers of equal wages to male and female
employees doing the same or similar work, requiring similar skill, effort and responsibility under similar working
conditions in the same establishment. This amendment
regarding equal pay replaces the Female Employees
Equal Pay Act, passed in 1956, which had not worked
satisfactorily, mostly because it required the person
aggrieved to lay the complaint, which put many
employees in a difficult position and they preferred to put
up with what they felt to be discrimination against them
rather than create unpleasant feelings with their employer. The new act is supposed to eliminate this necessity.
The Unemployment Insurance Act, passed in 1971, provides for universal coverage, for paid maternity leave,
and for nondiscrimination on grounds of sex or marital
status in employment referrals by the Department of
Manpower and Immigration. Both the amendments to the
Canada Labour (Standards) Code and the provisions in
the sections of the Unemployment Insurance Act were
among the recommendations of the royal commission.
According to the Throne Speech, a number of bills will
be introduced this session to make further provision for
the equality of women. One that was introduced on February 21 this year will, when passed, amend the Criminal
Code to give women the same rights and responsibilities
as men regarding jury service in criminal matters. Honourable senators may recall that Bill S-20 of the last
session had the same objective. Although it was passed by
the Senate and received first reading in the other place,
Parliament adjourned before it received further consideration. However, it is a great satisfaction to me that it is
now part of Bill C-2, which has been introduced by the
Minister of Justice in the present session.
Other subjects covered in Bill C-2 which are of great
interest to women, and which were discussed in the report
of the royal commission, are the abolition of whipping as
an additional punishment and the abolishing of attempted
suicide as an offence under the Criminal Code.
The Speech from the Throne indicates that there will be
important amendments to the Fair Employment Practices
Act, and in view of previous statements it is hoped that
these amendments will provide for non-discrimination in
employment on the grounds of sex.
At the meeting on February 28, when the Canadian
Federation of Business and Professional Women presented their brief to the Prime Minister and the cabinet, the
Secretary of State for External Affairs, the Honourable
Mitchell Sharp, referred to requests that had been
received asking that a married woman be issued a passport in her maiden name without the name of her husband appearing on it. The custom in such cases up to that
time had been to add the name of the husband to her
passport as an observation. The Secretary of State for
External Affairs announced that the government had

decided to accede to this request and that, should a married woman apply for a passport in her maiden name and
request that her married name and status not be included
on the ground that she is not using her married name, and
does not intend to use it, the passport office will issue a
passport in her maiden name without any mention of the
name of her husband. This may seem a small matter, but
it is of great importance to many women.
* (2120)

At the same meeting, the Honourable Mitchell Sharp
referred to ILO Convention No. 100, concerning equal
remuneration for male and female workers doing work of
equal value. Women have for years, been urging the government to ratify that convention. He stated that letters
had been sent by his department to all provincial governments, asking for their concurrence in such ratification,
but that up to that date, February 28, only five provinces
had replied.
However, as nine provinces already have equal pay
legislation on their statute books, and as in the tenth
province, Quebec, the principle is implied in the definition
of discrimination, which includes sex, in the Employment
Discrimination Act passed in 1964, it would seem that the
provinces have no objection to the principle of equal pay.
It seems to me that the federal government might follow
up the letters already sent to the provincial governments,
and might point out that those governments have already
passed legislation endorsing the principle of equal pay.
This might bring forth their acceptance.
I am also planning to suggest to the women who have
been pressing the federal government to ratify ILO Convention No. 100, that they might ask their provincial governments whether they have advised the federal government of their concurrence in ratification and, if not, to
urge the provincial governments to do so. I know that for
as long as I can remember women have been asking the
federal government to ratify this convention, and now it
seems useless for them to continue asking the federal
government directly.
As evidenced by women's groups who have appeared
before the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers, women
are actively seeking equality and are demanding from the
government more changes in legislation and in administrative action in government departments and in crown
corporations. However, from what I have said about the
action that has already taken place, honourable senators
must realize that the report of the Royal Commission on
the Status of Women in Canada has not been put on the
shelf by the government to gather dust. One member of
the department said to me that it is being studied so much
that instead of gathering dust it is gathering thumbprints.
Viewing objectively the accomplishments of the present
government towards establishing equality and better
opportunities for women, and comparing what has been
done with the accomplishments of any previous government in that area, one has to admit that considerable
progress has been made since 1968. The women of
Canada have reason to believe that they can rely on the
statement in the Speech from the Throne that, in accordance with the expressed policy of the government, steps
will be taken during the present session to ensure the
equality of women in Canada.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I regret
very much that absence on arrears of academic duties left
over from last year prevented me from hearing the
speeches given by the mover and seconder of the Address,
and indeed most of the other speeches which have been
delivered in this debate. I may say, however, that those I
did not hear I have read, if not word for word, very nearly
so. I should like to congratulate very warmly not only the
mover and seconder of the Address but also all those who
have spoken in the debate. It seems to me that the
speeches of all have been of a notable kind and have
made distinguished contributions to the discussion of
public affairs.
I noticed in the Globe and Mail a column in which the
writer intimated that the debate on the Address in the
other place was a mere charade. I do not know whether
the word was well chosen but it was evident that the
writer did not think very highly of the substance of the
speeches which were made in the other place on the
Address. I do not think that any impartial observer, reading the speeches on the Address here, could make that
kind of remark. I cannot think of one speech which did
not have a marked contribution to make to the enlightened and enlightening discussion of public affairs.
Honourable senators, having said that, I would like to
comment briefly on one or two particular points in some
of the speeches and to make one or two suggestions on the
better use of this chamber in the legislative process; and
then to offer some comments on a constitutional point
which arose elsewhere.
Before I embark on the substance of what I wish to say,
however, I want to make a rather, shall I say, discourteous
remark, perhaps, about what I think was the rather discourteous behaviour of some of the people who came up
at the opening of this session, and were out beyond there.
I do not know whether they were members of the other
place or not, but I think it was evident to other senators,
as it was to me-probably more evident to them because
of their more acute hearing-that there was a great deal
of hubbub, of conversation and of uproar, I might almost
say, going on outside in the lobby of the Senate chamber
while the Speech from the Throne was being delivered.
That was most unfortunate. I think it is a reflection on the
conduct of affairs in Parliament; and I venture to suggest
that, if people who come up here to listen to the Speech
from the Throne cannot mend their manners and keep
quiet while His Excellency is addressing the two houses,
they should stay away. As far as I know, there is no
compulsion on them to come up here. If they come up,
they should behave like civilized, decent human beings
and show proper respect for the Crown and the institutions of this country and the people who represent them. I
am sorry to have to make that remark but I was intensely
irritated, disgusted and ashamed at the hubbub which
went on during the reading of the Speech from the
Throne, while His Excellency was speaking to us.
Honourable senators, I wish to turn for a moment to
comment on some of the things said by earlier speakers in
the debate. I was pleased to notice the suggestion by
Senator Buckwold that we should have a committee on
urban affairs-whether a standing committee, as I think
he suggested, or a committee set up each session. When I
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.]

March 7 , 109
M~ar~h '7 10'79

was sitting on the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution, I was struck again and again by the number of
times that representatives in municipalities from all
across the country set forth their grievances at considerable length, and their feelings that they were not getting
substantial justice from their provincial governments. We
all know that municipal institutions are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures. We all
know, also, that it is almost impossible in modern circumstances to separate completely the activities of the Government of Canada and the Parliament of Canada from
the affairs of the municipalities.
* (2130)

This is, in fact, becoming more and more difficult not
only because of the intermeshing of the two jurisdictions,
but because of the extraordinary, one might almost say
the galloping, increase in the proportion of the people of
this country who live in urban areas; also in the proportion of those who live in very large urban areas-the
metropolitan centres. So that it seems to me the Senate
could perform a useful function indeed, if it had such a
committee as Senator Buckwold suggested to look at this
whole urban affairs situation and to offer to the Government of Canada, and of course indirectly also to provincial governments and indeed municipal governments,
suggestions on ways in which the plight of the municipalities-and I do not think the word "plight" is putting it too
strongly-might be ameliorated. I hope very much that
that suggestion of Senator Buckwold's will be taken up. I
think it would also be a help to the minister of the Government of Canada charged with urban affairs and housing.
The second particular point that I should like to comment on is one that Senator Lapointe made when she
spoke of our having an observer now in the Organization
of American States. As not infrequently, I am going to be
a trifle unorthodox here, because I hope that is as far as
we shall go in the Organization of American States. I have
long been convinced that it would be a great mistake for
this country to go into the Organization of American
States. It would be a splendid way of demonstrating how
not to win friends and influence people. I am perfectly
convinced that if we were a full member of the Organization of American States, we should find that the United
States would expect us always to say, "Me too," or at least
remain discreetly silent, if we could do no more than that,
to anything that the United States suggested. And on the
other hand we should find that the Latin American countries would expect us to stand up with them against the
United States. I think we should find ourselves constantly
in the position, whatever we did, of being the targets of
tut-tutting, if not abuse, from both sides.
An observer may be very useful, but it would be the
height of folly for the Government of Canada to make this
country a full member of the Organization of American
States. I strongly hope that nothing of the sort will be
done without thorough investigation and consideration of
the matter by both Houses of Parliament.
I read with great interest the contributions of the
Leader of the Opposition to the debate. They were, as
always, scintillating, and every word of them thoroughly
worth listening to and reading. But there was one remark
that he made that I confess I felt rather stretched the facts

March 7, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

of the situation, when he described the general policies of
this government as "creeping socialism." He went on to
set forth his own views which, it seemed to me, might
perhaps with at least equal accuracy, and I think greater
accuracy, be described as "galloping laissez faire." I was
rather appalled at the degree to which the Leader of the
Opposition appeared to be harking back to the Manchester laissez faire school of political economy, which I
should have thought gave almost its last gasp in Dicey's
Preface to his Law of the Constitution. No, it would be
his other one, Law and Public Opinion in England.I refer
to that notable preface in which he lamented at great
length and with great eloquence practically everything
that had happened in Great Britain since 1880.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition did not go as
far as that, but it seemed to me that he grossly exaggerated the extent to which the present government could be
described as going in for socialism of any kind, even the
creeping variety. I could not help feeling that possibly a
certain word of caution might be uttered here; a certain
suggestion that perhaps it would be a little more accurate
and a little fairer not to apply what, for him, is evidently a
very derogatory tag to the policies of the present
government.
If, of course, one is prepared to say with Lord Salisbury-I do not mean the present one, but his grandfather,
if I remember correctly-that we are all socialists now,
well, very well; but it seems to me that otherwise this was
an exaggeration.
Having said that by way of adverse criticism of what the
Leader of the Opposition said, I should like to add at once
that I strongly support the suggestion he made that the
present government should appoint more Conservative
senators. Let me also say at once that this is not by way of
criticism on my part of the qualities of our colleagues of
the Conservative Party in this house. With all due respect
to them, I think it can safely be said that their numbers
are so few now that it is difficult for them, with all their
talents and all their industry, to fulfil adequately the
duties which fall upon them in this chamber. I have had
some conversation with one or two of them who are
friends of mine, and I think I am not mistranslating what
they have said to me when I make that remark. It seems to
me that the present situation does impose a serious
burden upon honourable senators of the Conservative
Party. Certainly, even if the government were to fill up all
the vacancies with Conservatives, it would be in no
danger of being defeated in this house by a solid phalanx
of Conservatives augmented by the number which that
would involve. So I hope very much that, in spite of the
strong pressures which always exist upon any government to appoint its own supporters to this house, the
present government will from time to time see fit, I suppose the Conservatives would say, "to leaven the lump" a
little with the appointment of a certain number of Conservative senators. I do not mean just any Conservatives or
any kind of Conservative back-room boy or party hack.
There are distinguished Conservatives in this country
who would be ornaments to this house and who would
make a great contribution to its proceedings.
I had intended to say something on the question of
industrial relations in the Public Service and essential

industries, a subject which Senator Haig, Senator Desruisseaux and Senator Lawson ail spoke about in their
speeches, but I shall defer anything I had intended to say
on that until there is the opportunity to do so on the
substantive motion which Senator Haig moved this evening. I shall merely make at this time the remark that I
think his motion deserves the most serious consideration.
Personally, I support it. I think the investigation by our
standing committee which he suggests could be exceedingly useful. I am not prepared to believe that all is for the
best in the best of all possible worlds in the present
situation in labour relations in the public service and our
essential industries. I think a calm, dispassionate, considered investigation of the subject could be of great use
indeed.
As to the business of making the Senate more effective
in the legislative process, of course we very much hope
that the Leader of the Government will prove successful
in the efforts which he assured us he would make to see
that we get legislation from the other place in time to
allow us to give adequate consideration to it. But I must
confess that from my reading of the history of this place I
am afraid it would be rash to assume that the efforts of
the Leader of the Government, however zealous, will be
crowned with complete success. After all, governments
are not entirely free agents in the other place, however
anxious they may be to get their legislation through in
time to bring it up here for us to consider at our-I do not
like to say "our leisure," but for us to consider it with due
deliberation. Whatever their efforts, they may well be
frustrated by the desire of the other house, a perfectly
understandable and laudable desire, to give very full consideration to the legislation there. Sometimes, of course,
one suspects that there is a certain degree of repetition
and a certain degree of partisan ardour in the debates,
failings for which this chamber is less remarkable, I
think. But even apart from that, there may be delays in
presenting legislation here even with the best will in the
world on the part of the government.
0 (2140)
That being so, I should like to suggest that the government consider very seriously introducing into this house a
number of the bills contained in the list submitted by the
Prime Minister for the other place at the opening of the
session. I mentioned this to one member of this house who
has had vast experience and he said at once, "Oh, they are
pretty nearly all money bills and so we couldn't introduce
them here." But I think that a glance at the 29 items in the
list presented by the Prime Minister to the other place will
show that quite a number of them are not obviously
money bills. Of course there are certain ones which are,
but there are others which it seems to me could well have
been introduced here but which have already been introduced in the other place. I think there are still at least half
a dozen which could perfectly be brought in here in the
first place and given a careful examination here before
going down to the other place, a process which I venture
to think would save time for the government and for the
House of Commons and would be in the public interest
generally. We have had since 1947 a provision in our Rules
whereby a minister could come here, present legislation
and take part in the debate on the legislation and even in

SENATE DEBATES
the discussions in committee, although of course he could
not vote. It seems to me that this is an eminently practical
procedure and that the government might very well consider making some use of this particular device for expediting the work of Parliament and giving this chamber
more adequate opportunity to perform its duties. I notice,
for example, that there is a proposal for dealing with the
fair employment practices legislation, with wildlife, with
competition, with cigarette products, and, I think, with the
territorial councils of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories and, of course, the Canada Labour Code.
Now, some people may say that we could not very well
bring in any of those things here, but I really cannot see
why not. Some of them surely are not matters of acute
partisan controversy, and some others even if they are
matters of strong partisan controversy might very well
receive here the kind of careful investigation which our
committees are accustomed to giving to legislation of this
sort.
The other suggestion I have to make for improving the
effectiveness of the Senate in the legislative process is
that we should do again with a number of pieces of
legislation that are to come up or have already come up in
the other bouse what we did last year with the famous tax
reform legislation. I have no wish to rekindle the fires
which raged here at the end of December. I do not wish to
rouse my friend Senator O'Leary, for example, to some
more of those stinging, searing denunciations which he
hurled at his colleagues who were not of his own party. I
must say that I regret very much that he was not present
to witness what he so yearned to see, the spectacle of nine
Liberal senators voting against the government on a certain motion. However, I do not wish to go back into past
history about that or to discuss whether in fact what we
did was adequate. Personally I think it was, in all the
circumstances. But I do say that if we are likely to be
presented once again, as I fear we may be, with complicated legislation and with very little time to consider it at the
proper stage here, we might very well do again what the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee did on the
Senate's instruction with the tax reform legislation. We
might give these measures a very thorough going-over
first before they come up here, a process which I think
everybody will admit had some effect upon the tax reform
legislation-not as much as some honourable senators
would have liked, but undoubtedly some. It would be
better than not being able to give the measures any real
consideration at all.
Honourable senators, the last thing I want to talk about
is, as I indicated earlier, a constitutional question. To my
mind, one of the functions of this house should be to
defend the Constitution, and the rights, not only of this
house but of the other house and of the people, and for
that reason I feel it necessary to draw to the attention of
the Senate, and to comment on, certain erroneous statements on constitutional usage by a minister of the Crown
on the first day of this session. He asserted that it is the
first duty of the House of Commons to consider the
Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, and that
any other course would be a breach of the traditional
courtesy extended to the Crown by the Commons. But,
honourable senators, the minister was under a misapprefHon. Mr. Forsey.]

hension and a misapprehension fraught with peril to the
liberties of the House of Commons and of the people. For
that reason I think his statements cannot be allowed to
pass unchallenged.
I yield to no one in my loyalty and devotion to the
Crown, and my respect not only for the traditional courtesies extended to the Crown by both Houses of Parliament
but for all our parliamentary traditions, rooted in our
heritage from the Mother of Parliaments and sanctioned
by more than a century of our own usage. But in my
judgment there is no conflict between the rights of the
Crown and the rights of the people, and the rights of both
Houses of Parliament, properly understood. It is the
ancient and undoubted right of the House of Commons to
consider any business it sees fit before taking into consideration the Speech from the Throne. That right, as we all
know, is usually, although not invariably, asserted by
giving first reading to a pro forma bill. That is done in this
house, of course, as well as in the other, before the Speech
from the Throne is considered. This practice dates from
March 22, 1603, when the English House of Commons
resolved, "That the first day of every sitting in every
Parliament some one bill and no more receiveth a first
reading for form sake". The reference is to May's Third
Edition, page 188. In his Fifteenth Edition, at page 277,
May says that this is done, and I quote directly:
-in order to assert their right of deliberating without
reference to the immediate cause of summons.
He adds that, "In the Commons the bill is only required to
be read before the report of the Queen's Speech, and
other business is constantly entered upon before the reading of the bill, as the issue of new writs, the consideration
of matters of privilege, the presentation of papers and the
usual sessional orders and resolutions."
In his Seventeenth Edition, at page 291, he adds:
The order of business on the first day of a session
should be:
1.Motions for the issue of new writs.
2. Sessional orders.
3. Private notice questions.
4. Oral notices of introduction of bills.
5. Matters of privilege.
6. The Queen's speech.
Now, of course, the Canadian Commons is not bound by
all the rules and usages of the British House. By the way,
if honourable senators should feel that this is a little
tedious and rather antiquarian, I think that before I have
finished I shall establish that there is some very distinct
practical as well as symbolic importance in all of this.
However, as I have said, we are not bound in this country
by the rules and usages of either house of the British
Parliament. We have produced our own variations. But in
this matter those variations have only strengthened the
insistence on the traditional British right. As early as 1845
in the oldest legislative body in this country, the Legislature of Nova Scotia-and here I should like to remind
people in this part of the country that the Legislature of
Nova Scotia has now been functioning for well over two
centuries, long before any other legislature in this country-in that assembly, in 1845, a pro forma bill was passed
before considering the Speech from the Throne. This

SENATE DEBATES

procedure was repeated in 1846. In 1847, the Nova Scotia
Assembly went further, and before considering the
Speech from the Throne it gave first reading to a bill
which was not pro forma, but a piece of legislation which
subsequently passed through all stages and received royal
assent. In 1848 and 1849, the Nova Scotia Assembly
returned to the pro forma bill. In the first session of the
1851 assembly it followed the precedent which was set in
1847. The second session of the 1851 assembly again
returned to the pro forma bill.
0 (2150)

In New Brunswick, the Loyalist province par excellence, where the traditional courtesy extended to the
Crown would certainly be observed if it were ever to be
observed, the Assembly introduced a pro forma bill even
earlier than the Nova Scotia Assembly, in 1836. In all the
four sessions which followed 1836, before giving consideration to the Speech from the Throne, the New Brunswick
Assembly gave first reading to bills which subsequently
went through all stages and received royal assent.
The Ontario and Quebec Assemblies, being of more
recent vintage, cannot rival this record. However, each of
these Assemblies in its first session gave first reading to a
pro forma bill before giving consideration to the Speech
from the Throne. To the best of my knowledge, this procedure has been invariably followed in both legislatures.
Our House of Commons did likewise in its first session.
On the second day of that session, November 7, 1867,
before the Speaker had even reported delivery of the
Speech of the Throne, Sir John A. Macdonald moved first
reading of Bill No. 1, an act respecting the administration
of oaths of office-which, of course, is the pro forma bill
which is still used today. This was done before any consideration was given to the Speech from the Throne. To the
best of my belief, this practice has been followed in
almost every session since.
What about the exceptions? Within my memory, there
have been two-in 1926 and in 1950. However, they do
nothing to invalidate the principle that the House of Commons has the right to discuss any business it wishes
before considering the Speech from the Throne. On the
contrary, both of these cases immeasurably strengthen
that principle.
In the 1926 session, before the Speaker had even reported delivery of the Speech from the Throne, Mr. Lapointe,
who was leading the government in the absence of the
Prime Minister, who had been defeated in his own constituency, moved to assert the government's right to retain
office in spite of the fact that it had only 101 seats to the
Conservative's 116. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr.
Meighen, promptly raised a point of order, that this
motion required notice, which had not been given. The
Speaker took the point of order under advisement over
the weekend. However, while the matter was under
advisement, he reported delivery of the Speech from the
Throne, whereapon Mr. Lapointe moved that the Speech
be taken into consideration at the next sitting, and that
the Address in Reply take precedence over all other business except government orders, which he was careful to
explain included his own motion that the government had
the right to retain office.

To that motion, Mr. Meighen moved an amendment of
want of confidence. And it was a corker of an amendment. It left nothing to the imagination. It was couched in
Mr. Meighen's characteristically trenchant style, and that
amendment of want of confidence was debated for more
than four full days and pressed to a division. Only when
this matter had been disposed of was the Address moved.
Mr. Lapointe's original motion disappeared. It went into
limbo. Only when the motion of want of confidence had
been defeated was the Address in Reply to the Speech
from the Throne moved.
A more striking exception, of course, was in 1950 when
Parliament was summoned to deal with the railway strike
and send the railway workers back to work. The first
proceedings at that time were the announcements of
vacancies and the introduction of new members. Then the
Prime Minister, Mr. St. Laurent, moved first reading of
Bill No. 1. Well, there was nothing extraordinary about
that, except that Bill No. 1 this time was not the pro forma
bill. It was an Act for Maintenance of Railway Operations,
which sent the striking railway workers back to work
with compulsory arbitration. The Speaker then reported
delivery of the Speech from the Throne. There was a
motion for certain changes in the standing orders, followed by a motion to take into consideration the Speech
from the Throne as soon as Bill No. 1 had been disposed
of. This was followed by a statement of transfer of certain
duties from the Solicitor General to the Minister of Justice, an announcement setting up the Internal Economy
Commission, tributes to Mr. King, to deceased members,
and to the Honourable Pierre Casgrain, and the
announcement of certain appointments to the ministry.
Then came second reading of the Act for the Maintenance of Railway Operations, Bill No. 1, which took the
greater part of two days. The bill was passed and came to
this chamber. This was followed by notice of royal assent
to the bill, the tabling of certain orders in council, and
remarks dealing with the placement of division bells in
the restaurant and cafeteria. These were followed by
royal assent and adjournment. The following day, after
prayers and presentation of reports, a statement on
Canadian National Railways, and four questions on the
Orders of the Day, the Address was moved and seconded.
In other words, there was a large amount of business
transacted, one part of it being of immense importance.
This was before the Speech from the Throne was even
considered.
There are certain events in two other sessions of recent
years which are relevant. On January 25, 1940, Parliament
was summoned for the famous one-day session, or threehour session, which I am in the habit of calling the addled
session. The other place met at 3 o'clock, and after the
announcement of vacancies and the introduction of new
members, the Prime Minister, Mr. King, duly moved the
pro forma bill, No. 1. He then tabled certain orders in
council, and the Speaker announced the appointment of
an Acting Deputy Sergeant at Arms. Mr. King then moved
adjournment and, despite the fact the motion was not
debatable, he graciously agreed to allow the Conservative
and CCF leaders to speak. The House rose at six o'clock
for the dinner recess and was immediately dissolved by
the Governor General. There was not even a motion for

92

SENATE DEBATES
SNAT DEBTESMarch

consideration of the Speech from the Throne. So much on
that occasion for the alleged first duty of the House of
Commons and the traditional courtesy to the Crown.
In 1968, the present Prime Minister moved first reading
of pro forma bill, No. 1, before the Speaker had even
reported delivery of the Speech from the Throne. Following that, the Prime Minister moved that the speech be
taken into consideration at the next sitting. He then presented the house with a list of bills which the government
proposed to introduce. This was followed by tributes to
Mr. Colin Cameron, an announcement of the setting up of
the Internal Economy Commission, provision for the
appointment of standing committees, and the appointment of the chairman and deputy chairman of committees. On the following day, there was a statement on the
introduction of bills in bilingual form, followed by a
motion for temporary continuance of the provisional rules
of the previous session, and no less than 35 questions on
the Orders of the Day. And only after all this occurred did
the house proceed with its alleged first duty, the consideration of the gracious Speech.
Honourable senators, the ancient and undoubted right
of the Commons to consider anything it wishes before
dealing with the Speech from the Throne is not merely a
quaint custom or a matter of mere symbolic, historic,
theoretical or academic interest. It can have great practical importance as the events of 1926 and 1950 have shown.
* (2200)

It is not impossible-I hope it will not happen, but
between what I hope for and what actually takes place
there is often a great gulf fixed-that we may again have
in this country a minority government emerging from an
election. That is by no means impossible. If that situation
arises, that minority government may then wish to do
exactly what the Honourable Ernest Lapointe wanted to
do in 1926, and secure immediately from the House of
Commons an endorsation of its right to remain in office, if
it decides to remain in office, and not resign immediately
as Mr. St. Laurent did in 1957. It is not impossible that the
Opposition in such circumstances might wish to do exactly what the Opposition did in 1926, present a motion of
want of confidence immediately, before taking into consideration the Speech from the Throne. This, like nearly
every other constitutional usage, is based on common
sense because, after all, what is the use of proceeding to
consider a Speech from the Throne which represents the
policy of a government which is defeated? We must start
again from square one. It is better to decide at once, as
was done in 1926, whether or not this minority government should continue to retain office. If the house is not
prepared to retain it in office, then time is not wasted
going through a long rigmarole on the Address in Reply to

March

7,1972

the Speech from the Throne when the whole thing is going
to be thrown in the wastebasket anyway.
Again I hope it will not happen, but it is not impossible
that we may have an industrial dispute in some essential
industry. I do not think I can be accused, in the light of
recent events, of drawing a long bow here, or giving free
rein to my imagination. It is perfectly possible that we
may again have the kind of situation that we had in the
summer of 1950, a stoppage of work in an essential industry and a decision by the government of the day that it is
necessary to get that industry going immediately and the
workers back to work; necessary, therefore, to pass emergency legislation for that purpose. If that happens, as it
could, then again it would be simply common sense for
the government of the day to follow the practice of Mr. St.
Laurent in 1950 and get the necessary legislation through
double quick; that is, just as fast as the two houses see fit
to pass it. I am not, of course, suggesting that closure or
anything of that sort should be used, but there should not
be the delay occasioned by eight days of debate on an
Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.
Honourable senators, I wish to emphasize that I do not
argue that we should preserve ancient institutions and
practices out of mere ancestor worship. I do argue most
strongly, however, that we should not allow ancient rights
and liberties of the people and the people's representatives to be eroded or taken away, except after due deliberation by, and conscious decision of, the people and their
representatives. That is the reason I have thought it necessary to call attention to the unfortunate statement of the
Leader of the House of Commons at the opening of this
session.
I am confident that the minister had no intention of
trenching upon the rights of the Commons. I am sure that
on reflection he must have realized that he had said rather
more than he intended, and more than the facts warranted. But to allow such statements from so high a quarter to
pass unchallenged might have led to a widespread and
totally unfounded belief that this was an authoritative
statement of the constitutional position. This would have
been doubly dangerous at a time when executive power is
constantly growing and when, therefore, preservation of
the rights of Parliament and of the people calls, as never
before in my judgment, for the constant vigilance of us all
and particularly of members of this chamber.
As Edward Blake said in 1873:
It makes no difference to a free people whether
their rights are invaded by the Crown or by the Cabinet. What is material is to secure that they shall not be
invaded at all.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Bonnell, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
MOTION AUTHORIZING COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE AND
REPORT ON CANADIAN RELATIONS WITH EXPANDED
EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. John B. Aird moved pursuant to notice:

That the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign
Affairs be authorized to examine and report on
Canadian relations with the expanded European
Communities.
He said: Honourable senators, this afternoon I would

like to speak briefly concerning the activities of the
Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.
The study of Canada's relations with the countries of
the Pacific, which followed our examination of CanadaCaribbean relations, has now been completed. The Pacific
area report has been approved by the committee; it is now
at the printers and we hope to be able to table it in the
very near future, with a target date of Wednesday, March
22. After some consideration the members of the commit-

tee have decided that the next area for examination
should be Canada's relations with Western Europe, particularly with the European communities.
As we are all aware that Europe, and particularly Western Europe, has always been an area of particular meaning for Canada, I do not need to recite for you the many
cultural, political, military and economic ties and links
that Canada has had with Europe. Our country has been
peopled by successive waves of immigrants from there
over many centuries, and many of us cherish close family
and sentimental ties.
As a result, despite our increasingly close relationship
with the United States, particularly in economic matters,
Canadians continue to regard Western Europe as an area
of special importance and significance to this country.
Events in Western Europe have been developing very
rapidly in recent years. The post-World War Il impetus

toward greater unity has already led to the astonishing
success of the European community in the economic field.

There can be no doubt that the development of the
economic community is having, and will increasingly
have, a major impact on Canada. Yet, since the publica-

tion two years ago of the government's foreign policy
papers, there has been very little discussion of Canada's
relations with Europe or with the European Economic
Community. As an example, the visit to Ottawa last fall of
Mr. Malfatti, President of the European Economic Commission, passed almost unnoticed by the press. Canadians
appear to have been slow to realize the effect on Canada
of an enlarged European Economic Community.
Already the European Economic Community has

become one of the three most powerful economic units in

the world, rivalled only by the United States and Japan.
With the entry of four new member nations-the United
Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and Ireland-into the
common market, the six will grow to ten and will form an
economic unit with a larger population than that of the
United States. On a per capita basis it already imports
four times more than the United States. Its gross national
product is two-thirds that of the United States, and it
seems likely to grow at a faster rate. Further, the European Common Market, in developing a series of trade
relationships with countries around the Mediterranean
and among former colonies of member states in Africa,
will soon encompass 45 per cent of all world trade.
Honourable senators, what are the implications of these
major developments for Canada? The hard fact which
Canada will have to face is that after the entry of the four
new members into the EEC, and after the trade agreements are completed between the EEC and the remaining
members of the European Free Trade Association, including Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and Portugal, Canada
will be confronted by a huge bloc of nations across the
Atlantic. This bloc will stretch from the northernmost tip
of Norway to the northern border of South Africa, and it
will be held together by a variety of agreements. These
agreements in one way or another will favour internal

SENATE DEBATES

trading arrangements among members and associates;
they will discriminate against all outsiders.
* (1410)

The question is, honourable senators, where does this
leave Canada, a nation so heavily dependent on its export
trade? It is a sobering question; all the more sobering
because Canada is, at this time, actively seeking to diversify its trading relations. As a great trading nation,
Canada is finding it obviously unwise to become increasingly dependent upon a single market. In order to maintain a certain and most necessary flexibility, it appears
essential to strengthen Canadian trade with other
countries.
Honourable senators, you will find in the committee's
report on the Pacifie area our recommendations for
stimulating Canadian trade with the Pacifie countries.
But Canada must also look east as well as west in order to
diversify her trade. This is one of the reasons that our
committee considers it necessary to turn now to an examination of Canadian relations with the enlarged EEC.
Briefly, let me give you a few figures about this remarkable organization. In 1970 the EEC imported $45 billion
worth of goods and services from the outside world. That
was an increase of 17 per cent over 1969. It bas been
estimated that by 1980 the enlarged community of almost
300 million people could develop into an import market
amounting to $130 billion. In 1958 the GNP of the community was $175 billion. In 1970 it was $500 billion. It is
now projected at $700 billion for 1980. The order of magnitude of these statistics speaks for itself.
The entry of the United Kingdom into the EEC is, of
course, of vital interest to Canada since this means the
elimination of Canada's long-standing preferential access
to the British market. Although a transitional period for
gradually phasing out these preferences has been
arranged, and some items have been granted continued
favourable access, nevertheless it has been estimated that
45 per cent of our exports to Britain, which have a value
of over $600 million, will face more difficult tariff barriers
beginning next year.
Honourable senators, I have stressed the economic challenges for Canadians in the new Europe of today, and
these are the ones of most obvious and tangible importance. However, I would suggest in the light of the other
close ties which we have with Western Europe-political,
cultural and military ties, quite apart from the ties of
individual Canadians-that it would be a matter of some
considerable concern if the expanded EEC were to turn
inward on itself and have a decreasing interest in the rest
of the world, including Canada. Clearly, there are dangers
as well as possibilities for Canada in the developing EEC
and we must understand them more fully. Obviously, we
need a wide range of links with Western Europe, if we are
not to become a purely North American country.
It is for all these reasons that the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs considers that an examination of Canada's relations with the expanded European
Economie Community would be of prime importance. I
therefore commend this motion for your consideration.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: May I ask a question? What percentage of Canada's exports did the EEC countries take in

1970, and, if you have the figures, what percentage did
they take in the last month of that year?
Hon. Mr. Aird: Senator O'Leary, my authority for my
statistics is Foreign Trade, September 1971. Could I commend it to you for those figures? I do not have them at my
fingertips, but, speaking from memory, sir, I think that
the import figure for the United Kingdom was $1.5 billion;
the figure to the European Economic Community was $1.2
billion, and the total import figure for 1970 was $2.7
billion.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I think they actually took less than 2
per cent of our exports for the last year for which figures
are available.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, Senator
Aird asked me if I would second this motion and I am
indeed happy to do so. I find in the short time that has
passed since he asked me I have had little opportunity to
prepare. But I did recall that back in 1959 the Senate itself
engaged upon a debate with reference to the then recently
formed European Common Market. I had thought that
our leader at that time, the Honourable Wishart Robertson, introduced that debate but I find on looking into the
matter that he asked me to do so and I did it on March 18,
1959. That debate had to do with the formation of the
group that actually was known as the "Six".
This inquiry by the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, which, as I say, I commend, is of course
primarily about trade. We are all conscious of the fact that
almost to the exclusion of every other trading country in
the world, our trade is with the United States. Close to 80
per cent and sometimes more than 80 per cent of our
trade is with that country. The value of our exports to the
American market is now well over $8 billion annually.
Hon. Mr. Aird: It is nearly $12 billion.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, it could be $12 billion now but I
am talking of the figures available for 1969 which I used
on one occasion, and I did not have an opportunity of
getting the later ones. In 1969 the figure was close to $9
billion, and the value of imports, goods and services
brought across the border, apart from capital inflows,
was almost the same.
President Nixon, in a speech not too long ago, talked
about the trading patterns developing in the world. We
should be very conscious of the fact that new trading
patterns are developing. He listed five economic superpowers, as he called them: the Unites States, the European Economic Community, Japan, U.S.S.R. and China.
Three of these superpowers of course have free, open
economies like ours. The others are controlled economies.
In respect of Japan there is an element of control because,
as we know from our study of the Pacifie rim in this
committee, Japan uses the device of state trading agencies
much more than we do in Canada, for example, and, I
daresay, much more than the other free economies of the
world.
* (1420)

Senator Aird has referred to figures which indicate the
importance to Canada of the expanded European Economic Community. The figures which I have are relatively the same. First of all, we should consider the relative

SENATE DEBATES

population of the United States to that of the community.
In 1971, the total population in the United States was 207
million. In that same year in the expanded Community
the population was 257 million. In 1970, the gross national
product of the United States was $976 million. In the same
year, the GNP of the ten countries in the expanded community was $621 billion. This would probably indicate
that although there are more people, there is a relatively
lower standard of living in the community than exists in
the United States.
In the United States between the years 1965 and 1970 the
growth of the gross national product averaged 3.2 per cent
while the growth of the GNP of the six countries involved
in the community, as it was originally established, was 2
per cent higher than the growth of the GNP in the United
States in that five-year period. The average growth of the
GNP per annum in the community was 5.2 per cent. This
would indicate that the rate of growth, the increase in
value of goods and services in the European Economic
Community, is advancing at a greater rate than would be
the case in the United States, but undoubtedly from a
lower base.
In the United Kingdom, one of the important new elements in the community, the average growth of the GNP
for the same five-year period was two per cent.
No doubt we will be comparing the level of foreign
currency reserves in the United States with those which
exist in the United Kingdom. In 1971, the level of foreign
currency reserves in the United States was $11.5 billion. In
that same year in the expanded community the level of
foreign currency reserves was $43 billion, nearly four
times greater than the American level.
Senator Aird has referred to the extensive trading activity of Western Europe. This is reflected, in part, by the
figures for gross tonnage of the merchant fleet. In the
United States it is 19.5 million tons while in the community it is 75 million tons.
Senator O'Leary queried Senator Aird regarding
exports and imports from Canada to the community. I
have some figures which will, perhaps, indicate the importance of exploring and strengthening Canadian trading
relations with Western Europe, particularly with a few
individual countries.
In 1969 Canadian exports to the Common Market, to the
six, were worth $840 million. In that same year Canadian
exports to just one of the new countries, the United Kingdom, were $1.09 billion. By 1970 Canadian exports to the
community, the six, had increased from $840 million to
$1.188 billion. Our exports to the United Kingdom had
dropped slightly behind and stood at $1.08 billion. In the
same two years, however, Canada imported from the
community $789 million worth of goods in 1969 and $804
million worth in 1970. Our imports from the United Kingdom were slightly more than those from the community.
In 1969 they were $790 million plus. They fell off a little in
1970, to $738 million. Surely Canada is most interested in
economic growth within the expanded community, and
increasing her trade with the group.
We also, however, have an interest in preserving and
maintaining our traditional trade with the United Kingdom. I hope the committee will investigate and pinpoint
[Hon. Mr. Connolly.]

March 8, 1972

the great degrees of difficulty and try to find ways to
ensure that those markets, to the extent possible, are
preserved and retained. This is important, for I assume
that the market in Canada for United Kingdom goods is
likely to remain at relatively the same level, at least, as
heretofore.
Now, how are these new trading arrangements with the
expanded community to be established? What devices are
we to use? The committee, of course, will explore this.
Basically, I suppose there is no doubt that there is no
substitute for salesmanship. Canadian producers and
exporters unquestionably must sell Canadian goods, quality goods, at competitive prices in the foreign markets.
This is not easy of achievement, considering the high
income levels and the high standard of living which we
enjoy in this country. Between free economies there is no
substitute, of course, for salesmanship.
Governments, however, can do a great deal in arranging, through agreements, trade pacts and mutual reductions of tariffs and other obstacles to trade, to facilitate
the flow of goods and services between their countries. I
think for a trading nation such as Canada one could
expect that our government would always be alert to the
importance of this work. Officials within the Public Service, both of Canada and of countries with which Canada
desires to increase her trading arrangements, can do very
much indeed to open channels and free bonds that make
trading difficult.
* (1430)

Honourable senators, during the course of a briefing for
the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group,
Canadian officials spoke to us about the importance of
trade between Canada and the enlarged community. They
said it was important for Canada to develop a trading
climate in which relations could be improved.
I remember asking on that occasion what parliamentarians could do in that respect. As we know, approaches
have already been made from European parliamentarians. We have close relations with parliamentarians in the
United Kingdom. There have been visits by Canadian
parliamentarians to the Council of Europe, and approximately a year ago we in Canada were visited by representatives of the Council of Europe. At that briefing we discussed for a few moments the wisdom of Canadian
backbenchers having discussions with parliamentarians
from the various countries within the community or with
representatives of the Council of Europe at Strasbourg.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The consultative committee.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The officials felt that
such an exchange could achieve nothing but good, that
European parliamentarians would be able to return to
their own parliaments and discuss the Canadian attitude
toward trade.

about to take steps to promote more tourist travel within
this country.
Honourable senators, I should like to spend a few
and communications.
moments on transportation
Although this particular subject may not have been mentioned in the Speech, it does indeed refer to "isolation."
This has been referred to by Senator Buckwold, and by
other speakers on many occasions. We suffer this problem
in Prince Edward Island near where I live, especially in
the wintertime when the ice flows. When that happens we
are isolated, because the boats cannot get through the ice.
Probably every member of this chamber but myself can
be in telephonic communication with his home quite
easily. Our telephone system is among the worst in the
world. There are as many as ten people on a party line,
and they have to use long and short signals in order to
reach a certain person. We do not have the seven digit
dialing system except in the cities and bigger towns. Even
so, we pay higher rates for our telephone service than are
paid in any other part of Canada. We pay more for long
distance calls than does any other part of Canada, yet we
have the poorest telephone system.
There is one television station in the province, owned
and operated by the CBC. We have no mobile equipment,
and we have no way of getting on international programs,
except when the actors come in the summertime and dig
up some old horse and buggy. I am sure the horse has
been dead for a long time, and the buggy is a real antique
but it is taken out each time they wish to show Prince
Edward Island on national programs.
Honourable senators, what is needed to prevent this
continued isolation is something we have heard about so
often-the causeway. Different Prime Ministers have promised the causeway, but each time the project has been
postponed by some tight money policy or high rates of
interest. I believe that we are now in for better times.
a (1500)

I have to be fair and say that the present government
gave us two new car ferries last year, and is about to give
us another new car ferry at the other end of the island.
These certainly tighten our connection with the rest of
Canada.
In this expanding economy, and this age of expanding
travel and transportation, I believe the day has come
when, if we do not get a causeway to Prince Edward
Island, we shall have so many boats that if we put them
end to end we would have a causeway. The tourist industry of Prince Edward Island is growing rapidly, and the
only method of transporting the visitors is by boat for
which we need wharves and ancillary installations.
Therefore, realizing that we have these problems of
telephonic communication, transportation, and the like, I
suggest that the Standing Senate Committee on Transport
and Communications should visit Prince Edward Island
during the winter months and again at the peak of the
tourist season, in order to see the handicap that we are
under in that province.
A committee of the House of Commons was set up at
one time to view the transportation problems of Prince
Edward Island, but they became storm-bound and never
did get across to the island. Before the snow was gone and
25312-8

the roads were open they were recalled because of a vote,
and so our transportation problems were never viewed by
members of the other place. I think that a report from the
Transport and Communications Committee, after a visit
to Prince Edward Island, would stir up great interest in
this country, as have the reports on Poverty in Canada
and all those other matters with which this body has dealt.
I read in the paper the other day of some gentleman in
British Columbia who is going to the courts to restrain the
Government of Canada from giving money to the poorer
provinces in equalization payments. I am not the parliamentarian Senator Forsey is, nor do I know parliamentary procedure as he does, but when the day comes in this
country that the Government of Canada cannot tax the
people and distribute those taxes as it feels it should, then
we shall have lost our democracy and what we sat down
to put together in Charlottetown.
I can well see that if that money were taken from the
Government of British Columbia and given to another
provincial government, then British Columbia might have
something to complain about. But the taxes, as I understand it, come from the people of Canada and go back, as
the Government of Canada sees fit, to the people in the
have-not provinces. This is a means of assisting them to
pull themselves up by the bootstraps, so to speak, so that
in the future they may be able to give a little themselves in
order to assist other provinces which at the present time
find themselves in the fortunate position of having industries such as oil to keep them economically sound but
which may need help then.
I am a little disappointed to think that the premier of
that great province is a maritimer himself, and one who
knows the situation of the Maritime provinces. Moreover,
the Lieutenant Governor of that province comes from
New Brunswick. It is sad to think that when they get that
far away they forget their people back home, and say that
it is a bad thing to give equalization grants to the have-not
provinces.
The Province of Prince Edward Island is in a position
today where, without equalization grants and the help of
the federal government, it could not carry on the business
of government. We could not give any of the necessary
services to our people. The federal government has recognized that and has given us equalization payments. It has
recognized it further by creating the Department of
Regional Economic Expansion. Through the DREE program Prince Edward Island, jointly with the Government
of Canada, is spending $725 million over the next 15 years.
That is a program to help Prince Edward Island establish
sound economic industries such as agriculture, fisheries,
tourism, and so on. This has been done to assist the
Government of Prince Edward Island to give the people
of that province the things they deserve as Canadians.
After all, we cannot be a strong and unified country if we
have people in one part who cannot eke out a living and
have to do without many of the necessities of life, while
people in other parts are living in riches and have all the
things they need and even some to spare.
I appreciate the fact that the Government of Canada
has recognized this type of need not only in regions of
Canada but in regions all over the world. Our government
gives assistance and aid to other countries which need it. I

106

SENATE DEBATES

am sure the attorney general of British Columbia would
not want us to cut off all aid to foreign countries in need.
If he would not want Canada to do that, why would he
want Canada to cut off its aid to his fellow Canadians in
need. I contend that he must have been having a dream
when he thought that by going to the courts he could
remove the right of the Canadian government to tax its
citizens, and distribute those taxes as it sees fit. That is a
right all Canadians enjoy, and if it is ever removed we will
not have a very good country in which to live.
To demonstrate the benefits that exist under this
present program so far as Prince Edward Island is concerned, I will say that two years ago we started a program
to assist those with low incomes to build themselves
homes. In Prince Edward Island, with only 110,000 people,
there are 650 people who have received grants to build
homes of their own in the last two years. Many who were
in the very low income bracket could not afford to build
new homes, but they applied for and obtained grants of
$1,000 to build such additions to their old homes as washrooms, furnace rooms, and basements, and other amenities which they never enjoyed before. In this way at least
they now have better accommodations than they had
before.
a (1510)

The total annual revenue of the Province of Prince
Edward Island before the development plan was in operation was about $40 million, but in 1971, four years later,
the revenue had increased by 139 per cent. This shows
that DREE is doing good in the province, and those people
who criticize DREE and say it is not working should come
and look at the highways, the housing, the tourist developments, the fisheries, and other undertakings in Prince
Edward Island which have expanded and become
economically sound since the development plan was
signed in 1967.
As far as agriculture is concerned we have problems,
but then as far as agriculture is concerned Canada has
problems. In fact, as far as agriculture is concerned, there
are problems in every country. They are not unique to
Prince Edward Island. This year, with the existence of
DREE, the Government of Prince Edward Island, instead
of the usual Speech from the Throne at the opening of the
session of the legislature, delivered what could be called a
white paper on agriculture. The whole Speech from the
Throne was concerned with the promotion of new ideas
for the improvement of agriculture, to make it a sound
industry in the province. I am pleased to see that the
federal government in the Speech from the Throne also
states that it is going to promote agricultural and fishing
industries.
In Prince Edward Island we had other problems this
year. For example, we had some problems with the Unemployment Insurance Commission. It seemed that many
people were making application and a backlog developed.
There were delays in getting money to those who needed
it. I have investigated this matter, and I understand from
the Minister of Labour that he is now on top of the
situation. He has assured me that unemployment insurance offices will be established in each of the Manpower
offices in the various areas of the province. Therefore,
people going directly to the Manpower offices will be able
[Hon. Mr. Bonnell.]

March 8, 197 2

to see the unemployment insurance officers, and this will
help to overcome difficulties about claims. I thank Mr.
Mackasey for doing this, and I congratulate him on correcting the situation so quickly.
I am pleased to be able to say that in the Maritime
provinces, because of the new amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act, over 3,100 fishermen who
ordinarily would not have received five cents from the
Unemployment Insurance Fund this winter were able to
draw on it because they needed only eight stamps to do so.
This was a great boost to the fishermen, and it saved the
welfare department of Prince Edward Island a great deal
of money.
Honourable senators, I was told that if I wanted anybody to listen to what I had to say I should not speak for
too long, and Senator McGrand told me at noon today that
I would not be listened to anyway. Therefore, rather than
say too much at this time I shall let another senator
continue the debate. However, I should like to make it
quite clear that I am very pleased with the Speech from
the Throne because it shows that Canada cares about us
as individuals, and it shows the direction in which this
country is going in years to come.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Is it an election speech?
On motion of Hon. Mr. Argue, debate adjourned.
REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SENATE MEMBERS TO
JOINT COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, February 29, the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Martin, seconded by
Hon. Mr. McDonald, that the following senators be
appointed to act on behalf of the Senate on the Standing
Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments, namely, the
honourable Senators Fergusson, Forsey, Goldenberg,

Grosart, Haig, Lafond, Molson and Rowe; and that a
message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint
that house accordingly.
Hon. H. Carl Goldenberg: Honourable senators, in
rising to speak on the motion before the house I am
aware, of course, that the subject of parliamentary review
of statutory instruments has been debated in the Senate
and in its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs at different times over the past three years.
Since the last debate, the Statutory Instruments Act was

proclaimed into force on January 1, 1972, and both houses
are now in the process of setting up the committee provided for in section 26 of that act to review and scrutinize
statutory instruments. In the circumstances, some further

remarks may not be inappropriate even if they involve
repetition to some degree of what has already been said.
What we are seeking to achieve in this matter is a
combination of effective administration and effective parliamentary control of the executive to protect the rights of
the individual. In this we in Canada are not alone; it is a
problem which is faced by other nations with parliamentary institutions. In the complicated world in which we
live, with the functions and responsibilities of government
enormously expanded, it is not possible for Parliament to

March 8. 1972
8

March

1972

SENATE DEBATES

deal with all the details involved in the implementation of
legislation. Accordingly, while Parliament remains the
source of statute law, it delegates certain law-making
powers to authorities responsible for administering the
law: the Governor in Council, ministers of the Crown,
boards, commissions, Crown corporations and other
bodies and persons who are agents of the Crown. This
delegated or subordinate legislation in the form of regulations, orders and other statutory instruments confers
legally enforceable rights and imposes legally enforceable
obligations on citizens. Parliament therefore has a continuing responsibility to ensure that the power it has delegated is exercised properly in the public interest.
It is a power, as we know, that arouses criticism as the
volume of delegated legislation is enlarged. And yet it is a
necessary consequence of modern government. Lord
Chief Justice Hewart, who has been quoted in these
debates, in his famous criticism written some forty years
ago, called it "The New Despotism" but even he said:
* (1520)

It is tolerably obvious that the system of delegation by
Parliament of powers of legislation is within certain
limits necessary, at least as regards matters of detail,
because it is impossible, if only for want of time, for
Parliament to deal adequately and in detail with all
the matters calling, or supposed to call, for legislation.
Indeed, without a drastic alteration of its methods of
procedure, it would be impossible for Parliament to
deal adequately with even a comparatively small part
of the present-day volume of departmental legislation.
These were the words of one of the most severe critics
of the exercise of the power of delegation of law-making
authority. As a realist, Lord Hewart accepted the fact that
such delegation is necessary. It therefore serves no purpose to criticize the multiplicity of regulations as such.
They are numbered in the thousands now, and hundreds
will continue to be added from year to year as the activities of government expand. I admit that many will continue to confuse the laymen as well as the lawyer, even if
such confusion in the case of the lawyer may be profitable. It remains for Parliament to supervise and control
the exercise of the law-making authority because the rules
and regulations made under such authority complete the
laws enacted by Parliament.
Following the thorough and excellent third report of the
Special Committee on Statutory Instruments of the other
place; Parliament enacted the Statutory Instruments Act
which came into force on the first day of January of this
year. It marks, I hope, the beginning of a new era in the
exercise of parliamentary supervision of subordinate
legislation.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, I will now read to you the
remarks made in the other place by the Minister of Justice
during the debate on this bill. He said:
I believe this bill will provide better controls in the
hands of Parliament over delegated legislation, regulations and statutory instruments made by government, ministers and boards. I believe, also, that it will
provide a more open government because from now
on, subject to narrowly defined exemptions, all regu25312-8

lations will be published in the Canada Gazette and
this will be enforced by means of a mandatory registration system whereby a regulation will not come
into force until it is so registered and published.
Second, rules, orders or regulations governing the
practice or procedure of federal judicial or quasi-judicial boards and commissions will be subject to the
requirements of the new legislation. Third, members
of the public will now be given a statutory right to
inspect and obtain copies of statutory instruments
and regulations, a right which they do not now possess. At the present time the public has no right to see
or obtain a copy of any regulation or other statutory
instrument having the force of legislation which has
been delegated by this Parliament to ministers, to
boards or other administrative bodies.
Fourth, a scrutiny committee of Parliament-this is
the point upon which the amendment is based-will
be given the right to examine all statutory instruments
which are made or regulations which are passed.
Fifth, the powers given to the Governor in Council to
exempt regulations and other statutory instruments
from the application of this provision of the bill are
very narrowly defined. At the present time there is no
restriction placed upon the cabinet or Governor in
Council in the exercise of its power to exempt regulations from the obligations imposed by the Regulations
Act. Now, the exemptions are narrowly drawn and
they have to fit within one of the categories of clause
27 of the bill.
Finally, hon. members will henceforth receive a
copy of every regulation which is published in the
Canada Gazette.
This is a quotation from page 4065 of Hansardof March
8, 1971.
[English]
Honourable senators, I would like to deal more particularly with two sections of the Statutory Instruments Act.
Section 3 requires a regulation-making authority which
proposes to make a regulation to forward copies to the
Clerk of the Privy Council who must then examine the
proposed regulation in consultation with the Deputy Minister of Justice to ensure that:
(a) it is authorized by the statute pursuant to which it
is to be made;
(b) it does not constitute an unusual or unexpected use
of the authority pursuant to which it is to be made;
(c) it does not trespass unduly on existing rights and
freedoms and is not, in any case, inconsistent with the
purposes and provisions of the Canadian Bill of
Rights; and
(d) the form and draftsmanship of the proposed regulation are in accordance with established standards.
These are some of the principal criteria recommended
by the special committee of the other place for scrutiny of
delegated legislation. Incidentally, similar principles for
assessing such legislation are embodied in the laws of
other Commonwealth countries.
Having set out these criteria, and having provided for
registration and publication of regulations, with certain
exceptions, and for the right of access to regulations by

SENATE DEBATES
any person, save where precluded by considerations of
security and the rights of individuals, the act provides for
scrutiny of statutory instruments by Parliament. Section
26 reads:
Every statutory instrument issued, made or established after the coming into force of this act, other
than an instrument the inspection of which and the
obtaining of copies of which are precluded by any
regulations made pursuant to paragraph (d) of section
27, shall stand permanently referred to any committee
of the House of Commons, of the Senate or of both
Houses of Parliament that may be established for the
purpose of reviewing and scrutinizing statutory
instruments.
This is, of course, the committee to which the motion
before the Senate today relates. In setting up such a
committee, we have lagged behind other countries of the
Commonwealth. In the United Kingdom, the House of
Lords established a Special Orders Committee in 1925 to
examine regulations requiring an affirmative resolution
before coming into effect and to report to the house
thereon.
* (1530)

In 1931 the Senate of Australia established a Standing
Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to ensure,
inter alia, that they are in accord with the statute and that
they do not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. In 1944 the British House of Commons established a
Select Committee on Statutory Rules and Orders. In 1953
the House of the People in India established a Committee
on Subordinate Legislation to scrutinize and report to the
house "whether the powers to make regulations, et cetera,
conferred by the Constitution or delegated by Parliament
are being properly exercised within such delegation." In
New Zealand, Standing Order 360 of the House of Representatives provides for a Statutes Revision Committee to
consider regulations.
There are also precedents in Canada. In 1960 the
Manitoba Legislature established a Standing Committee
on Statutory Orders and Regulations to examine regulations referred to it under the act. The Province of Saskatchewan followed in 1963 with the establishment of a
Special Committee on Regulations. In 1969 Ontario provided for the appointment of a Special Committee on
Regulations at the commencement of each Legislature.
At page 73 of its third report the Special Committee of
the other house reports on these scrutiny committees that:
All the scrutiny committees have the following features in common: they are relatively small committees; they rely heavily upon preliminary examinations
and reports of their legal counsel; they are more concerned with the form, language, and operation of
regulations than their substance; they are objective
and non-partisan; and they report the results of their
examinations to the Legislature. The action which
may be taken by the Legislature with respect to a
regulation depends upon the terms of the applicable
statutes and Standing Orders.
On October 14, 1971, Standing Order 65(3) of the other
house was amended to provide for a Joint Committee on
Regulations and Statutory Instruments with 12 members
[Hon. Mr. Goldenberg.]

EMarch 8 1972

from that house. The Senate amended its Rule 67(1) on
October 12, 1971, by adding a new subparagraph (d) providing for the appointment of eight senators to the
committee.
Section 26 of the Statutory Instruments Act defines the
powers of the committee as those of "reviewing and
scrutinizing statutory instruments." Senator Grosart the
other day was critical of the fact that the act does not tell
the committee what to do after its review and does not
specifically require it to report. But surely a standing
committee has powers to sit in open session, to call for
persons, papers and records, and to report back to Parliament. Moreover, the act says that statutory instruments
shall stand permanently-and I stress the word "permanently"-referred to the committee. It follows that if no
action is taken on a report of the committee, the committee may scrutinize the same regulations more than once
and, if it feels strongly about the matter, it can report on it
again and again. In the words of the then Minister of
Justice, as reported in the House of Commons Debates,
March 8, 1971, at page 4068:
The burden of my argument is that the power of the
committee really is to draw to the attention of the
government, Parliament and the public the fact that
regulations may contravene the criteria which have
been advanced by the committee on statutory instruments and may go beyond the powers that are given
in the statute, and that the enabling power in the
statute itself may be drawn too widely, although that
should be a consideration for Parliament in the consideration of the bill itself.
I may point out that the powers of the British House of
Commons committee have also been said to be unduly
limited, and yet Dr. J. A. Corry, former Principal of
Queen's University and an eminent Canadian authority
on administrative law, says this about the British
committee:
Although sharply restricted in its terms of reference, the [Select Committee on Statutory Instruments]
has had a considerable measure of success in inspiring legislation which tidied up the process of delegation reducing sharply objectionable uses of the device,
arousing an informed public opinion, and even in
curbing the verbosity of the framers of delegated
legislation. The government departments are more
careful in their later framing of new delegated legislation after the committee has chided them ... The civil
servants fear it, and cabinet respects it.
Dr. Corry's judgment on the British House of Commons
committee will be found in his chapter entitled "The Prospects for the Rule of Law" at pages 547-548 in Canadian
Public Administration,edited by Hodgetts and Corbett.
I submit that the joint committee which we are about to
set up with the other place should be able to achieve
similar results if it approaches its task in a non-partisan
manner and with the assistance of a competent permanent staff. To those who fear that its findings may not
receive proper consideration, I say that the rules of procedure in both houses afford opportunities to vigilant members to bring them to public attention.
On another point raised by Senator Grosart, I agree that
section 26 of the act imposes a limitation on the commit-

March 8, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

tee's powers of review in that it excludes regulations of
which, under section 27, the Governor in Council has by
regulation precluded inspection "in the interest of international relations, national defence or security or federalprovincial relations" or where inspection might result in
"injustice or undue hardship to any person or body affected thereby."
The requirement of secrecy in matters affecting national defence and security is understandable and generally
accepted. In so far as it concerns international relations
and intergovernmental relations, information can only be
released with the consent of all governments concerned. If
one party insists that a matter be not publicized, the
others are bound to agree. This is a fact of life. Having
attended so many federal-provincial conferences, I can
confirm this.
In the matter of regulations the disclosure of which
would result in injustice or undue hardship to persons, I
do not feel that we can object to their exclusion.
In view of the long debate on publication and scrutiny
of statutory instruments in both houses, I am hopeful that
the tendency will be to make full disclosure except where
there is a strong balance of argument against it. The
effectiveness of the whole exercise will depend in large
part on the prestige that the committee will acquire.

Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: I share the views expressed by
Mr. G. W. Baldwin in the other place. I feel sure that the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn) will allow me
to quote Mr. Baldwin's comments as reported at page 8681
of the House of Commons Hansardof October 14, 1971:
I suggest that a committee which is objective, hard
working and properly staffed would perform a function which has long been needed in this country. I
wish to confer my blessing and the blessing of our
party on this committee. I feel that since the lives, the
fortunes and the liberties of the people of Canada are
affected to the extent of almost 90 per cent by statutory regulations rather than statutes, this committee will
be one of the most important committees to function
under the authority of Parliament during the course
of the next few years.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Forsey, debate adjourned.

CANADA-UNITED STATES INTERPARLIAMENTARY
GROUP
FOURTEENTH MEETING-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from February 29 the adjourned
debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Deschatelets, calling the
attention of the Senate to the Fourteenth Meeting of the
Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group held at
Ottawa and Montebello, 16th to 20th February, 1972.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, in rising to
speak on the Fourteenth Meeting of the Canada-United
States Interparliamentary Group held at Ottawa and
Montebello from February 16 to 20, 1972, I would like at
the beginning to say a word to His Honour the Speaker of
the Senate.

Your Honour, Senator Macnaughton who has much
experience in that field has congratulated you and the
Speaker of the House of Commons for the dignified
manner in which you played host to the large American
delegation. I entirely agree with Senator Macnaughton
but I want to add the following. Mrs. Deschatelets and
Mrs. Lamoureux represented Canada with much charm
and dignity and I wish to offer them my sincere
compliments.
Honourable senators, Mr. Ian Imrie, who is chief of the
Inter-Parliamentary Relations Branch, and Miss Jean
Macpherson, of the same office, carried out their duties
with the perfection we have come to expect of them.
I would also like to congratulate Mr. Paul Jolicoeur,
director of Château Montebello, who made us so welcome.
[English]
His Honour the Speaker, together with the Speaker of
the House of Commons, wrote a full report of the meeting,
which was published as an appendix to Senate Hansard
of February 29.
Senator Macnaughton, in an excellent speech to which I
have just referred, described our deliberations. I have no
wish to be repetitious, and will explain only the main
points which arose from the meeting.
Those who attended the interparliamentary meeting
were divided into two committees, one dealing with economic affairs, and the other with defence and security. We
are fortunate to be in a position to discuss our problems
with the top parliamentarians from the United States; to
be able to explain our problems and then listen to their
side of the story. Equally important is the fact that we had
an opportunity of getting to know the United States parliamentarians as people. In future, when we hear of action
taken by the United States, we will think of their parliamentarians as acting much as we do. No doubt they will
feel similarly toward us.
We may look back upon 1972 as the turning point where
the great powers started to make a serious effort to
reduce world tension. We all hope that the forthcoming
visit to Russia by the President of the United States will
prove as successful as his visit to China. However, in the
last 12 months we must remember that bitter, fierce
nationalism has caused death and untold suffering in
many parts of the world-and all of it in the name of
patriotism.
We in Canada look back over 150 years of peaceful and
friendly co-existence with our neighbours to the south. We
have a long but unguarded frontier. Before Confederation
most of the trade from the Maritimes was carried out with
the people of Boston. Honourable senators will recall that
when the late President Kennedy addressed a joint meeting of the Canadian Senate and House of Commons in
1961, he pointed out that he had been elected by a majority of only 140,000 votes out of a total of over 60 million
votes cast. He made us laugh by saying that a large
proportion of the voters in Massachusetts who were not
born in the United States were Canadians, and he intimated that these former Canadians might have decided the
election. I do not mean to say that all these Canadians
were from the Maritimes, as there are many people of
French Canadian descent in that state.

SENATE DEBATES
I recall reading some time ago a book written by Pierre
Georges Roy who was for a great many years archivist for
the Province of Quebec. He was a contemporary of my
father, but has been dead for some time. I have forgotten
the name of his book, but in it he referred to the great
depression of the 1880s when many French Canadians
emigrated to the United States. I remember an amusing
cartoon of the day depicting a French Canadian whose
name was Jean Baptiste Trudeau. He was shown as
returning to a little town in Quebec after a very successful
absence of 20 years. He had changed his name to John B.
Waterhole. Pierre Georges Roy stated in his book that
there were 2 million French Canadians in the New England States.
* (1550)

As honourable senators are aware, the Province of
Quebec borders on the States of Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, and New York. You can cross the border, as I
often do, and go for miles on the side roads without seeing
an American or Canadian Customs. If you stop and speak
to people, you cannot tell by the accent on which side of
the border you happen to be. Ontario borders on the
States of New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota, and across those borders billions of dollars of
trade are done every year. In many cases people get up in
the morning and cross the border to go to work and
return to their own country that evening; this is done by
Americans and Canadians alike.
I realize that there is a certain group in Toronto made
up of very successful professional and business people
who view American control as a danger to Canada and its
culture. I will not say anything about American control of
our industry today. We will discuss this fully when the
government announces its long-awaited policy in this
matter.
As far as culture is concerned, the only thing I can say is
that if we had the opportunity of listening to these gentlemen from Toronto talking with Americans of the same
class and kind, it would take a very discerning eye to
detect any difference in culture.
Manitoba borders on North Dakota; Saskatchewan borders on North Dakota and Montana, and Alberta borders
on Montana. When oil was discovered in the west in 1947,
a great many Americans came up to Canada and settled

March 8, 1972

in Saskatchewan and Alberta. There is nothing but the
friendliest feeling between our two nations in this area.
Indeed, if you and I could attend an agricultural fair and
see our colleague from Calgary, the honourable Senator
Hays, surrounded by cattlemen from both sides of the
border, I should think we would find it difficult to pick
out which ones were Americans. As far as I am concerned, I would sooner try to guess where the bulls came
from.
I am sure that the majority of citizens of British
Columbia feel just as much at home in Seattle or Tacoma
as they do in Vancouver or Victoria.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: More so than they do in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators, both Canada
and the United States are faced with an election in the
foreseeable future, and we can expect to find some misguided people trying to promote a hate-your-neighbour
campaign. We have to be on our guard in that respect; we
are all the sons and daughters of North America. Our
backgrounds are the same. Our ancestors may have come
from England, France, Belgium, Poland, Italy, Czechoslovakia or Germany. Exactly the same type of immigration
took place in the United States. They all came to North
America for the same reasons-to find liberty and wider
horizons and to build a better future for themselves and
their children.
Honourable senators, I will close my remarks by going
back to the speech that I referred to earlier by the late
President Kennedy. He quoted Edmund Burke as saying:
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for
good men to do nothing.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I think some senator from the Toronto region should rise on a question of
privilege. I think Senator Aird should. He probably
remembers René Levesque's statement to the effect that
he felt more at home in the United States than he did in
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Honourable senators, there were two
distinguished delegates at this conference from the other
side of this chamber, Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) and
Senator Hayden. I should be glad to follow them in this
debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, for Hon. Mr. Hayden,
debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

VISIT TO CANADA BY U.S.S.R. PARLIAMENTARIANS
STATEMENT BY HIS HONOUR THE SPEAKER

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, yesterday I
undertook to inform the Senate of the impending visit to
Canada of a group of parliamentarians from the U.S.S.R.
In 1969 the Speaker of the Senate received an invitation
for a small delegation from the Senate to visit the Soviet
Union. This invitation came from the Chairman of the
Council of the Union of the Supreme Soviet and the
Chairman of the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme
Soviet. The invitation was accepted, and in January 1970 I
was accompanied to the Soviet Union by Senators Connolly (Ottawa West), Flynn and Aird. Honourable senators
will recall that a full report concerning that visit was
made in this chamber and is recorded in Hansard of
February 4,1970, beginning at page 471.
Honourable senators are aware that a similar delegation
from the Senate had been invited to Czechoslovakia in
1969, and at that time I was accompanied to that country
by the Honourable Paul Martin, Leader of the Government, and the Honourable Jacques Flynn, Leader of the
Opposition, and the honourable Senator Aird. As is customary on such occasions, the visitors, before departure,
issued an invitation for a return visit. This was done in the
normal course, and the Department of External Affairs
was consulted.
The return visit by the Czechoslovakian parliamentaries
took place in March 1971. The visit of representatives
from the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. was to have
taken place in the fall of 1971, but had to be postponed. It
will begin next Monday, March 13. The Soviet delegation
will visit Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary. While in Ottawa the delegation will meet and conduct discussions with members of the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs and members of the External Affairs and National Defence Committee of the House
of Commons. It is expected that the Soviet delegation will
also have the opportunity of meeting with both federal
and provincial government representatives. Arrangements will be made to have certain of them with technical
qualifications meet with colleagues in the business and
scientific life of Canada.
Honourable senators will have received, I hope, an invitation to a dinner which will be tendered to the Russian
delegates on Tuesday evening.
I am grateful to honourable senators in the different
centres to be visited, for the extraordinary co-operation
and help they have given to make this Senate undertaking
a success. I express the hope that, as a result of this visit
exchanges between the representatives of the peoples of
Canada and the Soviet Union will be made more meaningful for the understanding and mutual advantage of the

two countries, and for the preservation of peace and economic and social development of the world at large.
I hope that this statement will be found satisfactory.

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved, with leave of the

That the name of the honourable Senator Burchill
be substituted for that of the honourable Senator

Motion agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, with
leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(g), I
move that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday, March 14, 1972, at 2 o'clock in
the afternoon.
Honourable senators, in explanation of this motion, may
I repeat what His Honour the Speaker has just told us,
that there will be a dinner on Tuesday evening in honour
of the visit of the delegation from the Soviet Union. Honourable senators and their wives have been invited. As the

SENATE DEBATES

March 9, 1972

dinner is scheduled for 7.30 p.m. it is proposed that the
Senate sit at 2 p.m.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators, as we probably will not be having a long sitting, would it not be
possible to meet at 3 o'clock instead of 2 o'clock? It is
difficult for some senators to be here by 2 o'clock.

Hon. Mr. Martin: But that is to be expected of somebody
from Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I was unable to hear Senator Lapointe's
speech but I read it carefully. I say to ber most sincerely
that as a Canadian and a senator I was thrilled to read ber
speech and to learn from it that she bas an understanding

* (1410)

of questions affecting all parts of this nation. She has had

Hon. Mr. McDonald: The only comment I could make is
that under our Rules the Senate meets for the transaction
of business at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But a change can be made with
leave.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I know that is possible, but I cannot
agree to that simply on my own.
The Hon. the Speaker: If there is to be a change, perhaps Senator McDonald would amend his motion.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, perhaps I could
say a word. My own view is that it is not in keeping with
the traditions of Parliament to change lightly the hour of

our meeting. In the circumstances, perhaps we could
regard this occasion as being an exception, but this is a

course I do not think we should encourage. We must keep
in mind that Parliament is not just an ordinary meeting

institution. It is the Parliament of Canada and this is one
of the bouses of that Parliament. I suggest that we accede

to this request at this time, but as I have said I do not

think we should encourage it as a practice.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved

by the honourable Senator McDonald, seconded by the
honourable Senator Bourget, that when the Senate
adjourns today, it do stand adjourned until Tuesday,
March 14, 1972, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Is it your

pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Motion agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Buckwold, seconded by Hon. Miss Lapointe, for an address in
reply thereto.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, my first words
this afternoon must be ones of sincere congratulation to
the mover of the Address in Reply to the Speech from the
Throne, Senator Buckwold, on his excellent speech. By
his statement he showed that be bas a firm grasp of the
fundamental questions affecting the people of this country and, while he bas been a senator for only a short time,
be bas already demonstrated by his activity in this chamber and in the Senate committees that he is learning the
ropes quickly and is already making excellent contributions. This suggests to us all that be will have a more
important role to perform in the interests of Canada in
this house in the years ahead.
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

a wide experience in her lifetime, young as she is, and I
know that she will make an invaluable contribution to the
Senate in the years ahead. I know that her outstanding
contribution will be an indication to the Prime Minister
and all future prime ministers that more ladies should
adorn this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I congratulate ber most sincerely.
I am delighted to be back in this chamber with my
colleagues, particularly the old politicians from past days
in the House of Commons. I suppose it may stem from my
background, but when I listen to Senator Flynn I almost
begin to agree with him at times when he becomes critical
of what our government is doing.
Then I glance over at my friend, the Leader of the
Government, Senator Martin. As I indicated to him upon
entering the chamber this afternoon, he looks so vigorous
and young. And the suit he is wearing would suggest to all
of us that spring is just around the corner. Senator Martin
performs a tremendous service on behalf of the Senate
and, because he is the government leader here, this helps
to improve the stature of the Senate, which is already high
in the eyes of Canadians.
We politicians are inclined to view our own party as
being almost always right. Sometimes we feel that other
parties are making many mistakes. However, it is my
opinion that when the history of this time is written it will
show that Pierre Elliott Trudeau, as Prime Minister performed a tremendous service in preserving and improving
national unity in this country. And unless we have national unity we have no country.
Those of us who come from the far reaches of this
nation very often find it easy to be critical of that which is
being done by the government in the interests of national
unity. When we are dealing with the question of bilingualism great emotion can be raised, and on occasion we even
suspect a tinge of racism. This bothers me as I am sure it
bothers all honourable senators.
We are not all alike in this country. We are different and
the regions of our country are different. If we are unable
to appreciate the points of view, the motives, and aspirations of people in other parts of Canada then we cannot
have a country. I feel that senators from the Prairies, as
well as senators from all regions, should use every opportunity to point up some of the matters which are required
to be done so that we are a united country. I am pleased
with the recognition given by the government to the
French language and the citizens of this nation whose
native tongue is French. They are now better able to
transact business in their own language.
I feel that Canadians from one end of this country to the
other should be made aware of the fact that, no matter
what mistakes have been made by the government, we do
not face the situation which exists in Ireland and some

March 9, 197 2

SENATE DEBATES

other nations of the world which are divided on religious
or racial grounds. We have been able to work out some of
these problems, and I hope we will continue to do so in the
best interests of our nation.

I have been a Liberal for a few years. I am a 10-year
Liberal, and feel that I should be considered a Liberal
without too many questions being attached to my position
in the party. I can say quite frankly, however, that sometimes I have been a discouraged Liberal.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Argue: During those years I found at times a
wall as far as the interests of the people on the Prairies
are concerned-some legitimate interests, in certain specific ways-and I became discouraged. I have been discouraged from time to time because they said: "Well,
everyone on the Prairies should be happy. They have lots
of money and are all off to Florida and California in the
winter." That sentiment has been around for a long time.
I have been an advocate of the two-price system for
wheat for a long time, as have other members of this
house. I think the fact that this has been adopted as a
policy of the Government of Canada indicates that the
Prime Minister and his colleagues are aware of some of
the legitimate aspirations of people on the Prairies. In my
opinion, this is something that we deserve and of which
we can be proud. Those who have worked for it can take
some credit for the government's moving in that direction.
I think of the speech delivered in this chamber in
December by Senator Sparrow. Obviously he had done
much research before he made that speech. It was a first
class economic argument in favour of the two-price
system for wheat. I remember a few years ago when
Senator Prowse and I put a motion before a Liberal
convention in Winnipeg asking for the two-price system
for wheat. It carried, and on the flight back to Ottawa a
distinguished member of the cabinet at that time said:
"Argue, you did it again. You have put that albatross
around our necks once more." Well, now the albatross is
removed.
It has been a good system. I have not seen criticism of it.
The two-price system is available for wheat produced on
the Prairies and is also being made available to the wheat
producers in eastern Canada on an equal basis.
I congratulate the Honourable Otto Lang, the minister
in charge of the Wheat Board, not only for the work he
has done within the cabinet and outside to obtain this new
and important policy, but also for having the foresight
and courage to announce that on the Prairies payments
under the two-price system will be by way of acreage
payments.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Argue: It would have been easy just to throw it
into the pot and pay it out through the ordinary wheat
pool accounts. This was advocated by the Saskatchewan
Wheat Pool and the Palliser Grain Growers' Association.
Some of us, however, did not advocate it. We said that it
should be paid either on an acreage basis, with a limited
acreage, or on a limited quantity of wheat, and not thrown
into the general pot and paid out on a straight bushel

basis. Had it been paid to all the producers based on a
bushel of wheat marketed, obviously the huge wheat producers, a handful, would have received a large part of the
money. That money is paid by the taxpayers of Canada,
and Mr. Lang and the government have now decided it
will be paid on an acreage basis, based on 640 acres, with
a limit of approximately $500.
This will give farmers an opportunity of enjoying a
reasonable share of the benefits accruing from the twoprice system. It is a social policy as well as an economic
policy. Taxpayers' money from the national treasury is
used by the government to achieve a social purpose,
namely, to improve, in a small but important way, the
living standards of farmers in the Prairie provinces.
The government displayed its interest in agriculture
when it decided to pay a deficiency payment for hogs. The
deficiency payment legislation has been on the statute
books for a long time, having been placed there by a
Conservative government. The Conservative Party and
the last Conservative government are in excellent standing with Canadian farmers, especially those in western
Canada.
Had no effort been made to change the act, hog producers would have been paid somewhat less than $1 per
hog. The government decided that this figure was not
enough, that hog prices were disastrously low, that hog
producers had suffered a substantial loss, and that payment could be made by way of a supplementary estimate.
The payment was raised to $5 per hog based on certain
grades up to a maximum of 200 hogs per farmer or $1,000
per producer. Once again, this decision took courage, this
time on the part of the Minister of Agriculture who resisted the proposition put forward by certain hog producers.
I believe there are two organizations, one representing
swine producers and the other hog producers-Senator
McDonald wiil correct me if I am not completely accurate-both of which opposed or criticized this method of
payment.
The government may wish to do something for the
agricultural industry but it is difficult when, having
sought the opinions of farm organizations who represent
the producers, it feels it is unable to follow those opinions.
It is obvious that the people who are likely to take the
keenest interest in a hog producers' organization will be
the large producers. They can attend meetings, they have
the money to travel, to pay for meals and hotel rooms, and
it is they who become officers of the organization. The
bulk of the hogs are not produced by the leaders of those
farm organizations. Most are produced by the tens of
thousands of small farmers, each of whom produces a
small number, and it is they who produce the bulk of the
hogs that go to market. The government was exceedingly
wise in setting a limit of 200 hogs in connection with this
deficiency payment.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Again it was a move which had a social
purpose, namely, to improve the living standard of ordinary agricultural producers.
There was criticism from the west that hog prices were
too low, and criticism from the east to the effect that the
producers were in a disastrous position because feed

SENATE DEBATES

prices were too high. I congràtulate the government for
taking this step towards helping hog producers in all parts
of Canada. It is another indication that the Prime Minister
and his government are introducing policies of great
value to ordinary Canadians.
Honourable senators, I turn now to the subject of grain.
As I entered the chamber this afternoon I was asked,
"What are you going to speak about-wheat?" I replied
that I always speak about wheat. I should like to speak on
some of the problems facing the grain exporting industry,
and particularly the problems facing the industry with
regard to the movement of grain through the west coast
ports.
a (1430)

I made a statement in this chamber some weeks ago
that the Honourable Otto Lang and all those connected
with the grain industry of this country are being exceedingly successful in this crop year because we are going to
export upwards of 800 million bushels of grain. This is 50
to 100 million bushels more than last year's all time
record, which was in excess of 700 million bushels. Sales
are coming in; the outlook has changed. Things are so
good as far as volume of sales today is concerned that
from time to time spokesmen for the government say that
we may have to refuse sales because we do not have the
physical capacity to meet further export commitments.
These are problems resulting from the highly successful
sales efforts. Transportation problems do not exist when
sales are down and there is only a small quantity of grain
moving through our ports. I am not aware of any great
problems affecting the movement of grain through the
east coast ports, but there are difficult problems affecting
the flow of grain to the west coast ports, particularly the
port of Vancouver.
Screaming headlines appear in the newspapers from
time to time, particularly on the Prairies, such as: Sales
are being lost; Glut of ships in Vancouver harbour waiting
to be loaded; There is no grain; and so forth. Such headlines upset people, and quite properly so, but why do we
have this problem at this time? I think I can give some
statistics that will show why.
They are endeavouring to unload 800 box cars of grain
daily, which means the handling of 1.5 million bushels of
grain a day. The storage facilities at Vancouver accommodate approximately 25 million bushels, so the quantity of
grain that can be held in storage, on the basis of the
amount of grain that is being shipped out of that harbour,
is just a two-week supply, or perhaps a little better. If we
are going to use Vancouver's exporting facilities to their
maximum degree, work must proceed without interference; everything must go like clockwork.
If any part of the assembly line breaks down, whether it
be as a result of snowslides in the Rockies, strikes in the
United States resulting in ships coming into Vancouver to
pick up grain, or any other cause, there is a reduction of
exports. I heard of a strike recently which was brought
about by the dismissal of a yard engineer because the
company felt his eyesight was failing. His dismissal
brought other yard engineers out on strike, shutting down
the whole movement of grain through those facilities.
Obviously we are sympathetic to anyone who suffers
because his eyesight is failing, but there should be some
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

better method of handling grievances than to have them
result in the shutting down of this whole system for the
movement of grain.
In 1969-70 Canada exported some 436 million bushels of
grain. Almost half of this, 197 million bushels, went
through the Pacific coast ports. This is almost the same as
the amount that goes through the east coast ports taking
into consideration the more than 20 million bushels going
through the port of Churchill.
How do the storage and handling facilities in the port of
Vancouver compare with those at Thunday Bay? Grain
storage at Vancouver harbour accommodates some 25
million bushels, whereas the storage facilities at Thunder
Bay accommodate 102 million bushels. In other words,
storage space for 25 million bushels at Vancouver has to
do the job that is done by storage space for 102 million
bushels at Thunder Bay.
In order to export through the west coast this year a
quantity in excess of 300 million bushels, if my calculations are correct, the capacity has to be turned over
twelve times whereas the same quantity through Thunder
Bay uses the total capacity only three times. It is no
wonder that Vancouver faces the severe difficulties it
does.
Mr. Lang has had a task force looking into this problem,
and I understand their report is now in the hands of the
trade. I believe it should be made public soon, and I hope
that it will indicate some things that may be done to
improve the facilities at Vancouver so that we will be able
to export larger quantities of grain through that port.
Some things to improve the situation that come to mind
are the following: The work week should be increased to
seven days. There should be a greater availability of
hopper cars. Senator Paterson knows more about this
than I do, but I understand hopper cars handle approximately 3,000 bushels as compared to ordinary grain box
cars that handle some 2,000 bushels. In addition, hopper
cars can be unloaded rapidly and quickly turned around.
As was suggested by the Palliser group and others,
there should be more use of inland terminals for the
purpose of conditioning grain-that is, cleaning and getting it ready for shipment to the west coast.
There is no question that there would be difficulties, but
if it is a matter of overcoming those difficulties and
obtaining greater sales, or failing to overcome them and
suffering a reduction of sales, then I think consideration
should be given to a greater use of inland terminals. There
is obviously a great need for more terminal and loading
facilities on the west coast.
I have talked about the need for programs to provide a
greater measure of national unity in this country, and I
cannot help but feel in my bones that if the difficulties at
Vancouver had occurred on the Great Lakes or in the St.
Lawrence Seaway the weight of political pressure from
Ontario, Quebec, and parts east would have quickly
resulted in steps to bring about a solution. There is not the
same kind of pressure on the west coast because it is
further away and there are fewer people involved. However, I am hopeful and confident that the Prime Minister
will take a sympathetic look at the difficulties on the west
coast and cause action to be taken during this calendar

costs by making it necessary for them to haul their grain
much greater distances.
I am pleased that we are making tremendous progress
in exporting larger and larger quantities of grain. We need
a more efficient transportation system and a more efficient system of assembling grain. The minister in charge
of the Canadian Wheat Board, and his officials, should
give an overall look at this whole question. They should
try to set up a system which, while it provides an
improved measure of efficiency, will also safeguard the
rights of local producers to have marketing facilities
within easy reach of their farms.
The note on which I started was that the government is
moving in the direction of providing policies to assure
greater national unity in Canada. To bring about greater
unity, we must have English-speaking Canada and
French-speaking Canada working together. It is easy to
think that Canada is divided between people of French
origin and people who originated from the British Isles.
However, that overlooks a very substantial section of our
nation. The government has announced that it is bringing
in a policy to promote multicultural activities. I am
pleased that this is being done. Canadians who are not of
French or British extraction are pleased that this step is
being undertaken and that these others are being given
some recognition. According to the Canada Year Book,
the 1961 census showed that 43.8 per cent of Canadians
had their origin in the British Isles; 30.4 per cent in
France, and some 25 per cent in other countries.
I should think that in this chamber greater recognition
could be given to our diverse Canadian culture, by the
appointment of a significant number of senators from
among those people who originated in other countries. I
am delighted that in the Senate, in addition to those of us
so-called British or French extraction, there are three
distinguished members of the Jewish community, a distinguished senator of Ukrainian origin and a distinguished
Indian. I may have omitted others, but I know of no
senator who is of German or Italian origin, although those
nationalities comprise substantial segments of the
Canadian nation. I would recommend to the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Martin) that the Prime Minister be
asked, when making appointments to the Senate, to see
that our membership here reflects to a much greater
extent than at present the multicultural make up of
Canada. The position of English-speaking Canadians of
British extraction would be stronger, as would the position of French Canadians, since you cannot have a strong
nation if 25 per cent of its people-those who come from
other extractions-feel they are being overlooked and that
their natural aspirations are being neglected.
Honourable senators, as a Canadian I am proud to
occupy a position in our upper chamber. I have confidence that the present government, and the government
that follows, will appoint to this Senate, in increasing
numbers, persons who will represent, by their origin, the
other important sections of Canada so necessary to the
continuation of a strong and virile nation.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, may I put a
brief question to Senator Argue? He said that when the
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

March 9, 1972

Federal Grain Company was purchased by the three prai-

rie pools, the local delegates of the pool organization had
not been contacted. Is it not true that a shareholder of the
Saskatchwean Wheal Pool is not entitled to attend an
annual meeting?

Hon. Mr. Argue: My understanding is that a shareholder
of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool is not entitled to attend
an annual meeting. The annual meeting is of their delegate body. I have complained of this privately. Almost all
their sessions are secret. I think that is a mistake. Certainly, I cannot understand why the doors would not be wide
open so that 50 or 100 or a 1,000 Wheat Pool members
would be made welcome at their annual meeting.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Thank you. I could not agree more.
Is it not also true that a delegate to a local committee is
not entitled to attend an annual meeting?
Hon. Mr. Argue: A member of a local committee?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I am a member of a local committee,
and I do not think I have any more right to attend an
annual meeting than if I were only a local member. It is a
hierarchical system. One may argue that it is completely
democratic with the powers two or three stages removed.
It is quite difficult for the wishes of a local committee to
be reflected at the head office.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It goes against the grain.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, may I
add my congratulations to those already extended to the
mover and to the seconder of the Address in Reply to the
Speech from the Throne. By now they may well feel that
such congratulations are but a pleasant formality which is
a part of the Senate tradition. If they do feel this way,
then I am happy to inform them that such is not the case.
The congratulations they have received are a sincere
expression of the appreciation felt by all of us for the
excellent manner in which they fulfilled their task. It was
a job well done and worthy of congratulations.
However, I must confess that, on hearing those speeches
by the mover and by the seconder, I hastened to read the
Throne Speech all over again as, for some reason or
another, I did not seem to get as much out of it as they did.
Again, on hearing some of the other speeches given in this
debate, I read the Speech again several times, as I felt I
must be missing some essential part of it, since it wholly
failed to evoke in me those sentiments of admiration, and
indeed of veneration, that it seems to have evoked in
others.
Honourable senators, I will not pursue this further, as
today I wish to speak in a nonpartisan manner and even
to give some credit where I think it is due, although before
I conclude iny remarks I may have some mild criticism of
some items in the Throne Speech. I may also mention one
or two matters not dealt with and which I believe should

have been.
I do approve of that part of the Speech which mentions

that steps will be taken to provide compensation for victims of crime. Certainly, such a move is worthy of support. As you know, several of the provinces already do
this, but since criminal law comes under federal jurisdiction it would seem logical that compensation for the vic-

March 9, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

tims of crime would be a federal responsibility. There can
be no doubt about victims of crime being entitled to
receive compensation. After all, it is an essential duty and
an essential responsibility of the state to provide protection for the life and the person of each of its citizens. If the
state cannot give such protection, if it fails in this duty,
then it is only right and proper that it pay compensation
to those who suffer on account of its inability or its
negligence.
The speech also mentions that some amendments will
be proposed in the administration of the criminal law, and
indeed bills have already been introduced in the House of
Commons to make such amendments. One bill, Bill C-2, is
quite extensive, containing 76 clauses. I think most of
these clauses are non-controversial and will find ready
support. For example, one amendment will change the
present dividing line, as it were, between indictable and
nonindictable offences in theft cases from the present $50
to $200. You will no doubt recall that a private bill to bring
about this very change was passed in this chamber twice
but got lost somewhere in the routine of the other place.
In my opinion the amendments contained in this bill, and
others, while good do not go nearly far enough. Personally
I think the amendments proposed are a patchwork affair.
The whole Criminal Code needs to be examined in the
light of changing conditions, and recommendations
should be made to streamline it and bring it up to date.
0 (1500)
The administration of justice, especially criminal justice, is a slow, leisurely and cumbersome process and
more suitable to the pace of the nineteenth than to that of
the twentieth century. I understand there is a commission
or task force working on a proposed revision of the Criminal Code. I hope we will receive their recommendations
before too long. I hope they will recommend that the
distinction between indictable and nonindictable offences
be abolished, as I believe the administration of justice
would be better served if there was but one procedure,
and if the option of trial by jury were governed by the
type of sentence which could be imposed. I will not discuss this matter further now as we will have ample opportunity to discuss it when the bills I have mentioned come
before us. I shall only add that I firmly believe some
method must be found to speed up the administration of
justice, especially where the criminal law is involved,
otherwise respect for the law will be further eroded, since
in my opinion it is not held in very high respect at the
present time.
May I say in passing that I believe it would be a better
practice when amending statutes to have a separate bill
dealing with each statute. For example, Bill C-2 is entitled,
"An Act to amend the Criminal Code, and to make related
amendments to the Criminal Code 1967 Amendment Act,
the Criminal Records Act, the National Defence Act, the
Parole Act and the Visiting Forces Act" and Bill C-6 is
entitled, "An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Crown
Liability Act and the Official Secrets Act."
Recently we received the new Revised Statutes of
Canada 1970 which consolidates the statutes up to that
time. It would make it much easier for those who must
work with the statutes if separate bills were used. It would
certainly make it much easier to keep the Revised Stat-

utes up to date. May I also say in passing that Bills C-2,
C-6 and C-7 could have been dealt with much more
expeditiously if they had been first introduced in this
chamber.
Mention is made in the Throne Speech that there will be
further reforms in the parole system. I hesitate to comment on this until we know exactly what is to be proposed, especially as our Legal and Constitutional Affairs
Committee is now making an examination of the whole
system. However, I would like to pay a well-deserved
tribute to the members of this committee for the work
they are doing in examining the parole system. I am not, I
regret to say, a regular attendant at the meetings but I did
attend on Thursday last and I was most impressed. It was
an interesting and instructive meeting, and I am sure that
the committee's report will be a very valuable document. I
would also say that this meeting strengthened the conviction I already had that the present Parole Board members
are doing admirable work. They are doing a work which
by its very nature cannot be given publicity, but if it could
be made known I believe it would draw universal praise
and commendation.
I suppose it is inevitable that we hear of the failures
under the parole system but we cannot hear of its impressive record of successful rehabilitation in a great many
cases. I do believe the Parole Board as presently constituted deserves the thanks and wholehearted support of all
who are interested in this important matter.
Honourable senators, I expect many of you were surprised, as I was terribly surprised, to find nowhere in the
Throne Speech any reference to the war on poverty.
Indeed there appears to be no reference whatsoever to the
great problem of poverty in Canada. To be fair about it,
there is a passing reference to the "isolation of individuals
caused by economic deprivation" and perhaps this means
"poverty" dressed up in fancy language. No, I could find
nothing in the Throne Speech which would indicate to me
that the government had any real concern regarding poverty in Canada. Certainly there is nothing to show it has
any realistic plans to fight this grave and pressing problem. And yet the government should know the awful
extent of the problem.
The report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty
showed the extent of poverty in our country without seeking either to minimize it or to exaggerate it. That report
showed that in 1969, the last year for which it had statistics, the overail poverty rate was just over 25 per cent. I
doubt if there has been much, if any, improvement since
then. Indeed, I remember being shocked just before last
Christmas when I saw the number of appeals being made
for funds to provide Christmas dinners for needy families. Why even here in Ottawa, the capital of Canada,
there was such an appeal. The Ottawa Citizen of November 25, 1971, stated it was starting its annual Christmas
Exchange Fund, and I quote from it: "The Fund this year
hopes to provide 35,000 meals for the underprivileged at
Christmas." It does not look as if the war on poverty has
been won if in the very capital of Canada 35,000 meals
were needed at Christmas for the underprivileged, and I
take it that means the poor. No, the war on poverty has
not been won, although one would never know it by the
Speech from the Throne. Nor is the problem solved by

118

SENATE DEBATES

giving poverty another name. Poverty is poverty even
though terms like the "needy" or the "underprivileged" or
the "isolation of individuals caused by economic deprivation" are used.
Honourable senators, I wholly agree with the statement
contained on page 175 of the report on poverty, and I
quote it because I believe it cannot be quoted too often or
emphasized too strongly:
The Senate Committee is firmly convinced that the
time has now come for Canada to incorporate the
right to an adequate standard of living for all Canadians into the Canadian Bill of Rights. It is also clear
that an adequate standard of living in the Canadian
context is dependent on the security provided by an
adequate income. The acceptance by Canada of an
adequate minimum income as a matter of right for all
citizens is the principal recommendation of this
report.
And may I interject here that every time I read the report
I am more and more impressed with its contents. It is
really a tremendous work and will long remain as a tribute to the zeal and the dedication of the members of that
committee.
a (1510)

Certain proposals were made by that committee which
the members believed would, if implemented, go a long
way toward solving this urgent and massive problem of
poverty. A brief outline of the main proposal is found at
page 178 of the report, as follows:
The committee proposes the implementation of a program of guaranteed annual income using the negative
income tax method, on a uniform, national basis,
financed and administered by the federal government, making uniform cash payments to all resident
Canadians in economic need. Payments would vary
by family size and need and would establish a "floor"
level below which no family unit would be permitted
to fall.
The committee went into detail as to the way the plan
would operate. It even took into consideration and provided against the remote possibility that the plan would
erode a person's will to work.
I believe this plan has great merit and is worthy of
support, and I am sorry it was rejected by the government
in what can only be described as indecent haste. On the
other hand, I think the committee did not go far enough to
provide for certain classes of people. For example, I do
not think the proposal that the basic allowance rate be
established at 70 per cent of the poverty line should apply
to those of our older citizens who are unable to supplement the guaranteed annual income in any way. I know of
old people who were always able to pay their own way,
who saved a few dollars over a lifetime of frugal living
and were always independent. Now living, perhaps, in a
home for the aged, their income is no longer sufficient to
pay their way. They see their life savings being rapidly
eaten up, and they worry about what the future holds for
them. It is a dreadful thing, a shocking state of affairs,
that old people who should be passing their few remaining years in an atmosphere of serenity and security are
frightened of the future. This should not be. I know it has
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald.]

March 9, 1972

been said that in effect there is a guaranteed annual
income now, that old age security plus the supplement is
such an income for those over 65 years of age. I point out
that the committee recommended an "adequate income,"
and it is wholly unrealistic to classify the old age security
and the supplement as adequate in any sense of the term.
I do believe that the government should now, at this
session of Parliament, show it has at least some realization of the plight of our older citizens. It should show some
sense of compassion and of justice by increasing the supplement to the old age security to a realistic and adequate
level instead of leaving it the miserable pittance it is now.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is the highest in the world.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not agree. And your alibies
have no effect on me.
Honourable senators, I notice by the Throne Speech
that unemployment continues to be a matter of intense
concern to the government, and well it might be. With
over 600,000 Canadians unemployed, the government
should be concerned. It should also be concerned by its
utter failure to institute policies which would generate
and stimulate employment. The record of the government
regarding employment is very dismal. You may remember as I do the attitude of the then Minister of Labour
when, speaking in the House of Commons on January 18,
1971, he made a very cold-blooded statement in reference
to unemployment. I quote his very words:
It takes courage sometimes to create unemployment.
We have created unemployment in the textile industry
and we will probably create it temporarily in other
industries as we automate and as we rationalize these
industries.
The minister has not stated, to my knowledge, in just what
other industries unemployment has been deliberately
created, nor has he indicated just what length of time he
considers to be temporary-a week, a year or perhaps
forever. And then just as recently as last November that
intense concern was not so evident. The Ottawa Journal
of November 15, 1971, carried a Canadian Press story of
an interview given by the Prime Minister. It quoted him as
saying these words:
In a society which has evolved as much as ours has,
people can give themselves the luxury of not accepting simply any job. It isn't like the 1930s when there
were no jobs, when people kicked up their heels and
lined up for anything. There are plenty of jobs.
That statement does not appear to me to indicate an
intense concern for the unemployed.
I believe that unemployment is the most pressing and
urgent problem we face at this time. Over 600,000 of our
fellow Canadians are without work. They are subject to
all the deprivation, the frustrations, the worry and the
fear which result from loss of employment. They are
subject, to use the fanciful language of the Throne
Speech, to the "isolation of individuals caused by economic deprivation." I expect it is but cold comfort to an
unemployed person to know that others share his isolation, that over 600,000 others are in the sane horrible
predicament.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the Throne must
have been a bitter disappointment to those Canadians

in more favourable circumstances in British Columbia
than any other part of Canada.
I accept the statement of the government with regard
to the contribution it has made in creating additional jobs
over the past year. I accept the figures they put forward
and that it is a better record than those of other countries.
On balance I believe it is pretty good, but it is simply not
good enough. I have no sympathy for those who are
unemployed and who will not take jobs for which they are
qualified when such jobs become available. That is one
category. In my opinion, however, it is a crime against
humanity that jobs are not available for those willing and
anxious to work.
The easiest course is to say simply, "Let us place the
total responsibility for the problem on the government." I
wish I could do that. It would be so much easier. When I
ask myself what contribution I have made in any way to
alleviate unemployment, I can say that in my function as a
trade union representative I have assisted in extracting
from many industries money that ordinarily would have
been locked in the vault and caused it to be put into
circulation to create more jobs. But, I wonder if we have
all made the kind of contribution that we should and
could have made, or if we have simply said it is the
government's responsibility?
A series of conferences with the provinces should be
held, not of management separately and labour separately, under the auspices of the federal government which, in

contains no proposals for the alleviation of poverty, since
it contains no realistic plans to provide employment, and
since it contains so many pious platitudes in place of
reasonable policies, I am unable to support the motion.

ization known as P.F.A., the initials of Pensioners For
Action. The pensioners are organizing. I do not believe we
need worry with respect to their rights or about imposing
binding arbitration upon them, but they will organize.
Perhaps they will be more effective in the area of the
ballot box, and collectively they will count. It seems to me
that we have some responsibility to provide for those on
fixed incomes, and to take steps on their behalf before
this becomes a fact.
I am glad to see in the Speech from the Throne that
there seems to be concern for women's rights. I think this
is good, because that is another group which is in the
process of becoming organized. I do not wish to be understood as being an advocate of women's lib, or anything
like that. I know how easily any reference involving
women can be misunderstood. A lawyer friend of mine
acted as executor for a will in which the deceased husband provided that $6,000 be set aside in order that upon
his death his wife could buy a suitable stone in his
memory. She bought a star sapphire. I want to be careful
how I express this, because one can easily be
misunderstood.
We have a tendency to overlook housewives who are not
included in the statistics of employment, and not considered to be part of the work force. Heaven knows, they
certainly make a contribution to the country as a whole.
Federal legislation provides for paid statutory holidays
and annual holidays for many groups and classifications
of workers, but not for housewives because they are not
considered to be workers. It seems to me that before this
group organizes we should speak in terms of extending
that legislation to provide paid statutory holidays and
paid annual leave for housewives, so that they may take a
holiday, perhaps even away from their husbands, before
they recognize that they also have considerable bargaining power. Once they recognize that, I suspect there will
be many hot days and cold nights.
I am also pleased to see that the Speech from the
Throne refers to concern for farms and agriculture. I am
concerned about areas such as the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. As a country boy who walked and ploughed
those green fields, I am concerned about the green spaces
that we will lose to developers if steps are not taken. I am
concerned that many municipalities, cities, and even provinces are not taking the necessary steps in this direction.
We shall have to look to the federal government for leadership in order to preserve some of these farmlands, these
producing areas and wheat belts. I hope we shall be
encouraged in the practice of consulting with those who
are best qualified to decide these issues--not academics,
but farmers and people who live and work in the area,
and who understand local conditions and feel for the soil.
* (1530)

I was pleased to see that the Speech from the Throne
made reference to a new labour bill to be introduced. I do
not wish to deal with this matter at any length. The
opportunity to do so will be given when the measure
comes before us. In view of so much concern about the
impact of militancy associated with labour, I hope that the
new bill will provide for the organization of an increasing
number of workers. It is to be hoped that eventually 100
per cent of Canada's work force will be organized.
[Hon. Mr. Lawson.]

March 9, 1972

Most people shudder in horror at such a possibility.
They complain about militancy on the part of a small
group of organized people, yet they oppose any move to
organize the labour force which would have the effect of
bringing in what is called the silent majority, of decreasing incidents of militancy, and would provide an opportunity for the work force to express its views. There is
need for industry to reshape its thinking, and we should
encourage further organization of the work force.
I have always maintained a jealous regard for my role
as an Independent, but on one point I should like to
identify myself with the comments of that thoroughbred
Tory, Senator O'Leary, regarding our relations with the
United States.
A few weeks ago, following an invitation by President
Nixon, I had the opportunity of attending a conference in
Washington, D.C. dealing with United States economy,
business, and industry in the 1990s. The conference discussed some of the innovations affecting ships of the
future. It was envisaged that major deep-sea vessels
would be equipped with elevators and barges which
would enable them to travel from deep-sea channels to
small tributaries which at present do not have the facilities for large ships. Natural gas would be used and, by
means of a process of refrigeration, millions of cubic feet
of natural gas would disappear into the atmosphere.
Other matters discussed concerned the design of kitchens
which would make life easier for housewives, economic
matters, human relations, and labour-management
relations.
I agree with Senator O'Leary's views concerning the
closeness of our relationship and our interdependence
with the United States. While I endorse the remarks of the
Prime Minister that we should bargain from a position of
strength, I believe that we should do everything possible
to preserve that close relationship with our neighbour.
I was pleased to hear the comments of His Honour the
Speaker and Senator O'Leary of the meeting of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group which took
place recently in Ottawa.
While I was in Washington I was interested to observe
the attitude of the American delegates towards Canada. It
is very easy for us to talk about our attitude towards
Americans, and to express concern about their taking
over our industries, and so on. It might be of interest to
share with honourable senators an extract from a report
on the White House Conference, which provides an indication of what is likely to happen over the next 20 years, and
an insight into America's attitude toward us. The report,
titled "Commerce Today", and subtitled "A Look at Business in 20 Years", states:
Canada made no change in its currency as a result
of the new monetary arrangements but will continue
to maintain a floating exchange rate without government intervention except as required to maintain
orderly conditions.
The Canadian dollar was unpegged in June 1970
from its fixed rate of 92.5 U.S. cents and has since
floated upward in relation to the U.S. dollar. In the
last quarter of 1971, the value of the Canadian dollar
fluctuated between 99 U.S. cents and par with the U.S.
dollar. When the U.S. dollar is devalued, the Canadian

March 9, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

dollar will simultaneously move downward, maintaining the same differential between the two currencies.
Despite the unchanged position of the Canadian
dollar, U.S. exporters should find the new monetary
arrangements benefiting their sales in the Canadian
market. The pace of these sales is closely linked to the
rate of growth of the Canadian economy. The removal
of uncertainties about international monetary
arrangements and the lifting of the U.S. import surcharge has given a boost to Canadian business confidence which had been shaken by the world monetary
crisis.
With Canadian exports heavily dependent on the
U.S. market, the U.S. surcharge imposition and the
exclusion of foreign-origin machinery from the
Investment Tax Credit raised doubts in the Canadian
business community as to the prospects of sales to the
United States. This widespread uneasiness had threatened to slow Canadian economic recovery, which was
showing signs of strength in the latter half of 1971. As
a result of the economy's sluggish performance in
1970, U.S. exports to that market had declined slightly
after having registered substantial annual gains in the
previous decade. The year 1971 was considerably
better, with an increase of 10.4 per cent.
The resurgence of confidence enhances the prospects for a rapid growth of the Canadian economy in
1972. The improved business climate should give an
impetus to spending for plant and equipment, and
result in better sales possibilities for capital goods.
The United States traditionally has been dominant as
a supplier in this sector.
U.S. exporters should also gain on the Canadian
market as a result of an improved competitive position vis-à-vis third countries. Although no change took
place in the U.S.-Canadian monetary relationship, the
currencies of the chief competitors appreciated substantially. Based on the May 1, 1971, exchange rate for
the Canadian dollar, the value of the Japanese yen
rose by 16 per cent, the German mark by 13 per cent,
and the British pound by 8 per cent. This should
strengthen the position of U.S. products in Canada,
where they hold the lion's share of the import market-more than 70 per cent. In finished products, the
U.S. share of the Canadian market is even largerapproximately 80 per cent.
Among the areas in which the United States stands
to gain from a better competitive position are automotive products and certain consumer goods. In recent
years, there has been a growing Canadian demand for
small cars from overseas sources such as Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In 1971, vehicles from
overseas accounted for 24 per cent of Canadian car
registrations. With U.S. car prices now more attractive, we should be able to take advantage of the strong
market for new autos. Sales of U.S. models produced
in Canadian branch plants should also increase, and
this will mean export gains for the United States in
automotive parts.
Rapid economic growth in Canada over the next
few years is expected to spark a substantial boom in
consumer goods purchases. Although consumption is

largely satisfied from local production, there should
be increased opportunities for U.S. exporters. For
example, an improved price position will help the U.S.
to compete on better terms with the Japanese in sales
of photographic equipment, stereo systems, and
home furnishings.
Taking into account the renewal of business confidence in Canada, the intention of the Canadian government to pursue policies aimed at stimulating the
economy, and the stronger position which the U.S.
exporter will have vis-à-vis third country competition,
Canada should prove an increasingly attractive
market to American firms that are seeking to expand
their export sales.

Surely we should start to have some confidence in ourselves. Someone asked me recently, "What can we do
about solving the problem of unemployment? Is there any
simple, easy solution?" It seems to me that if there is, it is
to be found in the word "confidence". The solution cannot
result from a joint program between the provinces, or
from a large capital expenditure by the federal government on a crash program. The solution, it seems to me, is
to install in each and every Canadian confidence in himself, his employer, his government and the economy of his
country.
If we are to have a democratic contest in the not too
distant future I hope that it be a spirited one with criticism of things that have been done or have not been done,
but I hope also the criticism is not put in such a way as to
undermine the confidence of Canadians in their economy
or in their country.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved
by the honourable Senator Buckwold seconded by the
honourable Senator Lapointe, that the following Address
be presented to His Excellency the Governor General of
Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Roland
Michener, Chancellor and Principal Companion of the
Order of Canada, upon whom has been conferred the
Canadian Forces' Decoration, Governor General and
Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY:

We, Her Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled, beg
leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has
addressed to both Houses of Parliament.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: On division.
Motion agreed to and the Address in Reply to the
Speech from the Throne adopted, on division.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Martin, ordered that the Address
be engrossed and presented to His Excellency the Governor General by the Honourable the Speaker.

SENATE DEBATES
REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
APPOINTMENT OF SENATE MEMBERS TO JOINT
COMMITTEE
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Martin, seconded by
Hon. Mr. McDonald, that the following senators be
appointed to act on behalf of the Senate on the Standing
Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments, namely, the
honourable Senators Fergusson, Forsey, Goldenberg, Grosart, Haig, Lafond, Molson and Rowe; and that a message
be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that house
accordingly.

[Translation]
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I do not
have much to add to the learned speeches we have
already heard on this motion. Moreover, it is an honour
for me to be a member of this very important committee.
It is high time we had such a committee in the Canadian
Parliament.
I think that in a society which wants to call itself a just
society such a committee is imperative. It is an
indispensable part of the mechanism of the constitutional

body which a just society needs.
I think that the task of this committee will be enormous
and extremely complex. I expect a great part of this work
will fall on those committee members who come from the
Senate, insofar as we are of course under far less pressure

than members of the House of Commons. There will very
likely be fewer changes in the make-up of the committee
on the Senate side, as in the next few months we will

probably have a general election where some members of
the House of Commons will-perhaps unfortunately, or
perhaps fortunately in some cases-lose their seats;
whereas in this place we have a little more stability, so to
speak, since we are here, if not, as formerly, until we die,
at least, God willing, until the age of 75. So I think we shall
have a fairly stable group of members on the Senate side,
and in the work of this committee we shall have the
opportunity to give the general public and the Canadian
population ample proof of our value. It is sometimes-and
not only sometimes-believed that we represent the big
shots of St. James Street or Bay Street, but here is an
opportunity for us to demonstrate to the general public
exactly the opposite: that we are rather, for the purposes

of this committee at least, representatives of the public, of
Canadians in general.
I think that not only shall we have the opportunity to
prove this fact, but we shall do our duty in this connection
and we will give proof of our value as members of the
Upper House, of the house of sober second thought, and

March 9, 1972

Commons do their best to carry out their duties as members of this important committee, there will be such a
mass of documents to be scrutinized, so many things to be
done and so much expertise of all kinds will be needed
that without a sufficient number of technical and knowledgeable staff, the committee will be unable to properly
carry out its duties which to me, and I say it again, are of
the utmost importance.
I do not share Senator Grosart's disquiet about the
impotence or alleged impotence of the committee. In the
first place, it should be emphasized that on the Senate
side, the committee will be bi-partisan or even multi-partisan since it will include not only Liberal and Conservative
senators, but also a representative of independent senators in the person of Senator Molson who, it is needless to
say, is a very experienced and highly valued senator and,
I believe, has an unequalled knowledge of public affairs.
On the House of Commons side, the committee will also
be multi-partisan. I do not think there will be any partisanship within the committee. It will be a committee of
technicians and experts. We shall also obtain the assistance of various experienced legal experts, not only from
the Senate but, I hope, from the House of Commons.
Moreover, we shall have Senator Grosart himself, that
valiant and vigilant defender of the people's rights, that
distinguished spokesman of the Opposition in this house. I
think we can rely on his vigilance and strength as well as
on his intelligence and experience to defend the people's
rights.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It will be a happy gang.

Hon. Mr. Forsey: Oh! No, not that.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Let us hope we have a happy gang.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: If you wish, senator, if you wish, but I
do not think I can use these words myself since I believe
there will be sometimes within the committee, more tears
than smiles. This will be not only hard work, but even a
heartbreaking task at times. "Happy" if you like, but I
rather doubt it.

I believe we shall also have the normal powers vested in
any committee. Senator Grosart, if I remember correctly,
has asked for instance whether the committee will have
authority to report to this House. I think it is a matter of
course, because I have looked into the rules of the Senate
and found that Rule 71 deals with this matter. I should
like to quote from Rule 71:
A standing committee-

so on.

-and this is a standing committee-shall be empowered to inquire into and report upon
such matters as are referred to it from time to time by
the Senate-

I must emphasize some aspects of the previous
speeches, some points made by the honourable senators
who spoke before me in this debate, such as, for instance
the absolute necessity for this committee to have expert
and adequate staff. Here I am not talking only of committee members, but of staff in the technical sense of the
word, so to speak-experts, members of the Public Service of Canada, for instance. In order to do our job, I think
we shall sorely need expert and adequate staff because
even if all the senators and members of the House of

Well, I think this joint committee of both houses will
have exactly the same powers in that respect as any other
standing committee of the Senate alone-someone might
correct me if I am wrong-and if the committee is empowered to report to the Senate, once the report has been
tabled here, any senator, as far as I know, has the right to
call the attention of the Senate to that report, to initiate a
debate on it. Furthermore, should anything disquiet the
members of the committee, if a report is made on that
situation and a senator calls the attention of the Senate to

[Hon. Mr. Macdonald.]

Msrch 9, 1972
March

SENATE DEBATES

that situation, to those deficiencies, to those bad aspects
of a regulation or any part of a regulation, well, I think
public opinion will soon be alerted and attention will be
focused on the issues involved, and no government can
resist a well-informed public opinion on a subject the said
public opinion considers to be of special importance.
So, I think that if the committee does its duty-and I am
sure it will-I think, as I say, we shall have sufficient
protection against the excesses of bureaucracy-as people
say sometimes-the excess of the cabinet, the excesses of
the government and any part of the organism of government, either from ministers or from civil servants. However, the success of this committee will in the final analysis depend on us-not only the members of the
committee, but also the members of the Senate who I
think should scrutinize in a proper way the work of the
committee.
As far as I know, any senator has the right to appear
before any committee-except in the case of meetings
held in camera.
So, I think one can hope that many senators who are not
members of that committee will attend the meetings of
that committee to examine our efforts, to encourage us, to
administer punishment, should this become necessary. I
hope the Senate in general will take an interest in our
work.
I think the committee will have a heavy responsibility, a
responsibility of the first order, for public interest, the

interest of the average citizen . I hope that all the members of the committee will be equal to the task.
I have absolutely nothing to add to those few remarks,
honourable senators. I apologize for their mediocrity but
when gifted speakers like the Government Leader in the
Senate, like Senator Connolly (Ottawa-West), the Leader
of the Opposition and my honourable friend and colleague Senator Goldenberg, when all these very erudite
senators have, so to speak, dealt with all the important
points, what can a poor amateur like myself, neither a
lawyer, nor a jurist, nor an expert in the field, possibly
do?
Hon. Mr. Martin: You are too modest.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I apologize once more for the mediocrity of my remarks in this regard but that, honourable
senators, is my small contribution.

DISTINGUISHED VISITORS IN SENATE GALLERY
PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION FROM THE SUPREME
SOVIET OF THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I should
like to call your attention to the presence in the gallery of
prominent parliamentarians from the U.S.S.R., who are
visiting our country as guests of the Senate of Canada.
This delegation is composed of seven important members
of the Supreme Soviet, and is headed by Mr. Nikolai
Tikhonov, who is the Deputy of the Council of the
Supreme Soviet and Deputy Chairman of the Council of
Ministers of the U.S.S.R. I should not like to pass unnoticed the presence also of His Excellency the Ambassador
for the U.S.S.R. in Canada, the Honourable Boris Miroshnichenko. Other members of this delegation are now
engaged in meetings with ministerial people of the Government of Canada.
Honourable senators, I know that you would like me, on
your behalf, to extend a very hearty welcome to these
guests in our midst. We sincerely hope that their visit in
Canada will be successful and beneficial to both
countries.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, in view of the
importance of this delegation of Soviet parliamentarians,
I think it is appropriate that, as Leader of the Government, I should join His Honour in extending to this delegation a warm welcome to Canada and to this bouse of
the Canadian Parliament.
The delegation is paying a return visit for one made by
Your Honour, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) and Senator Aird, over a year ago.
Indeed, it is a distinguished delegation that we are privileged to recognize and honour at this time. As you have
observed, Mr. Speaker, it is headed by Mr. Nikolai A.
Tikhonov, Deputy of the Council of the Union of the
Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.
Likewise, it is interesting to note the presence of Mr.
Konstantin I. Galanshin, Deputy of the Council of
Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union,
who is at the same time minister of the pulp and paper
industry of the Soviet Union. We welcome also the presence of Mrs. Nina Antonova, representative of the Moldavian Republic of the Soviet Union, who is a distinguished physician.
We welcome Mr. Alexander B. Chakovsky, member of
the Foreign Relations Commission of the Council of
Nationalities; Mr. Nikolai F. Tatarchouk, member of the
Council of Nationalities Commission on construction and
construction materials industry; Mr. Ivan R. Sidorovitch,
member of the Council of Union Commission on transpor-

tation and communication; and Mr. Michael A. Stelmakh,
member of the Foreign Relations Commission of the
Council of the Soviet Union; together with officials.
Today, the delegation is accompanied by His Excellency
Boris P. Miroshnichenko, Ambassador of the Soviet
Union to Canada.

(1510)

We recall other important visits of distinguished personalities in the government of the Soviet Union. Mr.
Polyansky, a deputy premier, came four years ago. We
still recall with satisfaction the important visit of the
Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union,
Mr. Kosygin, who visited Canada last November.
Canada has had parliamentary exchanges with her
southern neighbours. Delegations have come from Commonwealth countries and from France. We regard these
visits, including the present one, as part of the process of
trying to build a more peaceful world.
I am sure that when the members of this Soviet delegation see the expanse of our country throughout Canada,
this, together with the discussions that will ensue, will give
them further evidence of our own great desire for peace
with all our neighbours. They will realize why we are
anxious to further our relations with the peoples of all
countries.
We recognize the powerful place that the Soviet Union,
the United States and other countries play in the family of
nations. It is our desire to join these countries, more
powerful than we, in furthering the interests of international collaboration.
This particular visit is a further manifestation of the
desire of both our countries to find a way of resolving our
differences through adjudication, discussion and conciliation. This is a happy visit for us and we hope it will be a
happy visit for our distinguished visitors.
[Translation]
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I wish to join
the Speaker of the Senate and the government leader in
heartily welcoming our most distinguished visitors, who
are returning the visit a group of us paid them in the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1970, a delegation
of which it was my privilege to be a member together with
the Speaker, Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) and Senator
Aird. I hope Canada, and the Senate particularly, will
have the opportunity during the coming days to reciprocate the cordial hospitality extended to us on that occasion. The Soviet Parliament, the Supreme Soviet, was not
sitting at the time, so that we were not able to observe
legislative and other practice in that great country. Our
guests will, for a few minutes, have an opportunity to see
the proceedings of the Senate.
[English]
As opposition leader, I see the purpose of the Senate
under this administration as mainly one of reviewing
legislation and passing it. The Leader of the Senate on the

SENATE DEBATES

March 14, 1972

government side, when he wants the opinion of his followers on any matter, gives it to them.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The Leader of the Official Opposition,
on the other hand, does not dare turn round to see who is
following him.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Or how many are following him.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: In our spare time when we are not
watching government legislation go through, we sit in
committees and solve the great problems, economie and
social, which this country faces now or which it is soon to
face. Our committees publish reports and these reports
are printed and distributed to the government and to the
press. Some ministers thank us and tell us that we are
brilliant; the press tells us that we are out of touch, that
our interests conflict, and that we should either reform or
they will abolish us. The truth of the matter is that we are
not half as bad as they think we are, and we are not half
as good as we think we are.
I would not want to leave our guests with the impression
that we are reactionaries and that we are intrinsically
opposed to change. We have evolved over the years. There
used to be only one dissenter on the government side, now
there are two and sometimes even three. In fact, sometimes there are even more who suggest that they are not in
favour of the government. There used to be only one
deputy leader on the government side but now, generally
speaking, senators have a choice. Senators also have a
choice in another way; they can oppose the government
and have the majority accuse them of being unenlightened or reactionary, or they can oppose the government
and have the majority consider them as ingrates.
That, honoured guests, is the Senate as some of us see it
on cloudy days. But there are brighter days, and today is
one of those because we are afforded the opportunity of
welcoming you and wishing you a happy stay in Canada.

OFFICIAL REPORTS
TRANSLATION SERVICES-QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I rise on a
question of privilege because I think this is the appropriate moment to do so. I should like to ask whether something can be done to improve the English translation of
speeches delivered in this house in French. I have occasionally had the hardihood to address the house in what I
hoped was French, but on each occasion the English
translation of what I said has varied from poor to
atrocious.
The other day I made some remarks here exclusively in
French-I do not think I used a single word of Englishand the English translation was exceedingly bad, and it
has almost decided me to make no further speeches in
French at all. I say this, honourable senators, because I
fear that if I do so I run the risk of appearing to the
English readers of our Debates as a brimstone idiot, and I
certainly do not want to do that. I may be foolish, but I do
not want to appear any more foolish than I have to be.
Of course, this has its comic side, and I am aware that
part of the cause may be the deficiencies in my French,
although I have found the French report of what I said to
be very accurate. There may have been one or two occasions when I spoke indistinctly and the word did not get
through, but in general the report was extremely accurate. But, as I say, the translation is far from accurate and
has obviously been done by somebody who is very illversed in the idiom of the English language.
* (1520)

I am the more struck by these deficiencies because on
the more numerous occasions when I have addressed this
house in English, the French translation has been absolutely superb. In some cases, it is far better than the
original English. It rubs off all the rough spots and makes
them smooth, and it rounds off all the corners and I ask
myself, "Is it possible that I made a speech which was so
well expressed?" Our French translators are superb. They
not only give the sense of what I have said but they put it
in better language than I did when I made the speech.
However, the English translations are really deplorable.
I am not speaking of one single incident. But I corrected
three or four pages this afternoon and I must have made
100 corrections.
I wonder whether something could be done to improve
the English translations of French speeches. I do not
know whether other senators suffer from this problem. It
may be that I am unlucky. However, I am concerned
about the situation, particularly because a certain committee to which I belong drafted a report, one-third of
which was in French, and exactly the same thing happened. The French translation of the English was generally very good, but the English translation of the French
was exceedingly poor.
I cannot help but wonder how the translators are
chosen. I wonder if the translators for French into English
are chosen with sufficient care. I would urge whoever is
responsible to look into this matter and endeavour to

SENATE DEBATES

improve the situation. I do not believe it is satisfactory at
all. I am ardently in favour of bilingualism, but I mean
bilingualism. I would like to see the English translations
into French done as well as the French translations into
English. I insist that we have a right to have the English
translations into French given the same care in this
chamber.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I support Senator
Forsey's point of privilege. Some years ago I rose on the
same point of privilege in the House of Commons, but it
was for the opposite reason. A member had presented an
awful speech in French and the translator had succeeded
in making it into a very good speech in English.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I shall see
that this matter is looked into. I would indicate to the
honourable Senator Forsey that this is a very serious
point of privilege, and I thank him for bringing it to our
attention. I would encourage other senators to do likewise
if and when they feel that their speeches have been inadequately translated. This is the only way we can deal with
the matter. I will see to it that the officers concerned look
into this complaint, and I may report back to the chamber
at a later time. Surely we are entitled to the best possible
translation services in both English and French. I thank
Senator Forsey for having brought this matter to our
attention.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I should have
added that I am aware of the difficulties which the translators face and the extraordinarily complicated tasks
they have, as well as the degree of expertise which they
must have. I am sorry that I had to raise this complaint.
The Hon. the Speaker: The only way this service will be
improved is by bringing such matters to our attention
from time to time.
POVERTY
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. David A. Croll rose, pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty in
Canada, tabled in the Senate on Wednesday, 10th
November, 1971.

[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 14, 1972

He said: Honourable senators, I have in my hand the
second printing of the report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty in Canada, which became available
today. It has been out of print for two months. Up to this
time it had been available only through Information
Canada and a few bookstores in Ottawa. It had not been
made available in bookstores in other parts of the country. We hope that Information Canada will now ensure
that it is made available to bookstores. If it is, you can rest
assured that there will be a third printing.
I shall limit myself to just a few words today, my intention being to make a further statement and explain my
method of launching this particular inquiry. It was, as the
Leader of the Opposition said at the time, to provide an
occasion in the usual way for a number of honourable
senators who did not have an opportunity at the last
session, because of prorogation, to express their views on
the report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty in
Canada. In other words, the purpose was to revive in this
session a debate which was interrupted during the last
session. In my view it is of national importance that this
debate, or the dialogue on the substance of the recommendations, be kept alive, particularly when I am told, and I
do believe, that this will be an election year.
I invite all honourable senators who have not yet spoken
on the Poverty report to take advantage of the inquiry to
express their views on the record of the Senate. As Arthur
Blakely, the well-known columnist of the Montreal
Gazette, wrote in the issue of November 25, 1971:
Distinguished lawyers, financiers and businessmen,
the Senate has in abundance. For perhaps the first
time in its history, the Senate has the personnel to
staff almost any committee it sets in motion with
impressive credentials. Senate committee findings can
no longer be ignored.
I wish to bring you up to date on some matters and to
indicate to you the favourable trends as I see them. First,
with your permission, I should like to place on Hansarda
report of the Gallup Poll of Canada which appeared in the
Toronto Star on Wednesday, March 1.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

GALLUP POLL 0F CANADA
54 PER CENT ENDORSE $3,500 GUARANTEED
While rnost Canadians endorse the idea of a $3,500
minimum annual incarne for a family of four, impiementation of the prograrn would meet a great deal of
opposition. About five in 10 think it would be gaod not
only for the poor but for the country, but three in 10
object to it.
While it would be expected that low-incame people
would be more likely ta approve the plan, the difference
in attitude between thern and those with large incarnes
is not very great. At ail incarne levels, a majarity of the
public accepts the idea in principle.
The 54 per cent who would like ta see the pragranl
introduced do so maitnly because they fee1 there is toa
much paverty in Canada. "This help is needed by a lot
of poor familles who are trying hard,"' many say. Others
approve because they believe it would make for more
equality in standards of living and be goad for the econamy as well. In third place are thase who bold that we
are a rich country, and can afford it. "Nobody should
live in poverty in Canada," surns up their attitude.
The 29 per cent who abject give as their main reasan
an opinion that a guaranteed incarne wauld make people
lazy anîd less interested in working. They also think that
the cast would increase taxes.
The question:
"As you may know, the Senate Cornmittee an Paverty
bas recamrnended that a guaranteed annual incarne be
introduced as one way of eliminating poverty. This would
ensure that no famnily of four receives iess than $3,500 a
year and yet wouid retain the incentive ta work. Cost
estirnates suggest it might be about $8 million aver what
we aiready spend. In generai, would yau approve or disapprove of such a prograrn?"
Here is the response, natianally, and by ti'ose with
lower, middle, or upper incarnes.

Hon. Mr. Crali: Honourable senators, in my opinion the
pol was a remarkable one in that it was approved by 58
per cent of those people earning less than $6,000 per year,
54 per cent of those earning between $6,000 and $7,999,
and 52 per cent of those earning over $8,000. Fifty-four
per cent of Canadians approved, 29 per cent disapproved,
and 17 per cent were undecided, which merely indicates
that we have a job ta do on those 17 per cent who were
undecided and on some of those who disapproved.

I suggest that for a report which was presented ta the

Some people are critical of our welfare system and
say that it satisfies neither those who pay for it in
taxes, nor those who receive payments from it. Others
disagree and say that, on the whole, it is a good
system. In general, how would you rate our welfare
system-good, fair, or poor?

The result of the Gallup Poll indicated that 15 per cent

and 6 per cent were undecided.
I ask permission to have this article incorporated in the
record.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

GALLUP POLL OF CANADA
39 PER CENT RATE CANADA'S WELFARE SYSTEM AS POOR
"TOO MANY FREELOADERS," MANY CRITICS SAY
Canadians are critical of our welfare system. While
four in 10 give it faint praise as being "fair," another
four in 10 label it as "poor." Less than two in 10 are
ready to call it "good."
A main criticism is the complaint that there is not
enough screening of those who benefit from it. People
who really need it, say most of those who call the welfare system poor, don't get it, while many who don't
really need it are on the lists.
Close to this complaint is a belief that welfare is being
abused by recipients. These people think that many on
welfare could get jobs if they really wanted to, but that
they are lazy. "Too many freeloaders," sums up their
views. Other critics believe that the overall administration is bad, that the wélfare system destroys initiative,
or that the amounts received are too small for essential
needs.
In general, regional points of view are close, Ontario
and the West having almost identical reacLions. Quebec
residents are more likely to describe their systerm as
good than people in other provinces.
The question:
"Some people are critical of our welfare system and
say that it satisfies neither those who pay for it in taxes,
nor those who receive payments from it. Others disagree
and say that, on the whole, it is a good system. In general, how would you rate our welfare system-good, fair,
or poor?"
Hon. Mr. Croll: I should like also to place on record part
of a speech made by the Prime Minister when visiting
Toronto a few days ago. Speaking on unemployment, he is
reported in the Toronto Star of March 11 as saying:
You may say the salary is too low. It may be lower
than you would like but, after all, there is a minimum
wage in Canada. In federal industries, its $1.75 and in
most provinces, its between $1.50 and $1.75.
You say $1.50 or $1.75 isn't enough. If you don't want
to earn that and prefer to remain unemployed, that's
your business ... If you want us to raise the minimum
wage, we can do that too but we will oblige many
industries to close their doors and that won't create
any more jobs for the people.

The Poverty report dealt with the matter of minimum

The Prime Minister went even further, as reported in
the Toronto Star of March 13. The article reads:
"Perhaps more jobs is not the first thing we want in
the long run. Perhaps it's more wealth with more leisure and less jobs, less hours of work for less people."
Trudeau sees a different work ethic emerging in
Canada.
To Barkway, who questioned him about solutions to
heavy unemployment in Canada, he said: "Perhaps
there is a growing percentage of people, though I'm
sure it's still very small, who don't want to continue

March 14, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

looking to work in the traditional sense in order to
fulfil themselves as human beings.
"They would like to see a society develop in which
access to happiness or to self-fulfilment isn't necessarily through the labor market, but through other
concepts ... I think more and more we see our young
people, because they live in an affluent society, less
obsessed with money."
Most of the unemployed, Trudeau said, are people
who want to work. "But our statistical definition of
unemployment does include a certain number who
don't want jobs or have actually refused jobs," he
said.
What he is talking about, of course, is the working poor;
those people who take jobs, as he indicates, at minimum
wage levels, working full time, time and a half, and what
not, but who cannot earn enough to get by on, though
actually they could get more on welfare. There are thousands of people who just will not go on welfare, and they
continue to work under those trying conditions.
What troubles me is that the message we attempted to
get across in our report has not gotten across. As soon as
a guaranteed income is mentioned, you hear "Oh, free
ride; pie in the sky; everybody gets something for nothing,
and away we go." If you take a few minutes to read the
report you would know that the guaranteed annual
income is subject to work incentives, earning incentives,
and tax incentives; it is not just a handout. I was pleased
to see that at least one minister in the government is
catching on. The Minister of National Health and Welfare,
speaking in Windsor at the School of Social Work on
Thursday, March 9, had this to say:
The guaranteed income approach has an important
role when combined with other approaches and provides the most direct way of alleviating poverty without loss of dignity and self-respect.
Now listen carefully:
And it is the one instrument that is available to provide additional income to the working poor who are in
poverty.
That is what we are trying to say in our report, but we just
have not been able to get it across to the people. We will
just have to continue dialoguing until we do get it across.
I should tell you something about the acceptance of the
report. You could perhaps title this, "A Few Days in the
Life of a Chairman of a Committee." And this goes on all
the time; it is quite normal. On Monday I found on my
desk a resolution from the Lutheran Social Planning
Council, New Germany, Nova Scotia, in which it was
stated that on March 4 a meeting of concerned Lutherans
called by the Lutheran Social Planning Council, Atlantic
provinces, voted unanimously to support the concept of a
guaranteed annual income for Canada.
* (1540)

He said:
We support the recommendation ... with one excep-

tion. We feel strongly that the guaranteed level of
income should be no less than the "poverty lines"
established by the committee, rather than the 70 per
cent support recommended by the Senate committee.
25312-9

He does not know how much we agree with him and wish
we could have recommended the full poverty line at this
time. We thought that at the moment it would be best to
take a half step in the right direction, rather than a full
step and frighten everybody into thinking that the costs
would be astronomical. He indicates that the clergy have
been discussing it among themselves.
Another important document that arrived on Monday
was a speech made by the Reverend C. H. Forsyth, of St.
Andrew's Church in Sudbury. He spoke at St. George's
United Church in Toronto. It is an unusually good speech,
and well documented. It is a thoughful and hard-hitting
speech, as well as a truly telling one. The man has a world
of experience and knows what he is talking about.
A lady wrote in and said she had read in a newspaper
that I had said one per cent of the people of welfare were
doing a little cheating. She thought that was character
assassination, and an unenlightened view expressed by
the chairman. It is a point of view, and it has to be taken
into consideration.
I think every member of the Senate will have received a
document, a copy of which has just reached me, from the
Canadian Embassy, Office of Information, in Washington.
The four centre pages deal with poverty in Canada. It is a
report on the committees report by Tom Kelly, an American writer who spent five years as Regional Director of
Inspections and Director of National Affairs for VISTA in
Washington, D.C. They thought enough of the report to
give it that kind of coverage.
We find that CanadianWelfare, in its January-February
issue, discussed the report.
My purpose in indicating all this and bringing it to your
attention is to show that there is an interest. Last week
two churches asked me to participate in Sunday evening
services. I could not go because I had committed myself to
another engagement. They were both discussing poverty.
Last week there was a conference on poverty in British
Columbia. Almost every university has discussed the
report and expressed their feelings on it. All the schools of
social work have done so. It has found its way among the
people, not only for discussion but, as I indicated, for
acceptance. I think we ought to discuss it here as much as
we possibly can. I can assure you that if we go to the
country this year there will not be a platform in CanadaHon. Mr. Flynn: Who is "we"?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I mean the government. I do not go to
the country. You know that. The city is good enough for
me.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It sounded funny on this side.
Hon. Mr. Croll: If the government goes to the country
this year the report will be discussed on every platform on
which a candidate stands. The candidates will be asked
for some commitment, some understanding. This report
comes from the Senate of Canada. It is important that it
should be fully discussed here.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Has not a spokesman for the government already intimated that your proposition is
unacceptable?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Croll: You have not read the Speech from the
Throne. I have not a copy with me, although I should
have. It is obvious that the Speech spoke about income,
provision for maintenance income; it did not spell it out in
this way, but there was a full paragraph on it.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I am talking about a guaranteed
annual income.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is what he is talking about.
Hon. Mr. Croll: He was referring to maintenance
income, basic income. It is the same thing. I do not care if
you talk about the guaranteedHon. Mr. Flynn: Is this Mr. MacEachen or Senator Paul
Martin?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The Speech from the Throne.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You are speaking of the interpretation
of the Speech from the Throne by the Leader of the
Government. I was wondering if it was the leader in the
other place who was speaking.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It is quite clear. It is in clear terms.
There is no question of interpretation about it at all. In
any event, whether it be clear or not, the people of this
country will have an opportunity to make it clear at whatever time the election is called. That is the point I am
making.
What I intended to say today was that the submerged
fourth of the people of Canada who, working or not, are
living in poverty are entitled to have their day, and I am
sure they will. All L wanted to do today was to put some
matters on the record for your consideration, and to bring
you up to date. I will find the reference in the Speech
from the Throne in a few minutes, but I ask your indulgence to permit Senator Lefrançois to carry on the debate
at this time, and then others will follow him.
e (1550)

[Translation]
Hon. J. E. Lefrançois: Honourable senators, before
expressing some personal views on poverty in Canada,
may I pay tribute to all my colleagues who, like myself,
were members of the Special Senate Committee on
Poverty.
I would also like to take this opportunity to pay a very
special tribute to the chairman of the committee, Senator
David Croll, who, from the very first meeting of the committee up to the presentation of its report in this Chamber, did not spare himself and worked with the energy
and the efficiency for which he is well known to all of us
here.
The Senate of Canada should take special pride in the
study made by its Special Committee on Poverty. In fact,
it was the first time that an inquiry commission made a
global and in-depth study of the social phenomenon that
is poverty in Canada. Many useful studies were made in
the past, but they individually covered only one aspect of
the problem. There were investigations and reports on
housing, employment, education, old age security, and
what have you.
For the first time, and I am proud to repeat it, the social
ulcer that is poverty was the object of a global study and
at all levels, from coast to coast, from the Far North to the
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 14, 1972

large urban centres of this country. The committee heard
witnesses from a large number of public and private
welfare organizations, both religious and secular. The
poor themselves were heard by the committee. They told
us, in their own words, about the pitiful situation in which
they live and from which they have no hope of extricating
themselves. In addition, the members of the committee, by
moving from east to west and north to south, were able to
see for themselves, with their own eyes, how true the
testimonies received were, especially by visiting, on many
an occasion, the poor in their own homes, in their normal
habitat. I can tell you that there was nothing very cheerful
about what we saw.
When he tabled his report, the chairman of the committee, Senator Croll, alluded to all of his colleagues who
harboured preconceived ideas on poverty but who, due to
the impact of the testimony received, had to change their
views on poverty and the poor themselves. Like everyone
else, I have often heard it said that some people are poor
because they want to be, usually because they are lazy,
ignorant and without ambition; in short, because they are
parasites of society who contribute nothing to its wellbeing. As the committee study progressed, as evidence
was received, it became obvious to me that a minimal
fraction of the poor are, for all practical purposes, hopeless cases, but that the vast majority are willing to help
themselves and want nothing more than to go ahead and
progress, provided, however, they receive an initial helping hand and the means required to improve their lot on a
permanent basis.
Prevailing myths about poverty and prejudice against
the poor disappeared one by one, slowly but surely. Like
several of my colleagues, I had to revise my opinions and
sometimes drastically change them. I want to say that we
did not go through this transformation gladly. However,
the evidence submitted threw so much light on the subject
that we could no longer keep up those myths and
prejudices.
On close examination, the committees recommendations are not so very revolutionary and are but the logical
findings of our investigation. We had to conceive and
understand poverty within the context of human dignity,
human progress, human qualities and talents to be developed. We had to probe deeply into the matter to discover
the roots of poverty. Our recommendations are the outcome of our inquiry and of the witnesses we heard.
On the other hand, we observe that billions are being
spent for welfare. What are the results? In this regard, the
report on our study is quite clear and throws a glaring
light on the subject. Full employment is a goal to be
reached and maintained in so far as possible; this is stated
in no uncertain terms in the report. However, how did it
come about that during the years of prosperity when
Canada went through a period of full employment there
was parallel development of the social blight of poverty?
During that period, welfare benefits cost Canadian taxpayers billions and billions of dollars, without overcoming
poverty; on the contrary, as a social phenomenon, poverty
spread and increased throughout Canada.
What are the means to control that scourge? Where is
the true solution to the problem? After three years of
study, the Special Senate Committee on Poverty proposed

March 14, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

various measures to solve the problem, not in the immediate but in a more distant future, provided that they are
vigorously and gradually carried out.
Should not our social objective be to develop the human
potential of those small wage earners and the poor? The
entire country would profit therefrom.
If we really want to eradicate poverty in our midst we
will undoubtedly have to pay the price. It will be heavy for
most of the well-off people. However, how comforting it
would be to know that we invest in the development of a
human potential whose achievements will exceed, I am
sure, our wildest dreams. I am convinced that from a
strictly financial point of view, rational investment in the
underprivileged classes of society is good business. The
entire country will profit from the increased productive
activities of a group of people who at the present time do
not contribute, or else very little, to their own well-being.
From my point of view, I think that we are spending too
much for social welfare, considering the results obtained
among the poor and the benefits enjoyed by the community. Our chairman had some harsh words to say about the
present system. After all that we have seen and heard for
three years, I am not prepared to say that he is wrong.
The committee recommendations make up a set of measures which come to grips not with the symptoms only,
but with the very root of poverty.
We are not trying to say we have found a miracle
answer. We are not trying to say either that the overall
solution which we are suggesting is the only possible
answer to the problem of poverty. But what we are saying
and maintaining is that our recommendations make up a
rational set of measures for an overall solution to the
problem. If somebody else wants to submit another set of
measures to solve this problem, we are prepared to discuss it, provided it is really a set of coherent measures
which provide an overall solution. Anyway, it was clearly
evident to us that the present system, costly as it is, has
not reached the objective of an all-out war on poverty in
Canada.
What we need, in my opinion, is to spend less but to
invest more on the deprived classes of society in order to
restore in those people hope and the ambition to succeed-in other words, to develop the human potential of
some five million Canadians.
It was not our thought that all the committee recommendations without exception should immediately be
passed by Parliament and come into force within a few
weeks. This would be wishful thinking. However, we must
have right now a detailed and in-depth study of the proposed plan. It could then be implemented gradually, with
caution but also with firmness. No doubt we will have to
make some changes in details as we go along. Honourable
senators, this progressive policy will eventually lead us to
the just society that we all want.

Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, if I am permitted I
should now like to give you the passage from the Speech
from the Throne to which I made reference earlier. It is as
follows:
25312-91

It is the view of the Government that the most
important single factor in the attainment of individual
dignity and active social involvement is the assurance
of a secure income. Considerable progress towards
the goal of a total income security program for all
Canadians is achieved in the new Family Income
Security Plan bill which will be presented for your
consideration. The emphasis in this plan is on protection and is consistent with the Government's belief in
the strong sense of self-reliance of Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I notice in that passage the words,
"assurance of a secure income". Did not the report of the
Special Committee of the Senate on Pôverty ask for the
assurance of an "adequate" secure income?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Your point is well taken.
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Fergusson, debate adjourned.
CANADA-UNITED STATES INTERPARLIAMENTARY
GROUP
FOURTEENTH MEETING-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, March 8, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Deschatelets
calling the attention of the Senate to the Fourteenth Meeting of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group, held at Ottawa and Montebello, 16th to 20th February, 1972.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I propose
to say a few words in connection with the meeting which
took place in Ottawa in February with our United States
counterparts, members of the Senate and House of Representatives. His Honour the Speaker did, in fact, put an
inquiry on the Order Paper with respect to this, and he
has already spoken on it. In his speech he gave the backgrounds of the personalities involved and the subjects
discussed by the gathering. Therefore, I propose to come
right down to the meat of the meeting -and that is not
intended to be a play on words.
A committee or a group-call it what you will-of which
I was a member, was set up to deal with trade and economic matters. On that committee were representatives
from the Canadian Senate and House of Commons and
the United States Senate and House of Representatives.
The Speaker of the Canadian Senate was kind enough to
invite me to lead the discussion on the first topic, under
the designation "Trade and Economic Matters," of which
the first heading was "World Trade in the Seventies:
Exports, Subsidies, Non-Tariff Barriers and Regionalization." Obviously, that topic is pretty broad in its scope, but
I had had the advantage before we assembled of seeing
the agenda, and I had concluded that the most interesting
subject we could discuss under that heading, the one
which would be of greatest interest to our visitors and of
greatest value educationally, was the auto pact. Thus,
while I said a few words on the question of world trade, I
dealt at much greater length on the subject of the auto
pact.
In speaking on world trade, I pointed out that the concept of world trade has evolved considerably from the
days when it was a matter of the battle of tariffs. Now
world trade, or the exchange of trade, has moved into

SENATE DEBATES

other areas such as special tax treatment, the DISC plan
of deferral of tax in the United States, subsidies, countervailing duties, voluntary restraint agreements, and so on.
Tariffs in the sense in which we used to know them are
not leaned on in the same way to produce and develop, or
assist in developing, international trade today. As we
know, of course, the exchange of trade is necessary. It is
the life blood of the settled nations, if I may refer to the
established nations that way; it is also the life blood of the
developing countries.
Although the auto pact came into being some years ago,
nevertheless I see some senators here today who spoke on
it when its approval was before this chamber. I spoke at
that time in connection with the bill, and I recall that
Senator Grosart also took part in the debate. The bill then
went to a committee, so it is fair to say that it was dealt
with exhaustively.
In those days some senators held the position that we
were taking a fatal step in approving the auto pact, suggesting that it would prove to be very unprofitable for
Canada. However, the events which have developed throw
a different light on the circumstances upon which they
relied to point out that the auto pact could not be
successful.
Let me hasten to say that I do not propose to get into a
general discussion at this time, but to limit myself to what,
at the invitation of the Speaker, I presented to the group.
Let me confine myself to the points I endeavoured to
make at that time, and which I felt we had made with
some little success.
I pointed out at that time in reference to the auto pact
that an imbalance had recently developed as between
Canada and the United States, but I said also that one
swallow does not make a summer, and I added that in
mentioning the word "swallow" I was referring to a bird.
I said, and the meeting agreed with me, that what must
be looked at and balanced on the scales are the pros and
cons of trade relations between our two countries. I suggested that it was not sufficient simply to note the fact
that in the year 1970 there was, under the auto pact, an
imbalance against the United States of approximately
$195 million, of which $140 million was comprised of our
export of snowmobiles. The snowmobile is, of course, a
fairly recent development which had not been anticipated
at the time the auto pact was originally entered into. I
suggested to the group that as Canada had moved more
quickly it had gained more expertise in the field of the
manufacture of snowmobiles and, therefore, was able to
grab the market. The Representative from Michigan, Mr.
Harvey, agreed with that statement and admitted that
they had a great number of Canadian-made snowmobiles
in their country, but he was quick to point out that their
expertise was catching up to ours. In fact, that is the
feeling Canadian manufacturers have. They feel it will be
a much more competitive market very soon, and I pointed
that out to the meeting.
I also said that in so far as the regular auto pact agreement was concerned and the trade relating to it, the
imbalance against the United States in 1970 was only $66
million, whereas for year after year there had been a
substantial imbalance the other way. That is when I made
my remark about one swallow not making a summer. I
[Hon. Mr. Hayden.]

March 14, 1972

hastened to point out that we must look not only at the
performance and the historical feature of our operations
under the auto pact agreement, but also at our trade
relations generally with the United States over a long
period of time to see what the progress has been, and to
discover where there bas been any imbalance.
* (1610)

On that point, honourable senators, I should tell you
that the cumulative balance of trade between Canada and
the United States was about $2.6 billion, and since the
auto pact was signed this cumulative balance in favour of
the United States was $1.9 billion. When you look at this
larger figure you realize you have to start by putting these
factors into the scales because that is the only way to
measure the results. Let me say at this stage that Senator
Church, the co-chairman, made a statement in which he
agreed with this and said that he felt that if we are to
approach these problems of trade between the two countries in the proper way, and if we want to determine
whether the time has come for changes, we must look at
more than one instance of the result of this trade. In
effect, he agreed with my statement that you should put
all these factors into the scales to see whether something
should be done in favour of the United States having
regard to its present difficulties, or whether the counterbalancing elements are such that the situation should not
be disturbed.
I should say that at a later stage Senator Church proceeded to put another element into the balance on the
United States side of the scales, because somebody talked
about foreign ownership and the restriction of United
States investment in Canada. He volunteered the statement that if Canada were imposing restrictions on United
States investments in Canada then this was a factor which
should go into the scales on the United States side when
you are looking at the overall picture. He did not indicate
what weight he would give it, but he did say it was one of
the factors.
From the immediate impact and the imbalance of only
one year I then moved to the general trade relationship
between Canada and the United States to show that in
that regard over the years the trade bas been leaning in
the favour of the United States, and that the net result is
that Canada bas been the best customer of the United
States, and the United States bas been the best customer
of Canada. I said that we should move ahead and examine
it from that point of view, and then I went on to discuss
their program which is called DISC.
DISC is an acronym made up of the initial letters of the
four words, Domestic International Sales Corporations.
As part of the program to try to remedy the deficits which
the United States has been building up in its world trade
position and in its dollar position, the United States government announced this DISC program, under which
they propose a deferral of tax on those corporations in the
United States manufacturing for export. There could be a
deferral of tax on 50 per cent of the income or profit made
as a result of their export operations. I pointed out to the
United States representatives that DISC was unfavourably aimed at Canada because the United States would be
competing with Canada in foreign markets, and with our
multinational corporations such as Massey-Ferguson and

March 14, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

ALCAN, but with the benefit of this tax deferral program
and so would be disturbing our ability to be competitive in
those markets. I told them that the moment they started
competing on that basis they were affecting the areas of
greatest employment in Canada, and if the numbers
employed in Canada were to decrease then our purchasing power would be reduced, and in those circumstances
we would be forced into a position where we could buy
less from the United States.
So I said to them, "Let us assume that we buy less from
you because you have given a tax deferral to your export
manufacturing industries in the States, and this in turn
has affected the employment position in Canada. If you
reduce our purchasing power it may well be that the
things we do not buy from you because of that reduced
purchasing power will be things manufactured by your
domestic companies in the United States. So while you
may be creating new jobs for your exporting companies
through the benefits of the DISC program, you will be
losing employment in your domestic operations." In addition I said, "If you apply the DISC program and at the
same time there is some change in the auto pact, and if
this in turn leads to the export of American cars to
Canada on a basis not contemplated by the auto pact,
then your exporting companies would be entitled to this
deferral of tax. In those circumstances we have certain
laws in Canada which might apply. I might add, we did
not devise them in anticipation of what you were going to
do at this time. We devised them some years ago for other
purposes, and to deal with other countries. We have our
anti-dumping law, for example, which covers the situation
where there is a subsidy-and a deferral of tax certainly
would be a subsidy. We can invoke these anti-dumping
provisions if we can show that local or domestic industries have been hurt. We can invoke countervailing duties
under Canadian law if we can show that domestic industry has been hurt in Canada."
I told them also that we have a provision in our law
under which we can go before the Anti-dumping Tribunal-this was an amendment passed about two years
ago-and if we can establish that products are coming
into Canada, without any question of whether they are
being dumped or not or any question of their price on the
home market, that are likely to hurt domestic industry,
then the Governor in Council can act and apply enough in
the way of added charge to level the price of the imported
article to that of the same article produced in Canada. So
I made it quite clear that we are not without means to deal
with such situations. But the DISC program is something
that can be used. It could be embarrassing in certain
circumstances, subject to establishing what is required by
our law, and a Canadian industry could be hurt by this
action. Let us place this on our side of the scales.
a (1620)

Then I indicated that in the United States there are
countervailing duties, and they have had them for perhaps 100 years. In the United States they do not have to
establish hurt, injury, or damage to the domestic industry.
All they have to establish is whether there was a bounty
or grant paid, either directly or indirectly, by some government of some government agency in relation to the
production of those goods. Once this matter has been

established, the United States Treasury is in a position to
impose a surcharge or a countervailing duty equal to the
amount of subsidy which has been enjoyed.
There is the recent incident, in respect of which proceedings are in motion, of the Michelin Tire Company
which constructed a substantial plant in the Maritime
provinces, and which was proposing to export some of its
products to the United States. This matter is under investigation in the United States to ascertain whether a
bounty or a grant had been paid either directly or indirectly by the government to assist in the construction of
that plant to facilitate production.
You can see how difficult this matter has become, since
hurt or injury is not in question. The percentage or
volume of threatened export does not matter. The area to
which goods are to be exported might not be within the
area of the domestic operation, but this does not matter.
The only consideration is whether a bounty or a grant has
been paid either directly or indirectly by a government or
a government agency and, if this is the case, countervailing duties may apply. You can see what kind of weapon
this is.
I indicated that Canada and certain other countries
adhere to the doctrine of GATT, and the code required
that our anti-dumping legislation be changed. I think this
was around 1969. All you had to do to establish dumping
was to ascertain that goods were coming into Canada
below the normal price of those goods on the home
market when, in actual fact, they were being produced in
certain quantity in Canada. However, in the draft statute
included in the GATT agreement there was an additional
provision whereby we had to establish not only dumping
at a lower price, but also that the domestic industry had
been hurt.
The United States has not conformed to this practice.
The net result is that hurt, damage, or injury is not a test. I
indicated that we would need to discuss this matter, and
the scales would need to be balanced in favour of Canada.
This is the manner in which this discussion was
developed.
We had some discussion regarding the auto pact. One
senator indicated that the United States was in a difficult
position, and was required to move in a direction which
would result in some benefit regardless of whether, in
actual fact, it would amount to a benefit.
One of the matters discussed, and which was being
publicly debated, was that Canada imposes a 15 per cent
tariff on individuals importing automobiles from the
United States. Under the auto pact Canada extends free
entry to an importer who is a vehicle manufacturer in
Canada. However, an individual seeking to import a car
from the United States is subject to a 15 per cent tariff. I
indicated that we needed to look into this situation. If an
automobile is imported from the United States it is subject to a 15 per cent tariff. When the automobile arrives in
Canada it is subject to a 12 per cent federal sales tax, and
if it comes to Ontario there is an additional 5 per cent
provincial sales tax, or if it comes to Quebec there is an 8
per cent provincial sales tax. Whether this is a profitable
operation is open to serious question.

SENATE DEBATES

I have figures which illustrate the total amount of
importations. The total value of cars imported by
individuals from the United States in 1967 was $14 million; in 1968 it was $9 million; in 1969 it was over $8
million; in 1970 it was nearly $10 million; and in 1971 it
was $10,500,000. It can be seen that in terms of dollars we
are not discussing a substantial matter. I suggested that
we needed to consider the potential which might develop
if this duty were removed. On an automobile with its
original equipment imported from the United States by an
individual, the parts would come in duty free if the 15 per
cent tariff were waived. However, under the auto pact
replacement parts are subject to duty, and if the car has
been imported from the United States chances are that
the parts that have to be replaced have to come from the
United States as well. Therefore, you have the added cost
of importation and handling. This matter regarding the
value of benefits derived from the auto pact should be
seriously considered.
*

(1630)

Earlier I referred to the great benefits resulting from
the auto pact, whereupon Mr. Harvey, the Representative
from Michigan, interjected. He stated that the auto pact
agreement was the greatest thing that ever happened to
our two countries.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am paraphrasing his language. He
said we had been approaching a price war and the pact
corrected the situation. Both countries have benefited
substantially from this trade agreement, and certainly
Canada has.
Hon. Mr. Martin: So has the United States.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: For instance, in 1964 we exported to
the United States approximately $96 million worth of
automobiles and parts, and imported from the United
States in that year $698 million worth of such products.
That was at the beginning, but in 1971 the overall volume
of trade between Canada and the United States in this
area was over $6 billion. Canadian production which goes
into export and the United States production which is
imported into Canada divide reasonably equal at this
time.
I do not wish to weary you with figures, but it is very
interesting to note that in 1964, for instance, as I told you,
we exported $96 million worth of automobiles and parts to
the United States. The figure increased to $231 million in
1965, $1,627 million in 1967, $3,464 million in 1969, and
$3,363 million in 1970. A comparison with the United
States figures illustrates that it was only in 1970 that we
arrived at a stage at which the balance was against the
United States. This was of the order, excluding snowmobiles, of approximately $66 million.
These figures illustrate that from points of view in both
Canada and the United States this agreement bas been of
very great benefit. I do not think that in either country
there was any danger or thought of the termination of this
agreement. It has been too beneficial. The industry in the
United States and in Canada has become too firmly
entrenched in its positions and reciprocal arrangements
under which its manufacturing operations are carried out.
In addition to this, most of the automobile industry in
[Hon. Mr. Hayden.]

March 14, 1972

Canada is owned in the United States. Anything that
might decrease the profitability of the Canadian operations, of course, will reflect itself immediately in the
income remitted to the United States. Therefore I indicated that, all in all, I was not concerned and agreed with Mr.
Harvey, and that I, at least, could not imagine any reasonable or sane person thinking in terms of abrogating or
cancelling the auto pact agreement.
I was supposed to be provocative and lead the discussion. Although there were other elements to this which in
the interest of time were not discussed, I think I was
provocative in making reference to the United States
DISC program and the 10 per cent surcharge. I pointed
out that it was not likely in balance to achieve the expected results. It could in some way and to some extent
adversely affect Canada. In doing this it would have a
similar effect on the United States because, I stated, the
situation is such in our intertrading relations that if
Canada is hurt so is the United States. I indicated that this
business of trade relations and exchange of trade is similar to the old story of the balloon. When a thumb is pushed
into the balloon causing a depression in one place a bulge
is bound to appear elsewhere. I pointed out that a piecemeal endeavour to meet the drastic problems involved in
curbing their deficit in trade and their dollar situation
must be carried on with due regard to the overall relationships in trade between Canada and the United States, and
the great benefits which have accrued to both countries.
Since that time there have been newspaper articles, one
appearing in the Globe and Mail this morning, which
discuss further negotiations or revisions. Since that was
not included in our discussion that day I hesitate now to
make any comment. It would be a very interesting subject
for comment and consideration. With respect to the areas
of production ratios and the value added, which are supposed to constitute safeguarding provisions in the auto
pact agreement in favour of Canada, my own view is that
the industries in both countries have become so solidly
entrenched, and have moved so far ahead of the situation
envisaged at the time of the inclusion of the safeguards in
the agreement, that I cannot see how their removal would
in any way materially and adversely affect Canada. I am
also very doubtful as to the impact of such removal and
the 15 per cent tariff vis-à-vis the United States.
The tariff would have to remain, of course, in our dealings with other countries. The United Kingdom is about to
enter the Common Market. Its cars are allowed into
Canada duty-free, and I would expect that the moment it
joins the community the cars it exports to this country
will be subject to the 15 per cent tariff. This must be so
because the 15 per cent tariff is imposed by Canada on
individuals importing automobiles from the United
States. The request that has been made is that the tariff
be removed, not generally but only in that interrelationship between the United States and Canada. That would
mean, of course, that Canada would have to consult all
other members of GATT to devise an agreed means to
satisfy the request.
I must say that one could not attend meetings of the
group discussing these matters without being greatly
impressed by the character, ability, knowledge, and

March 14, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

friendliness in approach and analysis of those who represented the United States.
Hon. Mr. Gratton O'Leary: It seems to be my fate and

your good fortune that whenever the work of the CanadaUnited States Interparliamentary Group has been debated over the years, my task has been to speak a footnote to
the speeches of delegates more knowledgeable and able
than I.

I have now attended eight of the groups meetings and I
can say without reservation that the last one was, to my
mind, the very best.

Before I go further, I must congratulate the Leader of
the Government in the Senate for his selection of delegates to attend the conference. They included Senator

Macnaughton, who is very well known to American senators and congressmen; Senator Hayden, who, in the last
few minutes, has shown what a valuable contribution he
made to that gathering; Senator Everett, who has already
made his mark in this chamber; and last but not least,
Senator John Connolly, as a utility outfielder.

Modesty prevents me from mentioning those delegates
from this side of the house. However, I think that we too
made some contribution toward the success of the

internationally-renowned leader of the Democratic Party
in the United States Senate. I called on Congressman
Cornelius Gallagher, who has been a co-chairman of the
interparliamentary group almost since its inception.
I was able to speak frankly to those people as a friend. I
pointed out that they were asking Japan to do something
which we had done two years earlier. I reminded them of
a statement made by their President the evening before I
reached Washington, that it was necessary to be very
cautious when dealing with Japan because, as the President said, Japan was their best customer. I knew enough
about foreign world trade to point out that our sales to,
and purchases from, the United States were almost 100
per cent greater than Japan's; that we purchased more
from the United States than did all the member countries
of the European Common Market.
I found that the people with whom I spoke understood
all these things and sympathized with our position, not

because of anything that I said, but because of the years
they had spent in visiting Canada and discussing Canadian problems with us.

It is significant that of the three ablest speeches deliv-

ered in the United States Congress on these problems one
was delivered by Senator Frank Church, a co-chairman of

conference.

the American branch of this organization, and another by

There is a great deal of misconception among Canadians associated with the news media-which is the term

Congressman Gallagher in the House of Representatives.
I suggest that it is most important, for continuing good
relations between our two countries, that such people
understand our position. It is encouraging to know that a
man of the stature of Senator Sherman Cooper, a former
Governor of Kentucky, a distinguished member of the
United States Senate, and a former United States Ambassador to India, is knowledgeable about our problems, is
willing to listen to us, and is articulate in explaining
problems affecting the United States.
I read in the press almost every day that joint CanadianAmerican discussions on trade have broken down. Honourable senators, those discussions have not broken
down. There is no deadlock; there is no break in our
relations or our negotiations. The two countries have
merely taken time out to consider the propositions which
have been made, and negotiations will continue.
We are told by some academics that our special relationship with the United States is at an end. I disagree with
that viewpoint. Our relationship is not at an end. We have
today, and shall always have, a special relationship with
the United States dictated by geography. Whether we
think it bad or good, an advantage or disadvantage, history and geography link us with the United States. It is a

now used for newspapers-and others about the character, function and purpose of this interparliamentary
group. The view is held by many that our delegates go to
Washington, or that delegates from Washington come
here, for the purpose of having a confrontation. Honourable senators, there is no confrontation about these meetings. We meet for discussion, for friendly and frank
debate, and there is wide hospitality for ideas. I myself,
when speaking on a particular subject, have often disagreed with my colleagues. This is true also of delegates
from the United States. They do not always agree with
their colleagues on a particular matter. However, there is
agreement that issues should be discussed with frankness
and candor.
Yielding reluctantly to the conquering years, I may soon
have to terminate my membership in this organization. In
doing so I would offer this advice to those who f ollow: Do
not attend these conferences in a spirit of partisanship.
Our philosophy may be that of a Liberal, a Conservative,
or a member of any other party, but we must not go to
Washington with a partisan outlook, and delegates from
Washington do not come here with a partisan outlook.
Attending the conference were men such as Senator
George Aiken, who is so pro-Canadian that he himself
says that he expects one day to be hailed before the U.S.
Committee on Un-American Activities.
I happened to be in Washington three days after the
announcement concerning the 10 per cent surcharge on
goods imported into the United States, and took the
opportunity of visiting some of the friends I had made
over the years as a member of this organization. I called
on Senator Aiken, who is the ranking Republican in the
United States Senate. I called on Senator Church, who is
not a rising star but a star who has risen in the United
States Senate. I called on Senator Mike Mansfield, the

mandate from which we cannot escape. Our voyage
through history will be in company with the United
States. Of course we will have disagreements and quarrels, but that is the glory. That is the glory of free men;
that is the glory of the Senate.
* (1650)

I for one, in my humble way, have told the Americans
that we are prepared to co-operate with them as far as we
can, but not beyond our resolve to call one part of North
America our very own, and that question, honourable
senators, has always been received with acclaim by our
American colleagues.

SENATE DEBATES

I do not know of anything in the world more important,
even as an object lesson to the rest of the world, than that
we try to get on with our great North American neighbours. Of course we may find them difficult. I am sure
they find us a bit difficult too. But in our hearts we
know-and I wish I had said this earlier today when we
had certain distinguished visitors in the gallery-that if
bombs ever fall on the Dominion of Canada they will not
be dropped by Americans. This is something for us to
constantly keep in mind.
I recall one of the first meetings of these organizations.
It was just at the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway,
and Her Majesty the Queen, the Queen of Canada, helped
to unveil a stone commemorating that event. On that
stone there is this inscription: "This stone commemorates
and testifies to the common effort of two peoples whose
frontiers are the frontiers of freedom and whose ways are
the ways of peace." God grant that Canadians and Americans keep in their hearts and in their minds those words
and their meaning.
I realize the easy criticisms that are made every day
about the United States. I hear snickering remarks about
the young Americans who have stolen across our border
in the last two years because of the Vietnam question. Do
we remember the young Americans who came over our
border during World War I and who fought and died in
our armies? Next time you go to Washington, go out to
Arlington Cemetery and you will find there a cross on
which you will see these words: "Erected by a grateful
Canadian Government to the young Americans who
crossed our border and fought and died with our Canadian forces." Among the men who came to us at that time
was Robert Emmett Sherwood, a direct descendant of the
illustrious Irish patriot of that name and the biographer
of Franklin Roosevelt.
Those are the things we should remember. We seem to
have a genius and talent for remembering our difficulties
with the United States. We talk about the Battle of
Lundy's Lane, and so on and so forth, but we forget the
co-operation that has existed between our two countries
for over 100 years. Of course there was the War of 1812,
and those who started it were so ashamed of it in the end
that when they came to write the Peace Treaty they did
not even state what the war was about in the first place.
Then there was the Civil War-the War of the States-and
on that occasion we sprang to the aid of both sides; we
gave men to the North and money to the South, and when
it was all over we exulted with the North, shed a tear with
the South, and have extolled Mr. Lincoln ever since.
Those are things for our memory with our great North
American neighbour. Sometimes they make trouble for us
and sometimes we make trouble for them, and as free
people we will continue to do so. When we look at the
world with all its cloud and pain, when we see what is
happening on the Continent or what is happening in the
land of my ancestors, we should appreciate what we have.
I would remind my Russian friends, if they were still here,
of the number of Irishmen who went and fought for the
Russian army, and who are still there. A friend of mine,
Frank McCullagh, spent Christmas in Moscow and stayed
with an Irish family who remained there. The daughters
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary.]

March 14, 1972

of that family played and sang for him the melodies of
Tom Moore.
The Americans are our friends and our neighbours,
and, as I said before, our voyage through history is going
to be with, and as, North Americans. The faith, hopes,
dreams, and aspirations of Americans are the faith,
hopes, dreams, and aspirations of Canadians, and God
grant it will remain so to the end.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I really did not
wish to participate in the debate, but I cannot resist
saying something that has been on my mind for some
time.
I do not think that history will record O'Leary as
O'Leary the modest. He is out making speeches and an
impression, but the one man, in my mind, who stood out
when the surcharge was imposed by the Americans was
Senator O'Leary. He did not act as ordinary politicians
do; he did not make great speeches out of it, but he did
something that was effective. He went to Washington and
saw his friends-and he has friends in Washington. He
named them here today-Church, Aiken, Mansfield, and
others. Senator O'Leary has been going there for many
years and has made quite an impression, and when the
time came that he needed those friends they were there.
He went and saw them for a period of time at his own
expense, and then came back and indicated to the
government the feelings of those people.
I think that is a most unusual thing to do. When the
chips were down he was there acting as a great Canadian
in the interests of Canada. I could not resist the temptation to say that.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Martin, for Hon. Mr. Connolly
(Ottawa West), debate adjourned.

AGRICULTURE
DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING STANDING SENATE
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 7, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Argue, that
in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in the interest
of both eastern and western agriculture, to establish a
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider
legislation and other matters of concern to agriculture
that may be referred to the said committee by the Senate.
Hon. Paul C. Lafond: Honourable senators, it may be
somewhat difficult after the brilliant oratory to which we
have been subjected to for the last hour to return to the
somewhat more down to earth business of the Senate, if I
may call it that.
I welcomed Senator Argue's motion that a Standing
Senate Committee on Agriculture be established. In part,
its adoption would resolve some misgivings that I have
entertained, rightly or wrongly, not as to the functions or
efficiency of our committees but as to their names and
titles and the effect of those names and titles on the public
image of the Senate.
One day early last May, while driving home from this
building I heard the following statement on a radio news

hMarch

14, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

broadcast: "Representatives of the Consumers Association of Canada appeared today before the Senate Banking
Committee to plead their case on the proposed Packaging
and Labelling Act."
a (1700)

The first thing that annoyed me was the reference to
"the Senate Banking Committee." The media uses that
expression very commonly. Of course, we cannot
altogether fault the media, since quite often in this chamber honourable senators refer to it as "the Banking Committee," rather than "the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce," which is the way our
rules describe it.
The second thing that struck me as being highly anomalous was the fact that a people association, a people
group, was appearing before a committee whose main
interest or function seems to be banking in order to discuss packaging and labelling. Similarly, why should
people groups-I call them people groups because they
speak on matters of concern to individuals-interested in
food production and marketing have to make their case
on agricultural legislation before the Senate "Banking
Committee"? What image comes to the mind of the consumer-conscious housewife in Moncton, the dairy farmer
in Papineauville, or the grain grower in Lisgar upon reading or hearing such news items?
Honourable senators, we had a situation last December
when a piece of important and basic farm legislation was
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce, and a quick reckoning indicated to
me that a majority of the senators who are, or have been,
engaged in food growing or food production were not at
that time members of the committee. I am not by any
means, willingly or unwillingly, demeaning the committee,
which deservedly has the highest reputation within this
building and among a few knowledgeable people outside.
But since this is not widespread public knowledge, I
believe it is unfair to the committee and to the Senate
itself to give it responsibility for people legislation such as
that concerning agriculture and consumer affairs, of
which we are bound to get more and more over the years;
when from its own description, it seems to have only a
secondary interest in these matters.
I therefore welcome, and heartily support, Senator
Argue's motion. Since there is substantial affinity
between agriculture and consumer affairs, I suggest the
new standing committee be so named. I shall move a
formal amendment to the motion later, since I do not want
to advocate unnecessary proliferation of standing
committees.
I indulged in a little bit of research on the question of
standing committees in the past, and I should like if I
may, to refer to a few brief points. First, I find myself in
full agreement with Senator Davey's concern, as
expressed in this chamber on November 6, 1968. At that
time, in referring to the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce, he said:
I am one of those who agree that this has been an
outstanding committee, but why should it not have
been an outstanding committee when we have
referred every manner of matter to it? We have
referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee
matters which have no remote relation to banking or
25312-10

137

to commerce. I would hope that we shall have some
assurance from the chairman of the committee, or
from some of its members, that these matters which I
do not really think lie within the jurisdiction of a
committee on banking and commerce will be referred
to other committeesOur records show that an early major reform of our
standing committee structure took place in 1908. At that
time the proposal was to add 11 new standing committees
to the ten already in existence. When finally approved, the
motion did in fact add six new standing committees,
which were: agriculture and forestry, immigration and
labour, commerce and trade relations of Canada, civil
service administration, public health and inspection of
foods, and public building and grants. We see that the first
two names quoted are "agriculture and forestry," and
"immigration and labour." I shall have a few words to say
about labour in a moment.
The next major reform I came across was in 1945, when
a special committee was appointed to review the constitution and functions of the standing committees. Senator
Hayden was a member of that committee, which reported
on December 5, 1945, and recommended that the number
of standing committees be increased to a total of 19.
Among them was a committee on natural resources, to
which were to be referred agricultural matters, and a
committee on immigration and labour. In the course of
the debate it was stated that in view of the number of
special committees, the committee on agriculture and
forestry should cover fishing, mining and related industries, et cetera.
The most recent study, of course, was carried out by a
special committee chaired by Senator Molson in 1968, and
for the benefit of senators who have been appointed to
this chamber since that date I should like to refer to it
briefly.
In tabling the Third Interim Report of the Committee on
October 31, 1968, Senator Molson stated that the committee dealt first with the divorce committee, and he went on
to say:
The second subject, that of our committees, reflects
the intention of the special committee to revise the
whole structure of these committees, to modernize
them and bring them up to date so that this vital part
of the functions of the Senate may be in tune with the
age in which we live.
In the course of the debate on November 7, Senator
Molson further stated:
The way these committees are set out is completely
new for the Senate. In the past we had a list of
committees, and matters were referred to a committee
as seemed suitable at the moment. In this instance we
do not have a list of names of committees; we have
committees to which shall be referred matters relating
to certain subjects. This makes quite a difference
because, for one thing, it reduces to some extent the
importance of the name, in that the name does not
attempt to include the nature of every subject that
might be referred to that committee. It takes the
emphasis off the name and places some emphasis on
the general nature of the matters which should be
referred to it. This is a complete change for us.

SENATE DEBATES

I suggest, honourable senators, this situation should
now be reviewed, because it seems to me that the experience of the last four years establishes that this reform,
reducing the number of standing committees to eleven
and eliminating some names, was somewhat overdone.
Agriculture was then the prime subject of the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources, which was eliminated.
There probably was some justification for that on the
basis of the data supplied to the Rules Committee, which
established that during four consecutive sessions, from
1963 to 1967, the Natural Resources Committee had not
met at all. Yet Senator Argue told us last week that since
1966 Parliament has dealt with 19 important pieces of
agricultural legislation. It seems obvious to me that a
further change is required.
a (1710)

Honourable senators, I would suggest that serious
thought be given to de-emphasizing the word "Banking"
in the description of that committee. I have already discussed this with some of my colleagues. It seems to me
that that field of endeavour is not necessarily any longer
the committee's foremost preoccupation.
Furthermore, I should like to draw the attention of the
Senate to the fact that a similar case could be made on the
question of labour. This is a "people" question above all
others. We are getting more and more legislation in that
field. We have a motion before us to study labour management and disputes affecting the public service, yet we ask
the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science to deal with it. We know, but does the man in the
street know, where labour fits into the Senate's concerns?
In conclusion, may I paraphrase a sentence by Lord
Shepherd, in an article which was drawn to our attention
by Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) a few weeks ago:
I think the Senate will see ways and means within
itself to improve and increase its effectiveness and its
image by making changes in its procedures.
Of this I may have more to say when we consider the
report of the Joint Committee on the Constitution.
Honourable senators, as I suggested previously, I should
like to move an amendment to Senator Argue's motion,
which would insert, in three instances, words referring to
consumer affairs. I therefore move:
That Senator Argue's motion be amended to read:
That in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in
the interest of both eastern and western agriculture
and of consumers generally, to establish a Standing
Senate Committee on Agriculture and Consumer
Affairs to consider legislation and other matters of
concern to agriculture and to consumers that may
be referred to the said Committee by the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved
by the honourable Senator Argue, seconded by the honourable Senator Lafond:

March 14, 1972

That in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in
the interest of both eastern and western agriculture,
to establish a Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider legislation and other matters of concern to agriculture that may be referred to the said
Committee by the Senate.
In amendment, it is moved by the honourable Senator
Lafond, seconded by the honourable Senator McNamara:
That Senator Argue's motion be amended to read:
That in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in
the interest of both eastern and western agriculture
and of consumers generally, to establish a Standing
Senate Committee on Agriculture and Consumer
Affairs to consider legislation and other matters of
concern to agriculture and to consumers that may
be referred to the said Committee by the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I rise on a point of
order. I have nothing against the amendment moved by
Senator Lafond, but I think it is out of order because it
brings in something which is outside the purport of the
main motion. There is another way of dealing with the
matter which has been raised by Senator Lafond.
If His Honour the Speaker wishes to take this question
into consideration, the debate could be adjourned. In my
opinion, the amendment is outside the relevancy of the
main motion and should not be entertained. I will have
something to say after His Honour has made a decision on
this point of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, a point of
order has been raised by the Leader of the Opposition as
to the relevancy of this amendment. I should like to have
some time to consider this question. I would hope to be in
a position to give a ruling tomorrow. Does the Leader of
the Opposition wish to add some details now on this
point?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No, Mr. Speaker. I have made my point.
Someone else may wish to speak on it.
The Hon. the Speaker: The point will be decided in the
light of precedents, and also in the light of what the
Leader of the Opposition has said.
Hon. Mr. Michaud: Honourable senators, I move that the
debate be adjourned.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I take it
that this motion for the adjournment of the debate is
moved under reserve, having regard to the ruling which I
shall make on the admissibility of the amendment. If the
Chair rules that the amendment is out of order, the
motion of the honourable Senator Michaud for the
adjournment of the debate would apply to the main
motion.
It is moved by the honourable Senator Michaud, seconded by the honourable Senator McElman, that this debate
be adjourned until the next sitting of the Senate. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

SCIENCE POLICY
CONSIDERATION OF VOLUME II OF REPORT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
Senate resumed from Thursday, March 2, the
The
adjourned debate on the consideration of Volume Il of the
Report of the Special Committee on Science Policy, tabled
in the Senate on Thursday, February 24, 1972.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, in continuing the discussion originated by Senator Lamontagne on
March 2, let me first of all pay tribute to him for the
magnificent presentation he made at that time. Let me

SENATE DEBATES

also say that the members of the committee welcomed the
clarification of some of the misunderstandings that arose
out of that report as reported in the press. For example,
one of the things that I am sure concerned most of us was
the statement that appeared in more than one newspaper,
and was promoted by one columnist, that the Senate
committee was out to dismantle the National Research
Council. This was a matter of great concern to all of us
because quite the contrary is true, and the impact of the
recommendations of the Senate Committee on Science
Policy was to strengthen and make more viable the work
of the National Research Council.
There are people going up and down the length and
breadth of this country today attacking our report, and, of
course, in a free and democratic society this is their right.
But they have the advantage in that the discussion means
that more people become aware of the issues at stake, and
I am sure the Senate committee makes no pretence of
having all the answers. But we think we have some, and in
answer to some of those who are critical of the report I
am happy to be able to say that SCITEC, the association
comprised of a large number of the scientific organizations in Canada, has already endorsed 43 of 45 recommendations in Volume II. This is not a bad batting average. I
do not intend to say anything more along that line at the
present time.
Volume I of the Senate Report on Science Policy entitled A Critical Review: Past and Present says that after
reviewing what was being done in the name of science
policy in Canada and listening to hundreds of witnesses,
scientists, educators, administrators and industrialists,
and after visiting science policy administrations in a
number of countries in Europe, and visiting the policy
directors in those countries, the committee assessed the
results of 50 years of scientific endeavour in Canada in
the following manner, and here I am referring to the
conclusion on page 283 of Volume I. I repeat this for
emphasis because I think it is important to keep in mind
always just what the committee has said:
To attain the economic objectives of the first generation science policy, we put the emphasis on science
and government laboratories, in the hope that they
would foster new industrial technology. This strategy
failed. When it came to social objectives, we made
another strategic mistake. We believed that we could
succeed merely by devoting huge sums of money to
them.
Every year we are building more schools, more universities; we are providing easier access to education.
And yet we have more student unrest and more parental concern that our children are not getting an
adequate preparation for real life.
We are spending large sums to improve housing
conditions, but our cities are becoming more and
more crowded and inhuman. We are spending over
three billion dollars every year on social security, but
the poor are becoming relatively poorer and more and
more restless as they live, through television or otherwise, closer to affluence. We are building more hospitals and providing for free hospitalization and better
medical care, but a greater number of people die of
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

March 15, 1972

incurable diseases, and the mysterious diseases of the
mind are spreading.
Our obvious failure to cope with our collective problems forces us to recognize that we do not even understand the true nature and the real dimensions of most
of these difficulties. In other words, we are just beginning to realize that we have seriously neglected to
support research and development activities in these
crucial sectors. No wonder they still remain so puzzling and so frustrating to us.
Yet, as we awaken to the urgent need for more
research and development for social and collective
purposes, we should not repeat the mistake of the past
and think that this tragic gap in knowledge and
understanding will be filled simply by devoting more
money to science activities. We need more research,
but not only that; we need good research and we need
innovation. We must develop a coherent overall
science policy so that we can not only meet our economic objectives more effectively but also more realistically face our mounting social problems.
This is from Volume I which provoked the most stimulating dialogue on science policy in the history of Canada.
Volume II entitled Targets and Strategiesfor the Seventies has been in the hands of the public less than two
months but already there are evidences of revitalized
dialogue on the Canadian scientific scene. The main
thrust of Volume Il is to present challenge of change-the
need for dramatic change in the interests of national
survival.
It is no surprise that there is great resistance to change
on the part of certain segments of our national community. There has always been resistance to change. Here we
find resistance to change on the part of certain individuals and some people in universities. We find resistance to
change on the part of some scientists. We find resistance
to change on the part of many government administrators. But I want to emphasize with all the strength I can,
that the challenge of today to our scientific community, to
our industrial community, to our commercial community
and to the government itself is the challenge of change. In
order to survive, we must be prepared to accept change.
We must be prepared to innovate because innovation is
change. The success of the new science policy for Canada
will depend on the acceptance of change.
Constantly, throughout the hearings, the committee
questioned witnesses about their knowledge of a national
science inventory. Did they have any idea of the number
and kinds and diversity of projects for which public and
private funds were being used in Canada? We constantly
asked, was there an audit or monitoring of the projects in
order to determine in what manner the funds were being
used and to determine what output was being derived
from these huge inputs of money, manpower and
resources? We constantly asked what steps had been
taken to establish a national science and technical information system and I must confess that the replies were
not too encouraging. This is probably not surprising
because we are a relatively young country and so far we
have not had to do a lot of things on our own. We could
copy and adapt science and technological information
from other countries. As a matter of fact, we will always

March 15, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

have to do this. If we remember that regardless of the
amounts of money that we contribute towards our national science budget, Canada's contribution to the world pool
of scientific information will be about 2 per cent of the
total. This puts the matter in perspective. It also underlines the importance that Canadian policymakers and
planners must give to the utilization of the resources we
devote to science policy.
* (1420)

The purpose of a national science policy is to mobilize
the resources of scientific and technical information in
such a way that they can be readily available to the users.
We must never forget that the most important criterion of
the success or failure of a program of information, a
program of innovation, is the extent to which it meets the
needs of the user or consumer. This is something that has
been too often forgotten or overlooked in much of the
planning for the dissemination of information in the last
number of years. Today, many contemporary organizations and institutions are in a state of crisis in their efforts
to survive and adapt in a world of rapid and incessant
change. These enterprises are turning increasingly to the
use of the new "information technology," exemplified by
but not limited to the electronic digital computer. Rosove,
in Chapter 1 of his book Developing a Computer-based
Information System, says:
Unfortunately, the application of a new, dynamic
technology as a means to overcome crises generates
its own unique problems. These problems include
creating an efficient process for the development of
systems employing the technology, and dealing with
the effects of the new development process on existing management orientations and organization.
In the second half of the twentieth century we are
witnessing an extraordinary growth in the size and
complexity of governmental, military, and business
organizations. Whether we look at public institutions,
military commands, or business corporations, we see
an increasing division of labour and more intensive
task specialization, a growth in the number of
employees, personnel or clients serviced an increasing
diversification of operational functions, a proliferation of organizational components, and a growth in
the geographical scope of operations. A contemporary
enterprise may be characterized as a vast maze of
interconnected and interdependent elements, all, presumably, organized and operating to achieve a
common objective or related objectives, whether this
goal be producing a product, defending a country
against air attack or serving the needs of the public.
As governmental, military, and business enterprises
grow in size and complexity, and as they attempt to
adapt to rapidly changing environments or changing
threats in their environments-missiles, competitors,
or population explosion-the need of government
administrators, military commanders, and business
managers to be able to receive process, and use large
volumes of information rapidly becomes increasingly
critical to the successful operation of the enterprise.
The sheer number of data which must be utilized in
the typical institution of the contemporary period is in
itself overwhelming.

The division of labour, technical specialization, and
departmentalization characteristic of contemporary
large-scale institutions call for a degree of co-ordination and, therefore, an exchange of information
among interdependent operational units never before
equalled in human history. In addition, events and
operations within interrelated organizational units
occur so rapidly that the unaided human mind is no
longer able to keep abreast of the course of events
with a speed sufficient to comprehend and control
them.
There is abundant evidence that existing methods
and procedures for handling and using information in
contemporary large-scale enterprises are failing to
keep up with the needs of public adminstrators, business managers, and military commanders. As a result
of this situation, there has emerged in recent years the
specialized study and development of "systems" for
the transmission, processing, and utilization of
information.
If honourable senators have an opportunity of seeing
any examples of contemporary technology, I would suggest that they seek an opportunity of viewing the Strategic
Air Command at Omaha, Nebraska, the NORAD headquarters under Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, or take a
look at what we have at North Bay. They will then see the
type of technology that is likely to be common within the
next few years. In other words, the military are the
possessors of modern advanced technology which nobody
else can afford.
An advantage of this expenditure is that whatever is
produced is rapidly adapted for civilian use. This is what
a national system of information is all about.
What is information? It is important to recognize the
distinction between information and data:
A datum is a fact in isolation. Information is an
aggregate of facts so organized, or a datum so utilized
as to be knowledge or intelligence. Information is
meaningful data, whereas data, as such, have no
intrinsic meaning or significance.
Information is the concept relating data which are
otherwise meaningless to some specified human purpose or objective. From this point of view, "data processing" is a set of activities which transforms data
into information. This distinction between data and
information emphasizes what needs to be stressed. It
focuses attention upon the uses we intend to make of
data, rather than upon data-processing tools as such.
A radar operator in a system of air defense who is
tracking an unidentified aircraft regards radar
returns from clouds as noise, not information; but to a
meteorologist attempting to forecast weather, radar
returns from clouds are not noise-they are the information he needs to achieve his objectives.
An information system is the formal or rationally
planned means whereby managers receive and transmit information. Hence it is more than an automatic
data-processing system. It may include automatic
data-processing as one aspect of the information-handling apparatus assisting management, but it may
also include oral briefings. Every large man-made

SENATE DEBATES

enterprise depends upon and has an information
system of some kind.
Largely because of the innovativeness of the Canadian
Senate, as exemplified in the work of some of its committees recently, particularly its Committee on Science
Policy, Canada has become the focus for a number of
in-depth studies on our science policy and our information systems. We are the beneficiaries of a very detailed
and in-depth analysis of the current system. The information that has come from this analysis should be helpful to
us in assessing where we are at the present time and
where we must go.

The OECD Scientific and Technical Information Policy
Committee is quoted at page 411 of Volume Il of our
report as follows:
There is therefore an urgent need for every member
country to establish, as an integral part of its science
policy mechanism, a focal point for information
policy issue in science and technologyThat, of course, applies to Canada, as it is a member
country.
The OECD considers an effective STI system-and STI
stands for science and technology information-to be an
urgent need for each country. We are fortunate in that
Canada's STI system was the first to come under study of
all OECD member countries by the OECD information
policy group.
The report of the examiners of that group was published last year, and we quote that report at page 412 of
Volume Il to cite another example of what has been called
"Science Policy by Accident." These experts, no doubt,
were guided by tact and diplomacy, but they found it
necessary to use unvarnished language in describing
Canada's STI system, and what they said is worth
repeating:
Canada's STI system, however, developed piecemeal,
without liaison between them; without plan, without
co-ordination in a somewhat haphazard fashion.
Present scientific and technical information policy in
Canada may be said to be the resuit rather than the
cause of the many information activities which have
sprung up ... It is doubtful whether the economy of
the country could bear much longer the increased
expenditure resulting from an expansion of the
present system.
These words bear out the committee's own fears based on
our extensive questioning of witnesses.
The committee has been accused by some of causing in
Canadian science policy a "paralysis by analysis." Such
criticism is difficult to understand when in Volume I we
show how our science policy mechanisms had been effectively paralyzed for almost half a century. We tried to
analyze the paralysis in Volume I. Surely the discovery of
the symptoms of paralysis does not cause the disease.
What is even more peculiar about this criticism is the fact
that in Volume II we set out 45 specific recommendations
for action, and as I said a moment ago, the SCITEC
organizations have endorsed 43 of them. Surely that is a
pretty good batting average.
[Hon. Mr. Camerond

March 15, 1972

Certainly some of these recommendations call for some
analysis to be made, but an analysis of a type never before
made in this country. One can state that the only way of
avoiding institutional paralysis in today's, and more relevantly, in tomorrow's fast changing world, is for continuing analysis to be made of our science policy. An eventual adjunct to this will have to be a dynamic Canadian
science and technological information system. In Volume
II of our report, at page 411, we point out that the OECD
examiners complimented Canada on the study of STI
made by the Tyas Group. They stated that this study
published by the Science Council was of immense value.
But what happened? The Tyas study called for a change,
and, as we all know, an entrenched bureaucracy, benefiting under the status quo, fights change. This is what leads
to paralysis. What happened? The Tyas study did not lead
to far-ranging changes, but to a watered-down compromise, so we have the OECD examiners advising us again,
as quoted on page 411, Volume II of our report:
The examiners are of the opinion that the recommendations of the Tyas Group deserve reappraisal and
incorporation into plans for the future.
What the OECD examiners are telling us is to stop being
paralyzed in the face of change and what should concern
all parliamentarians is their warning-and I repeat it-as
quoted at page 412:
It is doubtful whether the economy of the country
could bear much longer the increased expenditure
resulting from an expansion of the present system.
This brings us to the one central paradox or problem
concerning a Canadian STI system. Volume II of the
Senate Science Policy Report is a statement centred
around the thesis we develop, that Canada must become,
and soon, an innovative society. In this volume we focus
our attention on secondary manufacturing industry and
say that this country's future, among other things of
course, will depend on how effectively Canadian industry
turns the output of not only Canada's but the world's
knowledge-producing institutions into successful new
products and processes.
If, as we believe, Canadian industry can and does
become dynamic, growing and innovative, then there will
be a vital need for a dynamic, growing and innovative
scientific and technical information system, and this will
always be complicated by the fact that at best Canada can
produce only about 2 per cent of the world's science and
technical information. China, this new emerging superpower, will eventually produce more than 25 per cent of
the world's STI, which is a shock to some of us.
Now the paradox. Our STI capability must grow in
order to match the growth of a dynamic industry, but, as
the OECD warns, our economy could not withstand the
growth of the present system. The Senate committee
agrees. So what is to be done? Changes in our STI system
must be made, and we have recommended this item for
immediate consideration by the Ministry of State for
Science and Technology. This is shown in the four recommendations on pages 592 and 593:
1. The Ministry of State for Science and Technology
be given responsibility for initiating the creation of
new scientific and technical information and transfer
systems and technological forecasting services in co-

March

operation with the proposed National Research
Academy and the Department of Industry, Trade and
Commerce and in consultation with the communication industry;
2. The main operating responsibility for the collection, storage, and dissemination of scientific and technical documentation should be assigned to the proposed National Research Academy, and the operating
responsibility for the collection, storage, and effective
transfer of information and technological forecasts
concerning the industrial innovative process should
be assigned to the Department of Industry, Trade and
Commerce, while enabling other government agencies
to maintain their own systems according to their specific needs;
3. The Ministry of State for Science and Technology
be responsible for the continuing review and evaluation and coordination of the various government
agencies' scientific and technical information and
technological forecasting activities; and
4. All these activities be arranged so as to encourage
the development of a Canadian information and forecasting industry to which the two ministries named
above should give high priority.
When governments suddenly perceive a problem such
as this there is always a temptation to precipitately and
unthoughtfully "do something," and no more costly mistake could be made in the field of STI systems. On page
334 the committee quotes the Prime Minister's warning
about such a camouflage for real and meaningful change.
In the field of STI systems it would take no wit at all to
expend millions of dollars on computer-based information systems to ferret out the growing world STI and send
it careening back and forth over the length of this land.
The possibilities of doing something are almost unlimited,
and so are the attendant costs. You would have the
unseemly spectacle of "a dynamic STI policy by
accident."
The only way of ensuring we do not have a further
growth of an STI policy by accident is to carefully set up
guidelines for a Canadian STI system which carefully
reflect the nature of the task.

First of all one must understand what is meant by
information and information systems. It is sometimes forgotten that information is designed to inform the receiver
of that information. Information, as I said earlier, is not
simply data. There is an almost infinite reservoir of available or potential data that one could gather about any
activity but that could not possibly inform anybody. Information is distinct from data. Information is a collection of
facts, organized in such a way as to be knowledgeable or
intelligible. In other words, information is data which has
been processed to be useful and understandable for some
specific purpose or objective. The focus of information
must be on the user of information-and this is often
forgotten.
One of the most interesting analyses made to date,
namely, a Study of Success and Failure in Industrial
Innovation, is a report on Project Sappho by the Science
Policy Research Unit of the University of Sussex-and

this is just off the press. Probably for the first time, pairs
of innovations have been studied; that is, a successful
innovation in a given line has been compared with an
unsuccessful one. A detailed study was made to determine
the factors which make this important difference. For the
instrument industry, for example, the index variables
which contribute to success, in order of importance, are:
marketing know-how, knowledge of and attention to user
needs, and thirdly, "the effectiveness of the innovating
organization's communications network with the outside
scientific and technical community." In other words, an
effective STI system comes before "R and D strength,"
which is the fourth item. These are the key factors which
differentiate between success and failure.
To illustrate this point in a simple manner, we take note
of the fact that in Volume Il of the Senate committee's
report we deal with the first generation science policy.
This policy is designed to develop the necessary excellence in basic research and an innovative industry which
can sustain the economy at the necessary level of growth.
Therefore, in a Canadian STI system for a first generation science policy, emphasis must be placed on the needs
of the users, and such systems have been called "user
friendly systems." STI systems must never be designed
for the convenience of those who collect, store and process information, but rather the client must be catered to.
Today, an STI system would undoubtedly use computers.
One definition of an information system is:
-an integrated, multi-purpose, geographically dispersed computer-based configuration of people,
procedures and equipment designed to satisfy the
informational needs of a user.
That is a definition which should be pasted up in every
office in this country-and in every government office,
too. This is taken from the book, Developing a Computerbased Information System, by Perry E. Rosove, published
in 1967 by John Wiley and Sons of New York.
Experienced experts in the field of information systems
warn that such sytems are often resisted and their
implementation stifled because the revolution in information technology can only be realized by "revolutions in the
social or institutional realm." In other words, the threat of
change to which I referred earlier often causes managers
to impede a more rapid and more successful utilization of
the new technology. Experience shows that there is often
a lack of correspondence between the jurisdictional area
of an organization and the information system that it
requires to meet its needs and objectives. The latter point
often causes an information system either to be still-born
or to be continually hampered by jurisdictional
arguments.
This brings us to another aspect of a Canadian STI
system, and that is its relation to the problem of "accountability." The system is primarily designed to meet the
needs of its clients, either in the field of basic research or
in the field of industrial innovation. In a subsequent
volume, the committee will deal with systems designed for
its second generation of science policy but here, as an
example. we deal only with the first generation science
policy. The question of accountability arises because a
considerable sum of public money is spent in promoting
in Canada, either basic research or R and D aimed at

SENATE DEBATES

industrial innovation; and, as parliamentarians, we know
that there has to be accountability for these funds. In
other words, what does the public get for its expenditures? What is the output from the multi-million dollar
input?
The question of accountability cannot be answered by a
simple statement of the inputs of public money to R and D
but rather must be answered in terms of outputs. With
regard to accountability, one would assume that eventually the Minister of State for Science and Technology would
be in a position to account to Parliament for the funds
expended in support of R and D in Canada. This would
entail designing a Canadian STI system which would
allow the ministry to measure not only the inputs to R and
D but to also be informed of the outputs from such expenditures in terms which could be related to government
objectives. And here I am delighted that the Minister of
State for Science and Technology has recently indicated
that it will be one of the functions of his ministry to
monitor and examine carefully the inputs and the outputs-and this is long overdue in Canada. I realize that
this part of the policy is an anathema to certain scientists
who insist that they have a right to go their own untrammelled way and that the only responsibility of the public
is to give them access to unlimited funds for which they
are not to be accountable. In fact, one distinguished
Canadian scientist, in speaking from one end of Canada
to the other about Volume II of the report of the Senate
Committee on Science Policy, has described the senators
who prepared the report as being "all wet." Time will tel]
who is "all wet" in this matter, and I refer to an article on
this subject which appeared in the Toronto Star of
Friday, February 25. I am not going to quote it. We see in
this man's statements the classic example of the resistance to change-not only a resistance to change but a
willingness to distort the facts, because this man, and
many others, including a well-known columnist in this
cityHon. Mr. Flynn: Name him.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: -falsely accuse the Senate committee of being deliberately out to destroy the NRC. If these
men had taken the trouble to read the report they would
see that, instead of destroying the NRC, the recommendations of the Senate committee will strengthen that organization-and that this is what Canada needs today and
what Canada must do in its own national interest.
A Canadian STI system, therefore, must be designed to
supply effectively the users of STI with information
which they require. The clients of such a system would be
found in universities, industries and governments. Many
of the users of the STI would be managers of projects,
funded wholly or in part by public funds. Some of these
managers would also be government employees.
We also see that from the point of view of accountability, & Canadian STI system must be so designed that
information on the outputs of these publicly funded programs be collected so as to evaluate the outputs from the
various points of view. Here we must take into account
the common experience that the managers of a program
are not the best people to evaluate the program from the
point of view of the effectiveness of the expenditure of
public funds. That is why the committee has recommend[Hon. Mr. Camerond

March 15, 1972

ed certain actions to be taken by the Ministry of State for
Science and Technology, and why the committee feels
that that ministry should not have any operating responsibility for programs in order that they may be better able
to preserve their impartiality by avoiding the situation
where they are managers of R and D programs and
evaluators of the same programs.
a (1450)

Regarding the function of a Canadian STI system
designed to supply the users of STI, attention should be
given to three aspects.
First, in a country as large as Canada, attention should
be given to decentralization because it is obvious that
there are differences between the needs of STI users in
different parts of the country. For example, the needs of
industries in the Maritimes might be very different from
the needs of users in southern Ontario, and, again, the
client requirements in the Province of Quebec would be
different from those in Alberta. In the regionalization of
STI systems, arrangements would have to be worked out
between the federal government and the provincial governments, and in the past such arrangements have been
made.
The second aspect which must be considered is that of
community control because in any region the public are
quite aware of their problems and are very conscious of a
potential for betterment. Hence, it is only reasonable that
in regional areas the public should have the means to
control the expenditure of their own funds. This aspect
might simply result in co-operation between local governments and the federal government along with ensuring
that the process whereby STI becomes available is readily
visible to the public. Another aspect, of course, arises
regarding community concern over pollution. Here special attention will have to be given to ensuring that the
public can have access to authoritative information about
pollution problems.
The third aspect which must be considered is to decide
to what extent a market model can be used in an STI
system. It is oftentimes remarked that people, such as
industrialists, do not appreciate information that they do
not have to pay for. Another way of looking at this is to
reflect on the obvious fact that information for industrial
firms is probably not very useful if they are not willing to
pay for it. One obvious way of ensuring the effectiveness
of a client-oriented STI system is to determine to what
extent the clients are willing to pay for this service. This
approach opens the way for private industry to participate in the development of a Canadian STI system, and
this might well offer export opportunities. As an example,
a regional STI system in the Province of Quebec would
necessarily have to translate much of the STI from English-speaking regions of the world into the French language, and it might well be that there would be a market
for this information in the rest of the Francophone world,
particularly in the developing countries.
Regarding the necessity of having accountability for
public money spent by the federal government in support
of R and D in the various sectors, such as universities,
industries and within the federal government's own
laboratories, it is worth stressing the obvious steps which
must be taken. There are four such steps which I will

March 15, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

describe briefly. First, it is necessary to define the objectives for which R and D funds are expended, and this
would also involve defining the objectives of the organization receiving such funds, especially if they were the government's own laboratories. Such definition of objectives
should be made as clearly as possible. For example, if the
objective of a particular government laboratory is to
develop excellence in basic research in a certain field,
then the STI system must produce information which
allows the effectiveness of this particular unit to be measured over a period of time.
If governmental support of industrial R and D is intended as an objective to promote innovation, then information obviously would have to be collected which allows
some measure of the effectiveness of the expenditure to
be made. For example, if the federal government
increases its supply of R and D money to industry, does
this expenditure lead to increasing innovation or does it
simply result in firms spending less of their own money to
maintain their previous level of innovative activity?
Hence, the STI system must supply information which
allows decision-makers and parliamentarians to know
how effectively the moneys are spent regarding the objectives. In other words, here we are underlining the necessity of a national science inventory. We must know what the
proposals are for which the money is to be used.
Second, information must be collected which shows
what the money was being spent for and what was being
accomplished. This is necessary to some extent in order to
see the relevance of the expenditure. For example,
although a given institution might be performing at a high
degree of excellence in some region of basic research,
there nevertheless would always be the question as to
whether certain areas of basic research relevant to longterm Canadian problems were being funded to a sufficient level. Also, parliamentarians from time to time
would want to know what was being spent and what was
being accomplished in certain specific areas, such as
research on cancer and other diseases. In other words, the
monitoring process as part of our basic philosophy comes
in here.
Third, a dynamic science policy mechanism in the federal government would inevitably be defining alternate
policies for the future and, hence, there would be the
requirement for collecting as much information as possible in order to calculate what each alternate policy would
cost and to estimate its effectiveness. Here it might be
necessary from time to time for the government to experiment with different policies in different regions at different times in order to obtain information allowing judgment to be made on the effectiveness of the different
policies.
Some observers believe that in the 1970s there will be a
requirement for more and more of such experimentation
to be done in order to arrive at more effective policies.
What has inhibited this process in the past is the failure to
design programs so that something can be learned from
them which can guide the design of future programs.
Some observers point out that this failure to some extent
is due to the lack of courage on the part of adminisfrators.
In the future, all science policy programs, as well as
programs for the dissemination of scientific and technical

information, should be designed so that the requisite
information is obtained to allow the effectiveness of the
program to be measured and evaluated.
Fourth, a systematic procedure must be instituted
which allows all the relevant information about government-funded science activities to be brought together in a
manner allowing a coherent overall science policy to be
operative.
To summarize then, the OECD has added to the evidence which points out that we have had a STI policy by
accident and that the country cannot afford to pursue this
unguided, or misguided, path. If Canada is to become an
innovative country, then we must have a growing and
more effective STI system. The guidelines for such a
system must be squarely centered on ensuring that the
needs of the users of the system determine the development and direction of the system.
I should point out here that there are persons, in universities in particular, who resent that approach. Their attitude is: "The only action for the government to take is to
give us the money we want, and out of that will come
magnificent discoveries." Well, I say that perhaps some
discoveries would come out of that expenditure, but probably not nearly as many as they would suppose.
With regard to a first generation science policy, which is
the substance of the first two volumes of the Senate
report, this means that Canadian basic researchers and
industrial R and D staff and the managers of industrial
innovation must have their needs met. In meeting the
needs of the users, it is suggested that account be taken to
decentralize the STI system so as to deal more effectively
with local or regional Canadian needs. The community
must have some aspect of control of the system as well as
the necessary access, and the market mechanism should
be used to the maximum practical extent. Furthermore,
encouragement should be given to the private sector to
develop economically viable STI activities, especially with
a view to export possibilities.
* (1500)

Finally, stress is given to the need for accountability for
public funds spent in support of R and D. This leads to the
necessity of having one function of the Canadian STI
system which provides the government with the necessary
information on the output of the various governmentfunded R and D activities in a manner allowing evaluation
to be made. It is recognized today that an effective and
coherent STI system is a prime requirement for any
industrial society, and it is clear that Canada and other
countries have a long way to go in order to develop such a
system. Fortunately, today there exist the skills and the
equipment necessary for this challenging task to be effectively met. In Volume Il the committee makes certain
recommendations that would place this exciting task on
the shoulders of the new Ministry of State for Science and
Technology and the Department of Industry, Trade and
Commerce. In this connection I would like to emphasize
the tremendous volume of new material coming out. This
volume which I have in my hand contains the proceedings
of the American Society for Information Science, Volume
8. It is entitled Communication for Decision-Makers.It is
just off the press. It is the report of their 34th annual
meeting. Looking at the report it is interesting to note that

SENATE DEBATES

while the participants were mostly American, there were
three Swedish participants and only two Canadians. I am
happy to recognize that the two Canadians came from my
own University of Alberta. One was Doreen M. Heaps,
Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta.
The other was Wayne D. Ingram, Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. It is significant that these two bodies
should be dealing with this particular subject because on
the one hand you have the university, which very often
takes the theoretical approach, and on the other you have
the Institute of Technology, which takes the applied
approach. In our educational system today we must place
more and more emphasis on the practical approach as
well as the theoretical. I recommend this volume to you
for reading.
Let me recapitulate that the essential elements of a
national science policy should be based on accurate and
as complete information as possible. This information
should encompass a national science inventory; in other
words, a schedule of the programs that are receiving
public and, if possible, private funds. Secondly, it must
make provision for an audit or monitoring of these
projects. And here I say an audit which will encompass
the assessment of the priorities for which funds are to be
used. This is the first step in a monitoring process, then to
be followed by an auditing of the results that come from
that expenditure. And third, in order to make the whole
program effective, we must build the kind of national
science and technical information system which will
mobilize and canalize the resources of scientific and technical information, not only between institutions such as
universities, government and industry in Canada but
which will mobilize the resources of information which
are available as free goods in many other countries in the
world. We must never forget that in spite of the huge
expenditures which are proposed by the year 1980, Canada's contribution to the total bank of new scientific knowledge and information will be about 2 per cent. This fact
alone underlines how important it is that we draw upon
the resources of other countries and, as has been pointed
out so often, this information is often in the public domain
and thus is available for free use if we only had the wit to
use it.

Finally, a national scientific and technical information
system will depend on the establishment of a number of
centres of excellence in the country based on institutions
both centrally located and regionally located, and all of
these must be linked together using the most modern and
effective information retrieval systems. Using this kind of
approach a national science and technical information
system can help to make the Canada of the 1970s and
1980s the kind of innovative and imaginative industrial
society which will enable us to use the resources of the
country more effectively in promoting the national
welf are.
In conclusion, there is a closing paragraph I want to
quote from Rosove's book Developing a Computer-based
Information System where he says at page 357:
The contemporary revolution in the information
sciences and the social revolutions call for imagination and the willingness to explore new areas for the
application of computerized systems and new ways of
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

March 15, 1972

conceptualizing information systems per se. We need
the kind of thinking that can conceive a "national
research library" built around computers and other
hardware which would serve the information needs of
both the federal government and the universities; we
need new approaches in which the information
system as a national public utility does not seem farfetched; we need to be able to design entirely new
kinds of medical information systems of the type illustrated in figure 6.2. This is the kind of thinkirg which
is required if we are to survive our time of troubles.
A word of caution must be added. Technology by
itself can solve nothing. Implied in this book is a set of
values; at the core of these values is a belief in man as
the creator of his own destiny. Furthermore, we
believe that institutions, also, are the creations of man
and exist for his benefit; they are not sacrosanct. The
truly effective use of information system technology
will require a re-examination of all types of accepted
institutional forms, from the operations of the Congress of the United States to the management of waste
disposal. Today our armament for survival includes
the information sciences. These sciences can be one of
the instruments in achieving the next evolutionary
stage of mankind.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Grosart, debate adjourned.

AGRICULTURE
DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING STANDING SENATE
COMMITTEE-MOTION IN AMENDMENT-SPEAKER'S
RULING ON POINT OF ORDER POSTPONED
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators,
with reference to this particular point I should like to say
that His Honour the Speaker left Ottawa this morning and
I replaced him only an hour ago. Therefore, before rendering a decision on this matter I should like to have a
little more time to consider it. It is my intention to hand
down a ruling tomorrow.
As honourable senators are aware, the point of order
was raised yesterday afternoon when honourable Senator
Lafond moved an amendment to the motion of honourable Senator Argue for the appointment of a Standing
Senate Committee on Agriculture. The point of order at
that time was raised by honourable Senator Flynn.
In the meantime, and before I hand down my decision
tomorrow, if there are other honourable senators who
would like to speak to the point of order, I shall be very
happy to hear them.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, I should like to
say a word concerning the point of order. Before Senator
Lafond moved his amendment he spoke to me about it. In
fact he had spoken to me before I made my initial speech,
so I do not have any personal objection to the amendment
placed before the Senate. The main purpose of this
motion is to establish an additional standing committee ta
deal with questions relating to agriculture. It seems to me
that it is quite in order for an honourable senator to
propose that the jurisdiction of that proposed committee
be widened to include some other field of consideration.

March 15, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Lafond moved that in addition to agriculture
the committee might consider consumer affairs.
I am certainly no expert on the rules, but both the
Senate and the House of Commons have committees dealing with more than one subject and some of those subjects
are quite diverse. I think one could argue they are more
diverse than the fields of agriculture and consumer
affairs.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You could perhaps argue that.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I have checked the fourth edition of
Beauchesne's ParliamentaryRules and Forms where, in
paragraph 203(1), at page 171, it is stated:
It is an imperative rule that every amendment must
be relevant to the question on which the amendment
is proposed. Every amendment proposed to be made
either to a question or to a proposed amendment
should be so framed that if agreed to by the house the
question or amendment as amended would be intelligible and consistent with itself.
I think the amendment would be intelligible and consistent. I do not think the motion and the .amendment are
self-exclusive, and I do not feel one is repugnant to the
other.
In paragraph 202(12) at page 170 Beauchesne states:
An amendment proposing a direct negative, though it
may be covered up by verbiage, is out of order.
This is not a direct negative. The Senate might well consider it to be in order. When it comes time to deal with this
question the Senate will have to decide whether it wishes
to support the addition of consumer affairs to the committee's terms of reference.
I appreciate the opportunity of saying these few words
before the ruling is given tomorrow.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, since I raised
the point of order, perhaps I will be permitted to say a few
words in reply to Senator Argue, whose opinion I hold in
high respect. As I indicated yesterday, I did not raise this
point of order because I have deep feelings regarding
whatever decision is given. It does not matter to me,
except it might set a precedent which could be dangerous.
If I follow Senator Argue's comments, the addition of
consumer affairs to the terms of reference of a proposed
committee on agriculture, while it does not change the
realm of the proposal, would mean there could be added
to those terms of reference everything that is presently in
the terms of reference of other committees. We would
then have only one standing committee on agriculture
which would deal with banking, trade, commerce, health,
welfare and so on.
I suggest to Senator Argue that we must draw the line
somewhere. Everything is relevant, but it seems the rule
of relevancy does not apply any more.
I remember when I was Deputy Speaker in the other
place, no one gave me more trouble with regard to the
application of the rule of relevancy than did the then
honourable member from Assiniboia. He could always
make an argument in favour of relevancy. No one was
better at this than he, except perhaps the present Leader
of the Government in this house who might be inclined to

147

say I am opposed to a motion because the sun rose at five
o'clock this morning.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Sometimes you are inclined to agree
with that principle.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I had to make some concessions
because Senator Argue was heading a small group of
about seven members, and he even had difficulty with
them. So I had to be very kind to him. I feel I did my best,
and I think I helped him occasionally. However, if the rule
of relevancy means anything, I do not think his argument
will stand up. The line must be drawn somewhere. If a
motion for the setting up of a committee on agriculture
can be amended to include consumers affairs, then any
other subject can be added.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I wish to
make one comment in reply to what Senator Flynn has
just suggested. It seems to me we must draw the line
somewhere, yes, but I cannot see why we should make
fish of this proposal and fowl of the name of our Standing
Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science. I
should have thought that science was no more closely
allied to health and welfare then consumer affairs would
be to agriculture. It seerns to me indeed that there is a
rather close connection between consumer affairs and
agriculture-as close a relationship as exists between consumer affairs and corporate affairs, in the name of one of
our departments of state. In my view, one can reasonably
say that consumer affairs is as relevant to agriculture as
science is to health and welfare, or as labour was to the
former standing committee of this house on immigration
and labour. I recall there was such a committee. In fact, I
appeared before it as a witness on one occasion.
I cannot see why the line of relevancy should be drawn
at the point which Senator Flynn has suggested. A case
could perhaps be made if agriculture and astrophysics
were linked. I think that that would be going way out
beyond the limits of relevancy. However, I cannot see that
there is a serious question of relevancy here.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, may I say that
Senator Forsey has learned this from Senator Martin. I
am sure that Senator Argue, in moving to set up a committee on agriculture, never had in mind the inclusion of
consumer affairs.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not know why you always bring
my name into these matters.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Perhaps it is because you are my best
argument.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, in reply to what
Senator Flynn has just said I should like to point out that
in several agricultural measures brought before us recently there were references to consumer interests, or provisions for consumer representation on marketing boards
or other such bodies.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is very well put, Senator Forsey,
and I agree with you. I would not have dared to use that
argument.
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators, I
wish to thank those who have spoken on this matter. As I
have indicated, I will give my ruling tomorrow.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
MOTION AUTHORIZING COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE AND
REPORT ON CANADIAN RELATIONS WITH EXPANDED
EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, March 8, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Aird that the
Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs be authorized to examine and report on Canadian relations with the
expanded European Communities.
Hon. M. Grattan O'Leary: Honourable senators, Arthur
Meighen, who was my hero of public life, once told me,
"O'Leary, if you have nothing of usefulness to say, for
heaven's sake, don't start saying it and, above all, don't
keep on saying it." I must confess that I have disregarded
that advice by attempting to speak, briefly I hope, on this
particular subject. I am doing so at the request of Senator
Grosart, who is much busier in this chamber than I, has
more work to do and is doing more. Therefore, in a
moment of weakness I told him I would substitute for
him.
I must say at once that there is a certain academic
element in discussing the Common Market, because there
is no certainty whatever that Britain will enter it. I know
there has been a general assumption or belief in this
country that because some particular government in England comes out for the Common Market the proposition
has the support of the British people. That was not true
when the proposition was first advanced in Britain, and it
certainly is not true today. When the vote was taken, a
week or two ago, on the acceptance of the principle of
joining the Common Market Mr. Heath, out of a house of
640 or 650 members, was able to achieve a majority of
only eight. He got that majority through the support of six
members of the Liberal party. The support of six members of that once historical party in England today means
practically nothing at all. Indeed, had he not received the
support of that famous gentleman, Mr. Jenkins, who carried with him the support of certain members of the
Labour party, the proposition would have been defeated.
The fact is that poll after poll in Britain has shown 45
per cent, 50 per cent, and 54 per cent in one case, of the
population of England voting against entering the
Common Market. This is understañ-dable. From the days
of the Tudors right down to 10 years ago, England's proud
boast was that she occupied splendid isolation from the
Continent. You will remember the story in a London
newspaper when a heavy fog developed in the channel. It
headlined: "Heavy fog over the channel-continent isolated." That was the attitude of the English people-to maintain balances of power, yes, but as far as possible to keep
away from entangling alliances with Europe.
That is what happened, and today in England the most
famous economist there, Professor Harrod, the biographer of Keynes, is against the Common Market. Arthur
Bryant is against the Common Market. Professor Jay, a
noted economist, is against the Common Market and, as I
said, vote after vote has shown the British people to be
against entering the Common Market, with some reason.
[The Hon the Speakerj

March 15, 1972

The Common Market, after all, was launched in Europe
as a political instrument. The Treaty of Rome provided
for political unification of Europe. They have not succeeded in achieving that, but they certainly have not abandoned the idea. Mr. Monet, who was the chief architect of
the market, says "We are still in politics." The British
people know that, and I wonder how many Canadians
realize that some 55 British statutes will have to be
amended when Britain enters the Common Market. There
is hardly any doubt that if Britain enters the Common
Market a great deal of British life will be affected directly,
not by acts of the parliament at Westminster, but
by
decisions taken in Brussels. A great many Canadians do
not seem to realize this. The Rome Treaty still exists. Its
authors continue to have in mind that which they set out
to do in the first place. They have not abandoned the idea.
Therefore some of the best authorities in Britain today
believe that for Britain to enter the Common Market
would be apostasy of Britain's past, and retreat from
greatness. We al] know what that would mean to the pride
of the Englishman.
I therefore say-and I have talked to many Englishmen
on this subject during the past week, and they also said
this-"Wait. It is true that Heath has had the principle
endorsed, but wait until he attempts to get certain clauses
of that bill passed, and see what happens." They said that
if they were wagering money they would wager that the
proposition to enter the Common Market will not succeed
as it stands.
I do not refer now to Mr. Wilson. He apparently accepted a proposition less favourable to Britain than the one
before them now. Politics is politics. Wilson is a very
shrewd and able politician, and were it not for the stand
taken by Jenkins the bill would have been defeated the
other day. But let us forget about that and assume the bill
will pass, and that Britain on January 1, 1973 will become
a partner of the European Economic Community.
I am astonished that so little has been written or said,
and so little action taken, by the Government of Canada
regarding the effects of this upon Canada. I know that
people come here frorn England, as they did the last time
the proposition was before us, and say, "Yes, of course
this will affect you and it will affect certain of your
exports, but with the great growth of the Common Market
and that of Britain as a partner, if we join, the long-term
benefits will be great for Canada." Just what that assumption is based upon, I do not know. I only know that,
considering the figures, a tremendous number of our
exports-exports which are pretty vital to us-will be
drastically affected by Britain's entry into the Common
Market.
Consider pulp, paper and newsprint, for example. We
now receive a preference from Britain, which Scandinavia does not. If Britain enters the Common Market, a
12 per cent duty will be imposed on our pulp and paper
and other products. This will be necessary because Britain would then have its European Common Market
attachments. Under the same proposition, the Scandinavians will enter free, and they are now our major competitors. They are more successful competitors because they
are not taxed in Scandinavia as our pulp and paper industry is taxed.

March 15, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

When we see what the pulp, paper, and newsprint industry means to Canada from the viewpoint of exports and
employment, the acceptance without concern or protest of
the proposition that Britain's entry into the European
Common Market will place us at a grave disadvantage
because of Scandinavian competition amazes me. I have
not heard one member of the present cabinet, speaking on
any public platform or in the other place, express concern
over the effect on our export trade of Britain's entry into
the European Common Market.
I am well aware that an undertaking has been given that
if any Commonwealth interest is adversely or gravely
affected compensation will be provided, but we do not
know-and I doubt whether the Canadian government
knows-what that compensation will be. It will have to be
negotiated, but it has not been negotiated yet. At a time
when exports are vital to the life of this nation, Canada is
faced with the fact that Britain's entry into the European
Common Market, assuming that it will happen, will gravely affect her exports, employment, and general prosperity.
I have mentioned only the pulp and paper industry.
There are other products which are likely to be affected.
Let us consider the effect on barley-and I am sure that
Senator McDonald is aware of this. Last year we sold $14
million worth of barley. If Britain enters the European
Common Market our barley will come under a tariff of 12
per cent, whereas at present it enters Britain free.
Barley is only one other commodity. I could cite example after example of Canadian products which are now
entering Britain free but which will come under tariffs
imposed by the European Common Market countries. No
one appears to have thought about that.
Five or six years ago, when the Diefenbaker government was in office, our trade with Britain was far greater
than it is today. I recognize the fact that had Britain
entered the European Common Market at that time, the
effect of her entry would have been greater than it is
likely to be now. At that time we went over to Europe and
protested Britain's proposed entry. My Liberal friends
and the Liberal press said that we had gone over there
and attacked dear old Britain, that we had initiated that
protest. As a matter of fact, we did not initiate that protest. It was initiated by Australia and New Zealand, and
we merely followed suit.
Mr. Diefenbaker was represented as being anti-Britain,
anti-Empire, anti-everything-even anti-Canadian, for
that matter-merely because he sought to point out the
effect on Canada of Britain's entry into the European
Economic Community.
I recall that when Mr. Macmillan came to Canada he
said, "Gentlemen, if we find that our entry into the European Common Market adversely affects the Commonwealth, we shall not go ahead with it." Britain, in effect,
gave us a pledge that the Commonwealth would not be
abandoned. Sir Anthony Eden made an emotional speech
on this subject, and said that no matter what happened,
Britain would never abandon the Commonwealth, and,
"You people come first." Within six months that was all
forgotten. Britain adopted the attitude, "We will enter the
European Common Market or bust. We must go in."

149

Curiously enough, an assumption exists, which has been
acceded to particularly by the Canadian press, that if
Britain does not enter the European Common Market she
will not survive. Where is the proof of that? Where is the
proof that the European Common Market will continually
expand?
It has been said that the European Economic Community has made spectacular advances from a percentage
standpoint. But what did it advance from? Percentages do
not mean a thing. Any businessman will tell us that. A
businessman might say, "Last year I experienced a 25 per
cent growth rate over the previous year." A growth from
what? What was the figure the previous year?
Some of the American senators who visited Canada
recently to attend the meeting of the Canada-United
States Interparliamentary Group indicated that Canada
and the United States would gain enormously from Britain's entry into the European Common Market, and suggested that Canada and the United States should get
together and make a deal with the European Economic
Community. I have before me some papers, presented by
the Council of Europe, which provide figures on world
trade. Senator Aird, when speaking the other day, said
that the European Common Market absorbs a large percentage of world trade. That is true, but that trade is
among the member countries of the European Economic
Community. It does not mean that following Britain's
entry that trade will come directly or indirectly to us. The
figure quoted by Senator Aird merely represents the total
trade enjoyed by the member countries of the community.
No one can say how much trade will flow between
Canada and the European Economic Community. I have
not met anyone who can forecast that. It is all conjecture,
supposition, and wishful thinking.
There is no proof that the Canadian farmer or manufacturer, particularly the manufacturer of refined goods, will
benefit from Britain's entry into the European Economic
Community. What did the community buy from us last
year? Purchases from Canada by the EEC last year
amounted to about one per cent of Canada's export trade;
85 per cent went to the United States.
I was astonished to hear Senator Aird, in the course of
his speech, supporting the viewpoint we hear so often that
Canada must have a countervailing force in Europe
against possible absorption, economically and otherwise,
by the United States.
Why did we not have this trade with the European
Economic Community last year? Why did we not have it
the year before? It is said that the United States is forcing
Canadians to become hewers of wood and drawers of
water. That is not so. The nations which are doing that are
in Europe, members of the European Economic Community. In the last three or four years they have purchased practically none of our processed goods. The
goods which create jobs for Canadians have gone to the
United States; they have not gone to the member countries of the European Economic Community. That is
something that we should all remember.
Canada must seek trade wherever she can find it. We
admit that. However, the idea that this country should
endanger or abandon its trade with the United States for
will o' the wisp trade with the European Economic Com-

HEALTH. WELFARE AND SCIENCE
PROPOSED STUDY BY COMMITTEE OF
LABOUR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTES AFFECTING PUBLIC
SERVICES-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 7, the
adjourned debate on the motion of honourable Senator
Haig that the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be instructed to examine and report
upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public services.
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, in
rising to say a few words as the seconder of the motion
which is before the house I do so, I know, to the extreme
disappointment of my learned colleague, the Leader of
the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Oh, no, you are entitled to redeem
yourself.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I want the Leader of the Opposition
to know that I am not following instructions from the
Leader of the Government. In fact, my instructions come
from the distinguished member of the Opposition who
moved the motion, Senator Haig.
I apologize to my friend, the Leader of the OppositionHon. Mr. Flynn: If you are taking instructions from
Senator Haig you should apologize to the Leader of the
Government.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I am very pleased that Senator Haig
asked me to second this motion because it gives those on
both sides of the house an opportunity to support what
could be an important study with long range effects on
the entire relationship of management and labour.
I particularly like the way in which the motion is
worded. I refer to the fact that it asks for an examination
and a report upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public
services. It does not have any specific direction. It does
not suggest that strikes are obsolete. It does not suggest
the outlawing of procedures which we presently follow. It
simply asks that the committee review what we are doing,
and the efficiency of the actions presently undertaken in
settling disputes in areas affecting public services, and,
hopefully, bring forward some suggestions.
I think this is al] to the good. I believe that in so far as
the area of public services is concerned, the people of
Canada have reached the stage where they expect some
review of the situation. There has been a great deal of
inconvenience to the public of this country, not only at the
national level but also at the provincial level and, in some
cases, the municipal level. All in all, whether through this
committee or some other means of studying the efficiency
of our system, the people of Canada feel that such a study
should be undertaken.
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary J

March 15, 1972

I want to emphasize that this committee has no preconceived notions of what should be done. I would hate to
think that because of my support of this motion some
members of the Senate would say that I am against
strikes within the Public Service. It may be it is the only
way we can achieve settlements; I do not know.
I am concerned about the direction of the thinking of
union leaders about public servants. A few days ago D.S.
Davidge, business manager of the 2,200-member electronic unit of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers was quoted in the Globe and Mail as saying he
believed the traditional strike to be of doubtful value.
That in itself sounds very good, but the news item went on
to say:
"Instead of striking in a form that's visible to outsiders, we may have to strike inside-a psychological
strike, if you wish-that would create internal chaos,"
Mr. Davidge said just a few hours after announcing
acceptance by a relatively narrow margin of the
agreement negotiated about 10 days ago.
I believe this has to be a matter of some concern. This
could literally cause a breakdown of services such as
those provided by the air traffic industry, resulting in a
danger to the public. This must be a matter of real importance in our consideration of the question before us today.
I am quite sure no member of this house is able to
provide the answers without a significant study. Senator
Lawson said that our present procedures are reasonably
effective. He indicated in his remarks last week that a
little bit of inflation is not so bad. He is quite prepared to
accept it. I think he said, according to the note I have, a
little bit of inflation is acceptable, and this may be quite
true. Of course, the question is how to stop a little inflation from becoming runaway inflation.
All of us must be concerned with the effect of settlements in the Public Service on the overall labour-management relationship in the country. When a large settlement
is agreed to with a segment of the Public Service, the
ripples are felt all the way down the entire labour-management line. For example, the dock workers in Montreal
were awarded a substantial wage increase and it resulted
in chaos in the whole field of labour-management settlements and started, in my opinion, a round of spiralling
wage settlements which were detrimental to the country
as a whole.
Settlements in certain segments of the Public Service
are generous because of the pressure those segments are
able to exert. I believe these create a class of favoured
employees. In other words, some unions, because of their
particular bargaining position, are able to get much better
deals for their membership than other unions. Of course,
the bargaining position of the non-unionized segment of
the labour force-and that involves the greater percentage
of our labour force-is even weaker. This is the type of
thing that must be of concern to the committee.
We still have with us the problem of the dispute between
the CBC and the electronic technicians. I have some letters from people in my area of the country who say that
we should just let them go on for as long as they wish
because the oniy thing being missed is the hockey games.
I do not agree with that. I feel that the CBC provides a

March 15, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

first-class service, and the sooner that dispute is settled
the better. I pass that on simply as an observation.
There are other approaches to labour-management disputes. For example, we should be reviewing the possibility of establishing labour courts of a judicial nature. In
other words, the Government of Canada should establish
labour courts which would have a similar structure to
those set up under our judicial system, and in which
disputes concerning public servants could be adjudicated.
We would have labour courts presided over by judges
appointed on the basis of their experience. The judges
could be recruited from the ranks of labour, management,
or the legal profession. If such a permanent court system
to deal with labour disputes were set up, perhaps there
would be some rhyme and reason to decisions handed
down. One of the weaknesses of our system of arbitration
boards is that there is no continuity. There is a board here

and a board there, and we really do not know how settlements are finally arrived at.
a

(1550)

It seems to me that we have to look at new approaches.
What is done in the Public Service, as I have indicated,
will reflect through all labour-management relationships.
We must have some new outlooks. I read somewhere that
it is easier to perpetuate an old error than to agree with a
new concept. We are always saying that we cannot eliminate the strike, that we must continue to do what we have
been doing. I believe that with the enlightened outlook
and ability of many of our labour and management
experts in government and elsewhere we can come up
with some new approaches.
Honourable senators, it is a privilege for me to second
this motion, which I hope has the support of this house.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Forsey debate adjourned.

(See p. 139)
LETTER FROM PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA TO PRIME MINISTER OF QUEBEC
REGARDING FAMILY ALLOWANCES, MANPOWER CENTRES AND

ADULT OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING
Ottawa
March 9, 1972

My Dear Prime Minister:
In September we had an exchange of letters which resulted in discussions with respect to family allowances
and also questions of manpower centres and adult occupational training. I am glad that progress has been made
on all of these, although further consideration appears to
be necessary on the manpower and occupational training
questions. Discussions on the latter questions have been
taking place with the provinces over the last year or two
and specific representations have also recently been received from the governments of Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta. I would hope that further discussions could
soon bring these questions to satisfactory conclusions for
all concerned.
We believe that the exchange of views with respect to
family allowances has reached a stage where the federal
government is now in a position to indicate to Quebec
and to the other provinces the nature of a modification it
is prepared to make to the federal Family Income
Security Plan in respect of its application.
The basic principles that, if adopted, could provide for
the adjustment of the federal family allowance plan to a
program of allowances adopted by a provincial legislature
have been extensively discussed by our officials in recent
months. Acceptance of a plan along these lines would
represent, as you will appreciate, a very important
change so far as the federal government is concerned. For
the first time, a federally-financed and administered program, legislated by Parliament, would be subject to modification to accord with a provincial program even though
the amount of financial participation by the province
would be small in comparison with that of the federal
government. In considering the matter, the federal government must, of course, envisage an arrangement that
would be capable of adoption by all provinces and this
requires that the arrangements be such that they would
be administratively possible even if ten variations of
application were to emerge. It also means that certain
conditions have to be laid down. These have for the most
part already been mentioned by you or your Minister of
Social Affairs and should not, therefore, create any problems. The Government of Canada is thus prepared to propose the following plan to the provinces.
Where the federal Parlianent and a provincial legislature have each established a scheme for the payment of
family allowances and the provincial law relating to such
a scheme seeks to ensure an integrated system of allowances within the province, provision will be made for the
federal scheme to be modified by a federal-provincial
agreement so that the amount of monthly benefits, the

levels of income at which the reduction of full benefits
commences and the rates of reduction to be applied will
accord with the standards of the provincial scheme. This
will mean that the provincial legislation, within the ambit
of certain limits related to national standards, will determine the design of the federal program operative in the
province. It is proposed that such an option should be
open to a province where the provincial expenditure on
these allowances, apart from any funds raised by the
province through tax abatement provisions, is at least
15 per cent of combined expenditures on family allowances by the two governments. This would enable the
province to ensure that the federally-administered payments under the basic plan are co-ordinated with the
provincially-administered payments provided by the province under its supplementary family allowance program.
The federal law would provide for certain minimum
standards along the lines referred to above that would
need to be met by any provincial plan before modifications would be made by the federal government in the
family allowance payments in that province. The intent
would be that where the income of the parents was equal
to or below the income tax exemptions provided for in
the federal income tax law, the family allowance payments to that family in respect of its eligible children
would have to be at a level equal to at least 80 per cent
of the maximum payments provided for in the federal
family allowances legislation. For parents whose incomes
were high enough to make them subject to income tax
payments, the provincial governments would be free to
determine the level of benefits payable. To make this
condition meaningful in a plan available to all provinces,
and also to have an arrangement that would be administratively feasible, the federal definition of income would
have to be used for the purpose of federal payments. This
would not, of course, be necessary for provincial payments under any supplementary provincial program and
would not in any way interfere with them. The definition of residence in any modified plan designed in accordance with provincial legislation could be less but not
more restrictive than in the federal law.
In the administration of the basic family allowance
benefit the federal government intends that the cheques
it sends out in payment of such benefits would initially
be based on the income statements made by families, but
these would be subject to eventual verification against
the income tax records of the Department of National
Revenue. The results of this matching process would be
made available to the agency administering the provincial supplementary program. Even though the two administrations might send their separate cheques, there
could, even with separate administration, be a high
degree of consolidation of operations, including the filing
of application forms, matching of information and other

March 15, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

matters of that kind. Alternatively, the federal government would be prepared to administer a single integrated program, based on the federal definition of
income for federal payments, but using additional relevant information about family incomes from a province.
In either case, literature describing the program would
indicate clearly that the plan operative in your province
had been designed in accordance with provincial legislation, and there would be, of course, recognition of
provincial financial participation.
This approach offers an opportunity to rationalize the
present arrangements with respect to Youth Allowances.
The federal government is prepared to ensure an integrated basic plan for all children under 18 in line with
the Quebec design. This would be on the understanding
that the province, in view of the current three-point
tax abatement which would continue to apply, would
pay to the federal government an amount equal to the
cost of the federal FISP program in respect of the 16
and 17 year olds in Quebec. The tax points would yield
Quebec an amount in excess of this payment and the
federal government would recover this excess from
other amounts payable to the province.
The proposed Quebec legislation recently made
public makes provision for additional amounts of
benefits for larger families. It may be that Quebec will
want to provide this type of benefit as a supplementary
provincial payment. If so, the federal administration
would assist the provincial administrative agency by
making available information from the basic plan. The
province would have to decide how much of its resources, if any, it would put in the basic benefit as
compared to the supplementary benefit. If, however,
Quebec were prepared to include all its expenditures
for this purpose as a part of the payments being made
under the basic benefit the federal government would,
as I have said, be prepared to contemplate an integrated administration with the same conditions as those
mentioned above.
Provision would need to be made in the federal and
the provincial laws for an agreement between the two
governments. The basic concept would be that, in any
plan as modified to accord with provincial wishes, the
cost to the federal government of total payments in
the province would not exceed the cost to it under the
family allowance plan as passed by Parliament. To ensure this, the agreement with the province would have
to include an obligation to make adjustment payments
to the federal government for any extra costs incurred
under the provincially-modified plan which turned out
to be over and above what the expenditures would have
been if the basic federal plan had been operative in
that province. The agreement would also have to make
clear that if actual payments to people under the provincial formula fell short of expenditures that would
have been made under the federal formula, the funds
representing the difference would not be made payable
to the provincial government. It would cover as well

the undertaking to identify the nature of provincial
participation in federal literature about the program.
It would also deal with the question of exchange of
information between federal and provincial administrations, and with the amount of notice needed to implement any changes in the provincial formula. These
and other financial and administrative matters would
be incorporated in the agreement.
The federal government feels that the general outline of a possible arrangement is now sufficiently clear
that it is prepared to discuss it with all provinces.
Similar letters to this one are therefore being sent to all
First Ministers. The federal government plans to proceed with the Family Income Security Plan legislation
at the current Session of Parliament. The Bill soon to
be introduced will not, of course, include provision for
the kind of flexibility and adaptation to which I have
referred. If, however, it seems desirable, after consultation with the provinces, the federal government would
be prepared to recommend to Parliament the amendment of the Bill, at the appropriate stage, in a manner
to permit the plan described here to be implemented.
As you will appreciate, what is contemplated here is a
major adjustment in the federal approach to an important income security payment established by Parliament more than twenty-five years ago. It would introduce
a degree of flexibility in relation to provincial conditions
that has been hitherto unknown. It would permit provinces that so wished to move toward an integrated system
of family allowances within their boundaries, while still
maintaining certain general standards for payments to
poorer families. I think the plan would meet the basic
requirements necessary for the government of Quebec
to establish the integrated system of family allowances
that it wishes to introduce. I realize that such arrangements would be as temporary as any statute. But if a
constitutional guarantee were needed, this could be contemplated as indicated in the next paragraph.
While the immediate federal proposal relates to the
family allowance program, the principles involved are
clearly capable of extension to other income support programs. Extension to such other areas would involve complications in making generalized provisions about the
degree of provincial participation, minimum standards,
the relationship between programs and other matters of
that kind. While the difficulties are considerable, the
federal government would be prepared to consider this
kind of extension of the principles I am proposing if a
satisfactory constitutional basis can be found and if it
solved the problem of social security which remained to
be cleared up to permit further progress in the process
of constitutional review.
As the arrangement I am proposing is a matter of
public interest and of importance to Parliament, I am
planning to table this letter in the House of Commons
on Monday and to make it public at that time.
Yours sincerely
P. E. Trudeau

modification it would be ready to make in respect of the

March 9, 1972

application of the federal Family Income Security Plan.

My dear Prime Minister:
During the Victoria Conference last June First Ministers spent considerable time examining the possibility of
including in the Constitutional Charter some provision
under which it would be possible for a provincial government to cause the pattern of federal income security payments to individuals in the province to be capable of adjustment in relation to provincial law. The objective of

such adjustment would be to ensure that the combined
effect of federal and provincial programs could best meet
what the province deemed to be the particular needs of
the people living within it. The discussions centred particularly on the Quebec desire to integrate programs of
this type, with special emphasis on the federal and provincial programs of family allowances. We attempted to
meet this objective by providing for a possible amendment to Section 94A of the BNA Act. As you know, following the Conference at Victoria, the Government of
Quebec decided that it could not accept the approach on
income security included in the Victoria Charter.
Early in September, Mr. Bourassa suggested to me that

the best course would be to explore in some depth the
possibility of meeting these needs through administrative arrangements or through laws which might be passed
by the federal Parliament and provincial legislatures.
Since that time, informal discussions of officiais have been
going forward and have covered family allowances and
also the questions of manpower centres and occupational
training allowances. Throughout these discussions the
federal government has, of course, had in mind that any
arrangements which might appear feasible would have to
be the subject of discussion with all provincial governments and would have to be equally available to ail.
On the question of manpower centres and occupational
training allowances, we are still in the process of examining the ideas brought forward by provincial governments during discussions on various aspects of this
question which have been going on over the past year or
two. We are also considering the recent representations
received from Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. We
are hopeful that, as a result of these studies and of
further discussions with the provinces, it may be possible
to arrive at conclusions satisfactory to all concerned.
In the case of family allowances, however, the federal
government is now prepared to indicate the nature of a

The basic principles would, if adopted, provide for the
adjustment of the federal family allowance plan to a
program of allowances adopted by a provincial legisla-

ture. Acceptance of a plan along these lines would represent, as you will appreciate, a very important change so

legislated by Parliament, would be subject to modification to accord with a provincial program even though

would be small in comparison with that of the federal

and this requires that the arrangements be such that they
would be administratively possible even if ten variations

conditions have to be laid down. The Government of
Canada is thus prepared to propose the following plan.

Where the federal Parliament and a provincial legislature have each established a scheme for the payment of
family allowances and the provincial law relating to such
a scheme seeks to ensure an integrated system of allowances within the province, provision will be made for the
federal scheme to be modified by a federal-provincial
agreement so that the amount of monthly benefits, the
levels of income at which the reduction of full benefits
commences and the rates of reduction to be applied will
accord with the standards of the provincial scheme. This
will mean that the provincial legislation, within the ambit

province to ensure that the federally-administered payments under the basic plan are co-ordinated with the
provincially-administered payments provided by the
province under its own supplementary family allowance
program.

The federal law would provide for certain minimum
standards along the lines referred to above that would

need to be met by any provincial plan before modifications would be made by the federal government in the

Mareh 15, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

family allowance payments in that province. The intent would be that where the income of the parents was
equal to or below the income tax exemptions provided
for in the federal income tax, the family allowance
payments to that family in respect of its eligible children would have to be at a level equal to at least 80
per cent of the maximum payments provided for in the
federal family allowances legislation. For parents whose
incomes were high enough to make them subject to
income tax payments, the provincial governments would
be free to determine the level of benefits payable. To
make this condition meaningful in a plan available to
all provinces, and also to have an arrangement that
would be administratively feasible, the federal definition of income would have to be used for the purpose
of federal payments. This would not, of course, be necessary for provincial payments under any supplementary
provincial program and would not in any way interfere with them. The definition of residence in any
modified plan designed in accordance with provincial
legislation could be less but not more restrictive than
in the federal law.

In the administration of the basic family allowance
benefit the federal government intends that the cheques
it sends out in payment of such benefits would initially
be based on the income statements made by families,
but these would be subject to eventual verification against
the income tax records of the Department of National
Revenue. The results of this matching process would be
made available to the agency administering the provincial supplementary program. Even though the two
administrations might send their separate cheques, there
could, even with separate administration, be a high
degree of consolidation of operations, including the filing
of application forms, matching of information and other
matters of that kind. Alternatively, the federal government would be prepared to administer a single integrated program, based on the federal definition of income for federal payments, but using additional relevant information about family incomes from a province.
In either case, literature describing the program would
indicate clearly that the plan operative in the province
had been designed in accordance with provincial legislation, and there would be, of course, recognition of
provincial financial participation.

Provision would need to be made in the federal and
the provincial laws for an agreement between the two
governments. The basic concept would be that, in any
plan as modified to accord with provincial wishes, the
cost to the federal government of total payments in the
province would not exceed the cost to it under the
family allowance plan as passed by Parliament. To ensure this, the agreement with the province would have
to include an obligation to make adjustment payments

to the federal government for any extra costs incurred
under the provincially-modified plan which turned out
to be over and above what the expenditures would have
been if the basic federal plan had been operative in
that province. The agreement would also have to make
clear that if actual payments to people under the provincial formula fell short of expenditures that would
have been made under the federal formula, the funds
representing the difference would not be made payable
to the provincial government. It would cover as well
the undertaking to identify the nature of provincial participation in federal literature about the program. It
would also deal with the question of exchange of information between federal and provincial administrations, and with the amount of notice needed to implement
any changes in the provincial formula. These and other
financial and administrative matters would be incorporated in the agreement.

The federal government plans to proceed with its
Family Income Security Plan legislation at the current
Session of Parliament. The Bill as first introduced will
not, of course, include provision for the kind of flexibility
and adaptation to which I have referred. If, however, it
seems desirable, after consultation with the provinces,
the federal government would be prepared to recommend
to Parliament the amendment of the Bill, at the appropriate stage, in a manner to permit it to be implemented.

As you will appreciate, what is contemplated here is a
major adjustment in the federal approach to an important
income security payment established by Parliament more
than twenty-five years ago. It would introduce a degree
of flexibility in relation to provincial conditions that has
been hitherto unknown. It would permit provinces that
so wished to move toward an integrated system of family
allowances within their boundaries, while still maintaining certain general standards for payments to poorer
families. I realize that such arrangements, if based solely
upon revised federal legislation, would be as temporary
as any statute. The federal government would, however,
be prepared to contemplate a constitutional guarantee if
this seemed desirable.

Moreover, while the immediate federal proposal relates to the family allowance program, the principles
involved are clearly capable of extension to other income
support programs. Extension to such other areas would
involve complications in making generalized provisions
about the degree of provincial participation, minimum
standards, the relationship between programs and other

156

SENATE DEBATES

matters of that kind. While the difficulties are considerable, the federal government would be prepared to consider this kind of extension of the principles I am
proposing if a satisfactory constitutional basis can be
found and if it solved the problem of social security
which remained to be cleared up to permit further progress in the process of constitutional review.

DESIRABILITY 0F ESTABLISHING STANDING SENATE
COMMITTEE-MOTION IN AMENDMENT-SPEAKER'S
RULING ON POINT 0F ORDER

The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators, on
Tuesday, March 7 the honourable Senator Argue, pursuant to notice, moved as follows:
That in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in the
interest of both eastern and western agriculture, to
establish a Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider legisiation and other matters of concern to agriculture that may be referred to the said
committee by the Senate.
On Tuesday, March 14, in amendment, the honourable
Senator Lafond moved that Senator Argue's motion be
amended to read as follows:
That in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in
the interest of both eastern and western agriculture
and of consumers generally, to establish a Standing
Senate Committee on Agriculture and Consumer
Affairs to consider legislation and other matters of

SENATE DEBATES

concern to agriculture and to consumers that may be
referred to the said committee by the Senate.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Flynn) then rose on a point of order on the ground that
the amendment "brings in something which is outside the
purport of the main motion" and that it should not be
entertained.
I am grateful to the honourable senators who spoke on
the point of order. In my opinion, the motion as amended
is substantially different from the motion of which due
notice was given. It can only be introduced as a separate
and distinct motion after notice. The proposed standing
committee would have substantially different and considerably broader terms of reference if the amendment to
the motion were adopted in its present form.
In so stating, I am not expressing any view as to the
wisdom or desirability of the expanded committee proposed in the amendment. That decision would be for the
Senate itself if the question were properly before it. The
difficulty is procedural only.
I refer to the precedent of February 27, 1961, in the
House of Commons, when the then Deputy Speaker ruled
an amendment out of order on the ground that it "would
widen the powers of the committee and would extend the
scope of the matters to be considered by the committee,"
and that this was an attempt to "introduce a substantive
question which could be raised only after due notice." The
Deputy Speaker on that occasion was Jacques Flynn,
M.P., and his ruling was sustained on appeal to the house.
May I refer also to a ruling by Mr. Speaker Michener on
December 7, 1962. A motion was then under consideration, of which notice had been given, for the establishment
of a special committee to consider, inter alia, the "use of
drugs". To this Paul Martin, M.P., moved in amendment
that the words "and cost" be added after the word "use".
Mr. Speaker Michener in his decision said:
On the matter of whether this amendment can be
received at all, I would draw honourable members'
attention to Beauchesne's Fourth Edition, citation 291,
which reads as follows: "When the House is considering a motion, of which notice has been given, for the
appointment of a select committee, a member cannot
move in amendment that the committee be given
wider powers than those which were set down in the
notice."
And further on he added:
I could give the honourable member many more
citations and rulings by Speakers. There is one by Mr.
Speaker Macdonald which appears in Journals for
April 4, 1951, page 243. He ruled that "an amendment
cannot be moved giving the committee wider powers
than those which were set out in the Notice of
Motion."
The present amendment, which would add "consumer
affairs" to "agriculture" as part of the terms of reference
of the proposed committee, represents in my opinion a
more extreme case than any of those I have cited. It would
substantially widen the powers of the proposed committee, and for these reasons I have reached the conclusion
IThe Hon. the Speaker.]

March 16, 1972

that Senator Flynn's objection is well taken and I declare
the amendment out of order.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It was a sure bet!
MAIN MOTION-DEBATE RESUMED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 14, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Argue, that
in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in the interest
of both eastern and western agriculture, to establish a
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider
legislation and other matters of concern to agriculture
that may be referred to the said committee by the Senate.
Hon. Hervé J. Michaud: Honourable senators, the
motion which is now before this house proposing the
establishment of a standing committee on agriculture, is
one which deserves serious consideration. I wish to state
at this time that I endorse wholeheartedly what has been
said in support of that motion, by the mover, Senator
Argue, and the seconder, Senator Lafond. Senator Argue
in the course of his remarks in this house on March 10
stressed the point that agriculture, in Canada, is still of
major importance. In that respect, it would seem appropriate to quote the words recently uttered by John Moles,
General Manager of the Royal Winter Fair, regarding
agriculture:
* (1420)

How many realize that there is more horsepower
employed on Canadian farms than in Canadian industry, that farmers purchase nearly 30 per cent of the
fuel requirements in Canada, and nearly 40 per cent
of the tires and a similar percentage of iron and steel?
How many realize that agri-business, meaning the
total sector employed in food production, transportation and marketing, together with those industrial
complexes engaged in the manufacture of chemicals
for farm use, employ about 35 per cent of the total
Canadian labor force? In other words, one family in
three derives all or part of its income from
agriculture.
Yet, as emphasized by Senator Argue, Canadian agriculture is confronted by many major problems. Most of
these, undoubtedly, stem from the fact that much of the
poverty which exists in Canada is located in rural areas.
Data recently published by ARDA reveal some of the ugly
aspects of poverty in agricultural areas of Canada.
In order to establish the level of well-being of the population, ARDA applied in various rural census divisions in
Canada what it termed "social and economic indicators."
Those indicators, five in number, provided the following
information: First, there were 39 rural census divisions in
which more than 20 per cent of the population were functionally illiterate. Second, there were 24 census divisions
in which more than 20 per cent of the labour force were
unemployed. Third, there were 13 census divisions in
which 40 per cent or more of those working on farms,
including farm owners, were earning less than $2,500 a
year. Fourth, there were 41 census divisions in which over
50 per cent of wage earners working in small villages were
earning less than $3,000 a year. Fifth, there were two
census divisions-and this is of special significance to
me-in which over 50 per cent of wage earners in towns of

March 16, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

1,000 people or more were earning less than $2,000 per
year. Kent County, New Brunswick was one of the two
counties involved.
In passing, it is with reluctance that I must indicate that
not only did Kent County figure in the results ensuing
from the application of this fifth indicator, but it was also
one of the few census divisions in Canada which came
within the criteria of poverty as set out in all five social
and economic indicators applied by ARDA, as indicated
above.
The special problems facing agriculture across the
country commend themselves to consideration by a
Senate committee on agriculture before which evidence
could be given by all authorities.
[Translation]
Nowadays, the participation of those concerned is, in all
instances, recognized as the best means of reaching a
solution in any difficult situation. Within the rural community, this participation has prevailed for years thanks
to the co-operatives. Commandeur Alphonse Desjardins,
the great promoter of the co-operative movement as
represented by our caisses populaires, stated as early as
1910:
Ever-increasing centralization is now leading us
towards social unrest and unemployment. Capital is
tapped from small industrial centres and rural communities and funnelled into larger centres. In a few
years from now, when the smaller communities and
rural areas have been financially drained, they will
then lose their human resources. Then we will have
overcrowded cities, unemployment, social unrest.
Isn't that what happened? Governments, both federal
and provincial, and this also applies to the Senate, must
therefore be prepared to support the efforts of the farmers of Canada even more vigorously than in the past, in
their co-operative efforts to solve their many problems.
Moreover, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Right Honourable Mr. Trudeau, when addressing the Coopérative
Fédérée de Québec in Montreal on February 1972,
expressed himself as follows:
The representative nature of the co-operative is
undeniable. The founders of your movement and their
successors were aware that co-operation conformed
to a Quebec tradition of mutual aid and community
initiative. Your movement has characteristics that are
highly esteemed. Community concern for the
individual is one. As members of a co-operative, your
first regard is for justice towards others, thus your
greatest strength is a moral one. The co-operative
movement may also be identified with the democratic
ideal of participation.
The required effort must be made by all, to restore to
agriculture its fitting role in the country's economy. The
farmer has too long been abandoned, left to face on his
own competition and exploitation. This must be remedied
through better planning both of production of farm products and in their marketing in every aspect. A standing
committee on agriculture, such as Senator Argue has
proposed, would assist members of the Senate in the
development of the programs which are imperative in this

field.
[English]
* (1430)

More and more, in the years that lie ahead, efforts will
have to be made to ensure a better economic balance
between the rural and the urban populations of the country. As stated by the Right Reverend H. L. Nutter, Bishop
of Fredericton, at a meeting of the United Appeal on
February 16, 1962:
People generally should realize that the individual is
still of ultimate importance in our society ... that
society has a responsibility to the individual ... and
that there must be a responsible use of both physical
and human resources.
Bishop Nutter added:
If the present values of education are maintained
we will be laying the seeds of destruction of our social
system. Children should be trained for entry into a
different kind of life ... not just training them to get a
job.
Then in November 1971 Mr. Harvey Scott of the Maritime Cooperative Services, speaking to delegates at the
annual meeting of the New Brunswick Federation of
Agriculture, had this to say:
People involved in agriculture will require the support of the agri-business community, the governments
and the public at large to mount the necessary supplymarketing

programs

...

The general public must

come to realize that agriculture is the nation's greatest
industry. Agri-business has proved to be the nation's
greatest source of wealth ... However, the farmer has
not shared in the benefits of his improved efficiency
to anything like the same degree as a non-farm person
... This disparity in benefits is a major social and
economic dilemma today, creating an inequity that
cannot continue in a just society ... Co-operatives can
help provide the farmer with the muscle and information he needs to make economic production decisions
and general trade policies.
In the course of this process, honourable senators, the
farmer's need for information has never been more
urgent. As noted in the Globe and Mail of May 20, 1971,
under the caption "Report and Business":
Farmer's business has grown much more complex,
and to keep pace with the fast-changing agricultural
industry he must have all the production and marketing advice he can get.
Governments, universities and commercial supply
companies are constantly developing new products,
production practices and marketing techniques, but
there is increasing evidence that much of the information they generate is not filtering back to farmers.
The report continues:
Much of this information is carried by the farm
press, radio and television, and studies in both the
United States and Canada show that farmers most
often hear about a new practice from the mass media.
But when it comes ta adopting that practice, it is a
different story. At that point the farmer wants
detailed information from a personal source such as a

SENATE DEBATES

neighbour, a government extension man, or a local
elevator agent.
All this can be achieved in one way only, and that is by
more personal contacts between farmers and government
representatives, legislators, extension service men, all of
whom, in the past, have not maintained sufficient contacts
with the farming population, as pointed out in that report
in the Globe and Mail. In agriculture, as in every other
field of human activity, greater emphasis in the matter of
personal human relationship has therefore become a prerequisite to any successful endeavour. In this respect, as
everywhere else, "participation" has become the password to all meaningful contribution. A Senate committee
on agriculture, such as is proposed at this time, would
facilitate that participation on the part of the members of
the Senate in the agricultural sector of the Canadian
economy.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, in addition to the reasons brought
forward in support of setting up a standing committee on
agriculture, I should like to mention another measure of
prime importance in that regard, precisely because of the
considerable impact it would have on the future of
agriculture in Canada. As you may have guessed, I refer
to the small farms development program as announced by
the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. H. A. Olson. In this connection, let us hear once again what the Prime Minister,
the Right Honourable Mr. Trudeau, had to say on February 2, 1972 in his speech to the Coopérative Fédérée de
Québec. I quote:
When we formed the government, we faced another
major problem, that of the transformation of rural
society, based in the past on the small farm concept.
The fact is that the small farm, even with mechanization, is becoming less and less profitable. Technology
and irresistible economic pressures demand land
areas much larger than those that supported the oldtime farmer. Lacking capital (which he needs more
than manpower), the farmer is often unable to adapt
to the system; isolated and reduced to poverty, he
must, in spite of his deep love for the land, sell it on
unfavourable terms and move to an urban environment for which he is unprepared. The rural exodus
too often involves farmers who feel a deep sense of
tragedy in having to quit their larkd. These are unhappy experiences that can be avoided.
The first aim of our small farms development program announced in December is to give small farmers
who want to remain on the farm the means to develop
a profitable enterprise. From the outset, it is obvious
that our policy greatly favours the family unit, the
best way in most cases to operate a farm. Family
operation is readily adaptable to farm industrialization; it lends itself well to different forms of co-operation. For example, the co-operative movement possesses
an economic
efficiency comparable
to
corporate farming enterprises. Even if some concentrations are inevitable in the farm sector, fortunately
agriculture is capable of maintaining its innate
humanity without sacrificing production. We consider
this unique quality of the agricultural community a
valuable asset, an important element of social stability
[Hon. Mr. Michaudd

March 16, 1972

and a great cultural advantage. On the other hand,
many farmers want to leave the land and others, the
victims of merciless selection, are forced to leave,
however regrettable that may be. It is impossible to
stop the rural exodus completely but, in so far as it is
inevitable, it can be made more humane; that is a
complementary objective of the small farms development program. Under this program, persons forced to
sell will sell to their advantage enabling them to retire
with self-respect and, if they so desire, to keep a
parcel of land and their home. Furthermore, it will be
possible to use the property acquired under the program to set up reserves of desirable farmland which
can be used to enlarge small family holdings and
establish them on a firmer footing. In this way considerable stretches of land can be returned to their
proper use. This program is a significant step towards
furthering social justice.
The Senate must, therefore, take the necessary steps in
order to play a primary role in the new orientation to be
given Canadian agriculture. The Senate cannot play that
role without endowing itself with the required tools. A
Senate committee, along the lines suggested by Senator
Argue, would provide those tools. I am therefore happy to
support the motion of Senator Argue.
[English]
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, debate adjourned.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO EXAMINE AND REPORT ON
CANADIAN RELATIONS WITH EXPANDED EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Aird that the Standing
Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs be authorized to
examine and report on Canadian relations with the
expanded European Communities.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I think
there will be general agreement that Senator Aird's
motion is both logical and timely. Senator Aird, Senator
Connolly and Senator O'Leary have put before you the
broad facts and figures that indicate the dimensions of
the market involved as well as some of the problems
associated with it. Those facts and figures speak for
themselves.
In its last two inquiries the Standing Senate Committee
on Foreign Affairs looked first to the south, making a
report on our relations with the Caribbean, and then to
the west, examining our relationships with the countries
of the Pacific rim. The report on the Pacific rim is now in
the hands of the printers and will, I believe, be presented
for your consideration next week.
Senator Aird's motion now suggests that we look to the
east in order to consider Canada's relationships with a
large trading block of some 50 nations situated across the
Atlantic. I imagine that in due course we will turn our
attention as well to the north to consider our relationship
with Russia. No doubt we will carry on some of the
contacts already so well made by honourable senators
under the auspices of, and in accordance with the

March 16, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

arrangements made by His Honour, Speaker Deschatelets. Perhaps also in due course we will look again to the
south in the hope of examining from our point of view our
relationships with the United States, thereby carrying on
and complementing the very fine work performed by
many of our colleagues who are members of the Canadian-American group.
It is a truism to say that all of these studies are indications of the fact that Canadians today are becoming outward looking as never before in the history of this country. It is equally true to say that we have become outward
looking because we have no alternative. There is no alternative in a world characterized above all else by rapid
change. Today there is rapid change in trading relations
and there is rapid change in the economic sphere, the
social sphere and the technological sphere.
The enlarged or expanded European Common Market
is very much a part of that rapid change. The Common
Market is a very different structure from what it used to
be, and its impact on Canada is very different from what
it was according to the original conception of that market.
We used to think of the market in terms of the original
six countries which got together to form it. Now, with the
almost immediate entry of the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Denmark and Norway, some people speak of it today as
the "ten." But I suggest that this would be a misnomer,
and completely inadequate to indicate the real size and
importance of the so-called European Common Market,
because, as I said a moment ago, it involves at least 50
nations. The Common Market is on the point of completing special trading arrangements with the four remaining
members of the European Free Trade Association. Moreover, it has also established as associates in the community some 36 other nations found largely in the Mediterranean area and in Africa.
* (1450)

This new, enlarged market will account for about onequarter of the total trade of the world. The implications to
Canada, to whom export trade access to the markets of
the world is more vital than it is to any other country, are
obvious. They are even more so when we recall the alarming fact that Canada is the only industrialized country in
the world that will not have automatic free access to a
domestic consumer market of at least 100 million people.
The United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, even India
and China have such domestic markets. These 50 other
nations have created their own market of much more than
100 million people. So, Canada stands alone and isolated
in the world. The question is: What are we going to do
about it? This is one part of the larger question that I
believe the committee, if the Senate approves, will be
studying and, it is hoped, to which the committee will find
answers.
It is not my intention to attempt to anticipate the
answers that the committee might find to some of these
questions, but even a superficial study of the matter
before us in this motion raises some interesting, bewildering and almost terrifying questions. The first, the most
obvious and perhaps the simplest is how are we going to
adjust to the entry of the United Kingdom into the European Common Market. It seems to me that concern in
Canada today is less agitated than it was six years ago
25312-11

when the entry of the United Kingdom into the market
seemed imminent. There are several reasons for that.
One, of course, as has been mentioned, is that during the
sixties our exports to the United Kingdom market
dropped drastically from 17 per cent of our export dollar
volume to less than 10 per cent today. Our exports to the
European Community generally have increased, and it is
now our third market. But one of the problems we face, of
course, is that our track record in that market has been
very, very disappointing. It is true that we have increased
our exports to that market, but the percentage of increase
has not grown at anything like the comparative rate of
growth of the market itself.
So, honourable senators, we have to ask ourselves why.
Why have we fallen behind in this as in so many other
markets of the world? We have to ask ourselves seriously
where the fault lies. Does it lie with public policy? Have
we had the wrong trade policies? Have we had the wrong
foreign policies, the wrong tariff policies, the wrong competition policies or the wrong labour policies? We don't
know.
Does the fault lie with the private sector? Have we had a
lack of entrepreneurship, a lack of enterprise on world
markets on the part of Canadian firms? I would say that
the evidence already given to some of our committees,
and I have in mind our Science Policy Committee as well
as other committees, would seem to indicate clearly that
we are away behind the rest of the world in our private
sector entrepreneurship. The reason generally given is
that our industries have grown up behind a protective
wall, that we have become lazy and that we have lacked
initiative and lacked the innovative marketing skills
which other nations have developed so spectacularly. I
feel we have to look to both the private and the public
sectors if we are to find the answers necessary for coming
to grips with the problems raised by the enlargement of
this market.
Another kind of question that will probably face the
committee is whether Britain's entry into the EEC may
not of itself be a good thing from the Canadian point of
view. Britain with its long traditions and understanding of
the universal benefits of free trade would, we hope, bring
to the policies, structures and programs of that market a
more outward-looking philosophy of trade and other relationships than it has had to date. There have been some
encouraging signs in policy developments of the market in
the last few years with the result that the market is today
rather less inward looking than it was a few years ago. A
factor which tends to support that is the expansion of
relationships with countries not fully members of the
market.
The question is raised too as to whether we may not
have here an interesting repetition of part of our history.
We all remember that one of the anomalies of our economic history was the fact that we legislated what were
obviously anti-American protective policies. I am now
referring to the general raising of a protective tariff wall
which American enterprise very ikillfully turned to its
own advantage. We raised a wall to try to keep American
industry out of Canada, but the Americans came in
behind that wall and behind the Commonwealth preferential wall and established subsidiary plants, and at the

SENATE DEBATES

same time satisfied one of their basic requirements which
was for a continuing supply of raw material. They killed
two birds with one stone and turned a very difficult and
disadvantageous situation into one that has benefited
them to the extent that they have now taken over a large
part of our economy. One wonders whether with some
enterprise we could not repeat that to our own advantage
in the European Market. Perhaps the committee should
look at this possibility. It will certainly be drawn to their
attention. They could look at the possibility of Canadian
business firms establishing plants and subsidiaries in the
United Kingdom, getting in behind the wall and obtaining
a convenient kind of entry to that market, just as the
Americans were able by their enterprise-and no one can
blame them-to gain access to our market and to the
Commonwealth market generally.
However, honourable senators, there are some silver
linings to the clouds. The impact of the United Kingdom
entry in terms of production and Canadian jobs is not
quite as serious as it appeared to be on first analysis six or
seven years ago. It is true that up until Britain's entry into
the market, some 94 per cent of our products entered the
United Kingdom free, and this will probably drop to
something like 36 per cent. Unfortunately, some of these
products are in highly sensitive economic areas. The latest
estimate I have seen is that the community's Common
Economic Tariff (CET) and Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) will, in one way or another, still affect to some
extent about 70 per cent of our product exports to the
United Kingdom market.
a (1500)

However, as I have said, there are some silver linings.
For example, our wheat exports will not be completely
affected because, fortunately, the British housewife has
developed a taste for bread made from hard wheat flour.
Apparently it is not possible to grow this hard wheat in
any of the EEC countries. So long as the British prefer
toast and marmalade for breakfast, the chances are that
our wheat exports will not be gravely affected, at least not
immediately.
When we look at the problem of our trade isolation, we
certainly have to ask ourselves: Can we survive? Can we
continue in this isolation? Can we be an industrial nation
without free and automatic access to a market of more
than twenty million people? If we cannot, what are the
alternatives? I should imagine this will come to the attention of our committee as we examine our relationship
with the EEC countries. We will find perhaps patterns of
economic union to which we may have to give serious
consideration.
We shall have to ask ourselves whether we should now
be thinking of negotiating special trade arrangements
such as those enjoyed by the EFTA countries. If we do not
have special trade arrangements such as this, are we
going to be able to penetrate this huge market which is
one-quarter of the world market? We shall have to look at
the course that has been taken by the 36 other nations
which have indicated their intention to be associate members. We shall have to ask ourselves if this is the course we
may have to follow? Some of the Commonwealth countries have already taken this course. It is not always
[Hon Mr. Grosart.J

March 16, 1972

realized that some of the associate nations in the EEC are
Commonwealth countries.
We shall also have to look at more terrifying alternatives. The most terrifying, from the point of view of future
world trade, is the threatened trade polarity between the
EEC countries and the United States, the two great trading blocs that are possibly on the verge of all-out trade
war. On which side shall we be, or shall we be on any
side? Shall we be the traditional innocent bystander who
gets hurt more than either of the belligerents? Should we
look to the western hemisphere bloc if it develops-and it
may. Again, where do we stand?
One of my distinguished colleagues called attention to
the great British tradition of splendid isolation. I think it
was Sir George Foster who originally used this phrase. It
is, of course, a very glorious page in Britain's history.
However, it is doubtful that splendid isolation in the trading world as we know it today and which we shall face in
the next few years would rate a similar glorious page in
our history. We may find ourselves with no other alternative but to say there is going to be a western hemisphere
bloc which will be largely dominated by the United States
and we had better join them because we cannot lick them.
Honourable senators, these are some of the global questions, apart from the nuts and bolts of product by product
figures that I am sure our committee will have to look
into. I respectfully suggest that this is a thoroughly appropriate inquiry for a parliamentary committee. When we
examine the evidence which exists around the world
today, and if that evidence means anything to us, the
answers will be found in new, imaginative, and innovative
public policies. I hope I shall not be accused of being
partisan when I say that at the present we do not have
that kind of innovative, imaginative trade policy which in
any way matches similar trade policies of other countries.
We do not have the kind of answers to these problems
which have been developed in Japan, Sweden, or
Switzerland.
The time has come for us to stop talking about our small
domestic market. It is a joke in Europe; it is a joke in
Switzerland; it is a joke in Sweden. These countries are
aware that our domestic market is twice the size of theirs,
and that we are next door to the most dynamic market in
the world. These nations are selling products on that
market which we are producing here in Canada, but are
not able to compete.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am sure my honourable friend would
not overlook the statistic that 85 per cent of our manufactured goods are sold in the very market about which
Senator Grosart is speaking.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I hope the Leader of the Government
will not mind my saying that that is exactly the kind of
answer which seems to inhibit those innovative and
imaginative policies. It would not matter in the least if we
sold 100 per cent of our exported manufactured goods in
that market. It would not matter at all. That is not the
question. It is a question of the totality of those sales. It is
true that of our total sales abroad 85 per cent of the
manufactured products exported are sold on the American market.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: And at the highest price.

March 16, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Grosart: It is absolutely meaningless to make
that comment because you are speaking of 85 per cent-of
what? You are speaking of 85 per cent of an inadequate
total of sales abroad.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I was attempting to relate my statement of fact to what Senator Grosart said regarding the
sale from Scandinavian countries to the United States,
implying that they alone were really pre-empting that
market which, of course, is not the case.
* (1510)

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Again, of course, that is not what I
said. I did not say they are pre-empting the market. I
merely said they are selling products which we produce in
Canada in that market, and are not able to sell at the same
competitive level.
I started to say, and will repeat, that we do not have the
type of government trade policies that have made it possible for those countries with smaller domestic markets
than ours to pass us as some of them have, and all of them
will soon, even in per capita income. That is the situation.
I do not blame any one government. We have been moving
into this situation as a result of general public and private
sector inertia over a long period of time. It is true that in
the last few years there have been some useful initiatives
on the part of the government. I am sorry to say that they
are ad hoc, unco-ordinated and not as effective as they
could be, and on another occasion I will produce facts and
figures to support this contention. In fact, one of our
committees has produced a rather better answer to this
whole problem than the present policy of the government.
That, of course, is the function of the committee. No one
should take offence if a Senate committee suggests that
there can be important changes in government policy. If
that be the case and offence is taken at such findings by a
committee, then we waste our time appointing the
committees.
I wish to stress that the problem which faces us in
relation to the European Community is that political decisions have been made by other nations. These political
decisions, good from their point of view, have created our
problem. I suggest that the committee will find that at
least a very large part of the answer will be in matching
those decisions with realistic political decisions in
Canada. They will have to be courageous decisions,
because surely when we look back at the history of the
development of the EEC we must be impressed by the
courage necessary to bring those nations together after
hundreds or thousands of years during which they have
been apart and at each other's throat. They have now
been brought together in a community. It is a tremendous
achievement, a political achievement and I suggest that
we must match it with similarly innovative and imaginative public policy decisions on our side.
Honourable senators, for these and other reasons I support Senator Aird's motion. As deputy chairman of the
committee I also support his suggestion that the Senate
might approve the motion today if no other senator
wishes to speak to it. This would enable the committee to
proceed with its work immediately, on Tuesday, when I
understand the Honourable Mitchell Sharp has consented
to give the committee the benefit of his experience and
25312-1iM

163

good judgment, which would get our work off to a good
start.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, I
rise to take part in this debate for several reasons.
Although I am not a member of the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would certainly like to be
but that is not possible at this time.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You can work harder.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Over the past several years I have
had the opportunity of visiting many parts of Europe,
especially those within the Common Market and other
parts which are now about to join. In view of those experiences and the opportunities I have had to discuss the
European Economic Community, both in Canada and
abroad, I wish to make a short contribution to this
discussion.
I agree with Senator Grosart that the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs, under the able chairmanship of Senator Aird-and with Senator Grosart himself
as deputy chairman-has made a great contribution to
Canada and to those parts of the world, namely, the
Caribbean and the Pacific rim, in the two studies the
committee has already made. No doubt the studies to
commence at an early date with respect to our relationships with the European Economic Community will also
be of great benefit, not only to Canada but to Europe.
I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate all
members of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign
Affairs for the excellent job they have done, and which I
expect will continue during the new study.
I was rather surprised when I listened to Senator Grosart today, and, to his seatmate, Senator O'Leary, yesterday. I believe that if they were to read each other's speech
they would find the answers to most of the problems they
posed. Senator Grosart today informed us of the problems we face in increasing our trade with Europe, or the
failures of the Canadian people to take full advantage of
the improved market situation in Europe. Yesterday
Senator O'Leary answered that question. I refer to his
remarks at page 149 of the Senate Debates of yesterday,
as follows:
I was astonished to hear Senator Aird, in the course
of his speech, supporting the viewpoint we hear so
often that Canada must have a countervailing force in
Europe against possible absorption, economically and
otherwise, by the United States.
Why did we not have this trade with the European
Economic Community last year? Why did we not have
it the year before? It is said that the United States is
forcing Canadians to become hewers of wood and
drawers of water. That is not so. The nations that are
doing that are in Europe, members of the European
Economic Community. In the last three or four years
they have purchased practically none of our processed goods. The goods which create jobs for Canadians have gone to the United Statesand so on. This is very true, and one of the reasons that 85
per cent of our trade is with the United States andHon. Mr. Grosart: It is not 85 per cent, but 70 per cent.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. McDonald: Well, you can argue that. It is not
because of tariff protection in Europe. The tariff on
manufactured goods in the European Economic Community is lower than that on manufactured goods in the
United States and Britain.
S(1520)

One of the reasons why we are unable to sell many of
our goods and services to Europe is found in the prevailing economic conditions and the standard of living in
Europe, which is extremely low compared to that of
Canada, or indeed the North American continent. If we
were prepared to sell to Europe, at low prices or in some
instances at lower prices, some of the goods and services
which are today going to the United States, certainly we
could increase our trade. But we have never been inclined
to do that, and I do not expect that we ever shall.
If Europe remained a conglomerate of small, independent, poor nations, we would never be able to penetrate
that market. But that is not the situation today. Europe is
binding herself not only to an economic union but also to
a monetary and political union, and I predict the day
when the phrase coined by the late Sir Winston Churchill,
"The United States of Europe," will become a reality.
Anyone who has had the opportunity of visiting Western
Europe since the end of World War II has seen greater
growth in that area of the world than perhaps anywhere
else. From 1945 to 1965 the gross national product of
Western Europe doubled, representing greater growth
than in any other area. I am not in possession of up-todate figures, but I venture to suggest that the GNP of
Western Europe has again doubled since 1965, and is
today about 50 per cent of that of the United States.
Western Europe has made great progress. The standard
of living bas increased beyond all hopes and expectations.
Wage scales for Western Europe have increased by leaps
and bounds. They have almost doubled, and are almost
double that of wage scales in Britain.
Senator O'Leary, in the course of his speech yesterday,
wondered out loud why so many Britons wanted to join
the Common Market. One reason is to increase their
standard of living. Since 1945, real wages in Western
Europe, taking into account inflation, have increased by
an average of 40 per cent. In Britain over the same period
real wages have increased by only 20 per cent. In other
words, had Britain experienced the same increase as that
applying to the continent, the average British worker's
weekly earnings would be about five pounds more than he
now receives.
Senator O'Leary referred to the fact that Britain's
endeavour to join the Common Market had fluctuated
over the past several years, that on occasion there was
considerable hesitation about whether or not she should
join. Finally, Britain reached a conclusion and said-I will
use Senator O'Leary's own words-"We will enter the
European Common Market or bust. We must get in."
Either Britain joins the Common Market or she will go
broke. She has no alternative. Senator Grosart said that
Canada was one of the few nations in the world who had
access to a market of less than 100 million people. Great
Britain has access to a market of only half that number,
unless she joins the European Economic Community. I
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 16, 1972

suggest that she cannot survive unless she joins, and I say
that she will.
What is happening in Europe today in peacetime is what
on two occasions the German empire attempted but failed
to do by force. Had Germany been successful in either
World War I or World War II, Europe would now be united
under her domination. However, I suggest that Germany
is accomplishing much the same thing in Europe today,
but she is doing it by peaceful means.
Britain fought those two world wars to save herself, and
she will enter a united Europe in order to save herself.
The day will come in the not too distant future when we
shall have not only a trading union in Western Europe but
also common monetary and common fiscal policies. Some
day there may well be a federal Parliament administering
the affairs of Western Europe, and Sir Winston Churchill's prediction of a "United States of Europe" will come
true.
What does all this mean to Canada? Some people are of
the opinion that Britain's entry into the European Economic Community could be a catastrophe for Canada. I
do not believe that. We shall have some short-run problems. The fact that we are a member of the British Commonwealth and have had preferential access to the British
market has not in many instances solved our problems.
The fact that we are associated with the British Commonwealth has not solved our agricultural problems. Far from
it. It bas not solved our problems in the pulp industry.
I suggest that once Britain joins the European Economic Community, with the expertise that she can bring to
Europe in the management of its economy, its fiscal and
monetary policies, together with her expertise in government, the standard of living in Europe will increase to the
point where we shall be able to sell to Europe our highly
sophisticated and expensive products on a scale never
dreamed of.
Senator O'Leary mentioned that last year Canada sold
approximately $14 million worth of barley to the United
Kingdom. My figures are not quite the same; they show
that we sold something in excess of $29 million worth of
barley to the United Kingdom.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What is your source?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: My source is the Annual Report of
the Canadian Wheat Board. Our sale of barley to Britain
could be subject to a tariff if Britain joins the European
Economic Community. But how much barley did we sell
to Italy last year? We sold more than we sold to the United
Kingdom. How much did we sell to Germany? We sold
almost the same amount that we sold to the United
Kingdom.
I am suggesting that a United Kingdom market of 55
million people for Canadian barley is peanuts when considering a potential market of almost 300 million people. It
is access to that market of 300 million people that I am
interested in, because our sales to Britain over the years
have not been too significant. In the crop year 1950-51 we
sold the magnificent sum of 160,000 bushels of barley to
Britain. That was the low point. We got up to about 41
million bushels in 1958-59. The moral of the story is that
despite the fact that as a member of the British Commonwealth we have preferential tariffs with Britain, when

March 16, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Britain can buy barley for a lower price from another
source, whether inside or outside the British Commonwealth, she will do so. The British are one of the greatest
trading peoples on earth. They have lived by their wits for
generations, and I suggest to you they will continue to do
so. For those reasons I say that we must look to markets
where we can sell far in excess of what we sell to Britain.
* (1530)

Honourable senators, I sometimes wonder just where
we are heading unless we gain access to world markets
which have been closed to us in years gone by. At the end
of the 1970-71 crop year, Canada had 233 million bushels
of barley in storage. The minister responsible for the
Canadian Wheat Board is now telling farmers of western
Canada that they should seed about 15 million acres to
barley for the next crop year. Each acre yields 50 bushels,
so 15 million acres will yield some 750 million bushels. By
adding the present carryover of 233 million bushels, you
get a total of 983 million bushels. Then subtract about 300
million bushels, which represents the average Canadian
consumption for all purposes-human consumption, loss
in handling, feeding of livestock. In other words, from a
total of 983 million bushels we will dispose of about 300
million bushels in Canada, resulting in a new carryover of
about 600 million bushels.
Last year we exported about 172 million bushels of
barley to world markets, and this year our exports are
running about the same. Overseas clearances on barley as
of March 1, 1972, amounted to 94.4 million bushels, and on
the same date last year they amounted to 95 million
bushels.
If the farmers of western Canada follow the advice of
the minister, we will end up with a carryover of something
in excess of 500 million bushels of barley by July 31 next.
We will not get rid of this by selling $29 million worth to
the United Kingdom. We must sell to the masses of the
world. Even if we provided Britain with all her barley
requirements, it would amount to peanuts when compared to the barley production of Saskatchewan alone.
To repeat what I said earlier, I am convinced that there
is only one way that the people of Western Europe can
buy goods and services from Canada. They must increase
their standard of living to the point where they can afford
to pay for the sophisticated and expensive articles produced on this continent. I do not believe we have any
alternative today but to search for markets throughout
the world. This can be done by making the moves that the
government has been making over the last several months
in bettering our relations with the People's Republic of
China. In other words, we cannot confine our search for
markets solely to Western Europe. If we could sell barley
to 800 million Chinese, we could use up the huge quantities we are producing and have been producing in western
Canada.
We must make every effort to trade with other nations
in the world if we are going to survive, but certain Canadian products are more difficult to sell outside the North
American market. The reason, of course, is that people in
other parts of the world simply do not have sufficient
income to afford these items. How many of you when on
official visits to Europe have taken the time to ask a
secretary working for a foreign government how much

money she earns? Have you ever asked how much the
local taxi driver earns, or the local shopkeeper, or the
small businessman? Their income is less than half that
earned by their counterparts in Canada. That being so,
they simply cannot afford to buy the sophisticated products we manufacture in this country.
By the same token, how can we increase our trade with
countries in Western Europe when in many instances
those countries do not produce for export goods that are
sought by North Americans? They do not produce these
goods because they do not have a home market for them.
But all this is changing. The change that has taken place
in the last 14 years has been so great that I believe in
another 10 to 15 years we will be able to sell to those
markets the sophisticated goods and services we are now
producing.
For these reasons I fully support the entry of the United
Kingdom into the European Common Market. It will be
her salvation, and, through her, it will be our salvation.
Unless Britain enters, Canada as well as Britain will be in
serious trouble.
It is my hope that the committee, as a result of its study
of Canada's relations with the expanded European Communities, will make recommendations that will be adopted by our government, recommendations that will help
bring about the economic development of Western Europe
and hasten the day when Canadians can enter the European Market on a scale never dreamt of, something which
has not been possible throughout history but will be in the
not too distant future.
Motion agreed to.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
PROPOSED STUDY BY COMMITTEE OF
LABOUR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTES AFFECTING PUBLIC
SERVICES-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of honourable Senator Haig that the
Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science be instructed to examine and report upon the
efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about
the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public services.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I rise with
some reluctance today, partly because I have been heard
far too much, in my opinion, recently, and also because
one of our most experienced colleagues said to me the
other day in gloomy tones, "You are too wordy." However,
in view of the fact that for 27 years I was a trade union
official, I felt I could not allow this occasion to pass
without saying something. There are not many members
of this house who have had similar experience. In fact, I
think it is safe to say that the number of trade union
officials or ex-trade union officials in this house is pretty
small; I should think half a dozen would be a generous
estimate. I have not gone through the Parliamentary
Guide and examined the record in detail, but I think that
is a safe statement. I therefore felt that I must say something on the subject.

SENATE DEBATES

* (1540)

I propose to be very brief this afternoon and, if I may, to
adjourn the debate and add a little something further on
some matters of detail next week, on which occasion I
promise to be brief also.
I favour this motion. I favour the precise terms of this
motion and I should like to emphasize to honourable
senators what those precise terms are:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science be instructed to examine and
report upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting
public services.
I emphasize the words "efficiency," "federal," "settlement" and "public services." I do so because it seems to
me that the proposed terms of reference of this inquiry
deal with a rather special and limited problem, or series
or group of problems.
Certain honourable senators who have spoken on this
motion have gone rather farther afield. I should not go so
far as to say that they have surveyed mankind from China
to Peru, but in my judgment they have certainly gone
distinctly beyond the ambit of the precise terms of the
motion. I venture to think that in some instances it might
have been better if they had adhered more closely to the
proposed terms of reference, more especially because
some of the speeches, to my mind, suggested some rather
strong preconceived ideas on this subject. I think that is
perhaps unfortunate.
I liked very much the emphasis, both of the mover and
seconder of the motion, on the fact that the motion simply
asks for examination and report, and does not undertake,
in effect, to tell the committee what it should report. But
when it came to some of the speeches-and I think there
was a trace of it in Senator Buckwold's speech-there was
a little bit of a tendency to do what the late the Honourable Maurice Duplessis did when he appointed the Royal
Commission on Constitutional Problems, the Tremblay
Commission. The statute providing for the appointment
of that commission had a tremendous list of whereases,
and by the time the list of whereases was concluded it was
perfectly evident that the royal commission in question
had been given very precise instructions what its answers
were to be.
In some of the speeches made on this subject, whether
in the debate on the Address or in the debate on the
motion itself, it seemed to me that there was just a tinge of
an intention on the part of some of those who spoke to
give the committee instructions to come down with a
report which would suggest some pretty marked differences from existing legislation. I do not believe that is
what the motion says, and I do not think it is what the
committee ought to do.
This is an inquiry, if of course the motion passes, which
will need to be conducted with great caution and an
extraordinary effort at objectivity, partly because we
have in this chamber so few people with very much direct
experience of the labour movement on the labour side. I
suppose I may be guilty myself of some déformation
professionnelle, some parti pris, some bias here, resulting
[Hon. Mr Forsey.1

March 16, 1972

from my long association with the labour movement. But
I do not think people with that bias are particularly
numerous in this chamber. I believe there are certain
members who might, with some degree of justice, be
considered to have a bias, a déformation professionnelle,
a parti pris, on the other side, and I think they are rather
more numerous.
I do not wish to subscribe at all to the indiscriminate
allegations made in certain quarters that this chamber is
made up exclusively of tycoons, big business people, representatives of big interests and that kind of thing. I do
say, however, that certain employing interests are, on the
whole, better represented here than the interests on the
opposite side, and that is why it seems to me we should
observe especial caution and make a particular effort to
have a very objective, careful, thorough examination of
this whole subject that is suggested for examination by
the committee.
We should be particularly careful about listening, really
listening. I remember when I was running for the City
Council in Montreal, nearly everybody started his
remarks with the word "Listen," and practically nobody
ever did. On one occasion, a colleague who was engaging
in a discussion with one of the other people concerned
said, "Look, So-and-So, will you just please really listen to
what I am saying, because I am convinced that you agree
with me if you would only listen. But I do not think you
are listening. Now, will you please really listen." The other
man laughed and said, "Very well, I will try," and he did.
Then he remarked, "Well, that is what I have been saying
all along."
Sometimes it is necessary to do more than listen with
one's physical ears. It is necessary to listen intensely with
one's mind, even when the people who are giving the
evidence may be people with whom one finds oneself in
imperfect sympathy. There is the old legal maxim, "Hear
the other side," which I think should be very carefully
observed by this committee, as indeed by al] committees,
but perhaps especially in this case. We must avoid the
attitude of the probably apocryphal Irish magistrate who
said he never listened to the defence, he found it confused
him. Or the attitude of a certain Quebec judge of yesteryear, as recounted to me by my late friend R. L. Calder,
K.C., who said that when a prisoner was brought before
this jurist, accused of some crime and pleaded not guilty,
the judge would put on his glasses, look at the prisoner
over his glasses, shake his head and say, "If you were not
guilty, you would not be here." We want to avoid that
attitude.
The reason I mention that is because I have on several
occasions in the past appeared before Senate committees
where there was a tendency by certain senators, now long
gone to their reward, to take that attitude. If they saw a
trade union witness there was a tendency, as far as I could
see at the time, to say, "These blankety blank blank
so-and-sos. This is where we get a chance to get our own
back at them. They are desperadoes, conspirators, malefactors. Now we are going to tell them for once just where
they get off."
(1550)

The degree of relevancy of some of the questions, it
seemed to me, was slight, to put it mildly. Therefore, we

March 16, 1972

DEBATES
Marc 16,1972SENATE

need ta make a special effort in this case flot ta prejudge
the issue, even in the speeches which are made on the
motion now befare us.
Honaurable senators, there are two other things I want
ta add at present. One is that if this subject is to be
properly examined by this cornrittee, it rnay be necessary
to make some small changes in the mernbership of the
cornrittee. This sounds very disrespectful ta the existing
mem bers of the cammittee, and I hope it will flot in fact be
sa interpreted. 1 rnerely wish ta paint out that, an examining the rnerbership of the cammittee, it seems to me there
are few people an it who have had very rnuch experience
of industrial relations, at ail events on the labour side. It is
really indispensable that there should be sorne people on
that committee wha have had such experience, ar who at
least have had experience in an impartial capacity in
labour disputes.
If any one thinks that at this marnent I arn, as we used
ta say in the Methadist church, preaching far a caîl, I can
assure hirn that he is vastly mistaken. The people I arn
thinking of as indispensable members of a camrnittee to
conduct this inquiry are my honaurable friend, Senatar
Goldenberg, and my honourable friend, Senator Lawson.
Hon. Mr. Argue: You will probably be asked ta be a
member anyway.
Han. Mr. Forsey: I might appear on occasion and listen,
and possibly put rny aar in. Several honaurable senatars
wha have spaken on this subject have been kind enaugh
ta suggest that I have had a gaad deal of experience in
this field. I arn sarry ta say they are quite mistaken. I do
flot suppose that aver the whole of my career in the trade
union mavement, 27 years, I spent mare than about three
hours, all tald, in the negatiatian af disputes. That is a
very generaus estimate; I should almost be inclined ta say
that yau cauld put all my experience on the sharp end af a
pin and have plenty of rorn left for manaeuvre. Sa I arn
flot anxious to be a member af this cornmittee-far from
it. I have quite enough ta do as it is. But 1 do think that it
wauld be absolutely indispensable ta this inquiry ta have
available ta the committee on its mernbership-not simply
as people comning in fram outside the carnmittee-people
like Senator Galdenberg and Senator Lawson. There may
be others whose narnes will occur ta ather hanaurable
senatars, but I mention those two particular senatars
because I knaw myself haw extensive and profound their
experience is.
Hanaurable senators, the last thing I want ta say this
afternaan is that the cornmittee will need ta have same
expert and experienced professianal adviser. This I think
has been the custom af a number of aur cammittees
inquiring inta special subjects of sorne cornplexity, and it
will be necessary ta do the same thing here.
The hearings will require very careful organization.
They will require the services of sorneane who is intirnately cannected with this field, who has had prafessional
experience of it, and wha knows where ta go for the
necessary witnesses and haw ta inspire thern with confidence that they will receive the kind of hearings we know
they will receive frarn a Senate committee which is doing
its job ef fectively.

1 hope, therefore, that careful consideration will be
given by the comrnittee, if and when it undertakes this
inquiry, to the securing of a professional adviser and to
the organization of the hearings on the most effective
basis. It is flot a job which should be done in haste, it is
flot a job which can safely be scamped. It is the more
necessary that we should proceed with special care in this
field because there is a good deal of impression abroad in
the country-and sorne of it is unfair-that, an the whole,
this house is likely to be biased against the labour side.
There is a good deal of feeling against this house in labour
circles, and there has been for a very long time. The
demands by the trade unions for aur abolition go back ta
well before the end of the last century. Those dernands
neyer were pressed with any zeal but they are there and
they represent certainly a degree of feeling arnongst trade
unions which I do not think we want to encourage, even if
it is merely an instinct of self -preservation on our part.
I hope, therefare, that what I have said this afternoon
rnay be af same use. I should like ta move the adjaurnment of the debate, with a view ta adding a few remarks
on certain matters of detail which rnight came befare the
cammittee-nat my precanceived nations but certain matters which might well, in addition ta those which have
already been suggested, came befare the carnmittee;
adding those remarks next week, flot necessarily at the
next sitting but whenever this order of business cornes up
again.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: Honourable senators, may I ask
Senator Forsey a question? Senatar Forsey has mentioned rny narne in the course of his rernarks. I just want
ta ask hirn whether, flot being a Methodist, I would still be
abliged ta accept the cail?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I arn nat in a position ta extend the
call. 1 arn rerely hoping that the Senate authorities will
see that the cail is duly extended ta rny honourable friend,
whose experience in this field, it is safe ta say, is certainly
unique and is beyond that of any other member of this
chamber.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Forsey, debate adjourned.
ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT ACT
BILL C-55 (ESSEX)-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved the second reading
of Bill C-55, respecting the Electoral Baundaries Readjustrnent Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-55 deals with the
old constituency known as Essex.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Where is Essex?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Someane told me that it isHan. Mr. Benidickson: England.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: -south of northern California. The
constituency is represented, as you know, by Mr. E. F.
Whelan. During his remarks in the House of Commons, if
I might refer ta them, he mentioned that part of the old
constituency of Essex bas been annexed by the City of
Windsar. 1 arn told by rny seat mate that that is one of the
fastest growing industrial areas of Canada. It has great

SENATE DEBATES

growth and prosperity. As part of the City of Windsor is
now in the old Essex constituency, the sitting member,
after consultation with the electorate of that constituency,
has suggested the name be changed from Essex to
Essex-Windsor.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Thus preserving two historie names.
[Translation]
a (1600)
Hon. Paul C. Lafond: Honourable senators, a year or so
ago, I had an opportunity to express my opposition to the
study and adoption by the Senate of a bill of this kind.
The arguments I brought forward at the time are none the
less valid today and I do not intend to repeat them. They
are perhaps even more relevant, because we are twelve or
thirteen months closer to a general election and a readjustment of electoral boundaries.
I therefore restate my opposition to the study and adoption of those bills, and if they are to be read a second and
third time I request that this be on division.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask a question? The honourable
senator says he is against the bill, but he gives no reason. I
remember that he raised this question a year ago and
perhaps his arguments at this time are the same as those
he brought forward last year, but I should very much like
to know, for instance, why he considers he should oppose
the bill today. I should like to know his arguments.
Hon. Mr. Lafond: I can readily make a brief review of
the arguments I submitted at the time.
Names of constituencies were established after study by
electoral boundaries commissions. At the time of the last
revision, when the reports of these commissions were
tabled in the House of Commons, there was a certain
period within which every opportunity was given to members of the other place to make any changes they considered appropriate.
Therefore, in all the bills reaching us, long after the
readjustment of electoral boundaries, there has already
been an opportunity to make changes. This opportunity
has not been taken. They come to us with changes of
names of constituencies which sometimes get the
alphabetical order of counties mixed up and create useless hardship for the Chief Electoral Officer just before
the elections, when a great deal of his stationery has
already been printed.
[English]
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators, it
has been moved by Senator McDonald, seconded by Senator Smith, that Bill C-55 be now read a second time. Is it
your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Lafond: On division.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Honourable senators, at this stage I
should like to explain that I have been instructed by
Senator Flynn to move, on his behalf, the adjournment of
the debate on the second reading of each of the four bills
concerning electoral boundaries unless there is assurance
that they will be sent to a committee.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I have no objection to either course.
That is up to the Senate. If the Senate desires to send
them to a committee, I shall not object. On the other hand
JHon. Mr. McDonald J

March 16, 1972

I certainly do not object to Senator Choquette's moving
the adjournment of the debate on behalf of Senator
Flynn.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, for Hon. Mr. Flynn,
debate adjourned.
BILL C-74 (HIGH PARK)-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved the second reading
of Bill C-74, respecting the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-74 is in the same
form as Bill C-55. It deals with the old constituency of
High Park. The proposal is to change the name from High
Park to High Park-Humber Valley. The sitting member,
Mr. Walter Deakon, circulated a questionnaire throughout
the constituency, from the result of which it is apparent
that the desire of the people who live in the Humber
Valley area is to have the name of the constituency
changed from High Park to the double-barrelled name
High Park-Humber Valley.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, for Hon. Mr. Flynn,
debate adjourned.
BILL C-92 (RENFREW NORTH)-SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved the second reading
of Bill C-92, respecting the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-92 concerns the
present constituency of Renfrew North, which is represented by Mr. Leonard Hopkins in the other place. The
proposal to change the name to Renfrew North-Nipissing
East stems from the fact that, although the town of Renfrew is not in the constituency of Renfrew North, nevertheless many people living in the area believe that it is
because of the name of the constituency. There are some
15 townships in the northern part of Renfrew county that
are presently in the constituency, but there are 49 townships in the district of Nipissing East also in the constituency. The people in that area feel, therefore, that the
name ought to be changed in order to give recognition to
the two distinct areas of the constituency.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, for Hon. Mr. Flynn,
debate adjourned.
BILL C-167 (TROIS-RIVIÈRES)-SECOND READING-

DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved the second reading
of Bill C-167, respecting the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
He said: Again, honourable senators, this is a matter of
a change of name, in this case from Trois-Rivières to
Trois-Rivières-Métropolitain.
a (1610)

The reason for this change, as the member, Mr. Lajoie
points out, is that the constituency is made up of three
centres, Trois-Rivières, Cap de la Madeleine and TroisRivières West. Apparently the citizens of the three cities in

March 16, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

the constituency have asked for a change of name on this
account.
A second reason, I am informed, is that there seems to
be some conflict between the name of the provincial
riding and the name of the federal riding, and by changing the name to Trois-Rivières-Métropolitain, it is felt that
the citizens of the three cities would be satisfied, and the
change will end the confusion between the names of the
provincial riding and the federal riding.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, for Hon. Mr. Flynn,
debate adjourned.
CANADA-UNITED STATES INTERPARLIAMENTARY
GROUP

FOURTEENTH MEETING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 14, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Deschatelets
calling the attention of the Senate to the Fourteenth Meeting of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group, held at Ottawa and Montebello, 16th to 20th February, 1972.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, it is not my
intention to keep the Senate here for more than a short
time. The Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group in its 14 years of existence has generally been
considered by members of this house as one of the most
prestigious groups to which a senator or a member of
Parliament can belong. Back in the days of Senator Lambert, Senator Smith and Senator McCutcheon, who were
associated with the work of this joint committee, it was, as
it still is, an organization to which honourable senators
attach great importance indeed.
Senator O'Leary referred to my participation in the
recent meetings as that of a utility outfielder. I think he
flatters me because I was very little more than a benchwarmer. I was, of course, a freshman to membership in
the committee although I have previously had some connection with it, particularly in the years of my own leadership here. But, as a freshman member, I should like to
leave, if I may, some impressions of the kind of work the
group does, together with some assessment of the work
done at this particular meeting.
I think it is important to look first at the structure of the
group itself. When it meets, except in plenary session, it
meets in two committees. One is called the Committee on
Trade and the other the Committee on Defence. And with
good reason, for both countries the importance of the
other both in trade and in defence is great indeed.
On the question of defence in war, the two countries
have had very close co-operation and collaboration. I can
speak with personal knowledge of naval matters. We had
joint defence arrangements, particularly in the North
Atlantic, where the forces of this country and the forces
of the United States worked closely together. The personnel in the ships knew that there was a great depth of
feeling and warmth between the Canadians and the
Americans. The work of the Joint Production Board
during the war was a vital factor in the outcome of the
conflict.
25312-12

169

In peacetime also our two countries are complementary
and supplementary one to the other. We are, of course,
each other's best customer, a fact which has been repeated many times and again this afternoon.
In defence matters, of course, even in peacetime,
Canada is important to the United States because of the
simple magnitude of Canadian geography. On the other
side of the coin, honourable senators, I think we must
completely and without reservation acknowledge the
importance of the protection for Canada of the American
military establishment.
There have been many other developments in the history of our relations with the United States. It would be
impossible to enumerate them. I noticed some time ago
with some concern certain criticism that was directed at
the late Right Honourable C. D. Howe for the policies
adopted during his time for greater capital inflows of
American money to Canada. I am sorry Senator Manning
is not here at the moment since he has already spoken
about the importance of American capital to Canada and
particularly to the Province of Alberta. Regardless of
what we may say about American domination and the
extent of American ownership in Canada, the importance
t
o our development of the inflow of United States capital,
particularly since World War II, cannot be too highly
rated. We must realize that without it the standard of
living we have would simply not exist.
But, honourable senators, capital movements, trade
movements and defence matters are not the only things in
which we have a mutual interest and in which our legislators have mutual interests. The science and technology of
the two countries is important. While the science and
technology of the United States is greater in volume and
greater in value than ours, we still do a great deal in these
two fields. We supply some of the American establishments, both in the public sector and in the private sector,
with many able scientists and technologists.
In cultural affairs, of course, we shall long have a very
active interchange of scholars, artists, athletes and, I add,
tourists. All of these matters are bound to enter the discussions of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group. Even if the two committees are called the Committee on Trade and the Committee on Defence, we understand each other well enough-and this was obvious at
our last meeting-to be able to discuss any matter of
consequence that happens to be appropriate for the times
when our meetings occur.
The meetings we had with our friends from the United
States Congress in February were held under the shadow
of the crisis over the United States balance of payments
position. Canada recognized fully that this was a matter
upon which the American government had to act, and act
quickly. Its international commitments were very great
indeed, not only because of the aid which the Americans
have given since the end of the last war-and this amount
is staggering-but also because of their huge military
expenditures. The United States has been criticized
severely for some of its military undertakings. But we
should remember that following World War I the Americans were also severely criticized, firstly, for not being a
member of the League of Nations and, secondly, for not
assuming their share of responsibility in international

SENATE DEBATES

affairs. Following World War Il, they were determined not
to become isolationist and, being a wealthy country, they
undertook very large responsibilities. Because of these
commitments, particularly to the Far East and elsewhere,
they have been subject to censure from many quarters.
But if we look back at the various international crises
which have occurred since the end of the war, had the
Americans not been involved how satisfactorily would
these crises have been resolved?
S

(1620)

Canada recognizes the great imbalance in international
payments with which the United States was confronted.
We acknowledged that this could not be corrected by any
domestic instrument within the United States, or by their
anti-dumping legislation, or their anti-trust legislation, or
by the capacity of Congress to increase the tariff. The
main problem arose from foreign currency distortions.
The Nixon-Connally confrontation of August, 1971-and
I am talking about John B. Connally, the Secretary of the
Treasury-with the OECD countries was a peaceful confrontation. It was the kind of confrontation which called
for debate, a threat if you will, but not a military threat. It
did result in a debate. Canada was seriously disaffected
by this new policy.
So we debated with our friends in Congress last month,
we acknowledged that in our own self-interest we would
have to do all we could to ensure that there was not an
economic collapse in the United States. This would be a
complete disaster for the western world. The west must be
strong, and if the United States approached a bankrupt
position the economic security of the west would be
damaged. If that economic security is damaged then I
would not be too hopeful for the military security of the
west.
Canada was disaffected in an economic sense by the
steps taken last August. The situation was unusual for
Canada. Her trade surplus with the United States was
much greater in 1970-71 than it had been for many years.
As a matter of fact, for most of the years of our history we
have had a trade deficit with the United States. The surplus was due mainly to the unusual workings of the auto
pact agreement, especially with a small motor vehicle
called the Maverick and with snowmobiles. Nevertheless,
despite the fact that our trade balance was in a surplus
position, Mr. Pepin indicated to us that the invisible elements of our fiscal relations with the United States-such
as the interest payments on debt and payments for services, dividends and royalties-have put Canada in an
overall deficit position this year.
Over a year ago, Canada had floated her dollar. This
was not helpful to many of our export industries, particularly the pulp and paper industry. It was difficult for
Canadian exporters generally to compete when the dollar
was allowed to float to a higher level. I am not referring
only to this one industry. You name the product exported
and I think we can agree it applied to that product.
Canada did not perhaps fully recognize the crisis which
was developing in the American balance of payments. But
Canada had taken steps which probably helped somewhat
to rectify conditions within the American market and in
the American balance of payments.
We raised these matters and our friends discussed them,
but in the larger context of the crisis position with which

March 16, 1972

they were confronted. I feel that if we were in their shoes,
we would have done the same thing.
In respect to Senator O'Leary's visit to Washington
shortly after the new economic policy was developed last
August, I wish to adopt Senator Croll's statement that
when a member of the Opposition party travels to Washington in the interest of Canada one must say that this is
great Canadianism. Without gilding the lily, I think I can
say to Senator O'Leary, if he will allow me to adopt the
words used by Senator Croll yesterday, I can give him no
higher praise.
0 (1630)

However, the point regarding the present position of the
two countries relating to this issue was made by Senator
O'Leary when he said in his speech that we have now had
a pause in the negotiations. We had discussed this pause
with the American senators and members of the House of
Representatives. We said that as long as we are never
confronted with a closed door, which I do not think we
ever will be, difficulties of this nature between us can
always be resolved. We should not have too much to
worry us, because when dealing with Americans we are
dealing with people who think, live and want to operate in
the same way we do.
In respect of the personnel of the American delegation,
I do not propose to single out any individual. We have all
been impressed through the years by the desire on the
part of the members of the American Congress to send
their most distinguished and most able people here. A
glance through the list of members of the Canada-United
States group who have come from the American Congress
over the years discloses that this standard has been realized in the nominees they have made.
I was very proud indeed to have been associated with
my own colleagues from this house and, indeed, with my
colleagues of all parties from the other house. I make no
reference to any specific person. They all performed in a
very responsible manner, in a manner of which we as
Canadians should be immensely proud.
We recognized too that there were times between the
annual meetings when crises might arise and should be
discussed. It was readily agreed on the part of both
Americans and Canadians that when unusual circumstances arise we need only telephone and arrange for a
small group of Canadians to meet with a small group of
Americans to resolve any difficulty.
May I close by observing that there are times when
certain events develop which give rise to a feeling of
anti-Americanism in this country. Very often when the
event has passed and full light bas been shed upon the
circumstances, it is found that there was no justification
for the charge against the Americans. It is the responsibility, and should be made so, of legislators on both sides of
the border, when situations of this character develop, to
get in touch with each other to clarify the situation in
order that no misunderstanding will develop unnecessarily. In rñy opinion this can be done.
All in all, I felt very honoured to be a member of this
group. I only hope that I will not be just a utility outfielder
in the future.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 21, 1972, at

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS BILL.
1972
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem informed the Senate that
a message had been received from the House of Commons
with Bill C-8, to authorize the making of certain fiscal
payments to provinces, to authorize the entry into tax
collection agreements with provinces, and to amend the
Established Programs (Interim Arrangements) Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators,

when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Paul Martin, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 44(1)(f), moved the second reading of the
bill.
He said: Honourable senators, in proposing the second
reading of this bill, I would remind the house that five
years ago almost to the day, Senator Connolly stood in
this chamber to move second reading of the predecessor
of this bill, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements
Act of 1967.
At that time he explained that the bill rested upon six
principles which had been expounded in the course of
meetings with provincial governments. I think it is well
worth restating Senator Connolly's summary of those six
principles, which continue to apply:
1. That the fiscal arrangements between the federal and
provincial governments should give each level of government adequate access to tax resources to discharge its
responsibilities.
2. That each level of government should, as far as possible, levy its own taxes.
3. That the principle of federal equalization payments
should be recognized as essential to help provinces provide an adequate level of public service.
4. That the federal authority should at all times have
both theoretical and practical authority to discharge its
full responsibilities.
5. That the federal-provincial arrangements should aim
for the principle of uniform application of federal laws in
every province of Canada.
6. That there should be co-operation in the establishment of policies and priorities in federal-provincial
arrangements.
Honourable senators, these six principles, as I have
said, remain as valid today as they did five years ago. I
believe they are, in fact, better understood and more fully
accepted than they were five years ago. In any event, they

25312-12l

remain the framework of fiscal federalism in Canada,
exemplified in this bill.
Representatives of our federal and provincial governments meet often to discuss matters of this kind, and on
seven separate occasions ministers of finance and provincial treasurers examined the arrangements which had
been incorporated in this bill.
It is easy and popular to conclude that such federal-provincial meetings are typically fractious and ill-tempered,
harbouring deep divisions and fundamental tensions. But
in my experience, this is seldom so. The two levels of
government are building, I believe, on an enormous base
of agreed principles and practices in their relationships
with one another. At each step, of course, they must sort
their way through inevitable conflicts and differences.
Our political system sometimes highlights these differences. We remember the day's fireworks and forget the
week's quiet progress. But our political system typically
resolves such differences in the end, with reason and good
will on both sides, and for the benefit of the people of this
country.
* (2010)

This bill is not a perfect instrument of federalism, nor is
it a final one. But it is a good instrument, and a product of
great effort and imagination exercised in pursuit of a
balance between centralization and decentralization,
between fiscal independence and federal help for provinces not as fortunate as some of the others.
The Fiscal Arrangements Act is certainly the most
important document among many that delineate the
financial relationships between federal and provincial
governments. For example, it focuses their co-operation
in income tax policy. Under its provisions the two levels of
government not only agree generally on the rules by
which income taxes will be levied in Canada, but they
establish how those taxes will be shared and indeed collected at minimum cost and inconvenience. The bill provides for equalization payments in each of the next five
years, at a total expected to increase annually from a
current level of about $1 billion a year. This legislation
underpins provincial finances by guaranteeing that their
revenues will not decline in the event of serious economic
difficulties. It renews for two years the very broad support extended by the federal government in financing
higher education in this country.
Statutory authority for the equalization and postsecondary education provisions will lapse on March 31
this year. These pressures are unfortunate but they are
inevitable.
The first part of the bill extends the 1967 equalization
arrangements for a further five years, with refinements to
the formula for calculating payments. This complex formula measures the revenue-raising capacity of a province
and to the extent that its capacity falls short of the national average on a per capita basis, the federal government
fills the gap by a direct payment. The first formal equalization program was launched 15 years ago, and only with

SENATE DEBATES

the 1967 act did equalization extend to the comprehensive
base of provincial revenues. The calculation now covers
total provincial revenues from taxation, licences, privileges, permits, fees, fines, liquor board revenues and those
of other government-owned enterprises. The technical
changes in the bill before us relate to the classification of
revenues, the measures used for population and tax bases,
and the scheduling of calculation and payments.
The move to the comprehensive revenue base resulted
in a major jump in equalization payments to $546 million
in 1967. That figure has almost doubled in the five years
since. Projections indicate that equalization payments
may total $1.5 billion at the conclusion of these arrangements in 1976-77.
There is no doubt, therefore, that equalization payments
have been critically important in helping recipient provinces to lift their public services closer to national average
standards. The formula is designed to relate the amount
of the payment to the shortfall in revenue capacities.
Thus, we expect that both Newfoundland and Prince
Edward Island will qualify for about $213 per person in
equalization payments in the next fiscal year, well above
the average for recipient provinces. The corresponding
amounts in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan are expected to be $164, $135 and $102 respectively.
Quebec and Manitoba have revenues closer to the national average, and consequently the payments received by
their governments will be less on a per capita basis. The
estimates for them are $74 and $58 respectively.
Background material showing the operation of the
equalization system and payments under it will be available for study when the bill is referred to the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
However, I shall give briefly the results of one comparison
to indicate how important equalization has been to the
seven provinces that have received it during the past five
years.
The comparison examines the per capita revenues of
each province, before and after equalization payments
have been made. In 1966-67 net revenues from their own
sources for the seven lower-income provinces as a group
were 74 per cent of the average for Ontario, British
Columbia and Alberta. Equalization raised the average
for the lower-income provinces to 87 per cent of the average for the higher group. The gap between the two was
halved from 26 to 13 per cent. This year the percentage
gap between the same two groups is reduced dramatically
from 19 per cent before equalization to only 2 per cent
after equalization. Similar results occur when provincial
expenditures on their services are compared. Clearly,
therefore, we are making great strides toward the objective stated by Mr. Pearson's government in 1966 of
assisting:
all provinces ... to provide to their citizens a reasonably comparable level of basic services, without
resorting to unduly burdensome levels of taxation.
It is fortunate that most Canadians strongly support the
principle of equalization. We require reasonably comparable levels of public services not just for simple equity
and justice among our citizens, but because they contribute to a sense of common Canadian citizenship that is
vital to the unity of Canada. The principle extends not
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 21, 1972

just to this one system of payments, but to many of our
social programs as well.
S(2020)

Equalization is, of course, indispensable to the financing
programs of the lower income provinces. It is the equivalent of between 13 and 16 per cent of the gross revenues of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Quebec. It is equal to more
than one-third of the revenues Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick culled from their own taxes, and equal to 55
per cent of Prince Edward Island's own revenues and 66
per cent of those of the Province of Newfoundland.
In the course of discussions on equalization during the
past two years it has been criticized as being both too
broad and too narrow in scope, too generous and not
generous enough. The federal government has explored a
series of proposals for change in the formula and in the
concept of the plan, but there are both conceptual and
financial difficulties in changing the system substantially
at this time.
One sweeping alternative to equalization has been given
some prominence and should be discussed in the debate
on this bill. It is the proposal that equalization payments
to governments be abolished and replaced by payments
direct to low-income individuals. This would result in
drastic revenue losses for the provinces which receive
equalization payments at present, making it impossible
for them to maintain adequate services without enormous
tax increases. If the federal government attempted to
make direct payments to low-income Canadians sufficient
to generate compensating tax revenue for those provinces, it is estimated that the payments would have to total
a net $13 billion to $14 billion. This, of course, is far above
the cost of any guaranteed income scheme yet suggested
for this country.
Part II of the bill deals with the stabilization of provincial revenues, a little known but important reserve line of
support provided to all provinces by the federal
government.
Since 1967 all provinces, not just the have-not provinces
receiving equalization, have been able to plan their expenditures, taxation and borrowing on the assurance that
Ottawa would stand ready to prevent any major decline in
their revenues.
The assurance took the form of a guarantee of a federal
government grant to any province whose revenues fell
below 95 per cent of those received in the preceding year.
However, because it was a period of growth and steadily
rising revenues for all governments, no province needed a
stabilization payment. But the guarantee helped some
provinces to borrow on the capital market on favourable
terms. This new bill improves on the guarantee by
increasing the "floor" to 100 per cent of previous year
revenues, based upon the same rates and structure of
taxes in the two years. Stabilization will serve more
strongly than ever to assure people of the continuity of
public services, and to assure lenders of the credit rating
of borrowing provinces in the event of any sudden break
in economic conditions.
Part III of the bill authorizes the federal government to
sign agreements to collect corporation and personal
income taxes and succession duties on behalf of the prov-

Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Following the federal government's withdrawal from the estate and gift tax field as
of January 1, 1972, these provinces decided to rejoin
Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia in the succession
duty field. Lacking collection machinery of their own,
they urged the federal government to administer their
succession duties. The federal government has agreed to
do so, but for three years only. The bill also authorizes the
federal government to collect gift tax for certain
provinces.
Part IV will establish a guarantee that the revenue of
each province from personal and corporation income
taxes combined will, for each of the first five years of the
new tax system, be no less than they would under the old
system.
This guarantee has been desirable because of the unavoidable uncertainty that surrounds yields in the early
years of a new tax system. The federal government first
pledged in the White Paper that it would make an initial
guarantee of provincial revenues on the condition that
provinces adopted the new tax structure. The guarantee
of the bill also requires that provinces establish new tax
rates at the beginning of 1972 no higher than equivalent
rates for 1971. The actual rates differ because this year
provincial taxes will be calculated on a smaller federal
tax base than in 1971, and a conversion of expressed rates
is needed to derive the same amount of revenue. These
new rates are set out in the bill.
Under Part V the government is given authority to
share with the provinces revenue from a special 15 per
cent tax on certain distributions of corporate surplus.
This tax replaces the tax otherwise payable by shareholders receiving the surplus in the form of dividends, and the
revenue will be shared on an 80-20 federal-provincial
basis, about the same proportion by which the two levels
of government share the corporation income tax field at
the present time.
Part VI extends for two years, until March 31, 1974, the
fiscal transfers by which the federal government finances
50 per cent of the operating costs of post-secondary education in Canada. Separate methods are used to make
these transfers to Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island
and New Brunswick on the one hand, and to the remaining seven provinces on the other. During the two-year
extension the bill sets a yearly ceiling of 15 per cent on the
national rate of increase in the federal contribution. It
would still be possible for the federal contribution to an
individual province to exceed this 15 per cent growth rate
if transfers to other provinces were short of the limit.

inces. Central collection of taxes is, of course, a system
much admired by many other federations. In Canada
both provincial and federal taxes are generally collected
by a single tax return through a system that establishes
the same definition of taxable income, the same deductions and the same provincial levies.
For the federal government this generally means continuity and uniformity of taxes from province to province,
with all the benefits which that has for a federal state.
Provincial governments in turn are relieved of a costly
and difficult chore of tax collection. If they levy a tax as a
percentage of the federal tax, they may sign a collection
agreement and have their tax revenues gathered by federal machinery at no cost. The federal government bears the
cost of collection and bad debts, and retains all interest
and penalties. It is estimated that the provinces and their
taxpayers save as much as $100 annually by leaving this
job to Ottawa.
A system of this kind demands a great measure of
federal-provincial consensus of the shape and substance
that a tax system should take. I think it is of value for us
to realize, particularly after the criticism about tax reform
in the last two years, that the same provinces are staying
with collection agreements this year. Provincial income
taxes on a personal basis will be collected by the federal
government for all provinces except Quebec, and provincial corporation taxes for all provinces except Quebec
and Ontario. Quebec has indicated it will harmonize its
income tax system with the federal government. Except
for a restriction on rates applicable at January 1, 1972,
provinces are free to establish their own rates of tax,
expressed as a percentage of the federal tax.
The abolition of the abatement system for personal
income taxes occurs as part of tax reform and is assumed
in this bill. This is a step of some importance in demonstrating that the provinces are perfectly free to determine
their own levels of taxation. Abatements of personal
income tax had left the impression that some level of
combined federal and provincial taxes was right, and that
any government exceeding its so-called share of that level
was guilty of double taxation. In fact, no predetermined
share of income taxes exists. Governments must, of
course, consult on the total burden of taxation and on the
consequences of their respective spending and taxing
decisions. But, ultimately, they cannot negotiate as such
about tax shares or total taxes. These two things are the
consequences of political decisions at each level of government, decisions which flow from the demands of the
electors and which will be judged by the electors.

SENATE DEBATES

cerned not only with these fiscal transfers, but with manpower training, research support to universities and student assistance in the form of guaranteed loans.
Consultations have been held since 1970 with provincial
representatives and will continue to determine the longterm direction of federal participation in education.
Finally, Part VII of the bill is concerned with the regulations which set out the complex definitions, measurements and calculations that underlie the statute. It would
not have been possible to incorporate all of this into
statutory language, and the provinces have urged the
federal government to prescribe technical details in regulations so that they might be consulted on their form.
These and other questions can, of course, be dealt with
in greater detail when the bill reaches the committee at
which the Minister of Finance himself is ready to appear.
Another section of Part VII amends the Established
Programs (Interim Arrangements) Act to extend the socalled "opting-out" arrangements with Quebec and to
make necessary technical revisions to tax points due to
income tax reform.
Honourable senators may be aware that these optingout arrangements changed the form, although not the
amount, of federal assistance for hospitalization. welfare
programs and general health grants. In 1965, special tax
abatements plus cash payments were offered in place of
straight cash as the federal contribution to these programs, but, although the offer was extended to all provinces, only Quebec chose to take advantage of this
arrangement.
The amendments before honourable senators therefore
retain and bring up to date this arrangement with Quebec.
I believe I have given a general indication of the provisions of this bill, which is really essential to orderly government in our country, taking into account that government is the sum total of the operations of federal and
provincial governments.
Just as Senator Connolly commended to the Senate the
bill in its original form five years ago, I commend this bill
to honourable senators tonight.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators, if the Leader
of the Opposition does not mind my saying a few words at
this time, I think it would be in order for me to deal with
the matter raised by the Leader of the Government when
he referred to a statement that was made in the other
place by the Minister of Finance. It was with reference to
the cost of the guaranteed annual income, and he used the
figure of $13 billion. When I saw that in Hansard I
immediately attempted to find out where that figure came
from, how it was arrived at. I was not very successful. I
was told they got that figure from the same people who
advised them that the best way to combat inflation was to
bring on more unemployment.
a (2040)

Hon. Mr. Martin: There was no suggestion in anything I
said that that was the cost. I said it was away above the
cost. I did not say that that was the cost, and I do not think
that my colleague the Minister of Finance said it either.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am glad to have my mistaken impression corrected. I am sorry if I misunderstood you. Since I
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 21, 1972

do not want to get into the debate, perhaps I may make a
short statement at this time.
An estimate of the cost of the guaranteed annual
income was made by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce who hired a professional. The figure he arrived at
was short $1.5 billion. Then two professors from Queen's
University, whose names I do not remember at the
moment, made a calculation. Their estimate amounted to
approximately the same figure. Then there was an estimate made in the Senate committee by competent people,
who suggested a figure of approximately $800 million.
That was about a year ago, so it probably would be $1
billion by this time. I now have on my desk a very thorough study made by two professors from York University,
whose names also escape me at the moment, and whose
estimate came to about $49 million higher than our estimate. It was a very thorough study. Honourable senators
will remember the White Paper produced by the Department of National Health and Welfare in which a figure of
approximately $2.6 billion was used. However, if these
people were to search in their own departmental files they
would find figures on record which put the amount at
about one-half of that $2.6 billion.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That came from Information Canada.
Hon. Mr. Croll: If you wait for Information Canada to
come up with information, you will grow very old.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: So you understand the purpose of Information Canada?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am having great difficulty with so
many figures being thrown around, particularly when one
considers the figures which have been produced by very
competent people. That was the purpose of my rising at
this time.

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE-CORRECTION TO FINAL
REPORT TABLED
Hon. Gildas L. Molgat: Honourable senators, I wish to
table a correction to the final report of the Special Joint
Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on
the Constitution of Canada, tabled in this house on Thursday, March 16, 1972. The correction which I am tabling
involves simply a slight addition to the wording. It means
the addition of a few words to page 42 of the report, and
the words are "to determine the nature of this structure."
This applies to the recommendations dealing with the
National Capital Commission and the structure of such a
commission. This wording was omitted during the preparation of the final writing of the report, and there is no
question whatever that this is "an amendment after the
fact," as I have seen suggested in one newspaper column.
That is not the case at all. Any study of the working
papers of the committee would prove this, as would,
indeed, any inquiry of any member of the committee.
Honourable senators who were members of that committee will support the statement that it was merely an inadvertent omission.

UNITY BANK OF CANADA-PRESENTATION OF PETITION
Hon. John J. Connolly. for Hon. Maurice Bourget, presented the following petition:
Of Isadore Levinter and Benjamin Victor Levinter of
Woodbridge, in the Regional Municipality of York,
Zenon Gutkowski of the Municipality of Metropolitan
Toronto, Adiuto John Pianosi of the Town of Copper
Cliff, all in the Province of Ontario, and Gerald
LaSalle of the City of Sherbrooke, in the Province of
Quebec; praying to be incorporated under the name
of "Unity Bank of Canada", and in French, "L'Unité,
Banque du Canada".
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem informed the Senate that
a message had been received from the House of Commons
with Bill C-164, to incorporate Unity Bank of Canada.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I ask Senator Connolly if this is the
same bank as that referred to in the previous petition?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, honourable
senators. I understand the name of the bank has been
changed as a result of representations made in the other
place. However, this bill is substantially the same as the
one passed by the Senate during the last session with the
exception of a change of name and one other relatively
minor change.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Are there two separate bills, or only
one?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): There is only one bill.
The bill which was passed by the Senate in the last session
died on the Order Paper in the other place at the end of
the session. A new bill was introduced this session in the
House of Commons. It has been passed by the other place
and is now before us with two relatively minor changes.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That was not my question.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Why do we need a petition for incorporation? That is Senator Flynn's point.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why do we need a petition when the bill
has been passed by the other place?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is a private bill,
and private bills are required to be preceded in this house
by the presentation of a petition.

Bourget, that this bill be read the second time at the next

ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT ACT
BILL C-55 (ESSEX)-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 16, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald
for the second reading of Bill C-55, respecting the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, what I say
regarding this bill will apply to the others in this group. I
merely wish to echo a point made by Senator Lafond the
other day. I suggest that these bills run counter, if not to

SENATE DEBATES

the letter at least to the spirit of the Electoral Boundaries
Readjustment Act, Chapter E-2 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1970, which was passed in the 1964-65 session.
As you are aware, under this act provincial commissions were established to delineate the boundaries of federal constituencies, and to give a name to each. Any
person who wished to make a complaint or an observation
was welcomed to do so. Those commissions heard witnesses who suggested changes in names, and their reports
were tabled in the House of Commons. Members of the
other place who had objections could state them at that
time.
One of the principles the commissions endeavoured to
follow was that of giving simple names to each constituency in Canada. During the last session several bills were
introduced which followed the old custom of trying to
describe every corner of every constituency in Canada.
Some constituencies were easy to describe, such as Essex
East which today could be called Martin. However, others,
such as Berthier-Maskinongé-de Lanaudière and Nanaimo-Cowichan-The Islands, were more complicated. This
would indicate a return to the old method of describing
constituencies.
I feel this is the wrong time to do this because we are on
the eve of a federal election, which will take place either
this year or some time next year.
Under the provisions of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act another redistribution will have to take
place next year. This complicates the task of the commissions which will have to deal with this problem next year,
in any event.
It is obvious that no one wished to be too harsh on his
friends in the other place as far as these matters were
concerned, and the bills have no real political bearing.
The attitude was: "I am with you if you are with me."
That is, of course, the underlying reason for this series of
bills. We cannot really stop their passage, but we should at
least register a protest. When the motion was put, Senator
Lafond said that these bills should pass on division. I
agree with that.

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
CONSIDERATION OF FINAL REPORT OF SPECIAL JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of the final
report of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and
the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada,
tabled in the Senate on Thursday, March 16, 1972.
Hon. Gildas L. Molgat: Honourable senators, it was my
pleasure and privilege on Thursday last to table the final
report of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and
the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada.
This Special Joint Committee had as its work one of the
most serious and delicate tasks ever faced by a parliamentary committee, that of proposing the future shape of our
country as defined in its basic document, the Constitution
of Canada. I can speak without reservation and in glowing terms of the tasks of the committee. I can do this
without any false shame, because I was not a member of
the Senate when the committee was first established and
its terms of reference set when honourable senators
decided that this was a course of importance to the people
of Canada. I became a member of the committee long
after its establishment.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And one of its best members.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I wish to say, however, that the committee obviously could not have accomplished its work
without the help of a large number of people. The page of
acknowledgments lists a number of these people, and I
would like to read from it because the report itself does
not form part of the record.
The thanks of all members of the committee go to the
Speakers and officers of both Houses of Parliament, who
were invaluable in their advice and help. We thank also
the large and devoted staff from various departments.
When I outline the manner in which the committee proceeded you will realize why I refer specifically to "devoted
staff," because the pace of the committee was rather
hectic. We received invaluable assistance from the staff of
the Committees and Private Legislation Branch, the Com-

mittee Liaison Officer of the House of Commons, and the
Interpretation and Translation Divisions of the Department of the Secretary of State. One office not mentioned
is that of the Queen's Printer. I would mention in particular two employees of that office, Mr. Jeffrey Feren and
Mr. Archie Leblanc. They could not be mentioned in the
acknowledgments because obviously their contact with
the report came after it had been written. Without their
devotion the report might not have been produced and
tabled at the time it was.
e (2110)

We also owe particular thanks to the joint clerks who,
throughout the two years that the committee functioned,
worked far beyond what one could reasonably expect
from any employee. The clerks and other personnel put in
many hours of work. Here I should like to single out Mr.
Michael Kirby of the House of Commons Committees
Branch, Mr. Patrick Savoie of our Senate Committees
Branch, and later, replacing Mr. Patrick Savoie,
[Translation]

Miss Gabrielle Savard, from the House of Commons Committees Branch-we cannot really describe the enormous
amount of work done by these three persons.

McWilliam, who is our legal adviser,
[Translation]

Mr. Jacques Malouin, economic adviser, Mr. Richard Gervais, economic assistant, and Miss Suchal, research assistant, have also accomplished a task that we would describe
as exemplary.
[English]

The appreciation which I know that members of our
committee feel cannot be adequately understood unless it
is known how the committee functioned. Therefore,
before going into details of the committee's work, I should
like to explain how the committee operated.
The committee established from the outset that it had
two particular functions. It functioned as a special select
committee to analyze proposals put forward by the federal and provincial governments with regard to constitutional amendments and procedures, and to obtain the
views of as many experts as possible on constitutional
matters.
The committee commenced its work here in Ottawa
where material was already available for analysis. It was
here too that most of the acknowledged experts on the
Constitution appeared before the committee. They come
from all over the country.
By and large the committee met twice weekly, and usually a full morning or afternoon session was reserved for
each witness. The committee members had every opportunity to question each witness in detail.
I might add that those who were invited to appear
before the committee represented all political viewpoints.
There was no restriction whatsoever. The fact that someone represented a separatist viewpoint by no means
excluded him; on the contrary, every effort was made to
ensure representation on all points of view. As a result,
the meetings were extremely interesting.

The committee established from the outset, as being
crucial to its operation, what one might call its popular
function. In this connection I shall read an extract from
an early working paper which suggested the method by
which the committee might consider this popular
function:
Perhaps the most important aspect of the committee's work is the effect it can have on public opinion in
the country by arousing interest in the constitutional
process. This can be accomplished only by the committee's travelling the length and breadth of the country and conducting hearings in smaller centres as well
as larger ones. Indeed, this is already foreseen by the
committee's terms of referenceWe should prefer to have the cross-country meetings
as unstructured as possible to give maximum scope to
citizens to speak their minds on the kind of country
they would like to live in.
This is exactly what the committee proceeded to do. Its
popular function cannot be overemphasized. If honourable senators read the debates prior to the establishment
of the committee they will see that many members of
Parliament felt that discussions on constitutional matters
were just between the federal government and the ten
provincial governments, that they themselves and the
Canadian public did not share in determining these crucial issues concerning the future of our country.
To my mind the popular aspect of the committee's work
is most important, for in the final analysis a changed
Constitution will not be acceptable to the Canadian public
unless it is in tune with their mood-no matter what the
experts say.
The committee travelled the length and breadth of
Canada, visiting every province. In addition to visiting the
capital cities and the large centres, the committee held
meetings in such places as Prince George and Kamloops
in British Columbia; Sherbrooke, Arvida and Rimouski in
Quebec; and Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury in
Ontario. This was the pattern throughout the whole country. The two Territories, which so frequently feel left out
of the mainstream of Canadian life, were also visited.
Meetings were held in Whitehorse, Yellowknife and
Inuvik. Wherever the committee went, it attempted in the
best possible way to encourage public participation. Six
weeks prior to visiting a particular community, advertisements were placed in four successive editions of local
newspapers. These were, I might add, bilingual advertisements in all cases. I feel that future committees might
consider, in addition to advertisements in local newspapers, the use of radio and television advertisements. These
media, I believe, can reach all who are interested in the
work of committees such as ours.
* (2120)

When the committee arrived at a location, except in the
early stages of its work when the equipment was not
available, simultaneous interpretation facilities were provided so that anyone who appeared could speak in either
French or English. The rules were deliberately established on a flexible basis, and this again is something
other committees might consider. There was no obligation
to submit advance copies of briefs, nor was there an

SENATE DEBATES

obligation to submit a certain number of briefs. Everything was done to encourage participation.
People who had previously indicated a desire to speak
to the committee were allowed fifteen minutes in which to
do so; people who arrived on the day or evening of the
sitting wishing to present their views in a formal manner,
were allowed ten minutes. Between these formal briefs
the committee heard people from the floor. Microphones
were placed in every hall so that people could participate
from the floor if they wished, and they were allowed three
minutes. The three-minute time allotment had to be
enforced in order to be able to proceed in an orderly
manner, but people were allowed to make second and
third speeches if time permitted. There was real participation, and a real opportunity for any Canadian who wished
to be heard by a parliamentary committee.
It was amazing to see how many chose to appear. The
committee found there was a great deal of interest in the
Constitution. Let me give an example. In the City of
Vancouver the committee reserved a hall with a capacity
of between 300 and 400 people and at 8 o'clock, when the
hearing was to commence, it was filled to capacity. When
the doors were closed there were people milling about in
the halls outside clamouring to be let in. A formal petition
was sent to the chairman asking that a larger hall be
obtained, which resulted in the hearings being moved to
the main ballroom of the Hotel Vancouver in order to
accommodate the number of people who wished to
appear. It was a tremendous education from all aspects.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Did those people crowd the place
because they wanted to show opposition to any amendment to the Constitution?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: The majority of those who appeared
before us had intelligent and useful things to say with
respect to what they wanted Canada to be. One interesting thing from a Canadian standpoint, Senator Choquette,
this being a bilingual nation, was that almost invariably
across the country, not exclusively in one particular area
or another, when an individual rose to speak in French
there was little objection. In some cases there were rumblings in the audience, and I will admit that on one occasion in Vancouver I heard someone say, "Speak English,"
but the surprising thing was that the vast majority of the
audience immediately objected and said, "No, speak
whichever language you prefer." The effect of this on the
members of the committee and on the audiences throughout Canada was tremendous.
I feel that many people arrived at our meetings wondering what they were all about, and left feeling much more
Canadian. I remember in Calgary, for example, during a
discussion regarding the monarchy, a young lady of some
12 to 14 years of age was so taken up by the discussion
that she came forward and made an excellent presentation, pointing out her views as a young Canadian. There
was this type of spontaneous reaction in many parts of the
country.
The committee's task was a rather arduous one. The
tremendous participation prolonged our hearings. Rarely
did the committee rise before midnight-in fact, I can
remember only one or two occasions when it did. Most of
the time it was one or one-thirty in the morning when the
hearings were adjourned. The long hours made it difficult

for our staff who had to set up the equipment for simultaneous interpretation, arrange tables, distribute documents
and so forth, dismantle their equipment at the end of the
hearing, and then move on to another sitting the next day.
It was indeed a difficult and arduous task, and we
appreciate what they did.
The same sentiments apply to the members of the committee. I realize it is dangerous to single out individuals, so
I will attempt to do so in only a limited way. I feel I must
pay particular tribute to the joint chairman from the
other place, Dr. Mark MacGuigan.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: If one individual carried most of the
load of the background work of the committee, the drafting, re-drafting and checking, it was certainly my colleague, the member from Windsor-Walkerville. He
deserves the greatest credit for the work that he did on
this committee.
I must also give credit to my predecessor as joint chairman
from the Senate, the Honourable
Maurice
Lamontagne.
[Translation]
I am sure Senator Lamontagne regretted his inability to
continue as co-chairman of the committee. Illness as well
as work he had to accomplish within the Science Policy
Committee made it impossible for him to continue and I
had to stand in for him for a certain period, towards the
end of our meetings, when he was unable to continue and
I had to act as co-chairman in his place. I must say,
however, that all the work of the first meetings, all the
preliminary work, was done by Senator Lamontagne.
[English]
I want to thank as well all members from the Senate. I
cannot speak too highly of the work they performed. They
put in many long hours, and they deserve a great deal of
credit for the interest they showed in the work of the
committee, and the regularity with which they attended
the hearings. Here I should like to single out two lady
senators who were with us all the time that I was with the
committee, Senator Fergusson and Senator Quart. No
matter how long the day, or how far and long we travelled, they were there.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I should also like to point out the work
accomplished by Senator Casgrain. Although she was
with us only for a short time, she showed great interest in
the work of our committee, not missing one meeting while
she was here. We saw with regret the time come for her to
retire from the Senate, and therefore become unable to
continue her work on the committee. This loss is partly
the reason for a recommendation in the committee report
to the effect that senators, when the time for their retirement has come, should be entitled to continue working
either here in the Senate, or in a committee, wherever
their work seems to be of particular interest.
Had this rule existed previously, our committee could
have continued benefiting by the advice, the vast experience and the concern of Senator Casgrain.

SENATE DEBATES

* (2130)

[English]
One of the advantages of the work of the joint committee-here I speak specifically of joint committees-was
the obvious understanding that developed between members of the Senate on the one side, and members of the
other place on the other. As a newcomer to this building,
it came as a surprise to me that the chamber at this end of
the building and the other one, no further than some 200
or 300 yards away, could in a sense be somewhat in
isolation. The work of the committee, I think, helped a
great deal in promoting understanding between the members of the two houses. This is an important aspect of the
functioning of our system of government. The friendships
that developed between members of the Senate, and
equally between members of the Senate and members of
the other place, will, I think, bear useful fruit in the work
of both houses in the future. I for one would like to see
more use made of joint committees from now on.
This brings me to the committee's report itself. I do not
propose tonight to go through all the recommendations. I
hope that there will be a great participation by members
of this house in the discussion of the report. Whether it is
favourable or unfavourable I hope there will be discussion, because I believe there is a particular obligation on
the Senate of Canada to speak on this subject.
There would have been no Confederation in 1867 if the
question of the Senate had not been resolved. No issue
took more time in the discussions of the Fathers of Confederation at the Quebec Conference than the question of
the Senate. It was only when agreement was reached that
there would be a Senate representing the regions of our
country on an equal basis that agreement could be
reached with Lower Canada and the Maritimes, which
understandably felt that without this guarantee they
would be overwhelmed by the larger population of Upper
Canada. Thus the Senate was a crucial element in Confederation in 1867. To me this aspect of regional representation in the Senate is a major reason why the Senate
should take a leading part in discussions on the Constitution of Canada. I hope that honourable senators will enter
this debate, regardless of whether they are for or against
the report of the committee.
I might add, although I am co-chairman of the committee, that I do not agree with all of the recommendations.
One thing that we very soon found-and I am sure the
original members of the committee knew it before they
started-is that it is impossible for a committee made up
of 30 people, representing all political views and all
regions of Canada, to produce a unanimous report.
Frankly, I am not disturbed at all by the minority reports
that have appeared. In fact, it is rather surprising that we
have been able to agree as much as we have; that we
could produce a document like this report; that we could,
understanding the nature of Canada, make the number of
recommendations that we have.
Statistics Canada tells us that at the latest count there
are 21,681,000 Canadians. We cannot have an individual
constitution to serve each of us. The report is obviously a
document of compromise, a document of give and take. It
cannot be a document that will suit every individual, but it

17U

must be a document that represents the general will of
Canadians.
This report represents the general will of the many
Canadians whom we heard across Canada, and the general opinion of the committee members. I do not claim it is a
unanimous report. It is not. We do not pretend it is. But we
do say that it is not a partisan, politically inspired report.
The discussion and the vote on none of these recommendations were of a partisan nature. In every case they were
across provincial boundaries, and across language
groups. They were simply what the members of the committee wanted, and every one of the recommendations
was passed by a majority vote within the committee. I
repeat, this does not mean-and we do not claim it doesthat every recommendation has the approval of every
member.
I know we shall be hearing from other members of the
committee, one of whom sits directly behind me-I refer
to my good friend, Senator Forsey-who will voice some
objections. I have some as well. Although it may not be
completely within the rules, I hope that when other honourable senators have discussed the report I might have
the opportunity to say a few words more, at which time I
would like to voice certain reservations. I do not do so
now because as joint chairman I prefer not to express any
opinions that might prejudice the views of anyone. I think
it better that I voice my reservations at a later date. As
one who comes from a region of the country that has
often felt it did not participate fully in Canadian affairs,
there are certain things I would like to see changed. However, all in all I support the general recommendations of
the committee, and I think the work of my colleagues has
been of immense value.
* (2140)

As far as the recommendations themselves are concerned, I would say that the spirit behind them is one of
recognition of the growing importance of the provinces.
We believe that, in order to accommodate the present
structures of Canada, there ought to be a change in the
responsibility of various levels of government, the general
idea being to give the central government greater powers
in the economic field in order that it can fulfil its particular obligations of national unity, national defence, economic management of the country, unemployment, and
the whole economic area.
Hon. Mr. lanor: What is the basis of your argument on
that?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: The basic argument for that is that
there are certain areas in which, unless they are controlled by a central government, the nation has a tendency
to fall apart. Let us consider a specific case which has
been mentioned in some newspapers-the matter of control over prices, wages, incomes, and so on. It has been
said that we have recommended there should be income
control, price control, and wage control by the government. That is not what we have said. What we have said is
that, in a case of emergency, this should be within the
federal power, because it is impossible for the central
government in an emergency to take the steps required to
hold the country together if it does not have that power.
At the moment, that power is a provincial power. We
propose that it be a federal power, because we feel the

SENATE DEBATES

central government is the only government that can use it
effectively. It would be impossible for a Canadian government to take steps similar to those taken by the United
States government last summer. If the provinces do not
agree, it cannot be done.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Was there no evidence at all before the
committee to the contrary, that the federal government,
under the British North America Act, might have that
power?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: We recognize that this can be a controversial matter. My colleague, Senator Forsey, might
disagree on this issue, but in the committee's view it is not
sufficiently clear and it should be clarified, so that we
know where we stand. I admit it is not fully clear, and for
that reason it should be cleared up. It is our feeling also
that unless the federal government has these powers the
provinces can keep on moving into federal fields and we
may end up with an impossible situation.
On the other hand, we have recommended that those
things that can best be done at provincial levels should be
left in provincial hands. One recommendation in this area
is the field of social policy. Many of the programs, such as
family allowances and old age pensions, should be left in
the hands of the provinces. That is, a greater flexibility
should be left in the hands of the provinces rather than
centralized in the federal government. The provinces
should know best their particular circumstances, and they
should be given the opportunity to make changes in the
system, and should not be tied in.
Hon. Mr. Croll: How do you provide for uniformity?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: The provisional arrangement for uniformity is that the federal government will propose a
certain figure, and the provinces would be allowed to
move a certain percentage point from that figure. There
would still be a certain base, but if a province felt it would
like to put more money into family allowances and less
into old age pensions, or vice versa, it would be allowed to
do so. This would provide for flexibility as the province
would know best what is required within its domain.
There would be a certain percentage base below which it
could not go. The provinces would have more flexibility
than they have at present.
Honourable senators, I shall merely touch on a few of
the other recommendations, as time is moving on. Basically, we have approved the amendment formula recommended at the Victoria Conference. Again, there was not
unanimity on this, but it is a compromise that is acceptable to the provinces, and one on which we should
proceed.
In the case of native peoples, the general recommendations made to us are represented in our recommendations.
The feeling is that the native peoples want to be consulted
much more before changes are made by government, and
they want recognition. We specifically recommend that
the preamble to the new constitution re-affirm the special
place of native peoples, including the Métis in Canadian
life. We specify the Métis because it is our feeling that in
many cases they are the forgotten people in our country.
The question of the Bill of Rights produced a great deal
of discussion. The committee came down on the side of a
formal Bill of Rights in the Constitution.
[Hon. Mr. Molgat.]

March 21, 1972

On the question of language rights, the committee
recommended strongly the re-affirmation of Canada as a
bilingual country, with equal rights of English and French
specifically for three of the provinces where there are
substantial groups of English- and French-speaking people-New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec, and that each
of the other provinces, by its own decision, could declare
itself to be a bilingual province also.
We affirmed clearly that we believe Canada is a multicultural country and that other language groups be
given specific rights from the legislation standpoint where
certain provinces choose to do so, and the federal government should in those cases participate in any additional
cost.
We recognize the problem of regional disparities and we
recommend that these be recognized in the Constitution,
that Canada formally declare itself in favour of correcting
the regional disparities that exist.
Honourable senators, much of the speculation prior to
the issue of the report was around certain other aspects of
our considerations. One of these was obviously the question of the head of state. On this one we heard many
representations across the country, and I have to say that
there is widespread disagreement on the question of the
head of state. The committee-this is again a majority
view-recommends there should be a Canadian head of
state, but it does not recommend there should be an
immediate change. There is recognition that this is at the
moment a matter on which Canadians are extremely
divided.
As was the case at the Quebec Conference, the question
of the Senate and Senate reform took up a large portion
of the time of the committee. The recommendations that
are put forward represent the majority view.
0 (2150)

Hon. Mr. Choquette: I think they made an awful mess
on that question. I will talk on that later, but the Senate
could be abolished tomorrow if that ever came into effect.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Well, Senator Choquette, these are the
various points of view which we heard across Canada. At
any rate, it was our opinion, after listening to these various points of view and as a result of our own discussions
and analyses, that it was wise for the Senate to reduce its
veto power.. We felt that the unlimited veto power which
presently exists is an anomaly when you consider that the
Senate is not an elected house but is an appointed house.
We felt that it could properly perform its work with a
suspensive veto power rather than a total veto power. The
question of the amount of time-whether it should be a
suspension for six months or 12 months, as in the British
House of Lords-is obviously open for discussion, but by
and large we did not find much disagreement with the
idea that it should be a suspensive veto.
We recommended that the investigative powers of the
Senate should be expanded and made more use of. This is
a continuation of a process that actually exists.
The question of the numbers of senators also arose.
There was a very definite feeling repeated most frequently in western Canada and in the Territories that those
regions were under-represented in the Senate. It may not
be as evident to people from the more highly populated

March 21, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

areas, such as Ontario and Quebec, but I can tell you that
in the smaller provinces the question of Senate representation is, indeed, a factor of importance.
Thus, the final recommendation is that there should be
no change in the present representation in the Senate for
the Maritimes and eastern Canada, but that there should
be an increase in representation for western Canada and
there should be representation for the Yukon and the
Northwest Territories.
Hon. Mr. lInor: In other words, you would increase the
representation to those provinces which last came into
confederation. Is that right?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: No. We recommend no change in Newfoundland or any of the Maritime provinces. We recommend no change in Ontario and Quebec. The traditional
structure of 24 in Ontario, 24 in Quebec and 24 for the
Maritimes, plus the addition of six when Newfoundland
came in, is unchanged. But the west, which has been
considered so far simply as one region having a representation of 24 senators, should, we feel, be considered as two
regions having a total representation of 48 senators, while
the Yukon and the Northwest Territories should have a
representation of two senators each.
Hon. Mr. lanor: Senator Molgat, would you be good
enough to tell us what sections of Nova Scotia you visited?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I must admit, Senator Isnor, that I was
not a member of the committee when it went to Nova
Scotia. However, the places the committee visited were
Antigonish, Halifax, Sydney and Wolfville.
Hon. Mr. Smith: There was nothing else to visit.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Another matter concerning the Senate
is the change in the appointment method. This was again
a subject of great discussion-whether it should be an
elected Senate, or be appointed by another group, or
whether there should be no change at ail. In the final
analysis the committee recommended that the method of
appointment should remain in the hands of the federal
government because it is a federal institution. But the
committee felt that there should be regional input to the
extent that for half of the senators there would be a slate
recommended by provincial governments presented to the
federal government for choice.
The other changes, then, are of a relatively minor
nature. We recommended that the personal requirements
be changed simply to be those for an elector. We recommended that the retirement age be reduced from age 75 to
age 70 in accordance with the present judicial structure.
Of course, this would not affect present sitting senators
but would apply to senators appointed henceforth. We
further recommended that senators, upon retirement,
would retain the title and precedence of senators and
would be able to participate in the work of the Senate and
that of its committees where required, although there
would be no indemnity.

181

Hon. Mr. Choquette: They would get their expenses, I
hope.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I have already covered the matters of
division of powers and social policy. One further area
which I should like to touch upon tonight is the question
of municipalities. This was probably the matter most frequently brought before the committee at our hearings.
There is a feeling that the municipalities in this country
do not have adequate sources of revenue to match their
responsibilities. It is fair to say that at none of our hearings was this case not made. It was particularly made to
us by the large cities. In fact, we heard representations
that we should be thinking of city states; that we should
be looking at a three-level government structure on virtually an equal basis; that we should put the municipalities
into direct contact with the federal government, and so
on. However, after full consideration our committee finally recommended that there should be more consultation
but that in the final analysis the municipalities are creatures of the provincial governments. We felt that while
there should be meetings held among the three levels of
government, and, thus, more consultation, nevertheless,
the municipal structure is basically a provincial creation
and that that structure should remain so at least for the
time being.
Honourable senators, I do not think there is any need
for me to elucidate many more of the other recommendations. You can simply read them in the report. I merely
wanted to highlight what is in that report and I believe I
have done that.
I repeat that we did not expect unanimity. In fact, I am
surprised that we were able to reach agreement on as
many points as we did, when you consider the great
variety of points of view that exist in our country and the
tremendous variation in the problems that exist from one
end of the country to the other. We do not claim that this
document is perfect. We do believe that it is a good base
from which to start again the discussions on constitutionai matters in Canada.
We felt that after the conference in Victoria and what
flowed from that, a hait in the discussions at this time
would be detrimental to Canada, particularly if the various parties concerned in constitutional matters were to
retire to their respective places and not conduct any further discussions.
It is our opinion that the dialogue must continue. It is
our hope that our report and its recommendations will
give a new start to the discussions and provide a further
opportunity for debate on the part of governments and of
the public on this vital issue for the future of Canada.

SUMMARY 0F RECOMMENDATIONS
CONTAINED IN THE FINAL REPORT 0F THE
SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION 0F CANADA

PART I-THE CONSTITUTION
Chapter 1-ConstitutionalImperatives
1. Canada should have a new and distinctively Canadian Constitution, one which would be a new whole
even though it would utilize many of the sanie parts.
2. A new Canadian Constitution should be based on
functional considerations, which would lead to greater decentralization of governmental powers in al
areas touching culture and social policy and to
greater centralization in powers which have important economlic effects at the national level. Functional
considerations also require greater decentralization
in many areas of governniental administration.
of
Chapter 4-Patriation the Constitution
3. The Canadian Constitution should be patriated by a
procedure which would provide for a simultaneous
proclamation of a new Constitution by Canada and
the renunciation by Britain of ail jurisdiction over
the Canadian Constitution.
Chapter5-Amendments to the Constitution

PART II-THE PEOPLE
Chapter 7-Self-Determinatiort
6. The preamble of the Constitution should recognize
that the Canadian federation is based on the liberty
of the person and the protection of basic human
rights as a fundamental and essential purpose of the
State. Consequently, the preamble should also recognize that the existence of Canadian society rests on
the free consent of its citizens and their collective will
to live together, and that any differences among
them should be settled by peaceful means.
7. If the citizens of a part of Canada at some tume
democratically declared themselves in favour of a
political arrangement which were contrary to the
continuation of our present political structures, the
disagreement should be resolved by political negotiation, not by the use of milltary or other coercive
force.
8. We reaffirm our conviction that ail of the peoples of
Canada can achieve their aspirations more effectively within a federal systeni, and we believe Canadians
should strive to maintain such a system.
Chapter8-Native Peoples

4. The formula for amending the Constitution should
be that contained in the Victoria Charter of June
1971, which requires the agreement of the Federal
Parliament and a majority of the Provincial Legisiatures, including those of:

9. No constitutional. changes concerning native peoples
should be made until such time as their own organizations have completed their research into the question of treaty and aboriginal rights in Canada.

(a) every province which at any tume has contained
twenty-five per cent of the population of Canada;

10. The preamble of the new Constitution should affirm
the special place of native peoples, including Métis,
in Canadian life.

(b) at least two Atlantic Provinces;
(c) at least two Western Provinces that have a conibined population of at least fifty percent of the
population of ail the Western Provinces.
Chapter 6-The Preamble to the Constitution
5. The Canadian Constitution should have a preamble
which would proclaim the basic objectives of
Canadian federal democracy.

11. Provincial governments should, where the population is sufficient, consider recognizing Indian languages as regional languages.
12. No jurisdictional changes should be made in
administrative arrangements concerning Indians and
Eskimos wîthout consultation with them.
Chapter 9-FundamentalRights
13. Canada should have a Bih of Rights entrenched in
the Constitution, guaranteeing the political freedoms

with courts in New Brunswick, Ontario, Quebec
and the Territories;

14. The Bill of Rights should include a provision requiring fair and equitable representation in the House of
Commons and in the Provincial Legislatures.

(d) the right to communicate in either official language with Federal departments and agencies and
with provincial departmental head offices or
agency head offices in New Brunswick, Ontario,

15. The right to citizenship, once legally acquired, should
be made inalienable under the Bill of Rights.

Quebec and the Territories.

16. The individual person should be constitutionally protected in his life, liberty and the security of his
person so as not to be deprived thereof except in
accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

24. All of the rights in recommendation 23 (b) (c) and (d)

17. The individual person should be constitutionally protected against the arbitrary seizure of his property,
except
for the
public
good
and
for just
compensation.

(b) in any Province where the legislature declares
French and English the official languages of the
province.

18. The Constitution should prohibit discrimination by
reason of sex, race, ethnic origin, colour or religion
by proclaiming the right of the individual to equal
treatment by law.
19. Discrimination in employment, or in membership in
professional, trade or other occupational associations, or in obtaining public accommodation and services, or in owning, renting or holding property
should also be declared contrary to the Bill of Rights.
20. Other provisions already contained in the Canadian
Bill of Rights (1960) protecting legal rights should
also be included in the Constitutional Bill of Rights:
protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be informed promptly of the
reason for arrest, the right to counsel, the right to
habeas corpus, protection against self-crimination,
the right to a fair hearing, the right to be presumed
innocent and not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause, the right to an interpreter, the proscribing of retroactive penal laws or punishments,
and the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual
punishment.
21. The rights and freedoms recognized by the Bill of
Rights should not be interpreted as absolute and
unlimited, but should rather be exercisable to the
extent that they are reasonably justifiable in a democratic society.
Chapter 10-Language Rights
22. French and English should be constitutionally
entrenched as the two official languages of Canada.
23. The Constitution should recognize:
(a) the right of any person to use either official
language in the Federal and Provincial Legislatures and the Territorial Councils;
(b) the right to have access in both official languages to the legislative records, journals, and
enactments of Canada, New Brunswick, Ontario,
Quebec and the Territories;
(c) the right to use either official language in dealing with judicial or quasi-judicial Federal bodies or

should also be exercisable in:

(a) any Province where each language is the
mother tongue of ten per cent of the population;

25. The Constitution should recognize parents' right to
have English or French provided as their child's
main language of instruction in publicly supported
schools in areas where the language of their choice is
chosen by a sufficient number of persons to justify
the provision of the necessary facilities.
26. We support the general objective of making French
the working language in Quebec. We hope that
through the studies being carried out in Quebec on
this matter, this objective can be reached with due
respect for certain Quebec Anglophone institutions,
and taking into account the North American and
world reality.
27. The preamble to the Constitution should formally
recognize that Canada is a multicultural country.
28. The Constitution should explicitly recognize the right
of Provincial Legislatures to confer equivalent status
with the English and French languages on other languages. Federal financial assistance to support the
teaching or use of other languages would be
appropriate.
Chapter 11-Regional Disparities
29. The equitable distribution of income should be
recognized in the preamble of the Constitution as a
dynamic and humane objective of our social policy.
Consequently, we agree with the principle stated in
the Victoria Charter that:
The Parliament and Government of Canada and
the Legislatures and Governments of the Provinces
are committed to ... the promotion of equality of
opportunity and well-being for all individuals in
Canada.
30. We agree with the statement in the Victoria Charter
that:
The Parliament and Government of Canada and
the Legislatures and Governments of the Provinces
are committed to. . . the assurance, as nearly as possible, that essential public services of reasonable
quality are available to all individuals in Canada.
This objective should be recognized
amble of the Constitution.

in the pre-

March 21, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

31. The preamble of the Constitution should provide that
every Canadian should have access to adequate
Federal, Provincial and municipal services without
having to bear a disproportionate tax burden
because of the region in which he lives. This recommendation follows logically from our acceptance of
the principle of equality of opportunity for all
Canadians.
32. We completely accept the following objective as
stated in the Victoria Charter:
The promotion of economic development to reduce
disparities in the social and economic opportunities
for all individuals in Canada wherever they may
live.
As in the case of redistribution of income among
individuals and for the same reasons, this objective
should be recognized in the preamble of the
Constitution.
PART III-FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS
Chapter 12-The Head of State
33. Because of the state of divided opinion in Canada,
the Committee does not recommend any change in
the monarchical system at the present time.
34. The Committee itself prefers a Canadian as Head of
State, and supports the evolutionary process by
which the Governor General has been granted more
functions as the Head of State for Canada. Eventually, the question of retaining or abolishing the
Monarchy will have to be decided by way of clear
consultation with the Canadian people.
Chapter 13-The Senate
35. The present full veto power of the Senate over legislation should be reduced to a suspensive veto for six
months according to the following formula: a bill
may become law without the consent of the Senate
(1) if the House of Commons, having once passed it,
passes it again no less than six months after it was
rejected or finally amended by the Senate, or, (2) if,
within 6 months of third reading of a bill by the
House of Commons the Senate has not completed
consideration of it, and the House of Commons again
passes it at any time after the expiration of the 6
months, but any period when Parliament is prorogued or dissolved shall not be counted in computing
the 6 months.
36. The investigating role of the Senate, which has
gained more importance in receñt years, should be
continued and expanded at the initiative of the
Senate itself, and the Government should also make
more use of the Senate in this way.
37. The Government should be entitled to introduce in
the Senate all bills including money bills but excluding appropriation bills, before their approval by the
House of Commons, provided that, in the case of
money bills, they should be introduced by the leader
of the Government in the Senate on behalf of the
Government.

38. The distribution of Senators should be as follows:
Newfoundland 6, Prince Edward Island 4, Nova
Scotia 10, New Brunswick 10, Quebec 24, Ontario 24,
Manitoba 12, Saskatchewan 12, Alberta 12, Britisb
Columbia 12, the Yukon Territory 2, and the Northwest Territories 2: a total of 130.
39. All Senators should continue to be appointed by the
Federal Government: as vacancies occur in the present Senate, one-half of the Senators from each Province and Territory should be appointed in the same
manner as at present; the other half from each Province and Territory should be appointed by the Federal Government from a panel of nominees submitted
by the appropriate Provincial or Territorial
Government.
40. The personal requirements for appointment to the
Senate should be limited to those required for eligibility as an elector in the Canada Elections Act, plus
residence in the province for which a Senator is
appointed. The Quebec structure of electoral divisions should be abolished.
41. The compulsory retirement age for all new senators
should be seventy years. Upon retirement, Senators
should retain the right to the title and precedence of
Senators and the right to participate in the work of
the Senate or of its Committee, but not the right to
vote or to receive the indemnity of Senators.
Chapter14-The House of Commons
42. The mechanism of redistribution of seats in the
House of Commons as well as the limitations implied
in the 15 per cent rule and the Senate rule should be
retained in the Constitution. The formula of
representation, however, subject to our recommendations on the Bill of Rights, should be the exclusive
prerogative of the House of Commons, to be dealt
with by ordinary legislation.
43. Every House of Commons should continue for four
years, from the day of the return of the writs for
choosing the House and no longer, provided that, and
notwithstanding any Royal Prerogative, the Governor General should have the power to dissolve Parliament during that period:
(1) when the Government is defeated
(a) on a motion expressing no confidence in the
Government; or
(b) on a vote on a specific bill or portion of a bill
which the Government has previously declared
should be construed as a motion of want of confidence; or
(2) when the House of Commons passes a resolution requesting dissolution of Parliament.
Chapter15-The Supreme Court of Canada
44. The existence, independence and structure of the
Supreme Court of Canada should be provided for in
the Constitution.

186

SENATE DEBATES

45. Consultation with the Provinces on appointments to
the Supreme Court of Canada must take place. We
generally support the methods of consultation proposed in the Victoria Charter, but the Provinces
should also be allowed to make nominations to the
nominating councils which would be set up under the
Victoria proposals if the Attorney-General of Canada
and the Attorney-General of a province fail to agree
on an appointee.
46. The Provinces should be given the right to withdraw
appeals in matters of strictly provincial law from the
Supreme Court of Canada and to vest final decision
on such matters in their own highest courts, thus
leaving to the Supreme Court of Canada jurisdiction
over matters of Federal law and of constitutional
law, including the Bill of Rights. The issue of whether a matter was one of strictly provincial law would
be subject to determination by the Supreme Court of
Canada.
Chapter 16-The National CapitalArea
47. There should be a movement by stages towards the
possible creation of an autonomous Canadian
Capital.
48. The Canadian Capital should be generally the areas
of Ontario and of Quebec now defined in the
schedule to the National Capital Act (1959).
PART IV-THE GOVERNMENTS
Chapter17-The Division of Powers
49. The use of exclusive lists of Federal and Provincial
powers, but with an extended list of concurrent
powers, should be continued.
50. Concurrent powers which predominantly affect the
national interest should grant paramountcy to the
Federal Parliament and those which predominantly
affect Provincial or local interests should grant paramountcy to the Provincial legislatures.
51. The Constitution should permit the delegation of
executive and administrative powers (as at present),
but not of legislative powers except where expressly
specified in this Report.
Chapter 18-The
Parliament

General

Legislative

Power

of

52. The "Peace, Order, and good Government" power
should be retained in the Constitution as an expression of the overriding Federal legislative power over
matters of a national nature.
53. Since the Federal General Legislative Power is counterbalanced by a Provincial power over matters of a
Provincial or local nature, there is no place for a
purely residuary power.
Chapter19-Taxing Powers
54. Generally speaking and subject to recommendation
55, we endorse the principle that the Federal and

March 21, 1972

Provincial Governments should have access to all
fields of taxation. However, in order to bring about a
division of revenues that may accurately reflect the
priorities of each government, there should be Federal-Provincial consultations to determine the most
equitable means of apportioning joint fields of taxation in the light of:
(a) the projected responsibilities of each level of
government in the immediate future;
(b) the anticipated increases in their respective
expenditures;
(c) economic and administrative limitations, such
as preserving sufficient leverage for the Federal
Government, by means of its taxation system, to
discharge effectively its function of managing the
economy.
55. Provincial legislatures should have the right to
impose indirect taxes provided that they do not
impede interprovincial or international trade and do
not fall on persons resident in other Provinces. These
limitations could be satisfied by tax collection
through an interprovincial or Federal-Provincial collection agency, or by tax collection agreements.
Chapter20-The Federal Spending Power
56. The power of the Federal Parliament to make conditional grants for general Federal-Provincial (sharedcost) programs should be subject to the establishment of a national consensus both for the institution
of any new program and for the continuation of any
existing one. A consensus would be established by
the affirmative vote of the Legislatures in three of
the four regions of Canada according to the following formula: the vote of the Legislatures in the Atlantic region would be considered to be in the affirmative if any two of the Legislatures of Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick or Newfoundland were in favour;
the vote of the Legislatures of the Western region
would be considered to be in the affirmative with the
agreement of any two of the four Legislatures. The
consensus for existing joint programs should be
tested every 10 years.
57. If a Province does not wish to participate in a program for which there is a national consensus, the
Federal Government should pay the Government of
that Province a sum equal to the amount it would
have cost the Federal Government to implement the
program in the Province. However, a tax collection
fee of about 1 per cent, equivalent to the cost of
collecting the money paid to the Province, should be
deducted from the amount paid to such non-participating Provinces.
58. In order that the objectives of joint programs may be
more effectively realized, conditional Federal grants
should preferably be based on the cost of the programs in each Province. However, since a 50-50 costsharing formula, when applied to the expenditures
made in each Province, constitutes too great an
incentive in high-income Provinces, conditional Federal grants should not be made for that portion of
Provincial expenditures which lies above the national average cost of the service. The maximum per

March 2,1, 19,712

SENATE DEBATES

capita amount to which a Province would be entitled
would thus correspond to the per capita national
expenditure, and additional expenditures by a Provincial Government would in no way increase the
Federal grant to that Province.
Chapter21-IntergovernmentalRelations
59. More communication and fuller cooperation among
all levels of government are imperative needs. The
achievement of these ends involves the improvement
and simplification of the means of liaison and, where
necessary, the creation of new mechanisms.
60. The Constitution should provide for a Federal-Provincial Conference of First Ministers to be called by
the Prime Minister of Canada at least once a year
unless in any year a majority of the First Ministers
decide to dispense with the Conference.
61. The Federal Government should appoint a Minister
of State for Intergovernmental Affairs to respond to
the political challenges and opportunities resulting
from closer intergovernmental relationships.
62. A permanent Federal-Provincial secretariat for
intergovernmental relations should be established.
63. A tri-level conference among Federal, Provincial and
Municipal governments should be called at least once
a year.
Chapter 22-Municipalities
64. While we recognize the difficulties of larger cities in
providing for their needs, financing their programs
and determining their own priorities, as well as in
negotiating with the Provincial and Federal Governments on works which seriously affect municipal
planning, and also their need for more status and
more autonomy in order to achieve these goals, we
do not see how these matters can be entrenched in
the Constitution. They should be negotiated between
the cities and the Provincial Governments under
whose jurisdiction they fall.
65. The municipalities in each Province, in conjunction
with their provincial and national bodies, should
determine
which
representatives
from what
municipalities would attend the annual tri-level conferences we have recommended in Recommendation
63.
66. Such tri-level meetings would not have the power of
veto over any Federal or Provincial programs but
would rather operate by way of moral suasion.
67. In the light of the injustice done municipalities by
their having to rely on the property tax for the bulk
of their revenue, there should be a sharing of tax
fields between Governments that would allow
municipalities direct access to other sources of
revenue.
68. Where feasible, representatives of municipalities
should meet with other levels of government to discuss common problems particularly in the area of
economic planning through representation at meet-

ings of the Ministers of Finance and Provincial
Treasurers.
Chapter23-The Territories
69. The objective of Government policy for the Yukon
and the Northwest Territories should be the fostering of self-government and provincial status.
70. The provisions of the British North America Act,
1871, section 2, which provide for the admission of
new provinces by action of the Federal Government
alone, should be continued, provided that no territory should become a province without its consent.
71. The Yukon and the Northwest Territories should
each be entitled to representation in the Senate.
Chapter24-Offshore MineralRights
72. The Federal Government should have proprietary
rights over the seabed offshore to the limit of Canada's internationally recognized jurisdiction, and the
Federal Parliament should have full legislative jurisdiction over this subject matter.
73. There should be no constitutional provision as to the
sharing of the profits from the exploitation of seabed
resources. Nevertheless, we feel strongly that the
Federal Government should share the profits of
seabed development equally with the adjacent coastal Province rather than with all of the Provinces.
74. Sable Island should be recognized by the Constitution as part of the Province of Nova Scotia.
Chapter25-InternationalRelations
75. Section 132 of the British North America Act should
be repealed.
76. The Constitution should make it clear that: the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction over foreign policy, the making of treaties, and the exchange
of diplomatic and consular representatives.
77. All formal treaties should be ratified by Parliament
rather than by the Executive Branch of Government.
78. The Government of Canada should, before binding
itself to perform under a treaty an obligation that
deals with a matter falling within the legislative
competence of the Provinces, consult with the Government of each Province that may be affected by
the obligation.
79. The Government of a Province should remain free
not to take any action with respect to an obligation
undertaken by the Government of Canada under a
treaty unless it has agreed to do so.
80. Subject to a veto power in the Government of
Canada in the exercise of its exclusive power with
respect to foreign policy, the Provincial Governments should have the right to enter into contracts,
and administrative, reciprocal and other arrangements with foreign states, or constituent parts of
foreign states, to maintain offices abroad for the
conduct of Provincial business, and generally to

188

SENATE DEBATES

cooperate with the Government of Canada in its
international activities.

PART V-SOCIAL POLICY
Chapter 26-Social Security
81. In the area of social security, there should be
a greater decentralization of jurisdiction with a
view to giving priority to the Provinces according to
recommendations 82, 83 and 84.
82. With respect to social services, the present exclusive
jurisdiction of Provincial Legislatures should be
retained.
83. With respect to income insurance (including the
Quebec and Canada Pension Plans), jurisdiction
should be shared according to the present section
94A of the British North America Act, subject to the
following exceptions:
(1) Workmen's Compensation should be retained
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Provincial
Legislatures;
(2) Unemployment Insurance should be retained
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Canadian
Parliament.
84. With respect to income support measures:
(1) Financial social assistance (Canada Assistance
Plan, allowances to the blind, disability allowances,
unemployment assistance) should be under the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Provincial Legislatures;
(2) Veterans' allowances
and allowances to
Eskimos and Indians living on reserves should continue to be the exclusive responsibility of the
Canadian Parliament;
(3) Demographic grants (old age pensions, family
allowances and youth allowances) and guaranteed
income payments (guaranteed income supplement)
should be matters of concurrent jurisdiction with
limited Provincial paramountcy as to the scale of
benefits and the allocation of Federal funds among
these income support programs. Thus the Federal
Parliament would retain concurrent power to
establish programs and to pay benefits to individuals under these programs. However, a Province
would have the right to vary the national scheme
established by Parliament with respect to the allocation within the Province between the various
programs of the total amount determined by the
Federal Government and with respect to the scale
of benefits paid to individuals within the Province
according to income, number of children, etc.,
within each program; provided that the benefits
paid to individuals under each program should not
be less than a certain percentage (perhaps half or
two-thirds) of the amounts which would be paid
under the scheme proposed by the Federal
Government.

March 2L. 1972
March 21. 1972

Law
Chapter27-Criinial
85. Since we believe that each Province should be able to
regulate the conduct of its own people in such matters as the operation of motor vehicles, Sunday
observance, betting and lotteries, the Federal Parliament should have the right to delegate even to a
single Province legislative jurisdiction over any part
of the criminal law.
86. Because there is some ambiguity resulting from current practice, if not from the Constitution, the Federal power over the administration of criminal justice
should be made clear so that the Federal Parliament
would be seen to have clear and undoubted jurisdiction to enforce its own laws in the criminal field.

Chapter28-Marriageand Divorce
87. In keeping with our principle of control by the Provinces of their social destiny, the jurisdiction over
"Marriage and Divorce" should be transferred to the
Provincial Legislatures, subject to an agreed
common defintion of domicile.

Chapter29-Education
88. Education as such should remain an exclusively Provincial power as at present, subject to the guarantees
for minorities set out elsewhere in this Report.
89. The Provinces should create a permanent office for
cooperation and coordination in education, and Federal participation should be confined to the area of
Federal jurisdiction over the education of native peoples, immigrants, and defence personnel
and
dependents.

Chapter 30-Communications
90. The Parliament of Canada should retain exclusive
jurisdiction over the means in broadcasting and
other systems of communication.
91. The Provinces should have exclusive jurisdiction
over the program content in provincial educational
broadcasting, whatever means of communication is
employed.

PART VI-THE REGULATION OF THE ECONOMY
Chapter 31-Economic Policy
92. The Federal Parliament and Government should
retain the primary responsibility for general economic policy designed to achieve national economic
goals. This means that they must have sufficient
economic powers to regulate the economy through
structural, monetary and fiscal policies.

March 2.1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

93. National economic policies should take more account
of regional objectives through coordinating mechanisms between governments and through considerable administrative decentralization in the operation
of the Federal Government and its agencies.
94. Provincial and municipal governments should also
take more account of national economic objectives.
Chapter32-Trade and Commerce
95. Parliament should have exclusive jurisdiction over
international and interprovincial trade and commerce, including the instrumentalities of such trade
and commerce. Intraprovincial trade and commerce
should remain under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Legislatures.
Chapter33-Income Controls
96. In cases of national emergency, as defined by the
Parliament of Canada, the Provinces should delegate
to the Federal Parliament all additional powers
necessary to control prices, wages and other forms of
income, including rent, dividends and profits, to
implement its prime responsibility for full employment and balanced economic growth.
Chapter34-Securities and FinancialInstitutions
97. The matter of securities regulation, which has hitherto been under provincial jurisdiction, should become
a concurrent jurisdiction with paramountcy in the
Federal Parliament.
98. Where financial institutions (trust companies, insurance companies, finance companies, credit unions,
caisses populaires) do business in more than one
province, they should have to meet national standards as defined by the Federal Parliament; where
they confine their activities to a single province, the
Province should retain exclusive jurisdiction.

Chapter35-Competition
99. The Federal Parliament ought to have a concurrent
power with the Provincial Legislatures over competition in order that the regulation of unfair competition in all its aspects be subject to the national interest. In the event of conflicting legislation, the federal
legislation should be paramount.
Chapter 36-Air and Water Pollution
100. Control over the pollution of air and water should be
a matter of concurrent jurisdiction between the Provincial Legislatures and the Federal Parliament, and,
as in section 95 of the British North America Act, the
powers of the Federal Parliament should be
paramount.
101. The concurrency of jurisdiction over the air and
water pollution would necessitate both Federal-Provincial and Province-to-Province planning and coordination of programs.
102. We endorse the work of the Resources Ministers
Council as a means of continuing consultation on
matters of renewable resources.
Chapter 37-Foreign Ownership and Canadian Independence
103. The power of the Federal Parliament with respect to
aliens should be clarified to ensure that Parliament
has paramount power to deal with problems of foreign ownership.
104. The Federal Parliament should have the clear power
to nationalize industry and expropriate land threatened by foreign takeovers or control contrary to the
national interest.
105. The Federal Parliament should have jurisdiction
over citizenship, and that power should include the
power to promote national unity and a national spirit
and to create institutions for these purposes.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
PACIFIC REGION STUDY-REPORT OF COMMITTEE
TABLED
Hon. John B. Aird: Honourable senators, I have the
honour to present the report of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs respecting Canadian relations
with the countries of the Pacific region. With leave of the
Senate, I should like to make a few remarks at this time.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Aird: Honourable senators, in tabling this
report I do not intend to make a lengthy statement. At this
time there is no need to dwell on how much the Pacific
region has shifted to the centre of the world stage in the 16
months since the committee began its study. However, I
do believe that a few remarks should be made and are in
order and that some salient points should be emphasized.
Several weeks ago the attention of the whole world was
riveted on Peking, as the leaders of two superpowers
broke through 20 years of confrontation and hostility to
begin a process of communication and negotiation. Just
16 months ago it would have been impossible to even
suggest that such a meeting could occur. Now it would be
foolhardy to predict where this process may eventually
lead. It is clear, however, that the profile of the post-war
world is irrevocably changed. Accelerated change is
coming at a whirlwind pace and a great deal of it is
centered in the Pacific. Of course, Canada has been more
than just an interested bystander in observing China's
re-emergence into an increasing participation in the world
community. We have had substantial and mutually beneficial trade relations with the People's Republic for more
than a decade. Our exchange of diplomatic recognition in
October 1970 was one of the first sure signs that the
barriers were coming down. However, the Canadian role
must be kept in perspective and accordingly the committee has been realistically modest and accurate about it. At
the same time, the report does note that Canada is still the
only developed country of the Pacific region which enjoys
the full range of interstate relations with China. In this
light, the committee believes that Canada can continue to
play a useful contributory role in the search for normalization and stability in the Pacific.
* (1410)

In the months preceding this dramatic breakthrough in
Chinese-American relations, the International Monetary

System was going through its most drastic shake-up in
decades. One aspect of this shake-up which should be
stressed is that the international trading community has
been forced to face squarely the "economic miracle" of
post-war Japan. The implications for Canada are very
important, and they constitute one of the main concerns
in this report.
Also, in Canada's bilateral economic relations with
Japan, 1971 was indeed a remarkable year. Japanese
exports to Canada increased by approximately 38 per
cent, while Canadian exports-to Japan decreased slightly.
The result was a dramatic reversal of the pattern of
recent years in which Canada has enjoyed a substantial
dollar surplus in its trade with Japan.
However, another characteristic
pattern has not
changed. The great bulk of our imports from Japan are
fully manufactured products, while most of our exports to
that country are virtually unprocessed raw materials. The
committee has taken a firm position on this issue. The
report states:
It is no longer economically desirable (or perhaps
necessary) for as much as 65 per cent of Canadian
exports to be shipped to Japan in their rawest transportable and least profitable form.
There is also an obvious need for the diversification of
our exports to Japan to include a much larger proportion
of fully manufactured goods. The fact that less than 3 per
cent of our exports to that country are in the form of end
products is clearly unacceptable.
The report points out that there is no simple cause for
this situation, but that remedial action is urgently needed.
The committee was gratified to see that these problems
were the main concerns of the Canadian Economic Mission which visited Japan in January of 1972. It is significant that this mission, headed by the Honourable JeanLuc Pepin, was the largest that Canada has ever sent
anywhere in the world.
The impressive composition of this mission also testified to the growing realization that we must not only
continue to press for the removal of official obstacles to
our exports, but that Canadian exporting industries must
show more dynamism and aggressiveness if they are to
achieve any significant foothold in this highly competitive
market.
Many of these comments apply, as well, to our other
markets in the Pacific region. Nothing can be taken for
granted and the committee suggests that perhaps too
much has been. For example, as the report points out:
"Canadians too often underestimate the importance of
their economic relations with Australia and New Zealand." Solid effort will be needed to maintain these sizeable and reliable markets once the Commonwealth preference system comes to an end. In addition, honourable
senators, while there is every reason for optimism that
Canada will maintain its place in the Chinese market, this
should certainly never be automatically assumed.

March 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

In all the new Pacifie markets the same general situation prevails. In this region Canada faces the stiffest possible competition, often from well established suppliers.
The committee's report urges the government to provide
encouragement to Canadian exporters fully comparable
with that provided by competitor countries. More co-operation and co-ordination between industry and government
will be vital, and the report suggests some basic re-thinking as to how this can be achieved.
I have focused in these remarks on Canada's economic
interests in the Pacific because at present these trade
concerns are the most prominent factor in our relations
with Pacific countries. Some of the problems the committee has identified, however, are much broader in their
scope. The first chapter of the report is concerned with
"awareness and understanding." In that chapter, the committee notes that "Pacifie Asia is probably the least f amiliar to Canadians of all the world's great zones of civilization." Unless and until we as a nation learn a great deal
more about these countries and their peoples, we shall
only be able to play a limited and peripheral role in the
Pacifie community. As a first priority, then, the committee recommends a program of specific and concrete measures to increase Canadian awareness and understanding.
Not only must we learn about the Pacifie countries, we
must also learn from them. The committee considered
that the recent Canadian Science and Technology Mission
to Japan, headed by the Honourable Alastair Gillespie,
was an important initiative in this regard. The agreements
reached by this mission give every indication that our
expectations were justified.
I have referred to the prospect of new and broader roles
for Canada in the Pacifie community. The committee
gave a great deal of consideration as to how Canada can
best contribute to the peace, stability and shared prosperity of this region. In essence, we recommend a contribution
based closely on Canadian capabilities. The committee
did not foresee the need for any extensive Canadian military role in this region, nor the desirability of Canadian
participation in any bilateral or multilateral Pacifie
alliance.
Instead, the report urges that Canada mobilize its abundant economie and human resources to help attack the
root causes of tension and instability in the Pacifie. I am
referring, of course, to the need for development assistance to the less developed countries of the region. In this
field the needs are immense, and the report stresses the
requirement for selectivity in order to make the best use
of Canadian resources. In this endeavour the report
emphasizes the scope for co-operation with the other
developed countries of the region. Perhaps most important, however, the committee reiterates the view,
expressed in the report on Canada-Caribbean Relations,
that development assistance cannot be viewed as a mere
"handout" or charitable donation. Without determined
action and some sacrifice to allow the developing countries to pay their own way in the world economy, aid
programs are of dubious value. This report, therefore,
lays great stress on the need for policies and programs to
provide expanding trade opportunities to these countries
and the kind of investment which will be conducive to
their long-term economic development.

Honourable senators, I have only touched on some of
the main issues in the report at this time, but I commend it
to your further attention. It represents a genuine, collective effort. In particular, I must express my special personal appreciation for the contribution of the deputy
chairman, Senator Allister Grosart. He has been committed to this study throughout, and, as always, has played an
active and expert role. Our committee is deeply indebted
to him.
* (1420)

On behalf of the whole committee I should like also to
express the hope that this report will be given proper
attention. I must confess to some personal doubts as to
whether the expert testimony received by our committees,
their extensive analysis and their considered conclusions
and recommendations are given sufficient weight by
those responsible for the implementation of policy. The
Caribbean report is a case in point. In spite of the
enthusiastic reception given that report in all sectors of
qualified opinion, and in spite of the energetie efforts
made by Senator Paul Martin on his special mission, the
response to its recommendations has been disappointing.
Honourable senators, our committees carry out an
essential part of the work of this institution of Parliament.
I would suggest that we have a responsibility to follow up
on the performance achieved as a result of committee
recommendations. In any event, I can assure you that the
members of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign
Affairs will maintain a concerned and continuing interest
in the action taken on this report on the Pacifie region.
In conclusion, and on a personal note, I would just like
to say that I take some pride in the presentation of this
report today.
Honourable senators, I move that the report be placed
on the Orders of the Day for consideration at the next
sitting of the Senate.
Motion agreed to.

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS BILL
1972
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Martin for the second
reading of Bill C-8, to authorize the making of certain
fiscal payments to provinces, to authorize the entry into
tax collection agreements with provinces, and to amend
the Established Programs (Interim Arrangements) Act.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I have just
been to a luncheon in honour of our guests from the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and I did not have
time to read all the notes that I dictated this morning. I
shall try to do as well as the Leader of the Government
usually does with someone else's notes.
Honourable senators, the essence and the important
provisions of Bill C-8 are neither complicated nor new.
The machinery of its application remains complicated.
Some of the new provisions are merely technical. On the
other hand, it still is a very important piece of legislation.
For this reason, we are indebted to the Leader of the
Government for the lengthy and valuable explanation he
gave when he moved the second reading.
* (1430)

As he said, its principal effect will be to continue the
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act of 1967 for
another period of five years as far as equalization and
stabilization payments to provinces and the agreement
between the federal and provincial governments regarding the collection of corporate and personal income taxes
and succession duties are concerned.
Parts IV and V are new and result from the coming into
force of the new tax system. Part IV establishes the guarantee that the revenues of each province from personal
and corporate income taxes combined will, for each of the
first five years of the new tax system, be no less than they
would have been under the old system. Part V gives the
authority to the federal government to share with the
provinces revenue from a special 15 per cent tax on certain distributions of corporate surpluses.
Finally, Part VI continues for two years, until another
formula is found, the fiscal transfers by which the federal
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

March 22, 1972

government finances 50 per cent of the operating costs of
post-secondary education in Canada, under methods that
may vary from province to province.
As I mentioned, this bill will replace the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, Chapter F-6 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1970, which was passed in 1967. This
last piece of legislation succeeded the Federal-Provincial
Tax Sharing Agreement Act passed in 1959, replacing at
that time legislation enacted in July 1956. In fact, the
original Federal-Provincial Tax Sharing Agreement Act
goes back to 1952. At that time it provided for a tax return
payment to each province equal to 10 per cent of the
federal tax revenue in such province on personal income
tax, and also a payment of 9 per cent of the corporate tax
earned in such province, and, finally, 50 per cent of the
succession duties attributable to such province.
When I say that the act of 1952 was the original act, I
must warn the Senate that, in fact, the source of our
present system is to be found in the Tax Agreement Act of
1942. That act was passed during the war, and by it the
provincial governments agreed to vacate the fields of
personal and corporate income taxes and succession
duties for the duration of the war in return for the payment of defined subsidies to the provincial treasuries.
We all remember that after the war ended the federal
government was reluctant to revert to the situation prevailing before 1942, and, although the provinces at that
time could resume the imposition of taxes on personal
and corporate income and levy succession duties, the central government was able to persuade all of them, except
Quebec, to continue with the idea of a federal-fiscal compensation for their abstention from re-occupying those
taxation fields.
Of course, I am not speaking for the Leader of the
Government, who was then in the other house. If I am not
mistaken, he had at that time just become a minister of
the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Not until 1945.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Only three years later? Oh, I thought
the Prime Minister had been quicker in recognizing the
qualifications of my learned friend.
At any rate, in 1955 the Quebec government decided to
re-enter the field of personal income tax, and the federal
government made a first concession because of this. In
the case of any province which would take such action as
did Quebec, the resident of such province was authorized
to deduct from his federal income tax up to 10 per cent in
order to compensate to that extent for the income tax he
had to pay to the province. It was not long after this first
concession, and probably because of it, that the principle
of equalization was born, as it was then realized that it
was not in practice possible to go back to the pre-war
system of each government operating on its own if we
were to achieve some kind of equality in services to be
supplied by the provinces.
The merit of these equalization payments is, of course,
that they are unconditional and do not interfere with the
discretion of the provincial governments in the use they
can make of them. That is probably the reason why
Quebec, which had until then been so much opposed to
the continuation of the wartime fiscal arrangements,

March 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

agreed that the establishment of the equalization payments was a worthwhile improvement.
We have gone a long way from the act of 1956, but other
than in this particular field of equalization, the fiscal
jungle in Canada, I suggest, has grown thicker. The principles of the spending and taxing powers of both levels of
government are harder to define today than they ever
were, and we know that up to now it has been impossible
for the provinces and the central government to reach any
definite conclusion on this matter, even at the Victoria
conference. The main reason for this failure is, of course,
the fact that the central government has not been satisfied
to make unconditional payments to the provinces, such as
the equalization payments with which we are dealing now,
but has decided to initiate joint programs in matters
purely of provincial jurisdiction with the result that it has
completely disorganized the priorities set by the provincial governments.
Conditional payments are in practice very hard to
refuse, and it is a good way for the federal government to
exert an indirect control on the initiatives of provincial
legislatures and governments.
* (1440)

Of course, I recognize that in many instances the federal
legislation has provided for an opting-out formula which
has enabled the Province of Quebec in particular to have
a better control of its own affairs. However, I have always
wondered why these fiscal arrangements between Ottawa
and the provinces have not used the equalization principle
to solve practically all the problems of the services which
should, under the Constitution, be supplied by the
provinces.
The Leader of the Government indicated in his speech
last night that the bill rested upon six principles. He stated
that:
-the fiscal arrangements between the federal and
provincial governments should give each level of government adequate access to tax resources to discharge its responsibilities.
I deny this. I think that the Leader of the Government
meant tax revenues, because no easier access to any tax
source has been given to a province by these fiscal
arrangements.
He defines the second principle as having the effect
"that each level of government should, as far as possible,
levy its own taxes."
It seems to me that the fiscal arrangements have had
exactly the opposite results. Whether or not in the case of
some provinces it is a good thing is another matter which
can be dealt with on another occasion. Yet, I am in agreement with the third principle that:
-federal equalization payments should be recognized
as essential to help provinces provide an adequate
level of public service.
This has always been the case, and I suggest it is the only
valid reason for this bill to exist, and to provide equalization payments.
The fourth, fifth and sixth principles are so obvious that
the Leader of the Government could have by-passed
them, for they have no possible application to this bill.
25312-13

Is it not obvious "that the federal authority should at all
times have both theoretical and practical authority to
discharge its full responsibilities"?
Is it not obvious "that the federal-provincial arrangements should aim for the principle of uniform application
of federal laws in every province of Canada"?
Is it not obvious "that there should be co-operation in
the establishment of policies and priorities in federal-provincial arrangements"?
This is, of course, typical Martin prose. Even if I agree
with the Leader of the Government that this act is one of
the most important documents delineating the financial
relationships of the federal and provincial governments, I
cannot refrain from stating that it is mainly designed to
permit the federal government to remain the first and
practically the sole beneficiary of personal and corporation income taxes.
The Leader of the Government bas emphasized and
boasted about the fact that a major jump in equalization
payments has been made since 1967 when the amount was
$546 million compared to $1 billion for the present year,
and projections indicate that this figure may reach $1.5
billion at the conclusion of the present arrangements in
1976-77. But I suggest to him that the government should
not boast about this, because it is collecting at least twice
as much in revenues for 1971 as it did in 1967, and probably in five years time its revenues will have increased by
50 per cent.
Another comment I should make concerns the statement made by the leader that if the federal government
attempted to make direct payments to low-income
Canadians sufficient to generate compensating tax revenue for these provinces, it is estimated that the payments
would have to total a net $13 billion to $14 billion. I was
not surprised that Senator Croll should jump to his feet
when he heard that last night. As far as I am concerned,
these figures appear to be unrealistic or, at least, they are
presented in a way to create confusion or a smoke screen
behind which this government is trying to hide a definite
rejection of the principle of guaranteed income.
We knew that this would be the attitude of the government when it published its White Paper on Welfare just a
few months before our Special Committee on Poverty was
to report.
I want to add a final word concerning Part VI of the bill,
which extends for two years the fiscal transfers to the
provincial governments for the operating costs of postsecondary education. Apparently, the government has not
been able to devise a new formula or a new arrangement
acceptable to the provinces and to the institutions concerned. I hope that the consultations will proceed quickly
in order that the extension of programs in this field can be
decided and proceeded with without undue delay.
Of course, I expect the bill to be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce where
we would have an opportunity to raise questions on many
of the ancillary problems.
Hon. Ernest C. Manning: Honourable senators, I wish to
speak briefly to the bill which is before us. However,
before I proceed I would like to express my appreciation

SENATE DEBATES

to the Leader of the Government for his lucid explanation
of the bill's provisions which he gave last evening.
Early in the 1940s, when we were under the pressures
and tensions of World War II, a number of conferences
were held between the Government of Canada and the
provincial governments to work out more satisfactory
fiscal arrangements. Honourable senators are aware that
out of these deliberations came the initial federal-provincial fiscal arrangements, the concept of rental of fields of
revenue from the provinces to the Dominion Government,
and later on, the introduction of equalization payments,
which is a very prominent feature of this bill.
* (1450)

I call attention in passing to the fact that today there is
probably no intention of terminating this type of fiscal
arrangement. It was during World War I when for the first
time the Government of Canada entered the personal
income tax field as a temporary measure, but federal
income tax has become one of the most permanent provisions of our financial structure. If there is any lesson to be
drawn from these cases, it is that government at all levels
should be very careful when they enter into temporary
arrangements, because history shows they very rarely are
temporary but tend to become permanent features.
The importance of this bill is obvious. It was pointed out
last evening that some of the provinces, particularly Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, will derive approximately 65 per cent and 55 per cent of their revenue from
the equalization payments provided under this statute. At
the other end of the spectrum it is of equal importance to
the three provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and
Alberta by reason of the fact that the formula embodied
in this legislation excludes them from participation in the
federal government's equalization payments. They are by
this legislation in the category of contributors but not
recipients.
I should like to confine my remarks to Part I of the bill,
which deals with the matter of equalization. The Leader
of the Government was correct when he stated last evening that in general the concept of equalization is accepted in this country. The criticism and debate which evolves
around the equalization formula has to do with two
aspects. One, the extent to which equalization should be
carried and the other, those features of the formula under
which eligibility for equalization is determined and the
amount of equalization payments ascertained. I would
draw attention to two criticisms of the formula by which
the eligibility for equalization payments is decided.
One of these has always been of special concern to the
Province of Alberta, because it is affected by this provision more than any other province. I refer to the inclusion
in the revenue sources as defined by this bill of revenues
obtained from cash bonuses received from the sale of oil
and natural gas rights. It has always been the contention
of Alberta that this source of revenue should not be treated as being in the same category as the other sources of
revenue included in the formula. There are some obvious
reasons for this contention. In the first place, the use of
cash bonuses as a means of obtaining revenue from the
development of natural resources results from a policy
decision and is not the only method by which such revenue could be obtained. In the formula embodied in this
[Hon. Mr. Manning.)

March 22, 1972

bill, the choice between two or three alternative policies
can have a significant effect on both the eligibility of the
province to qualify for equalization payments and the
national average income from the source of revenue. This
becomes important because it is the basis on which other
provinces qualify for equalization if their income falls
below that national average.
To illustrate my point, the Province of Saskatchewan at
one time used the practice of charging overriding royalties on the sale of crown leases. A fixed royalty, similar to
that paid in Alberta, was employed, but when their leases
were offered for sale, instead of inviting cash bonuses,
those bidding for the leases would offer to pay "X" per
cent of the production as additional overriding royalty
throughout the life of production.
There are arguments for and against that formula as
compared with cash bonuses, but one of its effects is to
spread the income to the provincial government over the
entire life of the well, which might be 25, 30 or 35 years.
The annual income would therefore be less than that
under a formula in which cash bonuses were invited and
all payments received when the leases were purchased. A
very different revenue figure for the purposes of this bill's
equalization formula would be produced if the overriding
royalty were used under which the income is spread over
30 or 35 years.
It was also the contention of the Province of Alberta
that revenue from these cash bonuses should be treated as
being in the category of capital income as distinct from
current income derived from royalties, rentals, and so on.
Honourable senators are perhaps aware that in the case
of Alberta and Saskatchewan, although they became
provinces in the year 1905, their natural resources were
administered by the Government of Canada until 1930,
when they were transferred to the provinces under what
was known as the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement. The practice as far as Alberta was concerned from
that time was not to dispose of the title to any of these
mineral rights. It was for this reason that they could invite
cash bonuses on leases when they were offered for sale.
For the reasons I have stated, it has always been the
feeling in Alberta that it is unfair to include revenues
from these cash bonuses in the formula which determines
eligibility or otherwise for equalization payments. These
cash bonuses have been one of the major factors which
excluded Alberta from eligibility. Including these bonuses
in the revenue base has also had the effect of significantly
increasing the national aggregate income from natural
resources, which again affects the amount of equalization
payments to which other provinces are eligible. Many
representations were made on this matter, but it was
always the decision of the federal government that cash
bonuses must be included.
* (1500)

Another criticism is the excessive broadening of the
revenue base on which equalization payments are now
determined. I appreciate that there is argument for
having the base broad, but I submit that this concept can
be carried beyond a point that is logical. In applying the
concept of equalization to individual income, no one
would argue that income of all citizens should be equal.
We all agree that to some extent there should be equaliza-

hiarch

22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

tion, and much of our taxation system is designed to take
from those who have and distribute it among those who
have less or, through misfortune, have nothing at all. We
all accept that. However, I think we would all agree that
there is a point beyond which equalization cannot be
extended without having a detrimental effect.
In my view we have made the revenue base under this
formula too broad, in that it tends to discourage initiative
in those provinces which have peculiar circumstances or
particular resources which afford opportunity for
development.
In a country as large and diversified as Canada, we
cannot pour all regions into a common mold. Circumstances differ significantly from one region to another.
The Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin) last
night mentioned that no one would argue that this formula was the last word, that a lot of thought had been
given to an alternative but that nothing new had yet been
determined. I can only express the hope that such efforts
will continue. In my view the present formula could be
significantly improved.
Some years ago during one or two federal-provincial
conferences on this question, a discussion took place on a
concept advanced by Alberta, which I personally feel has
merit and I hope will still be considered. Briefly, the
concept was that rather than have across-the-board equalization payments, we should recognize three major areas
of national social concern, namely, education, public
health, and social welfare-areas in which Canadian citizens are entitled to a reasonable standard of service
whether they live in one part of the country or another.
For the purpose of aiding those provinces not able to
provide adequately in these three major areas, it was
suggested that consideration be given to introducing a
joint federal-provincial personal and corporate income
tax, with the money going into a fund for distribution to
all provinces on a per capita basis for education, public
health and social welfare.
The thinking was that personal and corporate income
tax reflect the economic growth of each province and of
the country as a whole. Under such a formula, a province
having a more buoyant economy and greater resources
would contribute a good deal more than one whose economy was depressed.
I admit that such a concept faces difficulties. It will be
said immediately that there is no constitutional provision
for a joint federal-provincial personal and corporate
income tax. That is true, but anyone examining this bill is
conscious of the many things which have been done by
agreement. It would be difficult to argue that a joint
federal-provincial agreement on personal and corporate
income tax would be any more difficult than what we
have here.
The reason for the suggestion that revenue be derived
from joint federal-provincial personal and corporate
income tax was to distribute more fairly the responsibility
between the provinces and the Government of Canada
whenever it was necessary to increase the rate of taxation
to meet rising costs within the three fields of social services to which I have referred. All provinces appreciate
that it would not be fair to ask the federal government to
25312-13I

195

levy such a tax on its own, and subject it to all the political
criticism whenever an increase was necessary. The provinces, being the recipients of the payment, would receive
all the credit, and the federal government would receive
all the criticism. A joint tax would spread the responsibility fairly and would have definite advantages.
I should like now to comment on the criticism levelled at
the whole concept of equalization payments which arises
from time to time. As honourable senators know, at the
present time one Canadian province is proposing court
action, its argument being that equalization payments
may be unconstitutional. I do not propose to deal with
that point. I simply point out that there is criticism of the
way the whole equalization program is working out.
We are all aware that criticism frequently centres on the
amount of money paid under the equalization program to
the Province of Quebec. The answer usually given is that
such criticism is unfair because Quebec receives, on a per
capita basis, substantially less than that received by some
of the other provinces.
The Leader of the Government last night mentioned
that Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland receive
$213 per capita under this formula, and Quebec receives
only $74 per capita. I would point out that trying to deal
with criticism of equalization by quoting per capita figures does not meet the case. The concern to the Canadian
taxpayer, and even more, the concern to the taxpayers of
those provinces which are contributors to this program
but not recipients-Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta-is not the per capita amount paid to each province but
the total dollar cost of the program. If you look at it from
that standpoint you can understand why Quebec is singled out. If you pay $213 per capita to the Province of
Prince Edward Island, the cost to the Canadian taxpayer
is about $21 million, but if you pay $74 per capita to the
Province of Quebec with a population of 54 million the
cost to the Canadian taxpayer is something over $400
million, and this, of course, is the factor that gives rise to
the criticism. There is also a second factor which I feel
must be recognized by the Government of Canada and by
the government and citizens of the Province of Quebec. If
it is recognized, it may at least help them to understand
why these criticisms are voiced.
e (1510)

When Canada became a nation over 100 years ago, the
Province of Quebec was one of the original provinces
along with Ontario, the Maritimes and, shortly thereafter,
British Columbia. It is significant that from the standpoint of resources you have four provinces in Canada
which are particularly fortunate, Ontario, Quebec, British
Columbia and Alberta. I do not mean by that to take
anything away from the other provinces, but it is a recognized fact that those four geographical areas are particularly fortunate as far as natural resources are concerned.
The Province of Quebec, from a resource standpoint, is a
rich province. It ranks with Ontario, British Columbia
and Alberta. It has had over 100 years as an integral part
of Canada to develop those resources and expand its
economy.
I do not intend to go into the reasons why it has not been
successful in this regard, but you cannot escape the fact
that today Ontario, one of the original provinces in Con-

SENATE DEBATES

federation, is excluded under this formula because her
economic growth bas put her in a position where equalization payments are not justified. British Columbia, again
one of the original partners, is in the same position. AIberta, which did not become a province until 1905, is in the
same position. Quebec had a 35-year head start on Alberta
as far as economic development is concerned.
One of the things that concerns people in our part of
Canada is why should a province with such vast natural
resources, and in Confederation for 100 years, be in a
position today where, under a formula of this kind, it
qualifies for some $400 million in subsidies from the rest
of Canada in order to provide a standard of services that
most of us, if not all, agree are desirable and necessary.
I point this out because I do not feel that we serve
Canada by shutting our eyes to this problem. The criticisms are real and understandable. When we talk about
equalization as being one of the necessary things to
strengthen unity between the provinces of Canada, my
submission is that such unity will not be attained unless
these valid criticisms are recognized and faced and
adjustments made in the equalization formula which will
minimize such criticisms, if not eliminate them.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I should
like to say a few words about this bill, if I may, before it is
read a second time. First of all, I have noticed that in a
good many of the public speeches on this question of
equalization payments, the expression "these payments
are made by the rich provinces" is used, and there
appears to be some misunderstanding of the ambiguity of
that phrase.
I feel it is necessary to point out that not one copper of
the equalization payments comes from the revenues of
any provincial government. I find a curious obtuseness in
the remarks of some people to this effect, and I felt the
matter deserved some clarification.
The second thing I should like to say something about is
the argument which the honourable Senator Manning
said he was not dealing with: the argument put forward
by the Government of British Columbia that there is
something illegal and unconstitutional about the equalization payments because of alleged provisions in the British
North America Act requiring equal treatment for all provinces in such matters. It ought to be recognized in the first
place that there is not one syllable in the British North
America Act or any amendment to that act from start to
finish which provides the slightest trace of ground for the
contention that the equalization payments are illegal. The
whole suggestion is utter nonsense.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: For that reason.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: On the contrary, if one examines the
British North America Act and all subsequent enactments
by both the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the
Parliament of Canada, a whole series of instances of
unequal treatment will be found. I do not want to go into
them in detail today but anyone who wishes to can look at
sections 104, 112, 114, 115 and 116 of the British North
America Act, 1867, and find written there a number of
unequal treatment provisions. Whether this is good, bad,
or indifferent, is neither here nor there for the purpose of
my argument. But written in there are provisions for
[Hon. Mr. Manning.)

March 22, 1972

payments of interest on fictitious debts, and special payments not related in any way to the size of the province or
the population of the province.
There is a whole string of inequalities. For example, by
section 119, the Province of New Brunswick was to
receive for ten years, over and above anything it got
under this system of unequal payments, a further subsidy
of $63,000 a year, subject to certain deductions under
section 116.
When British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871,
you will again find special provisions regarding payments
of interest on a fictitious provincial debt, and that provincial debt was to be calculated on the basis of the average
per capita debt of the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick which was $27.77.
When Prince Edward Island joined Confederation in
1873, again a series of inequalities, even apart from the
provision for compensating Prince Edward Island for the
fact that it had no public lands: they had all been grabbed
by absentee landlords long before.
In sections 24 and 25 of the Manitoba Act of 1870, again
you have this whole apparatus of payments to the provinces on the basis of a fictitious debt, and special arrangements by which, if the population increased so much up to
a maximum of 400,000, such and such would be paid. In
the Alberta Act and the Saskatchewan Act again there
are provisions for payments respecting purely fictitious
debts, and all kinds of inequalities.
Between 1867 and 1907 a number of acts were passed by
the Parliament of Canada giving special treatment to
various provinces beginning, of course, with the celebrated act of 1869 providing for better terms for Nova Scotia.
The provinces from that time on have played the same
leapfrog game that you sometimes get now with various
unions in collective bargaining-"If they get so much, we
get so much. We must get more because they get more."
By the beginning of the century the Government of
Canada was getting fed up with this, and accordingly
called a dominion-provincial conference, which drafted
the substance of the British North America Act, 1907,
which again embodied a series of inequalities, as anyone
can satisfy himself by looking at the act.
0 (1520)

For example, British Columbia was to get, over and
above what it was entitled to by the general provisions,
$100,000 a year extra for 10 years, and the population on
which certain grants were to be based was to mean for the
three Prairie provinces the population at each quinquennia] census, or a statutory estimate half way between each
quinquennial census and each decennial census. But for
the other provinces it was to mean the population at each
decennial census. Prince Edward Island and British
Columbia were in no case to get less under the act of 1907
than they would have got under the old act at July 1, 1907,
and no grant to either was to be decreased even if the
population decreased.
You can look up a string of things like that and find
Canadian acts on the subject, and British acts, amendments to the British North America Act. The whole thing
has been riddled from the beginning, in the Constitution
and by action of Parliament under the Constitution, with

March 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

inequalities as between province and province, and for
stated reasons which were set out in the legislation in
most cases. It seems to me impossible to think of any set
of provisions in any legislation which would be further
from embodying equal treatment of all the provinces in
this matter.
The next point I want to make is that, if you talk about
substituting for equalization payments to provinces payments to individuals, you have not only the colossal financial amount involved, which the Leader of the Government mentioned last night, but you have a
misapprehension, it seems to me, of the whole purpose of
equalization payments for provinces. The purpose is not
to equalize individual incomes in any way, shape, or form,
but to equalize, or come somewhere near equalizing,
public services, and I emphasize both the adjective and
the noun. That is what it is there for.
The fourth point I should like to mention is that I am
sorry it has not yet been found possible to make some
provision in the equalization formula for the difficulties
of municipalities. There is a passage in the report of the
Joint Committee on the Constitution on this subject at
page 27, which I hope will be taken account of in subsequent revisions of this whole scheme of equalization payments, which obviously is some distance off. However, I
commend to the attention of honourable senators and the
government the point which is made, very briefly, in one
paragraph in the second column on page 27 of the report.
I want to mention also the question of the provisions for
post-secondary education. I was very glad to hear what
Senator Flynn said on that subject, which I heartily
endorse. I should like also to call the attention of honourable senators to the excellent speech on this subject, as it
seemed to me, of Mr. Gordon Fairweather in the other
place. I shall refrain from quoting anything from it,
because that would be to paint the lily and gild refined
gold, besides taking up the time of the house unnecessarily.
I wish to mention the excellent illustration that Part III
gives of the uses of administrative delegation, this
arrangement for the Dominion to collect the succession
duties of six of the provinces for a limited period. When
the Constitution Committee was considering the question
of delegation of legislative power back and forth between
the Dominion and the provinces, most of us eventually
came to the conclusion that such legislative delegation
was undesirable. It is, of course, constitutionally impossible at present. We also stated our conviction that administrative delegation, such as is embodied in Part III of this
bill, is practicable, highly desirable, and very useful.
The last thing I want to refer to, very briefly, is the point
Senator Manning made about the Province of Quebec
having had a 35-year head start on Alberta in the matter
of natural resources. With great respect, I do not know
that that is to me a very impressive argument, because a
great deal seems to depend on the state of technology at
the time. A great many of the natural resources of Quebec
as we know them now were completely unknown, even
unsuspected, at the time of Confederation, just as up until
a comparatively recent date the immense oil and gas
resources of Alberta were completely unknown and
unsuspected.

192

I remember when I was lecturing on Canadian economic problems at McGill University back in the early thirties
one point I used to make was that we were almost completely dependent in this country on external sources for
our supply of petroleum and petroleum products. Now, of
course, this is a preposterous, ridiculous statement. In
those days, however, it was perfectly true. Nobody had
any idea of the great resources that were lying hidden
there.
I venture to suggest that to a certain extent this has
been true also in the Province of Quebec, and it is no use
hinting or implying that if the Province of Quebec had
managed its affairs better-although Senator Manning
was very careful to cast no aspersions-it is no use implying, even unintentionally, that if the Province of Quebec
had managed its affairs better it would have developed
some of these natural resources earlier, and would now be
in the same condition of, shall we say, almost unlimited
affluence as the great province over whose destinies Senator Manning presided with such distinction for so long.
I think there is more to be said on this score than
Senator Manning said. I am not prepared to say that every
Quebec government since Confederation has managed its
natural resources with the wisdom of Solomon, but I do
think that there were certain limiting technological, scientific and economic factors which, to some extent, invalidate what Senator Manning was saying just now.
I wished particularly to place on the record some of
those provisions of the Constitution for the highly unequal distribution of payments of this sort as between the
provinces. I pity the unfortunate lawyer who has to take a
brief for the Government of British Columbia in this
particular case. I was misquoted in the press on the subject, only slightly, in a literary fashion. I said that he
would need, not, as I was reported, the hide of a rhinoceros and the head of an ostrich, but the hide of a rhinoceros and the stomach of an ostrich to be able to swallow
the preposterous legal arguments that he would have to
produce before the Supreme Court of Canada, to the
accompaniment, I am afraid, of sad smiles from the members of the bench.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Do I understand that the
Leader of the Government would like to close the debate?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: If the honourable Senator Martin speaks now, his speech will have the effect of
closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am sure we all
agree that among the functions of this chamber perhaps
few are higher than giving consideration to a matter
involving the interests of the ten provincial constituents of
our Confederation. Indeed, as we have been reminded
from time to time, and particularly by Senator Molgat last
night, one of the essential considerations that brought
about an accommodation of Confederation was that there
would be an Upper House, one of whose prime responsibilities would be to follow the regional interests of
Upper and Lower Canada as well as the Maritime provinces. We are living up to the purpose of that arrangement

SENATE DEBATES

when we pay attention to a measure as important as this
particular bill.
* (1530)

In addition to the participation of the Leader of the
Opposition, we heard Senator Manning, the former Premier of Alberta. He has had a lot to do with what Professor Simeon calls federal-provincial diplomacy in his book
Federal-Provincial
Diplomacy. Senator Manning has had
much to do with this problem. This was reflected in the
speech he made a few minutes ago.
Federal states have different ways of bringing about a
sharing of their revenue, whether state or provincial and
federally based. In our Constitution there is an obligation,
under section 91, for the federal government to discharge
its responsibilities, and for the provinces, under section
92, to discharge theirs. This requires increasingly more
revenues to meet obligations by both regimes. The federal
government, in the extension of the equalization principle,
continues to recognize, as it has since 1942, the responsibilities of the provinces.
The federal spending power under our Constitution has
no limits. While there is a limitation on the taxing powers
of the provinces, there is at present, notwithstanding the
Joint Committee on the Constitution, no limitation whatsoever on the spending power of the federal government.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The taxpayers?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Speaking for myself, I find it difficult
to conceive how it would be desirable to place any limit on
the spending power of the federal government.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Common sense should govern.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I support the point Senator Forsey was
seeking to make. Any suggestion that these equalization
payments are unconstitutional does not seem to have any
legal or constitutional base. Because if there is no limit on
the spending power of the federal government there
consequently cannot be any restraint on what it does
either in terms of direct payments to individuals or to
provinces. One would not expect that this argument,
made in recent days, would have a great consequence.
Most of what Senator Forsey had to say, as I followed
him, was not so much with regard to equalization payments but with regard to subsidies which are part of the
arrangement made by the originating provinces in 1867.
This is provided for in the British North America Act.
Subsidies were to be paid annually by the federal government to the provinces. We continued to do that long before
the advent of equalization. Senator Forsey said: "But
what about the municipalities?"
Hon. Mr. Forsey: If I may interrupt the leader for a
moment, the only point I was trying to make, in referring
to the subsidies, was that the principle of unequal treatment of the provinces was written into the Constitution.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, that is right. The amount of subsidies paid to one province was not necessarily the same as
that paid to another. Senator Forsey was quite correct,
but the principle of equalization is superimposed on the
subsidy payments that now find themselves in the very
heavy amounts of money that are transferred from the
federal government to the provinces.
[Hon. Mr. Martind

March 22, 1972

In regard to the position of municipal governments in
this country, it must be realized that the moneys that are
transferred by the federal government to the provinces, in
either the form of equalization payments or in the greater
body of financial outflow to the provinces, are part of the
calculation made in the discussion between the federal
and provincial governments. These payments include the
provincial governments' requirements to cover that kind
of assistance which result in payments by provincial governments to municipalities. So the point that Senator
Forsey made is achieved indirectly.
Honourable senators, there will be an opportunity for
further discussion when this bill gets to the committee. I
hope that may occur tomorrow, so that the Minister of
Finance can attend-and, in any event, the Minister without Portfolio, or someone acting for him. At present, it is
the intention of the Minister of Finance himself to be
there.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would ask whether there is any objection to royal assent being allowed to wait until we come

TERRITORIAL SUPREME COURTS BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. George van Roggen moved second reading of Bill
S-3, to change the names of the Territorial Court of the
Yukon Territory and the Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a somewhat
mechanical bill, to change the name of the Territorial
Courts of the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories to that of the Supreme Court of those respective
territories.
It gives me particular delight to have the opportunity of
sponsoring this bill. I am probably the only member of
this chamber who has ever practised on a continuous
basis in either of the Territories, having practised before
the bar in the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory for
approximately eight years in the 1950s. I have been
involved in some 10 or 15 capital cases, and numerous
civil and criminal cases, before that court.

SENATE DEBATES

* (1540)

There are three courts in both of the Territories. There
are the magistrates courts, the Territorial Courts, and
their respective courts of appeal. The magistrates courts
are, generally speaking, the same as those in the provinces. The Court of Appeal for the Yukon Territory is the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia with the addition of
both of the Territorial Court judges. The Court of Appeal
for the Northwest Territories is the Court of Appeal for
Alberta, again with the addition of both of the Territorial
Court judges. This bill deals only with the Territorial
Courts and only with the name of the Territorial Courts.
It deals with nothing else.
I might say with some feeling that I am particularly
delighted that these courts will now be known as supreme
courts or superior courts by name, because this in fact is
what they have always been in so far as the extent of their
jurisdiction, which is unlimited, is concerned, and in so
far as the quality of justice which has been administered
by them over the years is concerned.
Honourable senators, you may be interested in a short
resumé of the background leading to this proposed legislation. In 1970 Parliament gave increased autonomy in the
fields of administration of justice to each of the Territories. This included power to make ordinances in relation
to "the administration of justice in the Territory, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of Territorial Courts both of civil and criminal jurisdiction."
This power is similar to that vested in the provinces by
section 92 of the British North America Act.
In the early part of 1971, many of the functions carried
out with respect to the Territories by the Department of
Justice in Ottawa were transferred to the Territorial
Courts as contemplated by the legislation to which I have
just referred. Both Territorial Councils constituted the
same courts that existed previously under the Yukon Act
and the Northwest Territories Act and, at the outset,
retained the sarne names for the Territorial Courts.
Last June, however, the Territorial Council of the
Northwest Territories enacted an ordinance to change the
name of the Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories
to the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. In
November the Territorial Council of the Yukon Territories did the same thing with regard to the Territorial
Court there. Both of these ordinances are to come into
force on days to be fixed by order of the commissioner of
each Territory. You will note that the bill before you is to
come into force on proclamation. The reason for this is to
enable this legislation to come into effect at the same time.
Federal legislation is required, of course, so that the
Territorial legislation can be fully effective because of the
numerous references in federal laws to the Territorial
Court. These references are in the schedules to the bill.
I might add as a side note that the statutes listed in the
schedules were located by the use of a computer, which is
part of the new jurimetrics program of the Department of
Justice. We can all hope for the sake of those practising
before the Territorial Courts in the future that the computer was accurate.
This bill has no effect on the authority to appoint the
judges of the Territorial Courts, which will still remain

199

with the federal government, as is the case with respect to
judges of the provinces. It also has no effect on the
number of judges. There is only one full-time judge for
each court, and there is no plan to increase that number.
As I have indicated, the purpose of the bill is to give full
force to the new Territorial laws by changing in the federal legislation the names of the two courts, one in each
Territory, so that the names of those courts will conform
to the style used in most of the provinces, particularly
British Columbia and Alberta, with whose courts the Territorial Courts are most closely associated.
Honourable senators, I have no objection, of course, to
this bill's being referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, but that might
well be unnecessary in view of the rather mechanical
nature of the bill.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: If I may add a word, honourable senators, this bill is very straightforward. It just
changes the names of the courts. I do not see any point in
sending it to a committee. There is really no need to do so.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. van Roggen moved that the bill be placed on
the Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
UNITY BANK OF CANADA-SECOND READING
Hon. Maurice Bourget moved the second reading of Bill
C-164, to incorporate Unity Bank of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, in June of 1971 Senator
Hédard Robichaud introduced Bill S-22, to incorporate
United Bank of Canada. On June 15 of the same year he
moved second reading and his remarks can be found at
pages 1135 to 1137 of the Debates of the Senate of that
day.
After his speech the bill was read the second time and
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce.
On September 15 and October 6 of the same year the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce dealt at length with the bill, heard witnesses, and
reported it without amendment. The bill received third
reading on October 7, 1971, and was sent to the House of
Commons. Unfortunately, Bill S-22 died on the Order
Paper of the House of Commons at the end of the last
session.
The bill now before us, Bill C-164, was introduced in the
House of Commons at the beginning of the present session. It received second reading on March 2, and was sent
to the Standing Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs of the House of Commons. That committee
dealt with it on March 16 and, after lengthy discussion,
unanimously approved it, except for the use of the name
United Bank of Canada. There was opposition to this
name from the United Trust Company. As a result of the
objection, the name was changed on third reading in the
House of Commons to "Unity Bank of Canada", et en

SENATE DEBATES

français, "L'Unité, Banque du Canada", and the bill, as
amended, was unanimously approved on third reading by
the House of Commons on the same day, March 16.
6 (1550)

Bill C-164 is exactly the same as Bill S-22 introduced in
the last session, which was unanimously approved by the
Senate last year except for the change in name. I do not
think it necessary to repeat at this time what was said by
Senator Robichaud when he moved the second reading of
Bill S-22 because that material is available to all honourable senators.
The bill is drafted exactly as required and specified by
section 8 of the Bank Act which covers the incorporation
and organization of banks. Its wording complies with
Schedule B of that act.
Mr. Scott, the Inspector General of Banks, appeared
before both committees and advised that this application
is in order and he could see no objection to it.
Honourable senators, this bill commends itself for your
support and if it receives second reading it is my intention
to move that it be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce where you will
have the opportunity to ask any questions you wish.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable senators,

SCIENCE POLICY
CONSIDERATION OF VOLUME II OF REPORT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, March 15, the
adjourned debate on the consideration of Volume II of the
Report of the Special Committee on Science Policy, tabled
in the Senate on Thursday, February 24, 1972.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, the broad
outlines of the recommendations made by your Special
Committee on Science Policy in Volume II have been well
covered in the speeches made by Senator Lamontagne
and Senator Cameron. My particular assignment is to
deal with one part of the report which can perhaps be
described as the core of the report, and that is three
chapters dealing with the vital necessity for some drastic
changes in Canadian policy in respect to innovation in
industry.
The committee finds that these drastic changes, and I
emphasize the word "drastic" because that is the word
used in our report-are necessary immediately if we are
to ensure our survival as an industrialized western country in today's science and technology race. I would say
that it is quite impossible for any one to overstress the
[Hon. Mr. Bourget.]

March 22, 1972

imperatives of these findings by the committee. In the
report we use these words:
-if we want to continue to improve our standard of
living and to produce more employment opportunities
we must re-orient our national economic objectives
and strategy. We must build new areas of comparative
advantage, put the emphasis on manufacturing industry and develop an aggressive technological strategy
to promote economic and social innovations. (Given
the weaknesses of the manufacturing sector of the
Canadian economy, this emphasis is essential even if
we go on increasing the rate at which we exploit our
resources.) Canada needs a new national policy adapted to the world environment of the next decades. For
the first time in our history we must be an innovative
nation.
Those are the words that appear in the committee's
report.
The core of this new national policy suggested by the
committee is what we call a new industrial strategy, a
strategy that would be new, coherent and positive. We
contrast it in a brief run-over of some historical developments in our foreign trade and tariff policies with what
we call the "passive strategies of the past" pointing out
that over a long period of time Canadian economic policy
has relied on imported technology rather than on indigenous technology and on the exploitation of our resources.
It is true, of course, that we have attained a position of
importance in the industrial world today, but we sometimes forget that the main reason we have been able to do
that has been the richness of our resources which we are
exploiting and which we continue to exploit, and it is the
recommendation of the committee that we call a halt to
the present kind of exploitation of our resources and use
the tremendous bargaining power of those resources to
improve our position in world markets for our manufacturing industry.
Obviously a new industrial strategy must be based on
the use of modern technology, not only our own, because
at best we are not likely ever to be able to contribute more
than 2 or 3 per cent to the world's stock of technology, so
we will have to learn, as we have not been able to learn in
the past, to make use in the development in our own
manufacturing industries of the technology of the world.
Senator Cameron dealt at some length with that aspect
of the problem which was dealt with in one of the chapters of our report where we stress the importance of the
development in Canada of a science and technological
information service which will render us capable, as the
Japanese, the Swedes and the Swiss and others, of looking around the world, keeping ourselves up to date with
new developments in technology and turning our own
skills, our own scientific and other skills, which are abundant, to the use of these technologies in our own secondary industries. The report indicates that nothing less than
what has been referred to as revolutionary change is
needed. However, the chairman and others have insisted
that it is really, in essence, an evolutionary change. My
own feeling in examining policies of the past is that this
report offers solutions in terms of present policies, structures and organizations which are revolutionary. The
report indicates that nothing less than what looks to me

March 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

like revolutionary change will bring about the necessary
specialization, improved productivity, built-up innovative
capacity, and substantially increased flow of technological innovation.
(1600)
(

To indicate the general flavour of Volume II, I would
like to read the following headlines from several Canadian newspapers indicating points of views which others
have expressed regarding the report:
The Toronto Daily Star of January 18, 1972: "Innovate
or Stagnate, Science Report warns Canada."
The Montreal Star of January 18, 1972: "Canada urged
to pay price of Independence."
The Ottawa Citizen of January 18, 1972: "Industrial
Revolution: way to our technological survival" and also:
"Senate price on industrial success-$4.75 billion."
The Globe and Mail of January 19, 1972: "Report urges
coherent overall science policy, research priorities, new
industry strategy." And also "Innovation envisaged as
main growth source."
The Ottawa Journal of January 18, 1972: "The price of
survival: 'Innovation'-Science Committee."
Time magazine of January 24, 1972, in its report on
Volume II: "For a new industrial renovation."
The Windsor Star of January 18, 1972: "Senators put it
bluntly: Innovate or go under." Also "Canada needs
industrial revolution, report says."
What then is the present situation in this country? What
are the bases for the complaints and criticisms made in
our report? Put frankly, we find the present situation
appalling. We heard from some 350 witnesses, and over
and over again this phrase was repeated: "Canada's low
industrial innovative base." The committee points out that
the reason is that we have not had a science policy which
knew what to do about research and development in spite
of the fact that the level of our scientific expertise has
received international applause of which we should not be
ashamed. The criticism is not of our scientists. The criticism in this context is not of our universities, government
laboratories, or industrial laboratories, at least not in
terms of the work which they have done. This work has
been excellent. But we have not had a science policy
which could put it to work for Canada.
At page 489 the report says:
The evolution and exploitation of a high national
innovative capacity depends to a large extent on an
adequate level of effectively managed indigenous R
and D activity [concentrated mainly in industry], complemented by an efficient monitoring system on technical progress abroad and on technological forecastingAnd on page 498:
-the Canadian business sector is desperately weak as
a performer of R and D. And yet it is precisely in this
sector that R and D activities in support of technological innovation should mainly be located.
I would like to give you a few simple facts which would
indicate the objectivity of the criticism this committee has
made. It is hard, for example, to believe that in the
present year the percentage of Canadian employment in
25312-14

the manufacturing industry has dropped from its traditional 21 per cent to 19 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I have read a good portion of the
report, but I do not recall whether many witnesses were
called from the private sector of the manufacturing
industry.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes, we heard from many experts on
science policy, from members of the public service, from
universities, and finally from the private sector. I would
think we heard over 100 witnesses and as many briefs
from the private sector which represented not only
individual firms but major industrial trade associations. I
can assure my honourable friend that the input from the
private sector was extensive and valuable.
I repeat that in comparative world terms, it is unbelievable that we could drop from 21 per cent to 19 per cent of
labour force employment in the manufacturing sector. It
means a loss of 120,000 jobs a year. Also, believe it or not,
the total government expenditure for research and development in industry in Canada has declined in some recent
years.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Was the committee able to determine
whether some of the research which normally would have
been done by companies based in Canada was done by
parent companies located in other countries?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am afraid that this subject would
require another hour speech, although I do not intend to
take an hour at this time. It is a very interesting question.
Up until a year or so ago, it could have been said that the
R and D intensity in subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies was slightly higher than those of Canadian companies. In the last couple of years there has been a decline in
the funding and performance of research and development in subsidiary firms as well as in non-subsidiary
Canadian firms.
0 (1610)

Hon. Mr. McDonald: May I ask if the drop in research
and development of foreign-owned subsidiaries in
Canada is comparable to that of Canadian-owned companies in Canada? Is the drop the same in both instances or
is one dropping faster than the other?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: On the basis of a number of studies, I
would consider them to be comparable. The drop has not
been great, and I do not suggest it has been very large. It
is merely the fact that there has been a decrease at a time
when in every comparable country in the world there is
clear evidence of substantial, on-going increases in the
funding and performance of research and development in
industry, which is my subject at the moment.
A very recent OECD study, one of a series generally
regarded as the most definitive in this field, selects 10
comparable countries who are competitive in world markets and rates them on their innovative performance in
industry, secondary industry and manufacturing in
accordance with a number of criteria by which they determine those ratings. The highest rating achieved by
Canada in any of the studies is eighth, and on the overall
picture we come last, tenth. In the total funding of
research and development in Canada, we are at the
bottom of the ladder, with 1.2 per cent to 1.3 per cent of

SENATE DEBATES

GNP. In the top league of countries, the United States is 3
per cent. The intermediate group, which includes most of
our competitors, is 2 per cent to 3 per cent. We are not
quite at the bottom of the ladder, because there are a few
small countries which spend a little less of their GNP than
we, but we are again a strong contender for the cellar.
How did we get into this situation? Our report makes it
clear that it has been as a result of these years and years
of passive strategy. I know that the Leader of the Government will note the emphasis I place on the phrase "years
and years." Our record is critical, highly critical of government policy. Just to save him the exercise of getting up
to defend it, as far as this speech is concerned any blame
there may be will be extended over any period he wishes.
As a matter of fact, the committee's report takes it all the
way back, not quite to 1867, but to Sir John A. Macdonald's first new economic policy. Reference to that is
made twice in the report. When we were looking it over I
had serious doubts as to whether Sir John should be
blamed. The chairman, however, who is a great economist
as we all know, persuaded me that was part of the beginning of our problems. That was, of course, the protective
wall we set up around our own manufacturing industries,
with the great dislocation which has resulted in our whole
economy.
Yesterday during a meeting of the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs a question arose in discussions with the Secretary of State for External Affairs, Mr.
Sharp, regarding the nature of the general preferences
which Canada hopes to develop between developed and
developing countries. The suggestion was made that at
one time when the Leader of the Government, I believe,
was the Secretary of State for External Affairs, we objected to the idea of preferences. I believe the main reason
was that we were advising these countries to avoid a
predicament similar to that in which we found ourselves.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That was in 1963.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Mr. Sharp said that circumstances
had persuaded us that perhaps there were good reasons
for changing that policy and reversing it, as we have. One
of the reasons for that, of course, is the protection of our
domestic markets and its many spin-offs in the whole
field of Canadian entrepreneurship.
A protected domestic market produces less incentive to
search for markets abroad. Businessmen now complain
that we have too small a domestic market in Canada,
which of course is nonsense. As I said the other day,
Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands have much
smaller domestic markets but are outselling us in world
markets and almost entirely in products of high technological intensity. One of the reasons is that indicated by
the Leader of the Government, foreign ownership. No one
is quite sure yet just what the balance between advantages and disadvantages is in this whole question of foreign ownership and the operation of foreign-owned subsidiaries in Canada. There is no question that there are
benefits. One is in this very area, the free flow of technology from parent company to subsidiary, and it is a free
flow. It may to some extent account for our low level of
growth of federal funding. There is the advantage of
skilled management, which is highly important, of course,
in the area of technological innovation and marketing.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.J

March 22, 1972

The disadvantages are obvious and I will not go into them
at this time, because I consider that to be the subject of
another debate, which could be very interesting.
Part of this passive strategy of the past, the conventional wisdom which we think should be changed as soon as
possible, is the whole spectrurn of public policy or, if you
prefer, government policy, in a number of areas which I
will indicate shortly. I stress that these are not personal
observations. To the best of my ability I am paraphrasing,
or using the exact words contained in the report. In our
first report, for example, we pointed out that Canada had
been spending only 39 per cent of its research and development effort in technological innovation. Thirty-eight
per cent represents the total amount of R and D performed in industry. That does not appear to make sense.
In looking at comparisons, we find that Japan allocates 60
per cent of its R and D to industry, and the United States
70 per cent, while we have been chugging along with 37
per cent, 38 per cent, and 39 per cent.
* (1620)

A year ago it declined, despite a very stirring statement
by Mr. Drury, who was then de facto Minister of Science
and Technology, to the effect that a major priority of
government policy was to increase the performance of R
and D in industry. Three years later the federal contribution had actually dropped a percentage point. It indicates
that there is something wrong with the system when the
government announces a clear-cut policy and then finds,
in the bureaucratic scientific mix, that its policy is completely frustrated.
I should perhaps end this part of my critique on a
happier note. There is clear evidence that the situation
has changed. In my view the committee can take some
credit for this. It has been listened to and has been consulted at a high level. Its chairman has access to those
who bear the responsibility for high level policy decisions
in this field. Although the committee members are not
informed of everything that goes on, they feel that their
efforts are not in vain.
The Estimates now before Parliament provide for a 15
per cent increase in federal funding of R and D performance in industry for this year. The figure was increased
last year and I am sure, frorn statements made by the
present minister, that it will continue to rise. The committee has recommended that by 1975 the level should be 60
per cent. We have a long way to go, but there is evidence
that we are heading in the right direction.
Volume II might be regarded as an alarmist document,
and didactic in its insistence on drastic changes. I am sure
honourable senators will be pleased to learn the committee does not content itself with merely complaining and
criticizing, but suggests remedies. It believes that if those
remedies are given fairly immediate attention, which
appears likely, it will be possible for Canada to get back
on the track in the science and technology race, on terms
reasonably equal with those of our major competitors.
I shall take the opportunity a little later of summarizing
the committee's recommendations. I should now like to
say a word about the kind of reception the report has
received. It bas, of course, been criticized, but I think it
fair to say that most of the criticism bas come frorn those
who, in one way or another, have a vested interest in the

March 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

status quo of the existing organization, either in the
bureaucratie organization of the Public Service or in the
equally bureaucratie organization applying to certain
parts of the scientific community. This is understandable.
Dr. Robert Uffen, former scientific adviser to the government, seems to have spent two or three frustrating
years in his federal position. Dr. Uffen, who is now Dean
of Engineering at Queen's University, recently made a
very significant remark. Reviewing the years spent in his
official capacity, he said that he found a tendency among
all entrenched interests to try to fit new policies into
existing organizations, rather than to fit organizations
into new policies. Some of the criticism has arisen as a
result of the committee's recommendations concerning
the National Research Council. Some people have said, in
effect, that we wanted to abolish it. However, a careful
reading of the committee's report would not support that
view.
I have said on a number of occasions that Canada's
science policy has been the victim of the excellence of the
NRC. There is no question but that the NRC has an
enviable international reputation. It has done excellent
work, and recently produced a Nobel Prize winner in the
person of Dr. Herzberg, a very distinguished Canadian
scientist.
A criticism levelled for a good many years was that our
intramural R and D had not produced a Nobel Prize
winner. I am sure that all honourable senators derive
great satisfaction from the fact that Dr. Herzberg has
been awarded the highest laurel in science.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I would have to admit, however, that
Dr. Herzberg is the committee's severest critic, and understandably so. Personally, I admire the tenacity with which
he has fought the battle for a continuation of high level
funding of basic science.
The committee recommends that the funding of basic
science should decrease from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.
When considered in the light of the committee's other
recommendations, this would not decrease the dollar level
of our investment in basic science. However, that is really
another subject.
It has been said that we are merely substituting one
bureaucratic structure for another. There is some truth in
that statement. It is the committee's view that the present
bureaucratie structure is neither adequate nor efficient,
but that the one suggested would be. However, only time
will tell.
Other criticism, in my view, is quite valid. Dr. Alexander King, Director General of Scientific Affairs for
OECD, in a critique of the committee's report, makes a
strong plea for better treatment for the NRC than is
envisaged in the report. I am not suggesting that all of the
criticism is baseless.
It is important to point out that there is support for the
five basic recommendations contained in the report, and I
shall cite three examples. There is an organization called
SCITEC which is an association of all the industry
associations, learned societies, and science, technology
and engineering associations. It is the voice of the scientific community in Canada. This organization examined our
25312-14è

203

report and, as Senator Cameron has already mentioned,
sent out a questionnaire to its members which resulted in
42 of the committee's 45 recommendations receiving at
least 50 per cent support.
* (1630)

Of the 25 recommendations in the particular area to
which I was assigned-that is, industry innovation-all
but one received over 50 per cent support. In percentages
of approval, two of them were in the fifties, nine in the
sixties, nine in the seventies, four in the eighties, and one
in the nineties. Interestingly, recommendation 23, the one
that received less than 50 per cent support, was a recommendation that after a task force had reported, its report
be forwarded to the cabinet. Practical scientists, technologists and engineers were divided as to whether the government should even see that report. It is a minor point,
but interesting.
Dr. Alexander King-and I ask honourable senators to
excuse me for quoting him at some length, but he is in
many ways the number one wise man in the scientific
community of the world-states as follows:
May I say that the Lamontagne exercise is a magnificent effort. In no country has a legislative branch
undertaken such a thorough and detailed job. The
anatomy of Canadian science has been thoroughly
exposed and even if all the recommendations are not
equally wise, the contributions of the Special Committee to the understanding of the problems of science
and technology in contemporary society are outstanding ... It can only be hoped that Canada's legislators
can maintain and mature this understanding so as to
give a lead in wise legislation in providing lines of
progress in this period of transition in both science
and society.
He goes on further to say:
It will make painful reading to many members of the
Canadian scientific community.
He finds the report "a well rounded and thoughtful, and
even erudite attempt to balance opportunity and needs,
responsibility and freedom; it delineates problems clearly
and points, sometimes a little hesitantly, towards their
solution." He says, "It is essentially a plea for innovation
rather than research; it is a challenge for Canada to
become an innovative society."
I received only yesterday a personal letter from the
President of the Research and Development Committee of
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whom I met recently. He expressed the view that the report would be favourably received in the business community. He now writes:
The Canadian Chamber of Commerce will be stating
publicly how much we agree with the general recommendations of your outstanding report.
I mention these accolades, if I may call them that, largely because they give me an opportunity to say that they
belong in a large measure to the chairman of the committee, Senator Lamontagne. When the first report of the
committee was tabled in this chamber I recall stating that
I felt sure that no member of the committee would object
if the report came to be called the Lamontagne Report.
That has certainly happened. It is known as such in

SENATE DEBATES

Canada and throughout the scientific community of the
world.
I know that everyone who worked on the committee will
agree with me that it was Maurice Lamontagne who so
freely devoted his great talents and, perhaps more freely,
his time and energy than many of us, and certainly his
doctor, thought he should. He worked tirelessly, and was
ably assisted by the committee's research director, Philip
Pocock, an indefatigable collector and assessor of data
and, in my judgment, one who could brilliantly articulate
and communicate his analysis of that data. He was of
great assistance to Senator Lamontagne and to all of us.
It is only the limitation of time that prevents me from
paying tribute, as I should, to all other members of the
committee from the Vice-Chairman, Senator Cameron,
down to the newest recruit on our staff. I can assure my
colleagues in the Senate that at some point in the 600-page
report they will find an important input from one or other
of the members of the committee.
I feel it is also worth mentioning that our views have
been well supported by other studies. Certainly the Glassco Commission stated in many ways what we are now
saying. The OECD report in 1969 said much the same
thing. I am sure what is in the minds of members of the
committee is the question: Is it possible that the government will not listen this time? I have on my shelf upstairs
a 1964 report of the Private Planning Association saying
much the same thing to the Government of Canada as we
are now saying. These reports have not been acted upon.
It would be a tragedy if, after this report bas been digested, dissected, and criticized, there is not some response
from the Government of Canada. I feel it is almost incumbent on a government, faced with a report such as this
and other reports from the Senate, to respond. I am not
saying that it should or must adopt everything in a report,
but at least it could come back and tell us what it agrees
with, or where it feels we are wrong. I believe this would
begin a dialogue between us in this chamber and the
government-whatever government may be in powerwhich would be very much to our mutual benefit.
I have been talking, of course, only about the effects of
technological innovation in resource development and
industry. Perhaps it is not necessary, but I feel it is important that I make it clear that the committee is well aware
of the social obligations that are more and more becoming
the responsibility of technology and technologists.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Grosart will perhaps permit
me to ask him a question. He refers to government
response to these important studies. He himself has clearly indicated the government's interest in the report of the
Special Senate Committee on Science Policy, particularly
the interest shown by Mr. Gillespie.
e (1640)

I intervened to point that out. I can assure Senator
Grosart that Mr. Gillespie is interested, and there have
been discussions. I would not say there would be full
agreement on every aspect, but he himself has indicated
already that the concurrence is pretty extensive.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I agree. I was perhaps thinking of
something a little more than that. What the Leader of the
Government says is quite true. As a matter of fact, Mr.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 22, 1972

Pepin, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce,
has himself announced that the government will publish
an industrial strategy in the fall. Perhaps he is over-optimistic that he will be the author of it.
I was going a little beyond that. I was thinking of the
complete shake-up of the broad conceptual approach
rather than just picking out this or that recommendation,
as the government has done, and implementing this, that,
and the other thing. We call for a new industrial strategy,
not a patching of the old, which is what has happened.
Whether the government will agree with us, and if it
agrees has the courage to do that, is the question that is in
my mind, and that is why I raised it.
The committee is aware that there are perils as well as
potentials in technology. We are aware that there is a fear
arising of the power of technology over our lives-technophobia, counter-culture, and so on. We are aware of the
almost terrifying report put out by the Club of Rome
called "The Limits of Growth." It supports one of the new
aspects of the counter-culture, which is actually advocating zero growth for all countries. This is the only solution
they see to population, pollution, urbanization and other
problems. It amazes me, because this is not the emanation
of a few crackpot psychologists or economists. It comes
from men whose influence we have to respect. I do not
understand it; it is beyond me to understand how we can
have zero growth and a high quality of life. Surely it is
economic growth and growth of GNP that will be
required to pay for the kind of quality of life that people
are asking for.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is all based on the MIT model, which
is very difficult to understand. At least, I find it difficult.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Is the Leader of the Government
speaking of the Club of Rome Report?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Based on the MIT model?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I must say I am not greatly impressed
with it, although I know others are. It does not answer
what to me is the essential question: Who is going to pay
for the good new life? Take our own country. The total
tax take is $25 billion, at all levels of government. Of that,
$12.5 billion is immediately redistributed to health, welfare, and education. Most people, social scientists and
others, say that $12.5 billion is not enough. Where are we
going to get the extra money if the GNP does not continue
to go up? I have not seen an answer to that although I
have looked.
It has also been said of our report that we began to look
at science policy, and wound up trying to restructure the
whole economy. There is a good deal of truth in that. For
example, the Financial Times, speaking of the committee's work, said:
The expedition, which started to explore science
policy, ended with the basic question of how Canada
can continue to live. Its conclusions are not cheerful.
This is quite true, because as we began to look at science
policy and to ask, "What is this all about? Why is it
important? Why does it matter?" we very quickly found

March 22, 1972
March 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

out that it impinged on almost every aspect of national
policy.
On page 540 of our report we list some of the larger
public policies that are obviously affected by science
policy. We begin with trade, and point out that our trade
policy has to be tied very closely to our science policy. We
have, of course, trade commissioners, ministerial missions, and so on. Effective work has been done. China and
Japan are obvious examples. We have the problem of the
EEC, which was discussed yesterday in the Foreign
Affairs Committee, a 50-nation trading bloc.
The committee finds that our tariff policies have often
been taken in complete isolation from their possible effect
on innovation in the secondary manufacturing industries.
We recommend, for example, that it is about time that
Canada insisted on equal tariffs-our own as against
those of other countries-on manufactured goods. One of
the great complaints of industry is that they have to face
high import tariffs on essential components of our own
manufactured goods. The committee recommends that we
equalize tariffs in that respect.
Fiscal policy is, of course, becoming more and more the
key to innovation in industry. We recommend, for example, that there should be a full time science adviser in the
Treasury Board. I will not go into the reasons for this, but
there have been some science decisions by the Treasury
Board that are frightening in their naïveté.
Tax incentives are highly important. Industry is asking
more and more for tax incentives to support their R and D
effort. We had them for a while until about 1961 or 1962,
when they were suddenly withdrawn. Nobody has
explained why, although the government did substitute
for them a whole series of incentive grant programs. We
find that this was done on an ad hoc basis that was not
co-related. I will not go into the full details but there are
PAIT, IRAP, DIP, DIR, any number of them. We find they
are not co-ordinated. We recommend that all these incentive programs be brought together and managed on a
co-ordinated basis.
Obviously the supply of money is an essential aspect of
innovative development, yet our monetary policies have
not always given due consideration to their effect on the
performance of our manufacturing industry.
0 (1650)

On foreign ownership, the Leader of the Government
raised some points. I shall not take the time to read our
comments in full. We do find that there are the problems I
mentioned in connection with foreign ownership. I have to
say that the final answer is not in. We recommend a
further study of this matter and, rather importantly, we
suggest that we should use the important asset of access
to our primary resources as a bargaining point in our
world trade negotiations.
We also recommend a "go-slow" policy on the exploitation of these resources. However, if we are going to
exploit them, if we are to meet the needs of other countries around the world-and the vital needs in some
cases-then let us get some bargaining value out of this
for our secondary manufacturing industries. Those industries are so job-intensive that without the development of

these industries we are in further trouble in our employment field.
On procurement policy, may I say we are the boy scouts
of the world when it comes to procurement policy. I am
sure you have seen recent examples where very important
contracts in the high technology field have been let to
other countries. From the point of view of our Department of Supply, this may make sense, but we have found
no evidence of any co-ordination of policy, a policy which
would ask whether it might be better and might make
more sense in an overall way if the Canadian economy
were to pay a little more and give those high technology
jobs to Canadian firms.
This came up in the satellite situation and it also came
up recently in British Columbia. Are we shortsighted in
saying that we always give these jobs to the lowest
bidder? I can assure honourable senators that the evidence before the committee shows that we are about the
only country taking what is sometimes called a boy scout
attitude in this matter.
On competition policy, there is a real problem, because
business at least has a feeling that our competition policy
is against mergers, against bigness; yet an essential feature of our report is that we must have mergers, we must
have industrial critical size, that one of the problems is the
fragmentation of our manufacturing industry with too
many companies chasing too few dollars. And yet, there is
not too much evidence that there has been any co-ordination of competition policy with trade policy in Canada.
For example, we find that 60 per cent of all Canadian
firms in this area are below critical size-critical size
being the size of the market or dollar volume that is
necessary in order to maintain an adequate research and
development base to innovate and stay in the world race.
On standards policy, it is true that about two years ago
we set up a Standards Council. It does not seem to have
got off the ground yet. There are good international reasons why it should. We recommend that in due course
Canada should adopt the metric system.
On manpower policy, it is clear from the evidence
before us that there is a complete mismatch in what is
called the QSESs, the qualified scientists and engineers,
and their support staffs. We have Ph.Ds looking for jobs.
There is no evidence of any structure to bring together the
universities, industry and government, to look into the
future and see whom we should be educating and how, in
what disciplines. There is no evidence that this has been
done. A complete mismatch exists at the moment. There is
no pre-correlation between supply and demand in our
scientific manpower policy. The result is that at the
present time Canada bas less than one QSES-which
means qualified scientist and engineer plus support
staff-in industry to each one in government. Germany
has 18 QSESs in industry for every one in government.
The Netherlands has 23 in industry for every one in government. That is what I mean by mismatch of scientific
manpower supply and demand.
Honourable senators, as I said earlier, in this particular
area, in the chapters I am dealing with, there are 25 major
recommendations. These are the recommendations that
SCITEC surveyed, and I gave you the result of the survey.
I am not going to read them all to you, although I would

SENATE DEBATES

like them to be in the record, but allow me to summarize
them very quickly by grouping them.
Of the 45, those involved in the industrial innovation
sector of the report begin at number 20. The first I have
already mentioned, that the performance of R and D in
industry be upgraded from the present 37 or 38 to 60 per
cent by 1980.
Numbers 21, 22, 23 and 24 deal with secondary manufacturing, and the recommendation we make which has certainly developed the widest interest in the press and
amongst the scientific writers and business commentators
is this:

-secondary manufacturing industries be requested
by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Commerce to
organize task forces, with proper labour representation, to consider the problems of scale and specialization and to prepare a plan within a year to improve
the efficiency, the innovative capacity and the international competitiveness of individual firms through
mergers or otherwise;
We are suggesting that the minister appoint a chairman
and a secretariat and that a special cabinet committee be
appointed to approve, after consultation, the results, and
to set up an office on industrial reorganization which will
do the operative job. It seems to me the reason this recommendation has caught the fancy of so many people is that
it appears to be a practical way of finding an answer. We
are saying that each industry set up its own task force, we
tell them to go to work, to tell the government what they
want; we say that we will give them the necessary financial support, the manpower support, and so on. Therefore,
instead of going on as we have been, with a good deal of
ivory tower solutions to some of these problems, we would
now get a practical input from industry, labour and
others, into the individual problems of each industry.
When all those results are in, of course there will be
conflicts. The government will then be in a much better
position to come up with the kinds of future strategic
industry policies that we think are needed. That is with
respect to the secondary manufacturing industries.
0 (1700)

We recommend much the same thing in respect of the
resource and primary manufacturing industries with
heavy emphasis on the importance again of an initiative
by government to insist on the further processing of raw
materials in Canada. It has been done in some provinces.
We are hopeful that we can come up with a national
strategy which will insist on this being done on a national
basis, because at the moment we are exporting most of
our valuable resources in an almost unprocessed form.
Recommendations 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 deal with the
problem of QSEs. I think I have indicated the problem.
We are suggesting now that the government get together
with the universities and industry and make a thoroughgoing survey, set up a training program to fill the gaps
and select certain centres of excellence, consult with the
Canadian Research Management Association and provide
the necessary scholarships.
Recommendation 31 suggests that there be science
policy advisers in every single department of government.
The Americans have done this very successfully. Their
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 22, 1972

Bureau of the Budget or, as it is called now, the Bureau of
Budget and Management, has a budget officer in every
department. He notices what is going on. He can advise
his superiors whether suggested expenditures are likely to
be approved by the Bureau of the Budget.
We are suggesting the same thing in this science policy
field. In our opinion there should be a science policy
expert in every department who can be consulted and can
check back with the Minister of Science and Technology
and tell him what is going on, because, again, we are
convinced that one of the serious problems is the making
of policy decisions in isolation in these various areas of
public policy without any co-ordination of those policies,
particularly in relation to their impact on our secondary
manufacturing industries.
In recommendation 32 we suggest that an interdepartmental committee on innovation should be set up. All I
can say there is that my personal view would be that it
would have to be a much better kind of interdepartmental
committee than any we have had in the past. It would
have to be one with a clear mandate, with terms of reference, with a chairman who keeps minutes, and it would
have to be one that has meetings regularly and reports.
That certainly has not been the pattern of operation of the
many interdepartmental committees in the Public Service
up to the moment.
We recommend setting up a Canadian innovation bank.
We are suggesting that there should be a government fund
to support practical and likely looking innovative developments in industry. It is interesting to note that most of the
practical innovations in industry everywhere in the world
come from small firms. I will not elaborate on that, but it
is a fact and it is one of the reasons why we suggest
setting up almost a venture capital fund within government.
Recommendation 39 deals with primary resources. We
make a plea here and elsewhere for a much greater
degree of contracting research out of government into
industry. We have the highest level in the world of funding
and performance of in-house government research and
development. That has been an obvious mistake in the
past. It has been one of those things that just grow like
Topsy. We are recommending that there be a strict limitation put upon it. We are suggesting that the government
should take the position that so much research will be
done in in-house government labs, and no more, and that
every effort will be made to contract research out to
industry. That, in fact, is the secret of American success.
It is the reason why they zoomed ahead in the world of
science and technology. They contracted out their government business. They were spending in the order of $25
billion a year on research and development, most of
which they contracted out to industry, thus building up all
over the United States various kinds of industries based
primarily on doing contract work for the government in
the field of space, defence, nuclear energy, and so on. We
say that we must reverse our policy in this respect and
contract out as much as possible research and development to industry.
An interesting example of the sort of thing that can
happen, if you do not contract out, came to light when our
committee was gathering evidence. One of our govern-

March 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

ment agencies, the name of which I shall refrain from
mentioning, was involved in a very large project which
industry wanted. The agency studied the problem. They
decided that there was no company in Canada with
enough QSEs to undertake the project, and therefore they
would have to do it in their own labs. When they started
the project they had 200 people working on it, which, as
they themselves pointed out, was more than any firm in
private industry. Within a year or so they had expanded
that force to 800. They could do that, but they did not
think industry could. Well, that is an example of what can
happen. That whole story is contained in our report.
Recommendations 40 to 42 deal with scientific and technological information. Senator Cameron covered that
aspect fully.
Recommendation 44 deals with QSEs. I have indicated

what our recommendations are in that respect.

That the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science be instructed to examine and
report upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting
public services -(Honourable Senator Forsey).
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, one speech in a
single day from me is as much as the Senate should be
expected to put up with.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I thank honourable Senator Croll for
his applause, and other honourable senators as well, and I
should be glad if this order could be allowed to stand.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I always enjoy your speeches.
Order stands.

Finally, recommendation 45 deals with the question of

mobility. That is an important problem we have run up
against. First there is the mobility of the scientists and
engineers within government departments. We suggest
that they should not get stuck within one department,
because this would narrow their focus, but that they
should move around from department to department and,
more particularly, from government to business and vice
versa, and from both government and business into
universities.
As it is, we have a very low mobility factor with respect
to our qualified scientists and engineers. Our major
recommendation in that regard, then, is that we do something about it.
In conclusion, honourable senators, we emphasize that
the major modus operandi of this kind of new industrial

strategy would require an immediate end to the senseless
adversary confrontation in Canada today between management and labour, government and industry. Students

of this problem around the world are now singling out
Canada as a horrible example of government and busi-

ness, labour and management continually being in an
adversary position. There are one or two countries where
the situation is worse, but there are very many where it is
infinitely better. For example, countries like Sweden,

Japan and Switzerland are models on which we could
base our economic future in this respect. They have

managed somehow to bring these essential elements
together. They have managed somehow to bring those

together, and I would say that a very sincere plea from
our committee to all three of them would be, "for Canada's sake and your own, get together and let us catch up
with the world in industrial innovation."

SERVICES-ORDER STANDS
On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the honourable Senator Haig, seconded by the honourable Senator Buckwold:

INCOME TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem informed the Senate that
a message had been received from the House of Commons
with Bill C-169, to amend the Income Tax Act.
Bill read first time.
Hon. Mr. McDonald moved that the bill be placed on the
Orders of the Day for second reading on Monday next.
Motion agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
UNITY BANK OF CANADA-SUSPENSION OF RULE 95

Leave having been given to revert to Motions:
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(a), that Rule 95 be
suspended with respect to Bill C-164, to incorporate Unity
Bank of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the reason for this
motion is simply that Rule 95 provides:
A private bill originating in the Senate, of which
notice is required to be given, shall not be considered
by a committee until after one week from the date of
referral to such committee and, in the case of any
such bill originating in the House of Commons, until
twenty-four hours thereafter.
As you know, we are expecting an Easter recess in the

not too distant future, and I should like to see the work of

this house progress in such a fashion that when we

adjourn for Easter we will have accomplished all the
work that appears now to lie ahead of us. It may well be
that this bill will not be considered in committee tomorrow-in fact, it may not be dealt with until Monday-but
should circumstances be such that it can be considered in
committee tomorrow, then the adoption of this motion
will help us to achieve our purpose.
This bill has been before the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce on a previous occasion, and we do not wish it be sent to that committee yet a
third time if we can possibly avoid it, which situation

SENATE DEBATES

could arise if we are flot able to deal with it before the
Easter recess.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I have only
one short comment to make. I think we sbould flot suspend one of our rules too lightly ur too carelessly. As
honourable senators are aware this is a very important
rule, and its purpose is to give those who might be affected by sucb a bill the opportunity to ask to be heard when
il is discussed in committee. Therefore, I should like 10
receive an assurance frorn the Deputy Leader of the Government that this committee will not meet so expeditiously to consider this bill that anybody wbo wishes to be
heard, or who indicates that be wishes to be heard, would
be prevented from doing so.
I might add that I would flot agree to the motion at Ibis
lime were it flot for the fact that this bill has been before
the chamber and our committee previously.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I am quite prepared to give that
assurance, and I can also assure the bouse that if this
particular bill had flot previously been considered by the
committee I would flot have asked for the agreement of
the house lu the suspension of the rule. It is quite possible
that we will flot need the suspension of the rule, but I
make this motion on the basis that it is wise to have the
permission of the bouse in case it is necessary. I can
assure the bouse that ail witnesses who wisb to appear
before the committee will have the opportunity lu do so.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Is Ibis su thal you can get il througb
before dissolution?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes-wbenever that cornes.
Hon. Mr. Croîl: Honourable senators, I think the position taken by Senator Grosart makes a great deal of
sense. I have no objection to waiving the rule with the
caveat that consideration by the comrnittee of this bill will
flot take place until Monday next.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: If the rule is suspended they need
only 24 hours.
Hon. Mr. Croli: I arn approacbing it on the basis that the
committee will flot deal with this bill until Monday next.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: But if this permission is given they
can deal witb il tomorrow.

Mrh2,17
March 22, 1972

Hon. Mr. Croli: I realize that, but if leave is flot given aI
Ibis lime it cannot be dealt with tomorrow. I assume we
are granting Ibis leave on condition that this bill will flot
be dealt with until Monday next.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is flot what was proposed. What
Senalor Grosart asked was that Ibere be nu finalization of
this bill until such lime as outsiders are given an opportunity bo register their views. That means that while the
committee could start work on the bill Iomorrow, Ihey
could not dispose of il finally until Monday or Tuesday
next, and Ibal would give the public an opportunity 10
make representations if tbey su desired.
I tbink the point Senator Grosart bas made, which bas
been supported by Senator Croîl and also, I might add, by
Senator McDonald, is a very important une. We are jealous of tbe importance of Ibis rule, and the reason for
having it as one of our rules. But in Ibis particular situation there is the strong supporting circumstance referred
tu by Senator McDonald tbat Ibis bill does flot corne 10 us
for the first lime, Il bas been before a comrnittee of Ibis
bouse on a previous occasion, and il bas been considered
in the other place in both Ibis session and the lasI session.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I would say Ihat,
as a member of Ibis bouse, rny consent is necessary if Ibis
rule is tu be suspended in Ibis instance, and I ar n ot
prepared 10 give that consent unless I gel an assurance
that tbis bill will flot go to comrnittee until Monday nexî.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: In that case Ibis motion is flot
necessary.

Hon. Mr. Croîl: Wbat is the purpose of tbe motion?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: So that the bill can go to comrnittee
tomorrow.
a (1720)

Hon. Mr. Croli: Wbat you are saying then is that it will
flot be disposed of until Monday.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes, Monday or Tuesday. I will
make that commilment.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Perbaps il would be belpful tu Senator Croil if be were assured the comrniltee will flot report
ils findings until Monday at the earliest.
Hon. Mr. Croil: Yes, that is helpful.
Motion agreed to.

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS BILL,
1972
REPORT OF COMMITTEE
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald, for Hon. Mr. Hayden,
Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce, reported that the committee had
considered Bill C-8, to authorize the making of certain
fiscal payments to provinces, to authorize the entry into
tax collection agreements with provinces, and to amend
the Established Programs (Interim Arrangements) Act,
and had directed that the bill be reported without
amendment.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: With leave, I move that the bill be
read the third time now.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, before today's
proceedings began I had told Senator Manning that I
would respond on third reading to statements made in his
speech.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On third reading, not before.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Manning's interesting and able
speech contained statements that nevertheless required a
reply. I had thought of replying at the time. In view of the
importance of the matter, I do so now after having had
the opportunity of reflecting on what he said and obtaining certain figures.
e (1410)

Senator Manning contended, when we were on second
reading, that the Province of Quebec receives too much in
equalization. In answer to that, Quebec has 6 million
people and accounts for 60 per cent of the population
living in the provinces with below-average tax bases, so
naturally it receives the largest share of equalization. In
general, its share has been about one-half of the total
payment, which is well below their population share. If
the principle of equalization means anything, it must be
applied, I am sure we all agree, to all provinces.
Senator Manning also indicated that if Quebec is receiving over $400 million, then the total cost of the program
must be too high. In order to put equalization in perspective, the program must be considered in relation to total
provincial expenditures. In 1972-73 these expenditures
will gross to an amount well in excess of $17 billion.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): To the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Martin: No, of the provinces. It naturally costs
a substantial sum of money to equalize revenues raised to
finance expenditures of this magnitude.
Senator Manning also suggests that the federal government's equalization program should not be concerned
with revenues to finance all provincial expenditure programs, but only with those for financing health, welfare

SENATE DEBATES

and education. However, these three categories account
for about three-quarters of total provincial expenditures,
including a pro rata share of the general overhead. Nor is
the other quarter unimportant. It includes administration
of justice, grants to local government, expenditures for
protection of the environment, and so forth.
Senator Manning further suggests that Quebec is a
resources-rich province. Impartial statistical evidence
does not support this view, except in the case of water
power. In so far as minerals, oil, gas, and even forestry
are concerned, the Quebec share of the tax base is below
the national average. Quebec has no oil or gas production
at all. This is particularly significant since about 60 per
cent of the revenues which provinces derive from natural
resources come from oil and gas.
Finally, the honourable senator suggests that natural
resource revenues from the sale of assets should be
excluded from equalization. These are included because
they are used by provinces to finance expenditures in the
sane way as other revenues-tax revenues, for example.
Equalization is ultimately concerned, both as a principle
and as an objective, with enabling the have-not provinces
to finance their expenditures. This is done with reference
to whatever taxes and levies the ten provinces choose to
levy to finance them.
Senator Manning noted that one kind of levy on oil or
gas may be substituted for another. This, of course, is true
and provides an additional reason for equalizing revenues
of all kinds. Otherwise, provinces might be tempted to
distort their tax systems in order to influence the amount
of equalization payments.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, the Minister
of Finance appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce this morning to
discuss the problems which the Leader of the Government has just raised. I, together with the Leader of the
Government, can understand the observations made yesterday by Senator Manning, and perhaps the criticism
that was levelled some time ago by the Premier of British
Columbia against equalization payments. I am not supporting the equalization payments on a legal basis; I was
never convinced that strictly speaking they were entirely
within the scope of our Constitution. However, on a practical and equitable basis, it is very difficult to argue
against equalization payments. After all, the way the federal government distributes the income it gets from taxes
is done on a practical and equity basis. You give more to
those who need more. The same principle is involved.
In Quebec, equalization payments represent only 10 per
cent of the budget for the fiscal year commencing April 1
next, not 16 per cent, which is a figure that has been
mentioned. It is therefore not very important in itself. It is
an important figure, $400 million, but it is only 10 per cent
of a budget of $4 billion. If it is justified, as I think it is,
that equalization payments should help have-not provinces to the extent of 65 per cent, or even more, of their
budgets, then it is very difficult to be critical of an equalization payment providing 10 per cent of the Quebec
budget.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE ON
SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (B) PRESENTED AND
PRINTED AS APPENDIX
Hon. Douglas D. Everett, Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance, presented the
following report of the committee, to which was referred
Supplementary Estimates (B) laid before Parliament for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1972, and asked that the
report be printed as an appendix to the Debates of the
Senate and the Minutes of the Proceedings of today and
form part of the permanent record of this house.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed
that this report be printed as an appendix to the Debates
of the Senate and the Minutes of the Proceedings of
today and form part of the permanent record of this
house?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
For text of report see Appendix pp 226-33.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Everett: With leave of the Senate, now. As I
understand it, the supply legislation will be in the hands
of the Senate on Monday next. For this reason I am
requesting leave of the Senate to deal with this matter
now.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Everett: Honourable senators, there is only one
item with which I should like to deal in respect of this
report of the committee. It is a matter that concerns the $1
items, about which this chamber has been concerned for
some time, especially those items which are used by the
administration for legislative purposes.
The special concern of your committee has been that
amendments to legislation take place in this way, and the
fact that these amendments are themselves law is not
communicated either to members of the legal profession
or to the public generally and very often does not appear
in the Revised Statutes. When any legislative commitment
is amended we would like to have that amendment incorporated by way of a special act. However, considering the
press of business with which Parliament is confronted,
this is not always possible. Therefore, your committee
recommends:
... that consideration be given to the formalization of
the amending effects of such $1 votes in Appropriation Acts by explicit amendments to the existing acts
concerned in a separate schedule to any Appropriation Act where such amendments are required.
Thus, amendments which take place now under Appropriation Acts would be given their actual wording and
legal meaning and would be included in any list of amendments published by any law reports, digests or other
agencies. We believe that this would be extremely useful
in making sure that the legal profession and the public
generally are made aware of amendments made by this
method.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: When they are not legislative in
character.
Hon. Mr. Everett: I was going to say that our opposition
to the $1 items is the legislative nature of them. We have
not been able to convince the government, however, that
they should drop that method of legislation altogether.
That is why we are asking them to attach a schedule to an
Appropriation Act that does constitute an actual amendment to the act.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): May I ask Senator
Everett a question? He talks about legislative enactments
in an appropriation bill. This is purely a matter of semantics, but every item in an appropriation bill is, of course,
legislative action. I take it that when he is talking about
the legislative effect of certain items, particularly $1
items, he is pinpointing amendments to existing statutes
as a result of the enactment of a section dealing with the
$1 item. What he desires, as I understand it, is that the
amendments to existing legislation by these items should
be clarified so that anyone reading a statute and following
up on the amendments will know precisely what effect
was had upon an existing statute by the introduction of a
$1 item or a similar item in an Estimates bill. Is that right?
Hon. Mr. Everett: I could only wish that the honourable
senator had given the explanation of the report instead of
myself. Indeed, the Estimates are all legislative in character, but most of the Estimates concern $1 sums. There are
certain items in the Estimates that actually change the
terms of the act in non-dollar amounts, and that is what
we mean when we talk about the legislative effect of the
Estimates, especially as that pertains to $1 items.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Very good.
Hon. W. M. Benidickson: Honourable senators, I rose
before to ask a question. I should now like to make one or
two brief remarks.
In recent years, the form of the Estimates bas changed
considerably from the pattern I became used to when I
was a member in the other place. We were told that the
change in form would provide us with somewhat better
information as to the purposes of each vote. When I examHon. Mr. Flynn: I should like to be clear on the state- ined carefully Supplementary Estimates (B) for the purment made by Senator Everett. I do not think he meant

I might also mention that these Supplementary Estimates (B) provide for $185 million of funds to be provided
by Parliament, $98 million for loans, investments and
advances. That brings the total expenditures for the year
ending March 31, 1972, to $16,474 million, of which $15,195
million is for budgetary items and $1,279 million is for
loans, investments and advances.
Honourable senators, we further recommend that in
future the explanation of $1 items be provided the committee in advance of meeting with the officials of the
Treasury Board. This has been agreed to by the Treasury
Board. Also, we recommend that the blue book containing
Supplementary Estimates (B) be expanded to include the
type of explanation given of $1 items in the list with which
we are provided at the beginning of each committee
meeting.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Honourable senators, may I ask
the chairman of the committee if it was not agreed--I
thought it had been-not to confine our recommendation
for explanations of $1 items alone. I thought what we
wanted was an explanation of any item that was legislative in effect and was in substitution for what we would
normally expect to be a separate bill amending an existing statute.
Hon. Mr. Everett: The honourable senator makes an
excellent point. Indeed, that was discussed with the officials of the Treasury Board. The legislative items, while
they are largely matters of $1 items, do, indeed, include
items for which there is an appropriation of a larger
amount. It was my understanding in the discussion with
the officials of the Treasury Board that in the past they
had attempted to include these items as legislative items
and it had been recommended by our committee that they
confine themselves to the $1 items.
I think at our next meeting they are going to provide us
with a list of the items that are legislative in character but
are not $1 items, and it would be my suggestion that we
defer any action on that until we see the list and see how
germane it is to the sort of examinations we are having.

SENATE DEBATES
but this arrived too late to compensate for the amount of
research necessary yesterday and the day before to learn
what information was available as a result of questioning
in the committee of the other place.
I will give you an illustration. With respect to ferries,
under the Department of Transport, you will find in the
Blue Book containing Supplementary Estimates (B) what
was called an explanation-simply the words "Ferry Service." It does not tell you from what point to what point
the ferries operate, and as I recall it the amount of money
involved was $16 million. All they had to do to satisfy me
as a non-Maritimer, and to give me some information
about that item, was to add a few more words to the effect
that the ferry operated from such and such a place to
another place, and I would have understood. Instead I had
to take the time to ask somebody else, or look back to
other documents to see what it was all about.
My point, honourable senators, is that while in the new
form they pretend to be giving us better information than
was the case in the past, I have found in many instances
that the information is so terse and so unspecific that it
really is not much of an improvement. Furthermore, I do
not think the number of pages in the printed books of
Estimates would be enlarged very greatly if they were to
add half a dozen words or so in giving the explanation. In
most instances it would not come to more than one line,
and in many instances it could be done simply by filling
out the remaining unprinted space on a line. That would
give us information which I think we as parliamentarians
should have.

SCIENCE POLICY
CONSIDERATION OF VOLUME Il OF REPORT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the consideration of Volume II of the Report of
the Special Committee on Science Policy, tabled in the
Senate on Thursday, February 24, 1972.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I should
like to begin my remarks by congratulating Senator
Lamontagne and the other senators who have preceded
me in this debate on the excellence of their presentations.
We have already heard three very eloquent and comprehensive speeches on science policy, from Senator Lamontagne and Senator Cameron and, yesterday, from Senator
Grosart. The subject has been covered now so thoroughly
that it remains for me mainly to fill in some of the remaining gaps, and flesh out some of the points which were not
fully developed in the earlier speeches.
As Senator Lamontagne pointed out in his clear and
lucid manner, the Special Senate Committee on Science
Policy approached their task in three stages. First, they
took a look backwards through history and traced the
development of the Canadian economy and the concomitant science policy that developed along with it. Next, the
committee made an appraisal of the current situation as it
existed at that particular time in accordance with our own
observations and the latest information and opinions
available to us. The third stage was to take a look into the
future to try and see what changes will have to be made,
not only to correct the mistakes of the past but to enable
Canada and particularly the Canadian economy to adjust
successfully to the new challenges that lie ahead.

Miarch 23, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

The backward look was outlined in detail in Volume I.
Briefly stated, Canada's first industrial strategy was initiated by Sir John A. Macdonald in 1867. It rested mainly
on the construction of the first transcontinental railway
and encouragement of secondary industry through high
tariff protection, for which at that time there was no
alternative. Canada's second industrial strategy was initiated by the government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. It was
based on the opening up of the west, which gave a great
impetus to the extension of secondary manufacturing in
central Canada.
In the manufacturing sector high tariff protection had
in time led to the attraction of branch plant subsidiaries
of foreign companies reproducing products developed by
their parent companies but geared to the much smaller
Canadian market. This, in turn, generated what is often
referred to as "the scale problem." Sir Wilfrid Laurier
attempted to overcome this problem by trying to negotiate
free trade with the United States, but this led to his defeat
in 1911.
In time, Laurier's strategy became superimposed on
that of Macdonald's and the two were further modified by
a major technological revolution that took place in the
United States. This was the second technological revolution within the United States of America and its products-motorcars, electrical appliances, et ceterarequired large quantities of resource materials such as
minerals, pulpwood, and cheap hydraulic power.
United States industry was very quick to realize that
their local supplies were not nearly sufficient for their
growing needs but that their next door neighbour,
Canada, had these resources in abundance. Consequently,
United States money flowed into the natural resource
sector of the Canadian economy. Since national resources
are under provincial jurisdiction and the provinces were
naturally anxious to improve their slow growing economies, the federal government had no way of shaping or
influencing Canadian industrial strategy except through
tariff and export trade policies. The net result was a rapid
expansion of the branch plant economy, both in the
manufacturing and the natural resource sectors. In fact,
United States needs along with their capital and knowhow became the prime movers of Canadian economic
growth. For example, in 1900 United States investment in
Canada was only $205 million, less than 16 per cent of the
foreign investment total. In 1966, it had reached more
than $25 billion, over 80 per cent of foreign investment in
Canada.
With that background we can take a look at where we
are and how we compare with other industrialized countries at the present time. Our economic growth today
derives mainly from two sources. One source is increased
exploitation of our natural resources, combined with a
trade policy concerned mainly with obtaining the most
favourable entry into foreign markets for our raw materials and primary products. The other source is a secondary
manufacturing industry based on tariff protection, abundance of natural resources and easy access to foreign
capital and know-how, but often geared to horizons fixed
by the small domestic market.
It cannot be denied that this industrial strategy has
provided Canadians with a high standard of living, but at

213

the same time it has made our economy extremely
dependent upon foreign capital and extremely vulnerable
to decisions and policies of other nations. Furthermore,
the exploitation of our natural resources by foreign subsidiaries and the export of our primary products tend to
relegate Canadians to the status of hewers of wood and
drawers of water for the larger industrialized nations. If
this is continued on an ever-increasing scale for a few
more years, it will probably be too late for anything to be
done about it.

So much for our current industrial strategy and the
results it has produced. If we take a look at the present
state of our science policy which has developed side by
side with it and compare it with other countries, we find
that in the Western world as a whole somewhere between
40 per cent and 60 per cent of all economic growthvarying from country to country-results from quality
improvements and efficiency factors. In Canada, however, the growth from industrial innovation and R and D
activities is negligible. That is a direct result of the present
science policy which has evolved over the years parallel
with our present industrial strategy. In actual fact our
present science policy generates a climate that tends to
discourage our industries from becoming innovation-oriented and in some cases inhibits them altogether. This is
particularly true of individual inventors and entrepreneurs.
A science degree is not a prerequisite to the generation
of marketable ideas. Ordinary persons with average education often hatch ideas that can be marketed profitably
but in Canada this source of wealth lies relatively
untapped. Numerous instances were brought to the attention of the committee and to individual members where
individual investors and entrepreneurs had good ideas
but when seeking help from government agencies such as
NRC and the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce they got the merry old run-around.
( 1450)

A typical example is described in chapter 12 of Galt,
U.S.A., which is available in the Library. It relates the
experience of Mel Hill and Peter Dicks, two ordinary
Canadians, who had invented a machine to shape plastic
without pressure. They patented their idea and ploughed
into it every cent they could spare from their salaries.
Their machine made possible a 20 per cent increase in
output with about 40 per cent lower unit costs, and had a
good export potential. They came to Ottawa to get a grant
from the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce
under the PAIT program. They were received enthusiastically, and in due course an official came to see them and
asked a number of questions. Three months went by, and
they were being asked the same questions all over again.
Four months passed, and they received another visit from
officials, who called the whole deal off because they had
started work on their machine in the interval. They said,
"If you have already started it, it is not a development,
because you must know what you are doing. We can only
give you money if you don't do anything until we approve
it." An additional six months would be required for
approval.
The machine required extremely thin, stress-free nickel
moulds which the designers had to import from the

SENATE DEBATES

United States of America. Since nickel is a Canadian
product, Hill and Dicks thought it made sense to manufacture their own moulds. They went to NRC, talked to
certain individuals who took down all the information,
and went away feeling they had had a very good
reception.
Three or four weeks later NRC informed them that
their application had been turned down because experts
in the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources had
said that what they wanted to do could not be done. This
was despite the fact that not only had the process been
used successfully in the United States for the past ten
years, but Mr. Hill had actually taken along a casting and
shown it to NRC, and had given them the name of the
company in the U.S.A. that was making them. He also
gave them the name of the man in the U.S.A. to contact
for further information.
I talked to Mr. Hill on the telephone, and he feels very
strongly that he was given the run-around. When he suggested to NRC that he contact the EMR experts directly,
they said, "Oh, no, you must go through us." Mr. Hili
claims that the NRC was the most disappointing agency
he visited, but that he received the brush-off from all of
them.
However, despite rejection by NRC, EMR, and Industry,
Trade and Commerce, Mr. Hill and his company, Spraymould, are now on the way to success. He has been visited
by four groups from Japan and one group from Switzerland, and is presently negotiating licences in those two
countries. He has also been visited by interested parties
from Australia, France, West Germany, and Scandinavia,
but adds that in Canada no one is interested.
I asked Mr. Hill if he knew of others who had had
similar experiences, and he told me that when his story
appeared in the Financial Post and Galt, U.S.A., a
number of persons had telephoned him to say that their
experiences were identical to his.
Research expenditures have increased from $20 million
in 1940 to $800 million in 1967, but our research effort is
fragmented among government agencies such as NRC
and a number of federal departments, as well as among
universities and industries scattered all across the country, each going his own merry way with little or no contact
with each other.
This fragmentation results in several government
organizations being involved in one function, with the
result that people from industry, such as Mr. Hill, have to
knock on up to ten doors whenever they wish to discuss
assistance programs, instead of on one door as recommended by the committee.
There is no inventory of research programs, no system
of establishing priorities, and little or no means of evaluating the programs, of co-ordinating them, or of establishing standards of excellence. It is hoped that this situation will be effectively dealt with by the new Ministry of
State for Science and Technology.
The committee found that Canadian research programs
were heavily weighted in favour of pure or basic research,
compared with applied research and mission-oriented
research and development. This imbalance is the reverse
[Hon Mr Carterd

March 23, 1972

of what is happening in other advanced industrialized
countries. On page 491 of the report, the committee states:
-in 1967, Canada spent only 39 per cent of its national
R and D effort on technological development and that
the business enterprise sector performed only 38 per
cent of the total R and D activities. The comparisons
indicated that these two percentages were the inverse
of the practice in other advanced countries. They also
revealed that the Canadian government funded only
18 per cent of the cost of the industrial R and D
performed by business, which was a much lower proportion than in several other advanced nations,
including the United States (53 per cent), France (42
per cent), and Britain (35 per cent). Another special
feature of the Canadian scene was that the government sector was a substantially larger performer of R
and D than in most other countries.
A recent OECD study on innovation indicates that the
innovative capability of a company cannot be measured
solely by the number of PhDs on their staff, but rather by
the total number of R and D teams in that company; in
other words, by the total number of qualified scientists,
engineers and supporting staff engaged in R and D. For
brevity, this latter group is termed QSES. It is suggested,
therefore, that the ability of a company to compete in
innovation depends on the size of the various QSES teams
in various industrial units. The evidence indicates that
Canada is weak in this regard, as our report states on
page 492:
A similar imbalance is found in comparisons of the
number of people working in R and D .. . Figures for
the total number of QSESs conducting R and D in
Canada show that the Canadian government has a
disproportionately high number of QSESs and,
second, that the number of QSESs in the industrial
sector is proportionately lower than in the industrial
sectors of some other countries . . . German industry
employs 18 QSESs in R and D for every one in government. For the Netherlands the corresponding number
is 23, for Sweden about 5.
For Canada it is less than one.

0

(1500)

The second point can be illustrated by comparisons
with Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands. Although
Sweden's population is only two-fifths of Canada's,
the total number of QSESs conducting R and D in
Swedish industry is 25 per cent higher than in
Canada. With less than half of Canada's population
Belgium comes within 12 per cent of the number of
QSESs conducting R and D in Canadian industry.
Industrial R and D QSESs in the Netherlands, which
has about three-fifths of Canada's population, outnumber those in Canada by almost two to one.
Some of our worst problems today are social problems,
yet the social sciences are neglected almost completely in
our science policy.
There is also a great gulf between the universities and
industry. The universities have shown little interest in the
problems of industry, and the scientists and engineers
they turn out do not have the proper mental attitudes, nor
do they have the proper scientific training to do the kind
of scientific research and development that industry

March 23, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

requires. In fact, universities are so oriented in favour of
basic and pure research that Professor H.I. Schiff of York
University described the efforts of science professors in
these words, and I quote from page 518 of the report:
What we are doing, then, is producing carbon copies
of ourselves, because, after all, we have turned out so
well the best thing we can do for the students is to
make them over in our own image.
This is borne out by the fact that the first choice of a
graduate is to find a job in a university where he can
continue the work he has been doing. Failing that, his
second choice is to find a position in a government laboratory, and only as a last resort will he look for work in
industry.
To remedy this situation the committee has made a
number of recommendations which I need not repeat
because they were outlined in detail by Senator Lamontagne in his excellent speech in this chamber on March 2,
1972. I feel, however, that two points which Senator
Lamontagne made at that time cannot be emphasized too
much or repeated too often. The first point is that what
the Senate Committee proposes is the restructuring of our
present institutions. The committee does not propose that
the National Research Council or any other agency be
dismantled, but rather that the total scientific program be
reorganized and the scientific effort redistributed
between government laboratories, industry and universities on a more logical basis, and in a manner that will
have a much better chance of correcting the deficiencies
to which I have already referred.
The second point which cannot be repeated or stressed
too often is that the committee does not recommend that
less money be allocated for basic research. If the committee's recommendations are adopted, in time, more money
will be spent on basic research than ever before. What the
committee does recommend, however, is that the imbalance between basic research and mission-oriented
research be corrected and reversed. The need for this
should already be evident by our comparison with other
advanced industrialized countries. It will become more
evident in a moment when we look at the challenges that
lie ahead.
Looking into the future, we see emerging a new set of
world economic conditions that will last at least until the
end of this century. To start with, we see the world population doubling, a world shortage of pure fresh water, a
world much more sensitive to pollution and damage to
our environmental and eco-systems. We see the danger of
world hunger crises caused by protein shortage due to
lack of phosphates for fertilizers. We see new trade patterns developing and multinational corporations expanding their networks, dominating the international scene,
and in the process, freeing themselves in large measure
from political and governmental control.
At the same time we see the world's reserves of natural
resources being depleted at an exponential rate which in
the 1980s will be moving towards a state of permanent
scarcity of both renewable and nonrenewable resources.
The Systems Dynamics Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has accumulated evidence indicating
the severe implications of the finite resources of nature,
many of which are approaching a point of exhaustion.

For example, the world's known supply of lead and platinum could be exhausted within twelve years, mercury
within thirteen years, and practically all the basic minerals within 35 years. Incidentally, this throws into perspective the importance of the ocean floors and the debate
about who owns them.
This very fact by itself will necessitate a technological
race to find substitutes as well as to conserve and make
more efficient use of present supplies. Recycling of wastes
is already a necessity and already the large powers are
actively exploring the technology necessary for the exploitation of the resources of the oceans and the ocean floors.
The international technological race is already on and
gaining momentum. It is not difficult to imagine what will
happen to Canada if we simply continue on as we have
been going for the past 20 years with an industrial strategy based heavily on the exploitation of our natural
resources, and with a fragmented secondary manufacturing sector unable to exist without tariff protection and,
therefore, unable to compete in world markets, and at the
same time with no innovation-orientation worth
mentioning.
In Canada today we are faced with a serious unemployment problem because although our economy last year
expanded at the rate of 9 per cent and is now expanding
even faster, it is still not sufficient to ensure full employment. We need 250,000 new jobs a year just to keep up
with our expanding labour force. Where is the economic
growth needed for these new jobs to come from? One
source, of course, would be increased exploitation of our
natural resources but, in the face of coming world shortages, that seems hardly a wise thing to do. Furthermore,
that will ensure Canadians becoming permanent hewers
of wood and drawers of water, and at the same time push
up our exchange rate. What about the secondary manufacturing sector? As long as our secondary industries are
fragmented and geared mainly to the domestic market,
that source holds out little promise. The third source must
be technological innovation.
On page 488 of the report, the committee concludes as
follows:
In the whole spectrum of investment expenditures,
the funds devoted to technological innovation may
have the highest multiplier effect on economic growth
and the standard of living. The direct technological
multiplier effect is great because the innovative country usually has a seller's market for several years
during which it can build substantial export sales and
consolidate its position when competition develops
through imitation on licensing to producers in other
countries. What is more, investment in innovations
has a large indirect technological effect in other enterprises and sectors. Professor James B. Quinn of Dartmouth College has summarized this point:
... in stimulating long-term growth, policy makers
must recognize that the driving force is not investment itself, but the technological multiplier that innovation can achieve; (1) by increasing the productivity
or value added of the sector in which it is employed,
(2) by lowering the factor costs of those who utilize the
output of that sector and releasing their resources for
other useful purposes, and (3) by stimulating "respon-

SENATE DEBATES

sive innovations" in customer, supplier or functionally
competitive branches.
* (1510)

It is clear, then, that to meet the challenges of the future
Canada must have a new industrial strategy. The committee has suggested that we slow down the exploitation of
our resource sector, restructure our secondary manufacturing sector so that they can concentrate more on technological innovation in order to meet world-wide competition with their present products, and at the same time
develop new products for the world market.
However, to do that requires a science policy quite
different from that which we have now. To bring this
about, the committee has made 45 recommendations
which, with the exception of a few outspoken scientistswho appear to want to maintain the status quo at all
costs-have been generally well received.
Last year, when I spoke on Volume I of this report, I
referred to SCITEC, the Association of the Scientific,
Engineering and Technological Community of Canada,
and said that if nothing else developed from the committee's work the birth of SCITEC was well worth the effort.
SCITEC is now a full-fledged organization, and when
Volume II of the committee's report became available
SCITEC set up a response committee under the chairmanship of Dr. R. Quittenton, Dean of St. Clair College, in
the Honourable Paul Martin's home town of Windsor.
This response committee is a group of approximately 100
authoritative people selected proportionately from the
various disciplines represented by the association, half of
them being basic research scientists and the other half
applied research scientists.
On January 27 they were mailed a list of the 45 recommendations given in Volume II, along with the chairman's
summary of the report. On February 26 SCITEC held its
first annual meeting here in Ottawa, and on that date
approximately one-third of the response committee had
been heard from. Presumably the latter group constitutes
those with a serious interest in a science policy for
Canada.
Judging by the vote of this one-third of the response
committee, the recommendations of Volume II were overwhelmingly supported. Of the 45 recommendations in
Volume 11, 42 had a majority in support of them. I talked
with Dr. Quittenton on Friday last, and by that time he
had heard from additional members, but there had been
no significant percentage change in the original results.
Dr. Quittenton informed me that of those heard from,
roughly half were engaged in basic research and the other
half in applied research.
Not one recommendation had a majority opposition,
although three recommendations did not have majority
support. Nevertheless, these recommendations, numbers
15, 16 and 23, were approved by 42 per cent, 33 per cent
and 40 per cent respectively. Recommendation 23, recommending a special cabinet committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce,
was characterized by 42 per cent abstention.
The three recommendations which were not given
majority support, nor majority rejection, landed in limbo.
It would appear that this was due to some confusion
[Hon. Mr. Carterd

March 23, 1972

regarding recommendations 15 and 16 as to the implications of the recommended priority to be given to the social
sciences, or in applying the criterion of social merit. The
situation regarding Recommendation 23 probably resulted from the lack of knowledge as to how cabinet government operates.
Seventy per cent approved the setting up of a Canadian
research board, together with three foundations. Sixtyseven per cent approved the setting up of a national
research academy; only 15 per cent rejected this. Fiftyeight per cent approved the setting up of the Canadian
Industrial Laboratories Corporation, whereas only 12 per
cent rejected this and 30 per cent abstained.
Several recommendations received a very high degree
of approval. Ninety-one per cent approved of the Canadian government adopting an overall plan for the seventies
for science and technology. Ninety-four per cent approved
of the Minister of State for Science and Technology keeping a national R and D inventory, and developing an audit
of current R and D programs and projects being supported by public funds. Ninety-one per cent approved of a
national conference of university and industry people
regarding improved innovation. Ninety-one per cent
approved of setting up a Canadian innovation bank. Ninety-one per cent approved of increasing the mobility of R
and D personnel, with special emphasis on transfers from
government to industry. Over half the recommendations
were approved of by 70 per cent or more of the
respondents.
SCITEC is also polling about 350 people in the SCITEC
community at large. The initial response last Friday was
not very different from that of the response committee,
although only a small fraction had been heard from. This
information was made public at the SCITEC main meeting on February 26, but as far as I know no reference has
been made to it in the press or mass media.
Honourable senators, I feel that the committee's recommendations are not only sensible and practical, but they
are absolutely essential if Canada is to meet successfully
the challenges that we must face in the remaining years of
this century. I trust, therefore, they will receive your
support.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, for Hon. Mr. Thompson, debate adjourned.
POVERTY
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 14, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Croll, calling
the attention of the Senate to the Report of the Special
Committee of the Senate on Poverty in Canada, tabled in
the Senate on Wednesday, November 10, 1971.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
because I am a member of the Special Senate Committee
on Poverty I am pleased to take part in this debate on the
report, and to share with my colleagues some of my
experiences as a member of that committee.
Certainly I welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to
the guidance given to the committee and its work by the
chairman, Senator Croll, who for many years has devoted

March 23, 1972

Marh 2,

172SENATE

much of his time and efforts towards improving the condition of the less fortunate, the disinherited in our country, of whom there are far too many.
I have had the privilege of being a member of a number
of other committees of which Senator Croil was chairman
or co-chairman. To ail of them he gave outstanding service, but to the Poverty Committee he gave such dedicated,
untiring devotion and leadership that he will long be
remembered fromn coast to coast in Canada as the champion of the poor, many of whom look to him as their only
hope.
Han. Senators: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: The deputy chairman, Senator
Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), whose present iilness
we deeply regret, also made a valuable contribution to the
work of the committee, as did Senator Carter, who
assumed Senator Fournier' s responsibilities when he
became ili. and who gave such a knowledgeable and
scholarly explanation of parts of the report in the debate
in the chamber on November 16 last. My colleague
reminds me that Senator Carter has also given other
excellent speeches regarding the Poverty report. I believe
his latest was before the Canadian Bar Association.
e(1520)

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes, I saw that in the latest report.
At the head table, he was very dignified.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: As usual.
Hon. Mr. Croîl: He may start practising law.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Many other members of the committee also deserve commendation for their attendance
and participation. The hearings, both in Ottawa and elsewhere, were prolonged and often exhausting, for we
toured rural areas and talked with poor farmers and
fishermen. We walked through and viewed for ourselves
Vancouver's skid row, and atrocious housing in Charlottetown, Whitehorse, and Tracadie. We saw deplorable,
depressing, tar-paper shacks on the fringe of Halifax and
heard of the tremendous cultural and other adjustment
difficulties the Indians and Métis face when they forsake
the countryside and try to adapt to urban living in Winnipeg. We also saw some of the regrettable conditions
existing amongst the Indian and Métis people who had not
gone to the cities.
Ahl speeches made in the debate on the report have been
excellent and those made by committee members show
the interest taken by tbem in the work of tbe committee
and also that, in the main, they support its
recommendations.
Because about 55 per cent of low-income families live in
urban areas, many people consider poverty is strictly an
urban problem. It should not be forgotten that 45 per
cent-almost half-still live in rural regions.
As you know fromn his speech in this debate, Senator
McGrand took special interest in the causes of rural poverty, and in what means might be adopted to elimînate it. I
think honourable senators should know that, after the
committee was established and when the Senate was not
sitting, Senator MeGrand visited several foreign countries, including Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland,
which countries had all experienced a similar problem, to

DEBATES

21l'i

learn what had been done by themn to overcome the problem of poverty, and what success had been achieved.
Senator McGrand believes, as you know from his
speech, that much success migbt be acbieved in eliminating rural poverty in Canada if more attention were given
to developing our forestry and fishing resources, as has
been done in some other countries. His arguments
impressed many of bis colleagues, amongst whom I certainly can be numbered, and I hope further investigations
will be carried out along the lines he suggested.
Committee members were grateful to Senator Hervé
Michaud of New Brunswick-I regret that he has been
called out of the chamber-who, although he was not a
member of the committee, joined some of its members
when we visited parts of his home province. His understanding of the desperate conditions in that province was
shown very clearly in his recent contribution to the debate
on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne on
February 24 last, when he made an eloquent plea on
behaif of his own county of Kent, where members of the
committee had observed many of the conditions he
referred to.
Honourable senators, I remind you that Canada has
subscribed to the United Nations Declaration of Human
Rights, Article 25(l) of which says:
Everyone has the rigbt to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his
family, including food, clothing, housing and medical
care and necessary social services, and the right to
security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood
in circumstances beyond bis control.
The Declaration does not say everyone is entitled to
these tbings only if he or she is able to get a job and earn
sufficient money to pay for them-whicb seems to me to
be the philosophy of many Canadians, especially amongst
the well-to-do. Certainly Canadians are not making a
great success of implementing in their own country this
Article of the Universal Declaration, to which Canada has
given its support, wben the conditions exist which the
Special Committee on Poverty learned about through
brief s presented to them, and whicb they witnessed for
tbemselves when they visited different parts of this
country.
Is it a standard of living adequate for health and wellbeing wben a mother, who is the sole support of her
family and ber cbildren, because of circumstances beyond
ber control, bas to live in a building where the floors are
obviously unsafe, and where tbe members of the committee upon entering the house were warned wbere they
should step. We were told that if we did not follow tbe
warnings we would go tbrougb the dangerous floor.
Farmers wbo own cows, horses, or other livestock would
not house them like that, because of the danger of financial loss through broken legs, but in Canada we saw
children living under those conditions, and we know the
conditions we saw were not exceptional. cases.
In one area we visited, no bouses had brick cbimneys.
Smoke was carried out by stovepipes. Àlthougb we saw
these homes only in mild weatber, we were told it was
neyer possible to heat them properly, and that in winter
the walls were often lined witb frost because an adequate

SENATE DEBATES

fire in the only stove would inevitably cause the stovepipe
through the roof to become overheated and set the roof on
fire. Children are living in these bouses, wbere they are
either haif frozen in winter or in danger of being burned
alive. Is this housing adequate for health and well being?
In one of these 1 4-storey houses in "stove-pipe town"agamn the home of a sole-support mother and ber familywe noticed a hole in the floor of the attic where the
children slept. The bole was near the stovepipe and we
were told that the youngest child-really a baby-had
fallen through it, on to the kitchen stove in the room
below. There was no fire in the stove at the time, but the
baby had not investigated this, and the same thing could
have happened if there had been a fire. Surely this is flot
providing properly for the well-being of a family which is
in want, due to circumstances beyond their control.
I see Senator Quart nodding ber head at some of this. I
know that she saw some of the things I saw, because we
were together on many of these investigations.
During the hearings of the Special Committee on Poverty, I learned about things I bad neyer dreamed existed in
this country. I learned too that many belief s which I had
held-and which I presumne had been held by other members of the committee and by members of this bouse,' and
which are stili beld by many people in Canada-were not
true, that, in fact, they are myths left over from the l9th
Century.
*(1.530)

We found that the belief that economnic growth will of
itself provide enough jobs to eliminate poverty is one such
myth. In fact, witnesses expressed the opinion that, if we
had sufficient economie growth, enough jobs would be
engendered so that almost everyone would be employed,
and poverty would not exist. The truth is that, with the
growth of automation, more jobs are being performed by
fewer people all the time, and the need for labour, either
skilled or unskilled, is less. In the 1960s we had tremendous economic growtb. Although the well-to-do became
better off, the numbers of poor did not decrease and the
gap between the two groups became even wider.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States of
America once said that "the test of our progress and of
our society is flot wbether we add more to the abundance
of those who have much; it is wbether we provide enough
for those who have too little."
Economic growth may provide more jobs. Indeed, it
will. But in the past it was flot the poor but the middle and
upper class workers who benefited from economic
growth. Such growth will flot in itself eliminate poverty.
Another belief we discarded as a result of our hearings
was that poor people are lazy, and prefer to live on welfare rather than to work. But actual studies have shown
that flot more than 1 or 2 per cent of them do this.
Moreover, many of the witnesses whom we heard, people
who deal with the poor from day to day, supported the
findings of those studies.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Was Prime Minister Trudeau a witness
on this point?
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Well, the Minister of Health and
Welfare agrees.
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.

Mrh2,17
March 23, 1972

Hon. Mr. Martin: Well, his government certainly has
done a lot.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: 0f course.
Hon. Mns. Fergusson: We learned that over 50 per cent
of the poor in Canada-that is, those whose income is
below the poverty line-are flot living on welfare; they
work full time. But even though they do work full time
they are unable to make enough money to provide a,
decent basic standard of living for themselves and their
families.
Another 25 per cent of the poor in Canada are those
who are unable to work because tbey are the disabled.
They are the blind, the physically and mentally ill, the
elderly, and the female heads of families who cannot go
out to work because their cbildren are too young. Surely,
any civilized country looks after this 25 per cent.
The remainîng 25 per cent of the poor in Canada are the
bard core 'welfarites,» those who are flot entirely out of
the labour force as are the disabled, the blind, the physically and mentally ill, and the female heads of families
witb young children, but who, for ahl practical purposes,
are unemployable at the present time because for the
most part they lack education, skills, and opportunities.
Tbe putting into effect of certain of our recommendations
will tend to remedy tbis situation.
A report in the Ottawa Citizen of Marcb 15, 1972, concerning a task force set up by tbe Honourable Thomas
Wells wben he was Minister of Social and Family Services
in the Ontario goverfiment, states that tbe task force
admitted that laziness is a problem "of minor proportions
because the relatively rare instances of it receive wide
publicity and arouse intense resentment." It can be seen
from that statement that tbere are only rare instances in
the minds of the members of tbe task force wbich made
that investigation.
It is a myth to say that the poor are lazy, sbiftless, and
do not want to work. In every province, except British
Columbia, a person is financially better off on welfare
than wben working for the legal minimum wage, but
despite this fact 50 per cent of the poor cboose to work.
They work ail the time.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Is that calculation based on a
40-hour week?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I believe so.
An interesting editorial appeared in the Ottawa Citizen
on February 21 of this year, of which the following is an
excerpt:
In that often flagging thrust toward a just society
there is no more important way of restoring human
dignity than to permit people, to the extent that tbey
are capable, to participate constructively in Canadian
society. And one of the most tragic obstacles is thatlow as welfare payments are-they are often bigher
tban tbe wages received by the working poor. A man
working at Ontario's minimum wage would earn $266
a month. As the bead of a family of five, be might get
$303 on welfare, along witb paid-up bealtb services
and drugs. Some beads of families cannot afford te, go
to work even if by staying home they still are weIl
below the poverty line.

March 23, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, that was brought home to me by a
witness who appeared before us. The mother of three
boys, she had been deserted and left with no means of
support. She, therefore, had to apply for welfare. Believing in the work ethic which most Canadians have been
trained to accept, she felt that this was not the right way
to bring up her boys. Consequently, she undertook training for herself so that she could make a living for them.
She subsequently secured a job that paid her as much as
she was getting on welfare but, because one of her boys
was diabetic and had to have special medicine and another had to have extensive dental work, she found that,
although her salary was equal to what she would get on
welfare, nevertheless she was $50 a month behind because
she had to pay for all these extras herself, whereas when
she was on welfare they were supplied to her without cost.
You may be interested to know that notwithstanding these
difficulties she was continuing to work because she did
not want her boys branded with the stigma of living on
welfare.
Many examples of this kind came to our attention, and
we can only conclude that something must be wrong with
a system that allows such situations to develop. Surely it
is not right that Canadians should have to make a choice
like that.
Another belief that is prevalent but which has not real
foundation in fact is the belief that the unions protect the
rights of the poor people. Actually, only 30 or 35 per cent
of the labour force is organized into unions, and even
then, I assure you, they are not made up of the poorest
members of the labour force.
I do not propose to list today, let alone tell you about,
the numerous other myths that were exposed during the
course of our hearings. However, I should like to tell you
that the committee discovered that very little was known
in Canada about the existence of poverty until it was
forcibly brought to our attention by the Economic Council
in its Fifth Annual Review, in which it pointed out:
Poverty in Canada is real. Its numbers are not in the
thousands but the millions. There is more of it than
our society can tolerate, more than our economy can
afford, and far more than existing measures and
efforts can cope with.
And I stress the words "existing measures."
Its persistence, at a time when the bulk of Canadians
enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the
world, is a disgrace.
As I say, that statement was made by the Economic
Council.
The Economic Council suggested that the Senate of
Canada should create a committee to study the problem,
and, as a result, the Special Senate Committee on Poverty
came into being. It quickly became evident to the committee that prior to its establishment very little research had
been done in Canada regarding poverty. Our researchers
constantly complained of the dearth of data that was
available. If the Senate committee has done nothing more,
then it has certainly awakened the people of Canada to
the existence of poverty and the need for research concerning it.

219

I sincerely hope that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty, a
council for applied social research will be established on a
national level to make research information available,
especially on poverty, for such research has now become
essential.
0 (1540)

Honourable senators, although in the past I have given
much of my time to the study of social and welfare problems, my experience on the Poverty Committee was traumatic. I was deeply disturbed when I saw for myself the
conditions under which many thousands of children of
the poor are existing. The children of Canada today are
the citizens of Canada of the eighties and the nineties, and
they are our most precious resource. They are much more
important to us than our mines, our oil fields, our forests,
our agriculture, or our fishing. We are •wasting this
resource if we do not give priority to developing the
highest potential of these children, and if we do not spend
money for this purpose as we so freely do now to develop
other natural resources.
Many studies that have been made in this country and
in other countries concerning children have documented
the disadvantages that are suffered by children in poor
families. I am not referring here to research on poverty,
but simply to research into the conditions of children. The
fact that poor children suffer a great deal is documented
by such research. They suffer from ill-health, sordid environment, lack of educational opportunity, and so forth.
Unlike the situation in many European countries and, I
might add, some Asian countries, relatively less emphasis
has been placed on benefits in kind such as free or subsidized school meals, day nurseries, domestic help, rent
subsidies, and other specific services. Free education and
health care have been extended widely in Canada, but
apart from this Canada relies mainly on local and voluntary organizations to respond to particular needs for services not readily available to poor children through the
market.
A brief to the committee from the Canadian Teachers
Federation said:
Daily, teachers of the poor see the effects on children
of these low levels of income, in the child's lunch bag
or in his clothes. Teachers also experience at first
hand the frustration occasioned by the apathy and
lack of interest in school that many low income parents exhibit.
The brief goes on to say:
Can a child learn well if he is hungry, or cold, or
ill-clad? Can he study well in a home that is crowded,
noisy and provides little encouragement? Let us say
honestly that no educational program, however welldesigned and forward-looking; no teacher-however
sympathetic and competent-can compensate for
these primary deprivations. Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that malnutrition, in
particular, if it occurs at an early stage of the child's
development, may cause irreversible damage.
The statements made in briefs we received from social
workers, and stories told to us by tenants we visited about
rat-ridden, vermin-infested housing in which many poor,

SENATE DEBATES

including children, have to live, are horrifying. How can
school children study in such an environment? On one
visit members of the committee saw a home where six
children of school age, four girls and two boys, were
living. We were asked if we wanted to see where they
slept, and we climbed to an attic and found there were
two beds, one a double bed with a broken spring and
dilapidated mattress where the four girls slept crosswise
on the bed, and a single bed in no better condition where
the two boys slept. How can we expect children from
homes like this, where they do not get proper rest and
have no quiet place to study, to compete with children
from what we consider to be normal homes? Do these
children have equal opportunity for education?
Witnesses appearing before the Senate Committee on
Poverty repeatedly emphasized the effect of the many
deprivations suffered by children of the poor-the lack of
seasonal and modern clothing worn by children of the
more affluent who share the same classroom, the lack of
pocket money to attend social functions where they are
expected to buy a coke or a hot dog and cannot do so
because of lack of money, and the embarrassment of
hearing announcements over the school loudspeaker to
the effect that welfare students are to pick up their supplies at a certain hour. Such "have not" children frequently are sullen, frustrated introverts or else they are boisterous dissenters. With a feeling that society does not want
them, they fight back, not by getting a good education in
spite of their handicaps, but by stealing or by becoming
delinquents and thereby jeopardizing their entire lives.
In his book War on Poverty Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, who may at some time in the future be president of
the United States, quotes David L. Baselon, Chief Justice
of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, as saying:
We are beginning to realize that the rising crime rate
is not caused merely by weak law enforcement. Poverty in all its manifestations-a lack of basic necessities,
family breakdowns, mental disorders, unsupervised
youths, school drop-outs, alcoholism, drug addiction
and so on-is the chief factor producing anti-social
behavior. From my own experience, I know that most
defendants convicted of crimes in the District of
Columbia are indigent. A successful war on poverty
would come close to solving the crime problem.
Considerable evidence was given to the committee
about poverty amongst working women, and especially
the poverty of working women who are the sole support
of their families. A woman who becomes the head of a
family usually does not reach that state by choice; she is
either widowed, deserted or, in some cases, separated. I
have heard the argument that some women are separated
because they want to be, and because they think that they
can do better from being on welfare. A study conducted in
Montreal showed that 50 per cent of the female heads of
families who are poor are widows. According to the 1966
census of Canada there were 300,383 families headed by a
female, and the number of children at home with female
heads of families in that year was approximately half a
million. Statistics show that if a female is the head of a
family, there is a 50-50 chance that she will be poor.

Women in Canada stated that 1967 data showed the average income for all female heads of families was $2,536
compared with the average income of $5,821 for male
heads of families. It costs just as much for a female to
house, clothe and feed a family as for a male.
Many of these female heads of families have been reintroduced into the labour market generally with skills that
have become obsolete, and are at a severe disadvantage.
This is one reason why these female heads of families are
poor, but it is not the only reason and not even the chief
reason. Many are earning low salaries or wages because
of discrimination in salary or wage on the basis of sex.
Sylvia Ostry, Director of the Economic Council of
Canada, in a book called The Occupational Composition
of the CanadianLabour Forcepublished in 1967, said:
Another factor that may result in inequality of earnings for male and female workers where other characteristics such as occupation, age and experience are
similar, is discrimination in respect to wage rates or
salaries. Statistics on wage rates suggest that many
industries traditionally have lower rates of pay for
women workers doing work equivalent to male workers. Although in some provinces there is legislation
against such wage discrimination, in practice it is
difficult to eliminate. No statistical data exist on the
extent to which earnings are affected by differential
pay scales.
And women have been reluctant to complain about
inequalities because they were afraid of losing their jobs.
After I spoke in this chamber on March 7, regarding
discrimination against women in wage rates and salaries,
one of my colleagues challenged me outside and stated
that in a business in which he was general superintendent
for forty years he had insisted there should be no such
discrimination, and that it had not existed. I am very
happy to know this. I know there are individual businesses where fair-minded people who manage them have
adopted this policy. But the various studies and the report
of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women show
that these are the exceptions, and that there does exist a
great deal of discrimination. In any case, honourable
senators, when I thought this over I felt that the fact that
the superintendent had to insist on such a policy was
evidence that, but for the insistence, there probably would
have been discrimination.
Dr. Pauline Jewett, professor of political science at
Carleton University, Ottawa, writing in The Working
Woman, sums up the situation of women in the labour
force in these words:
The pay is low, the opportunities for advancement are
rare, the hope of entering any number of higher
paying or more prestigious occupations is little better
than it was 30 or 40 years ago ... Although women
now constitute nearly one-third of the Canadian
labour force, they are still clustered round the bottom
of the economic scale.
The committee recommended that equal pay for equal
work legislation be passed and enforced, and it is hoped
that the recent amendments to the Canada Labour Code

March 23, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

will eliminate the discrimination that has existed in the
past.
The chairman of the Public Service Commission when
speaking to the Women's Canadian Club of Montreal on
November 10, 1969, stated that "a male has 100 times the
chance of reaching an annual salary of $14,000 than does
a female in the public service." His reasons for this discrepancy were: (a) differences in capability; (b) differences in interests and goals; (c) differences in experience;
and (d) differences in opportunity.
Subsequent to the publication of the Report of the
Royal Commission on the Status of Women, which also
pointed out this discrimination on the grounds of sex,
changes have been made in policy toward women
employees in the Public Service. These changes, which I
outlined in this chamber on March 7 last, give some hope
that more women will be given experience and opportunity to reach the higher pay brackets in the Public Service.
Of all the working women the ones most vulnerable in
the face of sex discrimination are the sole support mothers. They are striving to support their families and are not
in a position to debate discriminating actions. Female
heads of families who fall within the category of the "poor
in purse and in spirit" are affected by the same gaps in
legislation and social attitudes as women in general, but
this group of citizens suffer more acutely because of the
many voids in their lives such as lack of sufficient funds
to provide for themselves and their children, lack of social
activities to relieve the monotony of their environment,
and lack of opportunity and incentive to raise themselves
above their present level and, above all, to preserve or
regain their human dignity.
The presence of dependent children often prevents a
woman who is head of a family from entering the labour
market or restricts her to low-paid, part-time jobs. While
transfer payments by way of welfare allowances do play
an important role in relieving this type of situation, it is
evident that much improved day care facilities such as
exist in many other countries for young children could
also make a major contribution, and should be supported.
As we know Canada now spends $7 billion on health
and welfare. An analysis of 1969 figures by the Social
Development Council, formerly the Canadian Welfare
Council, showed that upper and middle class income
people get a larger share of this than the poor under our
present legislation. In fact Reuben Baetz, the Executive
Director of the Council, estimated last September that
only about 9 per cent of that money "was spent specifically for financial assistance and services for the very poorest in our population."
Our committee learned that through family allowances,
which is a universal program, the well-to-do, many of
whom did not need it, became better off while for the poor
it was not enough. To paraphrase the quotation I gave you
earlier from President Roosevelt, through family allowances in the past we were adding abundance to those who
already had enough, but we were not giving enough to
those who had too little.
Certainly the new amendments to the Family Allowances Act recently introduced into the other place will
help to guarantee income security for our poor families

221

including sole-support mothers, and this, of course, makes
me happy for them. However, it seems to be more of the
band-aid type of legislation when what is really required
is a major operation. Do we want to continue indefinitely
to give more to the poor because they are poor, or should
we adopt policies that will eliminate poverty?
As I said before, all children of the poor are at a disadvantage in today's society but it is the children of sole-support mothers, and the mothers of those children, who
really haunt me.
The brief to the committee from the Catholic Women's
League of Canada stated:
A woman without a husband, the lone head of a
household, suffers poverty in many more ways than
lacking money for everyday living expenses. She suffers from the weight of responsibility on her shoulders; from loneliness; sometimes from guilt; from
being 'different' in a world geared to the family unita husband, wife and children; from being taken
advantage of in many ways, knowing it and not being
able to do anything about it; from being emotionally
and physically exhausted.

One of these women who was a witness at a hearing in
Winnipeg told us:
I am 40 years old and I have lived on and off public
welfare since I was 17. I was married at age 15 and I
have had 13 children and my first marriage didn't
work out. This was partly due to lack of income, poor
housing and many other pressures. We were separated many times and are now separated entirely. Welfare has treated me as best they could but my allowance was never adequate. The basic necessities were
met but they were just barely enough to live on. I
never ever had enough income, no matter how much I
stretched the budget-my children have never had a
doll carriage or a bicycle. I have never had a winter
coat or a pair of winter boots. Perhaps it's no wonder
that my children steal small items from grocery
stores.
Many of the mothers on welfare have this problem
because their children soon learn that at the end of
each month they are sure to be short of food.
In the past when my problems were too much for
me and I had no one to help me I many times contemplated suicide. I was fortunate, I never went through
with it.
This was from one of the witnesses who appeared before
us.
If time permitted, I could tell you of many other groups,
in addition to the sole-support mothers, who suffer great
hardships under our present system. Chief among those I
would like to discuss are the older citizens. Statistics
Canada has recently released figures showing the heavy
proportion of older people who have very low incomes.
Honourable senators, I know that I have kept you very
long and I also know very well that "the longer the spoke
the greater the tyre," so I will not continue. My only
excuse for speaking so long is my very great interest.
Actually I have told you only a very few of the many
experiences of members of your Special Committee on

SENATE DEBATES

Poverty, but they may be enough for you to understand
why I feel very strongly that poverty should be
eliminated.
The committee studied in depth the problems of the 25
per cent of our population, approximately five million
people, who are poor. The report produced by the committee is an important social document on a subject concerning which very little research had been done previously. I support the recommendations in the report,
including the key recommendation regarding a guaranteed annual income.
If the recommendations of the Special Committee on
Poverty are implemented they will create changes that
will enhance the quality of life for Canadians, and will rid
our present welfare and social service systems of the
discrepancies, inconsistencies, and stigmas they now contain. These recommendations, if followed, will institute a
meaningful income maintenance policy of which Canadians of the future can be proud. If they are implemented it
will no longer be possible to say, as the Economic Council
said in its Fifth Annual Review, that the "persistence of
poverty at a time when the bulk of Canadians enjoy one
of the highest standards of living is a disgrace."
On motion of Hon. Mr. Smith, for Hon. Mr. Duggan,
debate adjourned.

make a speech with even the tolerable degree of success I
might otherwise achieve.
The first point I wish to make, honourable senators, is
the obvious one that we the other night listened to what
seemed to me to be a masterly speech by the Senate
co-chairman of this committee. I really do not see how the
speech of Senator Molgat could have been improved
upon. It seemed to me to hit just the right points and
strike just the right note. It might be thought that perhaps
after that speech very little remains to be said. On the
other hand, as Senator Molgat indicated, probably most of
us who sat on the committee had certain reservations,
certain points of dissent or certain aspects which we
might wish to emphasize. Senator Molgat himself indicated that when he came to close the debate he would probably say something with respect to certain features of the
report with which he was himself in imperfect sympathy.
Like Senator Molgat, I came in half way through the
proceedings of the committee. I was not a member of this
house when the committee was appointed. I became a
member of the committee very soon after I joined the
ranks of senators. I counted it a great honour and a heavy
responsibility to be a member of this committee, because
it was dealing with a matter of first class importance,
extreme importance to the whole future of the country.

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
CONSIDERATION OF FINAL REPORT OF SPECIAL JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 21, consideration of the final report of the Special Joint Committee of
the Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, tabled in the Senate on Thursday, March
16, 1972.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, it is a
little dispiriting to rise in so thin a house to speak on so
important a subject. One of the advantages of having
been a member of the CCF for as long as there was a
CCF, is that anything over seven people qualified as a
mass meeting. I am therefore addressing, by the old CCF
standard, a monster mass meeting, several times the
seven who used to constitute a mass meeting in the early
days of my inglorious political career.
It is desirable, on a number of grounds, that I set forth
certain of my views on this subject today and postpone
the delivery of the rest of my speech until a later occasion.
This is not only because there are relatively few honourable senators present, and a considerable number of those
are probably anxious to get away and catch a train or
aircraft. It is also because the amount of detail into which
I intend to go with respect to certain parts of the subject is
considerable. Even in the best of circumstances the
patience of honourable members is not unlimited.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You have a captive audience now
because of the storm.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I am sorry I cannot hear the interjection of the honourable Leader of the Opposition. I shall
have to postpone until the debates appear the pleasure of
reading what he said. If I were to put on this contraption
and wire myself for sound I would probably be unable to
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.I

March 23, 1972

(1610)

I am sorry that I missed not only the earlier sittings of
the committee when I was not a member of this house, but
also some of those that took place after I actually joined
the committee. I was fairly assiduous in my attendance,
but on one or two occasions flu laid me low, and I could
not be present as I had expected to be, and on certain
other occasions my academic duties of last year prevented
me from being present. However, I attended most of the
hearings after I became a member of this house.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You were a good member of the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Everything that has been said about
the comprehensiveness and thoroughness of the investigation that was conducted is amply justified by the part of
the proceedings which I witnessed. It was strenuous work,
but I thoroughly enjoyed it, nonetheless. It was not merely
enjoyable and entertaining. It was sometimes amusing,
sometimes exciting, sometimes exhilarating. But also,
there reigned in the committee a very admirable spirit.
We hear a great deal nowadays about dialogue. I have
become rather sick of that word. I think it is one of the
words that are ridden to death. I suppose in a few years it
will lie there, and none so poor to do it reverence. But at
the moment I cannot think of a better word to describe
what went on in the committee. I think it was a genuine
dialogue, not the sort of thing that people who talk about
dialogue sometimes mean. Some people, when they talk
about dialogue, mean "Now, I shall speak and you will
listen; not only listen, but believe and obey." That sort of
Mussolini or Hitler dialogue was not the kind of thing that
went on in this committee.
There was a genuine exchange of views. There was a
genuine willingness to listen, not only to the witnesses but
also to the other members of the committee. There was a
genuine, prolonged and sustained attempt to understand

hMarch

23, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

the different points of view which were represented, and
there was an immense diversity of points of view. I think
every member of the committee would agree that this is
SO.

If I remember correctly, Senator Molgat referred to the
fact that we rarely if ever divided on party lines. I cannot
myself think of a single instance. To the best of my recollection also, we rarely divided on linguistic lines. Again, I
cannot remember a single instance where that was so. It is
possible, of course, that an assiduous study of the record,
or an assiduous effort of recollection on the part of certain other members of the committee, might show that I
am to a certain degree incorrect in these statements. However, I think it is substantially true, at all events. Never,
either, that I can recall, did we divide on the lines of a
division between members of the House of Commons and
the Senate. I think in every instance one found, in any
difference of opinion, members of both houses on each
side of that difference.
This, I think, is a very admirable feature of the committee's work, and one from which all members of the committee must have benefited, as I know I did.
To my mind there is no question that the senators who
were members of the committee made a most valuable
contribution to the proceedings. Not only was there, on
the whole, rather more stability of membership from the
senatorial side, and understandably so, but I think that
the senatorial members of the committee put their backs
into the job and worked really hard at it.
I was not a member of the committee at the time that
Senator Lamontagne was co-chairman, except very briefly at the end of his term, when he was heavily preoccupied
with the Committee on Science Policy; therefore I cannot
bear personal testimony to the work that he did in the
earlier part of the committee's proceedings. From my long
friendship with Senator Lamontagne, and my knowledge
of his great gifts, I am confident that even though he was
not able to give to our committee, when he was co-chairman, all the time and energy he would have given had he
not been busy with the Science Policy Committee, he
made a most distinguished contribution to its
proceedings.
However, I can speak with knowledge of the work of
most of the other senatorial members of the committee,
and I should like to pay very special tribute to the work of
the Senate co-chairman in the later part of the proceedings, our colleague, Senator Molgat.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Senator Molgat presided on a great
many occasions, and on some of the most difficult occasions. He did so always with firmness, with discretion,
with tact, with good humour, with wit; and on more than
one occasion, faced with extremely rowdy people among
the witnesses, he handled the situation in a way that was
beyond praise.
I was not myself present on one or two of the worst
occasions, but I was present on others when he had to
deal with impatient and somewhat unruly people, and did
so in a most admirable fashion. His contribution to the
drafting of the report was, of course, immense.

223

It may seem a little invidious to pick out any other one
member of the committee from the Senate side, but I
should also like to pay a special tribute to my desk mate,
Senator Lafond. He took what I think may be called a
quiet and inconspicuous part in the proceedings of the
committee, but over and over again, when we ran into
difficulty, and when the members of the committee were
at loggerheads, sometimes almost at daggers drawn, when
the discussion grew fast and furious, suddenly the still
small voice of Senator Lafond was heard saying, "Mr.
Chairman, I have a suggestion to make." In every
instance, or in almost every instance, we looked at each
other after Senator Lafond had made his suggestion and
said, "Why, of course, the obviously sensible thing! Why
on earth did we get all excited about this? Why did we
squabble and row about this point, when it is perfectly
evident that this is the solution to the problem?" Not only
were the proposals that Senator Lafond suggested almost
invariably the quintessence of common sense and
wisdom, but they were admirably drafted. Very seldom
did we have anything to suggest by way of improvement.
I say this with special emphasis, because I did not
always agree entirely with everything that Senator
Lafond suggested. But even when I disagreed, I said to
myself, "This is a well-founded suggestion. This is an
admirably phrased suggestion. This is an excellent contribution to the discussion of this particular point." In nearly
every instance I found myself in agreement with what he
suggested, and I could not help wondering why in the
name of goodness none of the rest of us had thought of it.
I wished to pay that special tribute to Senator Lafond
because although his part in this chamber, as in the committee, is not always very conspicuous, it is a most valuable one, and over and over again his is the still small
voice of reason which recalls us to the essence of.the
matter before us and to the sensible way of dealing with
it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I could, of course, say a good deal
about the contribution of the other members of the committee. I want to emphasize that I am not intending to
suggest that only Senator Molgat and Senator Lafond
performed a great service from the senatorial side of the
committee. I mention those two special contributions
which, in my judgment, certainly stood out.
0 (1620)

The other thing I wanted to say in tribute to the work of
the committee refers to the co-chairman from the other
place, Dr. Mark MacGuigan. In Dr. MacGuigan we had
not only an extraordinarily learned chairman, not only a
master of the English language whose contribution in the
drafting of the English version of the report is overwhelming and of signal merit, but a chairman of really superhuman patience. An old professor of mine at McGill years
ago observed, after speaking of a highly improbable last
minute, death-bed conversion in a novel by the English
novelist Smollett, that Smollett himself apparently was
aware of the improbability of this and had, accordingly,
ended the work with the phrase "But the mercy of God is
infinite." The professor in question added "and the mercy
of Smollett is more so." I felt at times inclined to say, of

SENATE DEBATES

Dr. MacGuigan, "The mercy of God is infinite, but the
mercy of MacGuigan is more so."
Occasionally I felt he was, if anything, too patient. The
qualities of endurance, patience, and good humour that he
showed were, to my mind, most outstanding, and I am in
position to pay special tribute to those qualities because I
am afraid I was at times one of the more unruly members
of the committee, and I benefited from the kindness,
tolerance and patience of Dr. MacGuigan as well as, of
course, that of Senator Molgat.
Once again, I do not wish to suggest that simply because
I refer to Dr. MacGuigan from the other side I am in any
way depreciating the contribution of other members from
the other place, but I must reiterate that Dr. MacGuigan's
part in the proceedings was beyond question one of the
most important contributions.
As for the report itself, I think on the whole it is a
sensible report. If that seems faint praise-a tepid adjective-let me assure honourable senators that from me it is
not. The number of people who are highly intelligent and
highly educated, but who have, it seems to me, no
common sense, is staggering. For me the word "sensible"
is one of the most laudatory adjectives which I could
employ. I feel the report is, in general, a sensible one. I
feel it is reasonable, practicable, and I think it is the kind
of report which could lead to some important constitutional developments. I do have my reservations about it,
however, and I shall voice them perhaps fortissimo before
I am done, but in general I feel it is a good report.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I make a suggestion to the honourable senator by way of interpolation? What he is going
to say on this debate is, I know, of great importance. He is
a constitutional authority, and I should like to see his
statements on matters of substance given to the fullest
possible attendance by the Senate. A great nany matters
in the report concern the Senate.
The honourable senator certainly does not have to take
up my suggestion-it is entirely up to him-but if he feels
he should adjourn the debate so that he may have a larger
group to listen to him, I am sure that would certainly meet
with the approval of those of us here.
The decision is one that rests with Senator Forsey, of
course, and I only make it in fairness to him.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I thank the Leader of the Government
for that suggestion. I was inclined to think that perhaps
closure would be applied at an early time by the absence
of a quorum.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We would certainly not have closure.
We always have a quorum for the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I think I should take advantage of the
suggestion by the Leader of the Government after I have
finished with one or two other small points which I should
like to make at this time. I do not wish to stop in mid-paragraph, as it were, although I recognize the wisdom, as well
as the kindness to me, of what the Leader of the Government has said.
When I say that the report seems to me to be generally
sensible, I should like to underline that by saying that I
think on the whole it might be summed up in the words
"back to the Fathers of Confederation." I feel essentially
it is trying to get us back to an up to date version of the
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 23, 1972

kind of thing that the Fathers of Confederation were
trying to do. They made the basic distinction between
what they called matters of general interest and matters
of local interest, local meaning more than municipal or
small areas. Matters of general interest concerned the
whole country, and matters of local interest concerned a
particular province or section of the country. This, it
seems to me, the report also does. The Fathers of Confederation tried to divide the powers between the Dominion
and the provinces along functional lines, and this again is
exactly what this report attempts to do.
I think it is interesting to notice that Sir Georges
Etienne Cartier, when he was discussing division of power
in the Debates on Confederation in the Parliament of the
Province of Canada in 1865 said at page 55:
-in the questions which would be submitted to the
General Parliament there could be no danger to the
rights and privileges of either French Canadians,
Scotchmen, Englishmen or Irishmen. Questions of
commerce, of international communication, and all
matters of general interest, would be discussed and
determined in the General Legislature.
And at page 60 he said that the control of the General
Government was to be over the large questions of general
interest in which the differences of race or religion had no
place, such questions as defence, tariff, excise, or public
works.
In other words, he was saying what I have heard put in
other terms more recently by some other people, that
there is not really a Protestant way of building a railway,
a Roman Catholic way of sending a telegram, a French
way of levying a customs duty, or an English way of
imposing an income tax. You simply build a railway, levy
a tariff, impose a customs duty, or whatever it may be.
These are not questions on which people are ordinarily
thought to be divided because of their language, ancestry,
or the particular cultural group to which they belong.
I think we have in this report essentially the same type
of distinction drawn. On great economic questions which
affect the whole country the report says essentially, "Let
us give these to the central Parliament and Government,"
and on matters which are cultural and social, or socialcultural, the report substantially says, "Let us give these
predominantly, at least, to the provinces, sometimes with
some overriding provision for a paramountcy for the
legislation of the Parliament of Canada or the action of
the Government of Canada, sometimes not."
The difference between what the Fathers of Confederation suggested and what the committee is suggesting is
that nowadays things which were formerly not thought of
as having much to do with culture, in the technical sense
of that word, are now considered to be within that sphere,
so that the sphere of cultural matters which are left to the
provinces, or predominantly to the provinces, is somewhat widened. Essentially, it is the same thing, because
even in 1867, things like prisons, charitable or eleemosynary institutions-a splendid word that eleemosynary,
absolutely grand; Dr. Leacock used to roll it around his
tongue with great unction-hospitals and asylums, except
of course marine hospitals for certain obvious reasons,
control over property and civil rights, as well as a number
of other matters which were of special interest and impor-

tance to the provinces, were left to them. What we have
done, in effect, in this report is to suggest that the cultural
matters, in the view of the Fathers of Confederation "local" matters, shouid be left predominantly to the provincial legisiatures and governments. I do ot think there is a
substantial difference there from the kind of thing the
Fathers of Confederation intended. On the contrary, I
think there is an adherence to it.

and the opportunity was then denied me. We are ail very

you ail, then I arn very happy.

At that point, honourable senators, I think I should take
advantage of the kind and generous suggestion-shahl I
say, from the point of view of those who are listening to
me, the merciful suggestion-of the Leader of the Government and ask leave to defer until the next time this matter
cornes before the house the statement that I want to make
about my dissents on certain features of the report. I have
approximately ten or a dozen points, some major and
some minor, on which I dissent most emphatically. This is
a good report in general, but there are some parts of it
that, in my judgment, are foolish; some parts that are
perhaps dangerously foolish, and.I propose to say so with
some emphasis, and indeed with all the vigour at my
command, when next I have the honour to address this
assembly.
With leave of the Senate, therefore, I should like to
move, although perhaps it is not strictly necessary to ask
leave, that this debate be adjourned until the next sitting.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Forsey, debate adjourned.

asked by a member of this house who had to leave to
comment briefly on a story that appeared in one of the
newspapers this morning. I have before me the story in
the Globe and Mail under the heading: "12 MPs chosen
for committee to scrutinize Government abuse." The story
says in the first paragraph that a Commons-Senate Committee had been estabiished. The next paragraph goes on
to say that the government had named twelve MPs, who
will join eight senators on the scrutiny committee. There
is then a list of the members of the other place, from all
parties and some twelve in number, who constitute part of
this 18-member committee. There is no reference whatsoever to the senators who have been appointed.
In the hope that the press will make its story more
complete, I would point out that there is no mention of the
fact that on March 9 the Senate appointed eight senators
to act on behaif of the Senate on the Standing Joint
Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments, and sent a
message to the House of Commons accordingly. Those
senators are: the honourable Senators Fergusson, Forsey,

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT 0F STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL
FINANCE ON SUPPLEMENARY ESTIMATES (B)
PRESENTED BY HON. DOUGLAS D). EVERETT

THxRSDAY,

March 23, 1972.

The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance,
to which were referred the Supplementary Estimates (B)
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1972, has in obedience
to the order of reference of March 8, 1972, examined
the said Supplementary Estimates and reports as follows:
1. The Committee has exanuned the said Supplementary Estimates (B) and has heard evidence thereon from
Mvr. D. B. Dewar, Deputy Secretary, Program Branch,
Treasury Board, and Mr. B. A. MacDonald, Director
General, Budget Coordination, Treasury Board.
2. The said Supplementary Estimates (B) provide for
total expenditures for which Parliament wil-1 be asked to
provide funds of $185,000,000; statutory expenditures of

4. Your Committee expressed continued concern regarding the use of $1 items in the Appropriation Acts
to amend other legislative enactmnents. One of these concerns respects the difficulties that this method of legislation creates in reporting the amendments to the legal
profession and the general public. Accordingly, your
Committee recommaends as follows:
In the opinion of the Committee it is desirable that
any amendinent to an existing Act of Parliament be
made by a separate amending Act of Parliament
other than an Appropriation Act and that the
present practice of amending legisiation by $1 votes
in the Main and Supplementary Estimates is unsatisfactory for several reasons, including the fact
that such amendments are not systematically reported either lin law reports, digests or other sources
of information readily available to the legal profession and the public.
It is recognized, however, that there may be cases
where separate amending acts for each and every
legislative amendments now made by Appropriation
Acts would unnecessarily add to problems of time
and timing in the abready overburdened Pa2rliamentary legislative processes.
The Commnittee therefore recommends that consideration be given to the formalization of the amending
effects of such $1 votes in Appropriation Acts by
explicit amendments to the existing Acts concerned
in a separate schedule to any Appropriation Act
where such amendments are required.
5. Your Committee was provided with the explanation
of $1 items in the said Supplementary Estimates (B) and
a copy of this document is appended as an addendum
to this report.
6. Your Cominittee recomniends that where possible the
type 0f explanation used in the document attached as an
addendum to this report be used in the description of the
expenditure in the Supplementary Estimates (B). Your
Committee also recommends that in future the explanation of $1 items be provided in advance of the hearings
on the Supplementary Estimates.
Respectfully submitted.

Chairman.

THE LATE SENATOR HARRY A. WILLIS
TRIBUTES
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, it was with a
sense of personal loss that I attended in Toronto this
afternoon the funeral of Senator Harry A. Willis whose
sudden death last Thursday was such a sbock to tbose of
us wbo bad seen him in the chamber last week looking
healthier than he had for quite some time.
We ail know that organizations are required 10 market
political theories, and the setting up of sucb organizations
depends upon men with exceptional administrative ability. Sucb a man was Harry Willis. Devoted to a political
ideal, dedicated to a political party, he laboured tirelessly
at those thankless tasks whicb must be carried out efficiently and witb discretion if political parties are to
survive.
Harry WilIis was a man of exceptional ability, and
incomparable political savvy.
The Progressive Conservative party loses an organizer
par excellence. In spite of his recent serious illness be was
looking forward to the coming campaign like a prize
fighter looks forward t0 his next match. Men like Senator
Willis are not easily replaced. He was a fine businessman
and lawyer, and bis contributions to this chamber, if
recently limited by bis poor bealth, remain of significant
merit.
With Senator Willis' passing we lose a remarkable gentleman, an asset to Ibis institution and a credit t0 bis
party. He will be sorely missed. His cbarming wife loses a
dear companion and bis daugbters a lovable father. To
tbemn and to ail members of bis family in their bour of
grief we offer our most beartfeit condolences.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I join with tbe
Leader of tbe Opposition in paying tribute 10 Senator
Willis who, as Senator Flynn bas pointed out, was witb us
all lasI week. As a malter of fact, 1 recall baving a talk
witb bim as I entered the cbamber last Tbursday wben he
was sitting.on tbe bencb in the ante-chamber witb one of
our other colleagues.
Senalor Willis was a contemporary of mine at tbe
Osgoode Hall Law Scbool. I knew bim, therefore, for a
long period. I can altest to bis generosity, bis friendliness,
and bis great kindness. I am sure that many of us know of
many instances in whicb he displayed bis desire 10 belp
otbers in need. This quality is one I recognized in bim
during our student days.
*(2010)

Senator Wjllis was born in 1904 at Belfountain in the
Province of Ontario. He was educated at the public scbool
in that community, and at tbe Brampton and Erin Higb
Scbools. He was a graduate of McMaster University and,
as I said, of Osgoode Hall. He was called to tbe Bar in

June 1929, and became Queen's Counsel in 1948. He was
summoned 10 tbe Senate on June 15, 1962. I know from
observations Ibat he made to me from lime to lime that be
greaîly valued bis membersbip of Ibis house.
As Senator Flynn bas pointed out, be was a happy
political warrior. He bad great faitb in the political party
of bis cboice. He served il witb energy and conviction, a
quality wbicb is very essential if our political system is 10
carry on witb the endurance tbat we want t0 see il
possess.
We are ail losers for bis passing. To bis wife and to the
members of bis family, on bebaîf of certainly tbose of us
on Ibis side of the bouse, I extend my deepest sympatby
and our sincere condolences.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, Senator
Willis was my deskmate for the last eight years or so. I

judgment. I am going to miss bim. I sbould like 10 extend
t0 bis very cbarming wife and bis daugbters my sincere
sympathy.

BRITISH NEGATIVE INCOME TAX

QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators, I rise on a
question of privilege. I wish to refer to an article in the
New York Times for Sunday, March 26, 1972, which
makes reference to the budget presented in the British
House of Commons on Tuesday, March 21. It reads in part
as follows:
For two hours and 10 minutes the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Anthony Barber, stood before the packed
and expectant House of Commons last Tuesday, reading from sheafs of paper he drew out of a battered
dispatch box. Toward the close of his speech he drew
gasps of surprise, cheers and shouts of "Hear! Hear!".
Mr. Barber proposes a negative income tax as a
substitute for the many kinds of welfare payments
now being paid. This would be joined to the withholding tax system, making it possible for a Government
computer to spew out income to the poor and tax bills
to the rest of the people at a saving of 15,000 civil
servants.
Although the tax plan incorporates many measures
the Conservatives would have condemned as socialistic a few years ago-among them a guaranteed
income for all, which is what the negative income tax
would provide-it remains true to Tory doctrine in
that it lets the people spend more of their money and
the Government less.
I feel I am fully warranted in drawing this article to the
attention of all honourable senators, since this aspect of
the British budget-which the Chancellor of the Exchequer says is the biggest reform in the last 25 years-has
not yet appeared in our Canadian press. It has been
completely ignored.

sons elected at the same time to a provincial legislature.

INCOME TAX ACT

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second reading of Bill

C-169, to amend the Income Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, in substance Bill C-169
has been around for quite a while. In October of 1971 the
then Minister of Finance made a statement in which he
announced a 7 per cent reduction in corporate taxes for
the period from July 1, 1971, to December 31, 1972, and a 3
per cent reduction in individual income tax for the period
from July 1, 1971, to December 31, 1972. Then, on December 23 last year the Senate passed Bill C-275 which dealt
with the 1971 portion of this announcement, or pronouncement, to which I have referred made by the Minister of Finance. There was a reason for dealing with it in
that form. In 1971, until Bill C-259 was enacted, the law
which was in force was the continuing Income Tax Act as
we knew it and, therefore, the bill had to be drawn in a
form that would conform to the provisions of that bill,
and, since the 1972 application of this pronouncement of
the minister would affect provisions in the proposed Bill
C-259, that would have to await the enactment of Bill
C-259. So we have this division.
The first part of it, Bill C-275, has, of course, received
royal assent. This bill now deals with the 1971-72, 1972-73
periods in relation to corporation taxes and the 1972
period, the calendar year, in relation to individual income
taxes.
Undoubtedly, the comment will be made that Bill C-169
is in a form we are not accustomed to. As a matter of fact,
although it deals with an awful lot of money, it is a very
thin-looking volume. I suppose we can infer from that that
when you are reducing taxes you can do so using few
words, whereas, when you are imposing taxes, it takes
many words. It takes many words to cover all aspects of
an income tax act, whether you are imposing additional
burdens or removing them.
At any rate, Bill C-169 is a rather thin bit of paper which
we have to consider. It provides substantial tax reductions, some of which have already been enjoyed. I can tell
you, for instance, that for corporate taxes the effect for
1971-72 will be a loss in federal revenue of about $160
million and, for 1972-73, it will be a loss of approximately
$175 million.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Before we lose the humour of your
comments about the thinness of Bill C-169, do I understand that a bill such as the one we had last session,
comprising over 700 pages, was designed in practice to
increase the taxes?
Hon. Mr. Croll: That is what he said.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Hayden: If my friend wants to conclude that
from what I said, I suppose he could find many precedents. He could go back through every taxation bill we
have ever had and he would find that they have all been
rather thick tomes or volumes, for the simple reason that
when you are imposing taxes the transactions and circumstances are different. There are different political approaches to different questions. A bill is bound to reflect all
these things. Therefore, I say that of necessity a taxing bill
has to be more extensive and use up more paper, and,
comparatively, perhaps that is the inference that should
be drawn or the suggestion that should be made to the
government. Why waste paper? Surely the simple way is
the best way. Just keep on reducing taxes, now that we
have become accustomed to what happened last year and
this year.
However, honourable senators, to get back to the serious side of this, it is not my intention at this time to do
more than simply underline the fact that very substantial
amounts of money have been, shall we say, let loose in the
economy as a result of the reduction in corporate and
individual tax rates. This will help to bolster the economy
and to move it along. There are many people who have
spoken favourably of this intent, and, if I remember correctly, on second reading of Bill C-275 in this house I read
from the remarks, as I always do, made by my dear friend
Senator Grosart. We commented on the value of this type
of tax reduction and the encouragement which it would
have, more particularly so far as individuals are concerned, in the cumulative effect. I put it that way, honourable senators, because so far as some individuals are
concerned the dollar amount that they would gain from
the application of this 3 per cent reduction in individual
rates of income tax would be very, very nominal, but the
sum total of the amount of money let loose in the economy
would have substantial purchasing power and would
result in some enhancement of the economy.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Would the honourable senator
permit a question at this stage? He started by mentioning
the benefits that corporate activity would derive from the
provisions of this bill for 1971-72 and for 1972-73. He was
then about to give us the amounts of personal benefits
when a question was asked which interrupted him. I
wonder if he could now give us that figure.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The personal amounts involved in the
first year, that is in the period covered by Bill C-275, was
$125 million, and in the fiscal year 1972-73 it would
amount to $225 million. So, you can see that we are dealing with very substantial sums of money.
If I might just deal now with one more matter and then I
shall get down to the business of the meeting. The bill
itself is a simple bill containing six clauses. Although
normally the purpose of second reading is to deal with the
principle of a bill, I suppose I can deal now with the six
clauses because the principle of this bill is simply tax
reduction and all the clauses have some bearing on that
one point.
Clause 1 of the bill deals with the 3 per cent reduction in
personal or individual income tax rates. Clause 2 deals
with the 7 per cent reduction in corporate taxes.
Clauses 3 and 4 are of what one might call a consequential nature, consequential because of things that we have
[Hon. Mr. Crol.]

March 27, 1972

in the present law based on Bill C-259 which was passed
at the end of last year. However, I do not think that that is
a good and sufficient reason for me simply to say that
these are consequential. I should tell you what they do
and why it is necessary to have them there.
Clauses 5 and 6 are transitional in nature and are inserted for the purpose of making the transition easier, technically and legally, from 1971 when there was a different
statute called the Income Tax Act. These transitional
provisions are felt to be necessary in order to overlap
certain periods. For example, a company might begin its
fiscal period some time in 1971 and end it some time
during 1972. In order to work in the combinations of laws
which are applicable in the years 1971 and 1972, and
receive the full benefit of the 1972 law, some transitional
provisions are needed.
O

(2030)

I should like now to go back and deal with the personal
income tax reduction of 3 per cent. Clause 1 of the bill
deals with subsection 3 of section 120 of the present
Income Tax Act, and adds a new subsection which simply
says:
There may be deducted from the tax otherwise payable under this Part by an individual for the 1972
taxation year an amount equal to 3% of the aggregate
of
(a) the tax otherwise payable under this Part by the
individual for the yearWhat this means is that you have rates of tax outlined in
this bill, which is the present law, ranging from 72 to 76
per cent, and ranging from 50 per cent down to 46 or 47
per cent. Those are the rates in respect of which this
reduction would be applicable. But there is also added by
paragraph (b):
-any amount added to the tax otherwise payable
under this Part by the individual for the year pursuant to subsection (1).
Subsection (1) of section 120 of the present Income Tax
Act imposes a 30 per cent tax on income not earned in the
province. The sum total of the amount on which you
calculate the 3 per cent would be 40 per cent, if the
personal rate were 40 per cent, and the 30 per cent which
is applicable by virtue of subsection (1) of section 120.
Ontario has given way on that 30 per cent tax. So a
person in Ontario would have a reduction of 3 per cent of
whatever his federal rate was under the act. In some other
province which has not given way on the 30 per cent, the 3
per cent would be figured on the aggregate of the 30 per
cent and his own marginal rate.
The overall tax will not reduce the provincial tax
because for purposes of the latter the rate to which the
province is entitled will be calculated on the tax otherwise
payable, without any reference to and without any inclusion of this other item. Therefore the provinces, except
Ontario which has given up the right to this, will receive
their measure of provincial tax calculated entirely on the
marginal rate of tax of the particular person in relation to
the rate of provincial tax, which the federal authority will
collect. This is the simple part of it, which is easy to

rch 27 1972S

March

1972

AE
SENATE DEBATES

calculate. There are no complexities by reason of the
provisions of Bill C-259 of the last session.
Certain points are not included in making the 3 per cent
reduction. For instance, the 3 per cent is calculated by
reference to the rate schedule, section 123 of the present
Income Tax Act, and after deduction of any dividend tax
credits. Therefore, before the marginal rate is arrived at,
if there are any dividend tax credits, the income is
reduced to the taxable income by deduction of that
amount. It is also calculated before deducting any amount
in respect of foreign taxes or the credit for provincial
logging taxes. I have no explanation for the inclusion of
this, except that in committee much discussion took place
regarding logging taxes and perhaps some of it seeped
through. However, since this bill will be referred to committee we can satisfy our curiosity by asking why this
particular provision is included. I have nothing more to
add to that.
The corporate tax reduction is 7 per cent. The method
by which this is calculated is that it is the net of the rate
provided by section 123, which is the 50 per cent rate,
going down to 46 per cent in five years. It also involves the
electricity and steam provision, which provides for a corporate rate of 48 per cent. The calculation of corporate
tax reduction begins with the general corporate rate, or
the special rate of 48 per cent provided by section 143 of
the act. Before the tax is applied the small business
deduction under which the basic tax rate can be reduced
to 25 per cent is subtracted. It is also minus the basic tax
rate. The deduction is subject to a reduction provided
under section 130, which reduces the basic tax rate on
investment corporations to 25 per cent.
Subject to those deductions the calculation is commenced with either the general rate or the 48 per cent rate
on electricity and steam generation, et cetera, from which
follows the calculation under which the allowable deductions are made. In doing this, you have to arrive at whatever is the net corporate rate. I wish I could say that by
inserting a period one has gone the full distance and has
reached a determination. But that is not so, because one
then comes to clause 3, which deals with the refundable
tax to a private corporation on its investment income, to
reflect the 7 per cent reduction in the corporate rate.
* (2040)

As honourable senators know, private corporations, as
defined in section 89(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act, pay only
an effective tax rate of 25 per cent on their investment
income.
This is accomplished by having them pay their basic
rate of 50 per cent, which is the amount they are obligated
to pay under the law. Then, when they distribute their
investment to their shareholders, they are entitled to a
credit of 25 per cent. It was thought that since the basic
corporate tax under section 123, which is the top rate of 50
per cent, is being reduced by 7 per cent, the tax refundable portion under section 129 should also be reduced by
the same percentage. Thus, clause 3 amends section 129
by adding the following subsection (5)(a):
In respect of its 1972 taxation year, 93% of the least
of the amounts so determined;

The 93 per cent reflects the refundable tax reduction
benefit which is given from the general corporate rate by
the 7 per cent reduction.
The same thing happens in relation to clause 4, which
deals with refundable taxes on capital gains. The clause
reduces the tax refundable to a mutual fund corporation
or an investment corporation on its capital gains, to
reflect the reduction in its corporate tax rate.
You start with your general corporate tax rate of 50 per
cent, and, to the extent that you have refundable, the
refundable must not have undue benefit, as it would have
if you did not reduce the refundable in relation to the
reduction that you are making in the general corporate
rate. Where the capital gains tax rate is only half the
corporate rate, then, of course, the capital gains tax rate is
affected accordingly and that part of the refundable has
to be reduced.
In clause 4, the figure used in determining the amount
of tax as a result of the reduction proposed by this bill is
91.25 per cent of that portion of the amount so determined. The bill then goes on to spell out how that calculation is made. The 91.25 per cent bears the same relationship to capital gains applying to investment companies
and mutual fund corporations as does the 93 per cent in
respect of investment income of private investment companies. The formula by which they have arrived at the
91.25 per cent is one which I have examined a number of
times and have attempted to analyze. Frankly, after all
my attempts, I still would not be able to give a very good
lecture on how the figure is arrived at.
I can tell you what the principle is, and I can say that it
should be in that area or close to it, but in my calculations
I could not hit on 91.25 per cent. However, I am sure that
the mathematicians from the Departrnent of Finance who
will appear before the committee tomorrow will have the
answer. In the meantime, anyone wishing to enlighten
himself might start with this book by Clarkson Gordon &
Co. entitled Tomorrow's Taxes. An Analysis of 1971 Tax
Reforn Legislation as contained in Bill C-259.
At page 137 there is an example entitled "Illustration of
the conduit principle for open-end mutual funds qualifying as investment Corporations and for closed-end investment Corporations." That sounds terrifying, and honourable senators might wish to have the assistance of a
person experienced not only in corporation law but also in
accountancy and possibly in mutual fund practices. However, when we read the headings under which the allocation is made, they become quite intelligible. But even with
all this help, I could not get my own calculation down to
91.25 per cent, and I will not confuse honourable members
by explaining how that figure is arrived at. I merely say
that is the figure which has been inserted in this particular clause, just as the figure of 50 per cent, the general
corporate tax rate, has been inserted in another clause.
I doubt whether anyone has seriously asked the question, "Why is it 50 per cent?" One might with more sense
ask why it is 91.25 per cent rather than why the general
corporate rate is 50 per cent. Possibly the answer is that
we need the money, and that is about all we dare take. No
doubt that would be the classic answer.

SENATE DEBATES

If honourable senators are puzzled by the figure of 91.25
per cent in clause 4, there is nothing more that I can say
about it at this time. I expect to be enlightened tomorrow
in committee, and find out where my mathematics went
astray. I am sure that somewhere along the line I got lost.
The final two clauses are simply transitiorial. They
amend the Income Tax Application Rules, 1971, which are
part of Bill C-259. The explanation given is that clauses 5
and 6 are intended to modify paragraph 51 of the Income
Tax Application Rules, 1971, so that the 7 per cent tax
reduction will properly apply to a 1972 taxation year that
began before July, 1971.
S(2050)

Section 51 provides a general rule for computing a
corporation's tax payable for the 1972 taxation year
where that taxation year falls partly in 1971 and partly in
1972. Clause 6 repeats what is in clause 5 except that it
relates to co-operatives where part of the corporate taxation year falls in 1972 and the other part in 1971.
Technically, of course, you could not reflect under the
Income Tax Act as it existed in 1971, or under the Income
Tax Act as it now exists, a continuity which is most
desirable to carry through from 1972 and back to 1971
without this transitional authority. That is the purpose of
it, and it is in line with the pronouncement the minister
made.
I hope I have not piled confusion on confusion, but the
intent of the bill is a good one. I think we should erect a
shrine and designate it "Tax Reduction." Perhaps if we all
bow in acknowledgment every day, who knows, the process of giving more money and encouragement for spending might ultimately solve some of our problems. It might
create other problems, of course. I remember a senator
who used to stand in the place where I am standing,
Senator Crerar, who used to preach his faith in the old
doctrine of saving and being frugal, making your own
way, and not wasting your assets and your heritage, but
those were other times with other customs. If it is money
that makes the economy roll, then one way of putting the
money into circulation is by leaving more of it in the
hands of the people, consistent always with the needs for
government spending in the field of welfare and other
allied fields.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I wonder if I might ask the honourable senator a question? Is there anything in the bill
which would prevent a province from raising their income
tax which would, in turn, be collected by the federal
government?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Martin: No, nor is there anything to prevent a
province from dropping its income tax.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: May I ask the honourable senator a
question before anyone else speaks at length on the bill?
Speaking only about corporate taxes, the bill is designed,
as I understand it, to reduce the rate of corporate tax for
the taxation year 1972 or 1973, as the case may be, by 7 per
cent.
Under the present act the rate of corporate tax, I understood the honourable senator to say, is 50 per cent. With a
7 per cent reduction, does the rate then become, by this
[Hon. Mr. Haydend

March 27, 1972

bill 43 per cent? This is what bothers me, and perhaps
this is a question for the committee. Earlier in his
remarks, the honourable senator said that under section
123 the intent of the legislation is that the corporate rate
over a period of five years would be reduced from 50 per
cent to 46 per cent. However, by this bill it seems, on
superficial inspection, that the corporate rate is going
from 50 per cent to 43 per cent. Is there a correlation
between these two?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not see any difficulty. This was
an announcement which the Minister of Finance made for
a special purpose: To put more money into the hands of
people and corporations so as to stimulate or give more
life to the economy. It is entirely unrelated to the rate
schedule which appears in section 123 of the statute, and
that rate schedule for 1972 is 50 per cent. This bill ends on
December 31, 1972. It has no application after that date.
After December 31, 1972, we go back to the provisions of
section 123 for 1973, unless, of course, this particular
measure receives such wonderful support and the input in
dollars by way of taxes by reason of the tremendous
increase in the volume of business is such that the government can afford further tax reductions.
I do not see anything inconsistent. One is a special
measure to deal with a special situation.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, I have often
noticed that when Senator Hayden explains a big fat bill
he does not leave any new points for other senators to
discuss, and the same thing is true when he explains a
little skinny bill, as he has this evening. I should like to
say, however, that the bill would be much better if it
provided a reduction for the next ten years instead of just
for this year. Apart from that I must say I am in favour of
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You mean 7 per cent a year?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Well, you can compound it, if you
like.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: In any event, as I have a captive
audience, with your indulgence I should like to stray
somewhat from the bill in discussing the question of corporate tax.
There has been a good deal of talk over the last few
years by some smart politicians, professors, and economists of every kind and description about labour-intensive industries and extractive industries. It has been said
that the privileges or tax advantages granted to our
extractive industries have been too many and that they
should be reduced, while at the same time giving secondary manufacturing more encouragement. I quite agree
with giving secondary manufacturing more encouragement, but we are not in the same position as West Germany where they have imported two or three million Italians
and Spaniards because they themselves do not have a
sufficient main-d'œuvre or work force. We, of course,
have a good many unemployed. In other words, there is
no conflict; the mining industry is not taking away from
secondary manufacturing. There is no conflict because
the secondary industries are located in big cities where it
is easy to attract workers, and the mines are located in the
wilderness.

March 27, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

I disagree very much with the findings of a good many
of these people. I claim that if you want to find opt how
much employment any industry produces you simply
have to look at the wealth it produces. If you look at an
extractive industry and how its money is spent every year
then, bearing in mind there is no conceivable way in
which it can be spent without producing wages somewhere, you can see right away the amount of employment
produced.
To prove my point I should like to give you a thumbnail
sketch of the life and worth of the iron ore industry.
About 1938, the late Jules A. Timmins hired the late
Joseph A. Retty, who was probably our most outstanding
geologist. He sent him in to what is now Seven Islands,
Schefferville, Labrador. Of course, he had to be flown in
by Hartland Molson. Hartland Molson flew in Dr. Retty
and all his supplies. A couple of years before, Hartland
Molson had formed what he called the Dominion Skyways, or the Newfoundland Skyways. If they landed on a
lake on skis, on pontoons, and it happened to be in Newfoundland it was known as Newfoundland Skyways; if it
was in Quebec it was the Dominion Skyways.
* (2100)

Jules R. Timmins hoped they were going to find a lot of
copper, maybe lead and zinc, and things like that. They
knew there was a tremendous amount of iron ore. However, Dr. Retty found so much iron ore, and he was so
good at selling his point of view to Jules R. Timmins, that
Mr. Timmins got hold of George W. Humphrey, who was
then the President of The Hanna Mining Company.
Between them they raised over half a million dollars to
build a railway in and start it.
Honourable senators, after 20 years this is what we
have. Seven Islands has a population of 22,000; Labrador
City, 8,500; Schefferville, 4,200, and Wabush 3,150. That
makes a total of 37,850. If you throw in a couple of
thousand for those who do not live within the limits of
these little towns you have a population of 40,000 people.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is that without Seven
Islands?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I said Seven Islands had a population of 22,000. This gives a total population of 40,000
people. On page 10 of the 1971 edition of the Taxation
Statistics you will find that the average tax paid by the
residents of Seven Islands is just a little above what is
paid in Montreal, a little bit under what is paid in Ontario,
and for the whole of Canada it lists twelfth.
The iron ore company employs 4,800 people. The
Wabush mines employ about 1,700. That gives a total of
6,500. There is no unemployment. The iron ore company
pays an average salary of just over $11,000 a year. That is
their average. Here is an industry that produces $400
million worth of new wealth a year.
We often hear it said that these industries pay out their
dividends and go away. Right now the iron ore company
is spending $300 million increasing its pelletizing operation, and that is the second big expansion in the last 25
years. That $300 million will take care of an awful lot of
dividends that they might have paid out. If instead of
using giant steam shovels and other heavy equipment

239

people used picks and shovels to dig out this iron ore, they
would certainly find iron ore but it would cost twice as
much, and instead of averaging $11,000 a year the people
would be getting by on a couple of hundred dollars a
month.
To my mind there is only one way in which to judge the
benefit of an industry to the country, and that is to see
how much it produces in new wealth. For every dollar of
new wealth you can say there is between 90 cents and 95
cents in salaries paid out a year by this enterprise.
Honourable senators, I will vote for the bill, and I suggest that you all do the same and send it to committee.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I do not
propose to discuss the principle of the bill other than to
commend the government for reducing taxes to the extent
that this bill does so for one year. However, I do want to
comment for a few moments on a remark that Senator
Beaubien made. He referred to Dr. Joseph Retty. Joseph
Retty was a classmate of mine and of Senator Choquette's
at the University of Ottawa. He graduated there in 1926,
as I recall it. He was a very clever student. I remember
him, too, as a very good debater. I think in all of his years
at the university he led his class, and was always far
ahead of the next man.
Joseph Retty came from a small town in the Ottawa
valley called Fort Coulonge. When he graduated from the
University of Ottawa, where he had taken, along with us,
a rather general course in geology, he proceeded on a
scholarship to Princeton University. He had worked
during the summertime for a number of years on the
Canadian Geological Survey. There he met a man who
has made a great impact upon the mining life of this
country, Dr. William James. Dr. James encouraged Joe
Retty very much in his graduate work in geology, at
Princeton, and from there he went on.
I remember riding in a plane with Joe Retty coming
from the west. It was probably during the war, because I
remember that it was a very long flight. He told me about
Jules Timmins and the commission he had from him-I
think Bill James was probably involved in it too-to go
and do some geological work in Labrador and part of
Quebec. I did not know that Senator Molson had flown
him in. What he found there, of course, was so great that
when he came out people did not believe him. It was
fantastic. There have been other fantastic iron ore deposits found in the world since, but I think that was the first
really great one.
I am particularly pleased to have heard mention made
tonight in the Senate by Senator Beaubien of the very
significant role played by Dr. Joseph Retty in the discovery of that tremendous ore deposit, which has brought so
much benefit to that part of Canada, and indeed, to all of
Canada.
Hon. Eric Cook: Honourable senators, I should just like
to add a personal note, and to confirm what Senator
Beaubien has said. I think I had something to do with the
Labrador Mining and Exploration Company even before
Mr. Jules Timmins arrived on the scene, because in 1935,
as a young lawyer acting for a Montreal grou.p, I was an
incorporator of the Labrador Mining and Exploration
Company. That was started by Weaver Minerals Limited,

SENATE DEBATES

who knew that the presence of iron ore was discovered by
a Mr. MacKay, a Canadian geologist, way back in 1898.
* (2110)

So the presence of iron ore was well known, but it was
the exhaustion of the Mesabi range as a result of the last
war which made it feasible. By this tirne, Mr. Jules Timmins had taken over the Labrador mines and had
searched for other mines, but it was the exhaustion of the
other range in the United States, as a result of the inroads
made during the last war, which made the construction of
the railway from the coast to the iron ore deposits
feasible.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: And the St. Lawrence Seaway.
Hon. Mr. Cook: And the St. Lawrence Seaway.
I would make one further observation. As far as I know,
not one cent of either federal or provincial money was
expended on this development. Every single cent spent
came from private capital. The government might have
paid the expenses of a few Mounties but, outside of that,
all the schools, roads, hospitals, and everything there, was
built by private capital, and not one cent of government
money, either provincial or federal, was put into it.
Hon. Fred. W. Rowe: Honourable senators, I had not
intended to make any comments on this particular matter,
but inasmuch as Senator Cook and myself and many
other people took a great interest in this development in
Labrador, I think there are one or two points that could
be considered relevant at this time.
I should like to confirm what my friend, Senator Cook,
has said regarding the development of the iron ore in
western Labrador. I happened to be the Minister of Mines
and Resources at the time that this great development got
under way in the early 1950s, and indeed had the great
honour of being able to participate in the actual opening
or cornpletion of one of the developments along with, on
one occasion, the then Prime Minister of Canada, the
Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, and the then Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, Mr. George
Humphrey, who was one of the leading promoters of that
great enterprise in western Labrador. Incidentally, that
enterprise is one about which very little is known. I often
ask why it is that so little has been said in the world press,
in the public media generally, about this tremendous
development in Labrador. There were two iron ore developments. One was in Schefferville and the other, which
came later, was in what is now Labrador City and the
important city of Wabash.
Then there is the single greatest hydro-electric scheme
in the history of the world, the one nearing completion,
near Churchill, where $1 billion is being spent in one site
which you could almost shoot a .22 rifle across. That
single development, the largest in the history of the world,
will mean almost 7 million horsepower developed in one
area.
It is true, as Senator Cook has said, that this was done
wholly without any government funds. In fact, the only
government help there was in one development in which I
happened to play some role. That was in respect of what
is now Labrador City and the City of Wabash.
Perhaps I should remind honourable senators that there
are two distinct iron ore developments in Labrador, one in
[Hon. Mr. Cook j

March 27, 1972

what one might call the far north, the northwestern
corner of Newfoundland Labrador, and spilling over into
Quebec Labrador, the one at Schefferville. Then, considerably south of that, there is the distinct area where two
major developments took place-one under the Iron Ore
Company of Canada which of course was part of the
Hanna interests of Cleveland, and the other one at the
City of Wabash, only five miles away, again with those
other major United States steel companies which had not
been part of the Iron Ore Company at all.
There is one other point which I might make and I am
very happy to make it. This Wabash development was
done under the leadership and because of the vision of
John Doyle. Without John Doyle's enterprise in western
Labrador, there would tonight be no Labrador City, no
City of Wabash, and no iron ore development-the single
biggest iron ore development in the history of the world.
However, it is there.
There is one other point I want to make, and I say this
as one who was connected with it. As the house knows, I
am entirely of British descent. My ancestors as it happened were English from Devon and Somerset. I am also
one who considers himself a good Canadian, and am very
proud to be named a Canadian. I wish to say this now,
that if we had to wait until Canadian capital had developed the iron ore deposits of western Labrador, the greatest deposits in the world, and the other great iron ore
developments in the north, and also the new hydro development at Churchill, we would be waiting frorn now until
infinity. It was American capital that did it, and when I
hear people being what in effect amounts to anti-American on this matter of American financing, I am reminded
of the fact that at this moment there are tens of thousands
of people in Newfoundland and Quebec enjoying one of
the highest standards of living in all of Canada from these
great enterprises brought about almost entirely by American capital. I know the important roles that my friend Mr.
Jules Timmins and other Canadians played in that, but I
also know that without American capital we would not
have had this huge iron ore development and the great
Churchill development. It was American capital that did
it, and I think we should keep that in mind when we are
inclined to be a little bit ultra-Canadian on this matter of
capital investment in this country.
Hon. Mr. Cook: I wonder if my honourable friend would
mind if I make a suggestion? Is it not true also that the
Steel Company of Canada has played a major part? While
I agree with Senator Rowe that American capital played a
great part, I ask him if it is not also true that in the
Wabash development the Steel Company of Canada
played a major part?
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Honourable senators, that is true. Certainly Stelco was one of the prime movers. I can only add
one thing, which I mentioned at the beginning of my
remarks and then I sidetracked myself. Senator Cook said
that there was no government participation, or at least
very little. As to this, the only government participation
there was, I think we should note, occurred when these
American interests, who wished to develop what is now
the great Wabash area, came to us with Mr. John Doyle.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: That sacred name.

March 27, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Rowe: They came to us and said that a condition of their going ahead with this development was that
we would guarantee the cost of the additional railway that
would be needed from the main line of the Iron Ore
Company to what is now the City of Wabash and Labrador City. We did that. In my recollection, the Government
of Newfoundland guaranteed the financing of the railway,
and there was a tremendous opposition to that. In fact, a
petition was taken up and signed by thousands of people
protesting it, but still we went ahead and guaranteed it.
My recollection may not be as good as that of others, but I
think it was $22 million that we guaranteed for the building of that railway. Without that guarantee, and, of
course, without the railway, there could have been no
development of what is now Labrador City and the City
of Wabash. So to that extent there was government
participation.
I might say that it did not cost the Government of
Newfoundland one five-cent piece, because the whole
matter was subsequently financed by private capital,
most of it American.
a (2120)

Hon. Mr. Manning: Honourable senators, if I may I
should like to ask Senator Hayden for a further clarification of his comments on clause 2. This point also arose
from a question Senator Connolly asked. I understood
him to imply that the effect of this clause would be to
reduce the rate of corporation tax by 7 percentage points
to 43 per cent from 50 per cent. If I read it correctly, it
provides a reduction of 7 per cent of the tax payable by a
corporation on the 50 per cent rate, which is a very different matter from 7 percentage points, which would reduce
the taxation from 50 per cent to 43 per cent. I do not
believe that is the import of section 123 as it is contained
in clause 2 of the bill. As I understand it, that section
merely provides for the reduction in an amount of 7 per
cent of the tax payable on the 50 per cent rate.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Manning: Which is a different thing altogether
from a reduction of 7 per cent from 50 per cent to 43 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is correct. The 7 per cent reduction is a reduction in the amount of the tax otherwise
payable. That is the language in the section.
Hon. Mr. Manning: Thank you.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, the first
point I wanted to make, in relation to the digression, if I
may call it so, in which several senators indulged on how
the Iron Ore Company of Canada and other companies
developed the deposits in Labrador, is that we heard a
tremendous paean of praise of the philanthropists who
undertook these developments. We were told that the government contributed nothing, or very nearly nothing,
apart from the guarantee mentioned by Senator Rowe.
But I should have thought, from the little that I know
about this, that the indirect contributions of the government, in precisely the fashion which Senator Beaubien
referred to, namely, tax concessions and that sort of thing,
might have been rather considerable.

241

I should also be interested to know whether the governments of Quebec and Newfoundland made any indirect
contributions in the way of not exacting too extortionate
royalties from the companies concerned. I am not suggesting that this may not have been good policy. I merely
think that perhaps the eulogies of unrestricted, unsubsidized private enterprise have been slightly overdone.
The second point I wanted to make was the very one
that Senator Manning raised in his question. It seemed to
me that the 7 per cent was 7 per cent of the amount that
otherwise would have been paid. In other words, therefore, if my arithmetic is not too far off, it would have
amounted to a reduction for the year from 50 per cent to
about 46 per cent or something of that sort, rather than
43 per cent. I was rather surprised when Senator Connolly
raised the question he did. However, that has been dealt
with.
The last thing I wanted to say was that I hope that when
this bill goes to committee someone will at least try to
move there the amendment to clause 1 which was moved
in the other place by Mr. Broadbent, the member for
Oshawa-Whitby, namely, that clause 1 be amended by
changing the phrase "3 per cent" in line 11 to "6 per
cent", and by changing the period at the end of line 19 to a
comma and adding immediately thereafter the following
words, "or $60, whichever is the lesser". That is the
amendment which, in committee in the other place, I
think secured the support not only of the New Democratic
Party members present but also, if my reading of his
remarks is right, the support of the financial critic of the
Official Opposition in the other place, Mr. Marcel
Lambert.
I hope very much that that particular amendment and
the arguments by which it was supported by both of those
honourable gentlemen may receive some consideration in
the committee. I am aware that a point of order may arise
there just as it arose last year on the Old Age Pensions bill
when some members tried to move an amendment. But I
hope that the matter will at least be considered, because I
think there are strong arguments for making this reduction in tax for private individuals more beneficial to the
small people and less beneficial to people with incomes
like mine and up.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I would remind honourable senators that, if honourable Senator Hayden speaks now, his
speech will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, I just wanted to
add one point. I was rather puzzled by the figure 91.25 per
cent and how it was arrived at. However Senator Bourget,
with his slide rule and his mental mathematical agility,
and I, with one or two things I was able to say, were able
to work this out and we have concluded that the figure is
correct. Once you arrive at the basic tax on capital gains
on mutual corporations and investment companies of 25
per cent, you immediately deduct the 10 per cent abatement for provincial tax, which brings you down to 20 per
cent. You then figure 7 per cent on the 20 per cent, which
gives you 1.75 per cent as being thé tax reduction on a 20
per cent rate. Then, if you want to relate that to 100, you

SENATE DEBATES

multiply by 5. The effective tax rate is 20 less 1.75, which
is 18.25, and 18.25 times 5 is 91.25.
So what appeared mysterious before has now been
resolved by a simple calculation that perhaps should have
been done earlier. What I said about difficulties I now
withdraw. It really is a simple calculation once you get on
the right footing with your facts and establish your basic
tax rate. The first way in which you might go astray
would be by not deducting the provincial abatement of 10
per cent from the basic rate of 25 per cent. Once you do
that you are well on the way to getting the answer.
That is all I have to say at this time, except that if the
bill receives second reading I shall move that it be
referred to committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1, 1972
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading of Bill C-175,
for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service for the financial year ending 31st March,
1972.
He said: Honourable senators, on March 29, 1971, just
two days short of one year ago, I had the privilege of
introducing in this house a bill to provide for supply for
the final supplementary Estimates for 1970-71. It now falls
to my lot to introduce bill C-175, to provide for supply for
the final supplementary Estimates for 1971-72. I join with
all other senators in expressing the wish that introducing
supply bills will not become for me an annual habit.
Honourable senators, you will recall that royal assent
has already been given to three supply bills covering
Estimates for the current fiscal year. The first provided
interim supply for the months of April, May and June.
The second, agreed to on June 23, 1971, provided full
supply for the balance of the main Estimates for 1971-72.
The third, which provided full supply for Supplementary
Estimates (A), was approved on December 15, 1971.
The bill now before us provides for full supply for the
final Supplementary Estimates (B) for 1971-72, and is, of
course, the last supply bill for the year ending March 31,
1972. These final supplementary Estimates provide for the
expenditure of $184,625,025 under the heading Budgetary
Votes, and for an additional $98,226,000 required under
the various statutory obligations. Lastly, there is provided
a further sum of $150,649,002 for certain loans, investments and advances.
This last sum is apart from and in addition to the sums
voted for purely budgetary and statutory expenditures.
However, $145 million of this last amount of $150,649,002
is not a fresh vote, because it merely replaces a previous
larger provision of $172 million contained in the original
main Estimates and which will disappear as it is now
being repealed. The difference between the $172 million of
loans contained in the main Estimates and the $145 milIHon. Mr. Hayden.]

March 27, 1972

lion of loans now provided for in these final Supplementary Estimates (B) is $27 million.
In order to explain this vote, I shall quote from the
evidence given by Mr. D. B. Dewar, Deputy Secretary,
Program Branch of the Treasury Board, to the committee
of the other place:
The $27 million reduction in new loan authority is in
effect being replaced by a proposal to increase the
grant side of the aid program by $27 million. That $27
million includes $15 million in grants for emergency
relief to refugees in India and East Bengal that was
included in the Supplementary Estimates (A). It also
includes $12 million for projects that will take place in
East Bengal, or Bangla Desh, on a grant basis that
were previously in the program on a loan basis at the
time when this was part of Pakistan. These are the
provision of railway track material to the railway and
a tube well project.
The total Estimates tabled to date consists of budgetary
expenditures of $15,195,111,070 and net non-budgetary
expenditures, loans, investments and advances, of $1,279,329,878. The total Estimates tabled to date are
$16,474,440,948.
These Supplementary Estimates (B) were referred to
the Senate's National Finance Committee on March 8,
1972, and they were discussed in committee with Treasury
Board officials on March 23. The committee's report was
tabled during Thursday's session of the Senate and is, of
course, fresh in the minds of all honourable senators.
The form of this bill is the same as that passed in
previous years. No additional borrowing authority is
being requested in this bill. The previous supply bills for
the current fiscal year provided borrowing authority
totalling $3 billion, and $2,150,000,000 has in fact been
borrowed during the year.
The principal components of Supplementary Estimates
(B) are:
$20 million to recoup the Agricultural Commodities Stabilization Account for deficiency payments paid to raisers
of hogs.
$12 million under the Canadian International Development Agencies to provide aid for rehabilitation and reconstruction in East Bengal.
$145 million for loans to developing countries-this vote
as I have already explained is more than offset by the
repeal of the original vote for loans to developing countries of $172 million. The net effect is a reduction of $27
million in total loans for the year.
$40 million being an upward revision in the amount
forecast as payable in equalization payments to the
provinces.
$92 million for a revision in the forecast of payments to
Quebec under the Established Programs (Interim
Arrangements) Act-principally because of higher hospital services costs and higher welfare costs.
$11 million to the Canadian Wheat Board for losses
incurred in the operation of the barley pool account for
the crop year ending July 31, 1971.

March 27, 1972

__1SENATE DEBATES

$68 million for payments to producers of wheat to
increase their returns from wheat sold for domestic
consumption.
$25 million in additional funds for the Local Incentives
Programs under the Department of Manpower and
Immigration.
$25 million for a revision in the forecast of Canada
Assistance Plan payments which the federal government
makes to the provinces in sharing their welf are costs.
$15 million to the Ministry of Transport to cover the cgst
of three ferry vessels originally financed under a loan
vote in 1968-69. These three ferries are the Lucy Maude
Montgomery which operates between Sydney, Nova
Scotia, and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland, and the
Vacation Land and the Holiday Islander,both of which
operate between Borden, Prince Edward Island and Cape
Tormentine, New Brunswick.
There are also some reductions shown in these Estimates to forecast amounts of statutory items. In particular there is a $55 million reduction from the $80 million
originally established as a limit under the Employment
Support Act set up to reduce the unemployment effects
that were expected to flow from the 10 per cent United
States surcharge.
Happily, as a result of an improvement in international
financial affairs and successful negotiations between governments, the surcharge has been removed and the full
amount of $80 million was not needed.
* (2140)

There is also a reduction of $18 million in the amount
forecast as payable to the Unemployment Insurance Commission as the government's contribution. This amount is
no longer payable with the coming into full effect of the
new Unemployment Insurance Commission Act.
In view of the observations contained in the excellent
report of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance tabled in the Senate on Thursday, March 23, 1971,
there is no need, I am sure, to delay the house by further
extended comment on the appearance of 39 $1 items in
these Estimates. The Senate, both during debates on previous supply bills and through the reports of the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance, has on numerous
occasions expressed strong disagreement with this
practice.
The current report of the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance dated March 23, 1972, once again
expresses concern regarding the use of $1 items in these
acts. However, the report of March 23 deals in great detail
with all 39 $1 items contained in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Dearuisseaux: They could have given this
explanation without too much extra effort when they
printed Supplementary Estimates (B).
Hon. Mr. Cook: I feel Senator Desruisseaux has a good
point. However, as far as the Senate is concerned this
evening, they have been fully dealt with in the report of
the National Finance Committee.
The report gives a very full explanation of each item,
and outlines the purpose of the vote, and the source from
which the funds to pay the vote will come. In view of the
fact that these items have been fully dealt with in the

report of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance, I feel no good purpose would be served by my
going over the same ground.
Honourable senators, I think I have covered all the
important features of this bill, but should you wish further explanation, I will of course endeavour to supply it to
you.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Grosart, debate adjourned.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2. 1972

SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading of Bill C-176,
for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service for the financial year ending 31st March,
1973.
He said: Honourable senators, the Estimates for 1972-73
on which Bill C-176 is based were tabled in the Senate and
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance on February 24, 1972.
However, these Estimates have not as yet been discussed in committee but before we are called upon to give
final approval to the 1972-73 Estimates, our National
Finance Committee will have ample opportunity to discuss these Estimates, and to report.
This will be the case because the present bill covers
requirements for the first three months of the new fiscal
year only. Therefore, long before we will be called upon to
pass judgment on the total Estimates for the current year
we will have before us the usual helpful report of our
Finance Committee.
The 1972-73 Estimates total $16,539,080,169 consisting of
budgetary expenditures of $15,749,301,169 and non-budgetary expenditures (loans, investments and advances) of
$789,779,000.
I might point out as a matter of interest that the total of
the main Estimates for the new year and the subject
matter of Bill C-176 are just over $16.5 billion. This is
about $1.2 billion more than the main Estimates for the
current year, and about $50 million more than the total of
this year's main Estimates plus the total of both Supplementary Estimates (A) and (B).
The bill now before us is the first interim supply bill for
the 1972-73 fiscal year and will release, as I have already
said, a general proportion of three-twelfths of all votes in
these Estimates. There are, however, some votes where
additional proportions will be released. There are 20 such
special items and I will refer to these votes later. However,
in no vote will the total amount voted be released.
The total expenditure proposed by this bill is
$2,399,125,992.20.
The proportions requested in this bill are intended to
provide for all necessary requirements of the Public Service to June 30, 1972. This bill is the usual form of interim
supply bill and, once again, in no instance does this bill
request release of the total amount of any item.
In general, the twenty votes which require additional
proportions can be grouped as follows:
1. Votes in which it is customary to pay grants early in
the fiscal year.

SENATE DEBATES

2. Votes for which additional sums are required to
finance programs until forecast revenues are received
later in the fiscal years.
3. Votes which provide payments required to cover
accounts maintained on a calendar year rather than a
fiscal year basis.
4. Votes for which additional proportions are required
for other specific purposes.
Unless any honourable senator wishes future information on these votes at this time, I would suggest that
perhaps further detailed explanation of them could be left
to our standing committee. I believe there is good reason
why in each case more than three-twelfths is now being
released.
For example in Schedule A under the Department of
Consumer and Corporate Affairs there is Vote 25 for
$469,000. This vote is for the purposes of the Prices and
Incomes Commission, and in this case a further eighttwelfths is being released. This is in addition to the overall
three-twelfths released by section 2 of the bill.
Thus the Prices and Incomes Commission will receive
eleven-twelfths of its vote. This is being done in order that
the Commission can complete its work by June 30, 1972.
You will note, nevertheless, that even here the full 100 per
cent of the vote is not now to be paid so that this vote in
common with all other votes remains, and may, of course,
be commented upon by our standing committee or by any
honourable senator.
Section 5 of this bill not only grants borrowing authority
of $3 billion but also provides for the cancellation of all
outstanding and unused borrowing authority from previous Appropriation Acts for the fiscal year 1971-72. This
borrowing authority has been included in the bill as usual
to authorize the issuance of treasury bills, marketable
bonds, unmarketable bonds, and Canada Savings Bonds
for the financing of the ordinary operations of the government, non-budgetary cash requirements such as loans and
advances to crown corporations, and to meet the requirements of the Exchange Fund Account.
I would conclude, therefore, by once again pointing out:
1. The proportions requested in this bill are intended to
provide for all necessary requirements of the Public Service up to June 30, 1972.
2. In no instance is the total amount of an item being
released by this bill.
0 (2150)

3. The form of the bill is the usual one for interim
supply bills.
4. The passing of this bill will not prejudice the rights
and privileges of members to criticize any item in the
Estimates when it comes up for consideration in committee, and the usual undertaking is hereby given that such
rights and privileges will be respected and will not be
curtailed or restricted in any way as a result of the passing of this measure.
If any honourable senator wishes any further information I shall be glad to provide it.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Honourable senators, I wonder if
Senator Cook would care to comment further on his statement with respect to Schedule A. It is the only one of the
[Hon. Mr. Cook.j

March 27, 1972

many items in the bill which asks for eight-twelfths of the
total amount expected to be expended in the new fiscal
year commencing April 1. As this relates to the Prices and
Incomes Commission, can one take the inference that
there is some special activity going on in that branch to
prepare themselves for prices and incomes controls?
Hon. Mr. Cook: My information is that which I have
already given the Senate, that they are now being voted
eleven-twelfths in order that they can conclude their work
bäJune 30, 1972.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Grosart, debate adjourned.

SCIENCE POLICY
PROPOSED CONFERENCE TO ESTABLISH COMMISSION
ON THE FUTURE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Leave having been given to revert to Motions:
Hon. Maurice Lamontagne, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(h), moved:
That the Senate sponsor a conference to be held in
the Autumn of 1972 for the purpose of establishing a
Commission on the Future, whose responsibility
would be to help as many private and public organizations as possible to forecast and build their future not
only in isolation but together, as was recommended in
Chapter 13 of Volume II of the Report of the Special
Committee of the Senate on Science Policy;
That the Senate specifically assign the responsibility of organizing the said conference to the Honourable
Senators who are now members of the Special Senate
Committee on Science Policy and authorize the said
Senators or a majority of them to incur such special
expenses in connection with the said conference as
may be necessary for the purposes of the said conference; and
That any such special expenses shall be deemed to
be special expenses within the meaning of and shall
be subject to the restrictions imposed by Rules 83A
and 84 of the Rules of the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Would the honourable Senator
Lamontagne give me the name of the seconder?
Hon. Mr. Smith: I understood that this was a notice of
motion to be discussed tomorrow.
The Hon. The Speaker: The honourable senator asked
that the Senate revert to motions, and I thought leave was
granted.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes.
The Hon. the Speaker: I asked if leave was granted, and
there was no dissenting voice.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Surely there is no problem, Mr. Speaker. Senator Lamontagne asked for leave to place this
motion on record. That is the way it will stand, and
tomorrow or the next day we will deal with it.
The Hon. the Speaker: Then I must now put the motion.
Hon. Mr. Croll: There is no motion. There is notice of a
motion for tomorrow.

The Hon. the Speaker: There is a misunderstanding. I
was following very closely what Senator Lamontagne
said, and he asked with leave to revert to motions. I then
asked if leave was granted and apparently there was no
dissenting voice, and Senator Lamontagne made his
motion. I must now put the question on that motion.
It is moved by the honourable Senator Lamontagne,
seconded by the honourable Senator Thompson, that the
Senate sponsor a conference to be held in autumn of
1972Hoa. Mr. Smith: Dispense.

The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I do flot know my position in s0
far as the rules are concerned.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it the wish of Senator Lamontagne to move the adjournment of the debate?
Hon. Mr. Lamantagne: Yes. I would like to speak on the
motion tomorrow, if possible.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Lamontagne, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1. 1972
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Cook for second reading
of Bill C-175, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service for the financial year ending
31st March, 1972.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, Senator
Cook gave us a very interesting and excellent outline
yesterday of the effect of this bill. I would like to add a
few comments to what he told us on that occasion.
This bill gives us the last estimate of the proposed
spending of the government for the year 1971-72, being
Supplementary Estimates (B), which ask approval of
expenditures of something in the neighbourhood of $433
million.
Honourable senators will remember that when the Estimates were originally presented for the year, the assumption was that, barring supplementaries, the government
spending covered by the main Estimates would be $15.1
billion for the year. The supplementary estimates have
now raised this figure to $16.4, an increase of $1.3 billion
roughly.
When one looks back over the record of federal government and other spending during the last few years, one
finds we are faced now with a doubling of total federal
government spending since 1966-67.
The National Finance Committee recommended a few
years ago to the government that it would be wise policy
to contain the percentage of increase in the annual spending by the federal government to the percentage increase
in the gross national product in any one year-a recommendation which would seem to make very good sense.
Obviously, the funds which the government spends must
come out of the GNP, and one wonders how long we can
go on, year after year, spending at a faster rate than the
GNP is providing funds.
The average federal government spending from 1967 to
1971 shows an annual increase of about 12 per cent. It is
normal for government accountants to subtract from that
the transfer payments that are made by the federal gov-

March 28, 1972

1972

SENATE DEBATES

ernment to the provinces, although, of course, this is
merely an accounting explanation. It does not alter the
fact that the federal government requires from the taxpayers of Canada a certain level of revenue with which to
make these various distributions.
It is fair, however, to point out that from an accounting
point of view these transfers do show up normally in the
percentage increase in provincial spending, and that the
transfers from the provinces to the municipalities will
show up in any assessment of the percentage increase in
municipal expenditures.
It is customary, too, to say that the federal government
appears to have done considerably better than the provinces in holding down expenditures. In the same period
the annual increase in provincial government expenditures, less their transfers to local institutions and
municiealities, is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 19
per cent to 19J per cent. Put the three together, federal,
provincial and local, and you will find that at the present
time the total "tax take" out of our gross national product
is about 38 per cent.
But to have a clear picture of the involvement of the
federal government in the total economy we have to add
to these some other figures, because, as I will indicate in a
minute, one of the problems we are faced with over and
over again, when we have appropriation bills such as the
one before us, is the fact that they do not disclose the total
federal government spending. I have mentioned this
before. I intend to keep on mentioning it until the time
comes when the federal government is prepared to put
before Parliament a statement of the total spending or
loaning of taxpayers' money that it intends for any one
year. I repeat that these total figures do not appear in the
Estimates. We do not have the total figures. This has been
called to the attention of the government by the Economic
Council of Canada. It has been called to the attention of
the government by our committee. We still have not only
no action but no indication that we are going to get any
action.
At a recent meeting of the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance, when we were dealing with this bill,
I asked for these figures and was again told that it would
be very difficult to produce them. Representatives of the
Treasury Board told us, "We don't think we can do it."
Well, I suggest that the time has come when Canadians
are entitled to know the total percentage of GNP and the
total percentage of their tax dollars that all governments
intend to spend in any one year before they actually spend
the money. I am not saying that there are any hidden
figures there. It is true that to some extent there is in the
budgetary papers an indication of these additional figures
that are not covered in the Estimates, and, if you search
through it, you can find almost all of them. Almost all of
them show up also in the public accounts, but we have
developed over the years a system of presenting Estimates
which is certainly not designed to make full disclosure. I
hope the time will come when through the efforts of our
committee or through other efforts there will be full disclosure of the total spending plans of all levels of government in Canada before the money is spent.
On a happier note, although there are these very heavy
additional expenditures in these supplementary Esti-

mates, there are, nevertheless, some reduction items in
these supplementary Estimates.
0 (1420)

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): May I interrupt Senator Grosart to ask him a question at this stage? The point
he has just finished making is very valid and the opinion
he has expressed is one that most of us would share. If
there are to be further disclosures about government
spending in the federal field, it is within the purview of
the National Finance Committee to investigate, discover
and report this. But what about control of expenditures
by provincial governments? Does Senator Grosart have
any views on this? I ask this question because I know he
attends the meetings of the Finance Committee regularly
and he takes a very active part in its work. I wonder if he
has any views as to the efforts that might be made by that
committee in respect of the suggestions he puts forth
about provincial government spending.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: In answer to Senator Connolly I
would say that we have to recognize immediately that we
might be told provincial government spending is none of
our business, and perhaps there would be some justification for that. However, I think it is quite possible that in
examining, as we are required to do, the federal government Estimates of expenditures, we could quite plausibly
suggest that we would have to examine them against the
background of the entire national spending context. Last
year 40 per cent of the total "tax take," if I may use that
phrase, was accounted for by federal government estimates and spending. The items that I have referred to as
not being included in the Estimates-which one assumes
to be a statement of intended government spending-are
such things as the CNR, the CMHC loans, and parallelling
them, there is another very large group in the provincial
area such as Quebec Hydro, Ontario Hydro and B.C.
Ferries. There are all sorts of government-controlled
organizations whose financial status is not put before us
in the Estimates, and it is the federal responsibility in the
situation that I am commenting on at the moment.
To come down to the supply bill itself, we as parliamentarians are faced with a very great problem. There is at
the present time in the Parliament of Canada nothing
even approaching an adequate audit or examination of
the Estimates. That statement may be questioned, but the
fact remains that-although I am not able to say exactly
what was done in the other place with respect to this bill
dealing with Supplementary Estimates (B)--we know that
the Supplementary Estimates (A) went before the committees of the other place, as required by their rules. But in
Supplementary Estimates (B) there was a total of 87 votes
of which only 32 were discussed because there was no
time in the time schedule allotted under the standing
orders of the other place for the committees to even
discuss the rest.
Honourable senators are well aware, I am sure, of the
new schedule in the other place, which I am not criticizing, because they are trying desperately to improve this
situation which is completely unsatisfactory. It is being
said over and over again in the other place that it is quite
impossible under the time limits imposed on their committees to return to the House of Commons with anything

SENATE DEBATES
like a statement of a complete analysis of the spending
intentions of the Government of Canada.
We are all aware, of course, that from time to time the
Auditor General makes criticism and rightly so. One of
the reasons, but not the only one, is, of course, that the
Estimates themselves have never been properly examined. Surely it is not satisfactory to wait until the end of
the year, to wait until we have the public accounts, to have
any kind of an audit or to see what is being done with the
taxpayer's money. Even if that audit by the Public
Accounts Committee was complete, and once again I am
not being critical, because I feel that committee is doing
an excellent job, it would surely be unsatisfactory for us
to continue finding fault as we are doing now after the
money has already been spent.
Honourable senators, surely it is within the competence
of the government and its officials to design a better
method of presenting to Parliament the complete Estimates of spending intentions for the year. In dealing with
this type of bill, our committee has raised these problems
on many occasions. We find that these appropriation bills,
and of course this is an appropriation bill, are perhaps an
example of how a good precedent can develop into a very
bad habit. In the type of legislation we are being asked to
deal with in this bill, or in any other appropriation bill,
there are many inconsistencies from the point of view of
the criteria necessary for full disclosure.
As Senator Benidickson has indicated both in committee and in the house, the level of disclosure is lamentably
low. He has given us an example of certain expenditures
in connection with ferries which were purchased by the
Department of Transport. As he pointed out, there was an
expenditure of $15 million, and the names and location of
the ferries were not even disclosed in the supplementary
estimates. This is the kind of inconsistency which exists
throughout the entire Estimates. In this particular case,
some ferries were required and the federal government
lent the money to purchase them around 1968, and it is
only in these Estimates that someone has discovered the
absurdity of that transaction. There are other examples
such as this which appear in the Estimates as loans when,
in actual fact, they are capital expenditures. Indeed, the
purpose of one of the items in this bill is to correct that
absurdity. However, it has taken three or four years to do
this. Another example would be in regard to certain loans
which were made to the CBC-there is no way in the
world this money will be recovered, any more than will
the loans to purchase the ferries be recovered. Yet in
these Estimates we maintain this fiction year after year
and we appear to have made very little progress.
I feel it is my duty to protest, and I believe our committee will continue to protest, and perhaps in time the committee will obtain results from their protesting. I say that
because here again in Bill C-175 we are faced with some
20 $1 items. The situation in regard to $1 items is now
much better than it was three or four years ago. At least
now, as a result of the work of the committee, we have
had for some time an explanation of these $1 items. This
has advanced to the point where the Treasury Board
officials are now prepared to break them down, give us
the effect and tell us which of these are actually amending
legislation. I will not today go into that whole argument
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 28, 1972

which I have presented before, but it is about time that we
got rid of this method of amending legislation.
* (1430)

The committee in its report recommends two major
changes. One is that the explanation of the $1 items in
future be printed with the Estimates. I can see no reason
why that should not be done. Senator Benidickson raised
that matter in committee and, I believe, convinced the
officials that this should at least be given careful consideration. I say we have been able in our committee to have
these figures explained to us.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: I have written since to the minister in charge of the Treasury Board.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: We have these before us now in typewritten form, and we are hopeful that they will be printed
with the Estimates. There is a very good reason. Honourable senators may be surprised at this. In spite of the fact
that we have had this explanation in typewritten form
before us in our committee, it has never been given to the
House of Commons or a committee of the House of Commons. Why? Because they did not ask for it, I suppose. I
am glad to say, however, that in the House of Commons
this matter of the $1 items is being raised, but the explanation I refer to was not given in the House of Commons. We
asked that particular question and the answer given was
no. I do not believe any of us wished to embarrass the
officials further by asking if there is any possible reason
in the world why, after giving it to a Senate committee for
two years, it would not have occurred to anyone that it
would be a sound practice to put it before the committee
of the other place, which has exactly the same responsibilities as we.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: They may not be as thorough as our
committee.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Knowing something of what goes on
in those committees, I would have to demur to that comment. In total they are rather more thorough than are we.
As honourable senators are aware, under the new House
of Commons system the Estimates of each department are
referred to specific committees which are required to
report by May 31. The whole point, of course, is that this
would mean that by May 31 all the Estimates of all departments would have had a thorough going over in committee. Unfortunately, in practice it has worked out that the
committees just do not have enough time. Come May 31,
when the main Estimates will be before Parliament, it is
anybody's guess as to how many departments will have
been examined and certainly anybody's guess as to what
low percentage of the total votes will have been examined
thoroughly.
This raises other difficulties in relation to this type of
bill. An assumption with which it would be quite proper to
start in relating an appropriation act to any other act
would be that the ordinary act of Parliament would deal
with authorizing certain activities on behalf of the government while an appropriation act would authorize the
expenditures necessary to complement the other
authorization.
This is not what has happened. We now have authorization acts enacting legislation which actually commits the

March 28, 1972
March

28

1972

SENATE DEBATES

government to activities which are not covered by any
other act.
As Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) said the other day,
an appropriation act is an act of Parliament. So this
device has grown up from what was originally a good
precedent into what can only be described as an extremely bad habit which, like all bad habits that are not corrected, keeps on growing.
We now have appropriation bills amending other appropriation bills, which is understandable; but also, of
course, amending other acts of Parliament without any
attempt to go through the normal process of amending
that act by using the kind of proper terminology which
would make the amendment directly relative to the act.
Again, out of this sytem comes a very pretty device to
limit disclosure. I am not saying it is deliberate. Consider,
for example, the $1 votes which deal with very large sums
of money. Over and over again we find that the reason
why only $1 is being voted is that the department or
ministry has found the money somewhere else. We therefore assume they are not spending that money, that they
have actually saved some money, and they need the $1
vote only to transfer money already approved into another activity.
If honourable senators examine the $1 items in this bill
they will find that there is very little saving, that ministries have found, for one reason or another, that they
cannot spend the money, and have discovered another
place to spend it.
For example, in the A group of $1 items-I have broken
them down-where was the money found? What happened that money was available? In two cases there were
delays in recruitment of staff. However, we know that
staff will be recruited. Because they were unable to
recruit staff, they said "We have some money and we will
find a way to spend it." Five were due to delays in completing agreements with the provinces. We know that
those agreements will be completed and that the money
will be spent. One is due to a delay in a capital project,
another to delay in the delivery of goods, two due to
delays in construction. Another is due to what is called a
slippage of a capital building program. That is a new
word for me. I do not know what it means, but, anyway,
something slipped. Finally, five are due to delays in
awarding contracts. We know all this money will be spent.
They are only delays. No one has ever said we are saving
this money, but this impression is given over and over
again. In other words, "We have found money, so we only
need $1 for these 20 items."
* (1440)

I have used the word "inconsistencies" in describing
this bill and others like it, and I have indicated a fewonly a few-of the many inconsistencies that I find in it.
This to me is a totally inadequate system of presenting
government spending intentions to this house or any other
House of Parliament.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, I feel that if
the Senate is to be of any use in controlling expenditures,
if it is to have any opinion on which programs are worth
while and which are not, I think we should examine some
of the programs in depth and then suggest what should be

done. It is all well and good to look at a $1 item and decide
whether it is right or wrong. However, if we are to be
really useful I think we should examine doubtful expenditures, and if we believe something is wrong with any of
them then we should say so.
A couple of years ago I spoke on the CBC and at that
time I pointed out that since 1955 the government had
invested in the CBC by making up their deficits or their
capital expenditures, or whatever you want to call them
for they are all the same as the money is never repaid. The
government has invested $11 billion in the CBC. I pointed
out at that time that at a reasonable rate of interest-and
that would be 6 per cent if you average it over the yearsthe cost of the interest alone would amount to $100 million
a year. The CBC at that time was spending about $160
million a year plus about $25 million for capital expenditures for a total of approximately $180 to $190 million.
Add to that amount the $100 million a year in interest
charges and you are looking at a cost figure of something
in the neighbourhood of $300 million a year.
In this year's Estimates the costs of the CBC show an
increase of about $31 million over last year-an all-time
high. Also, of course, we now have a Film Board and the
CRTC, both of which are pretty much in the same league
with the CBC and both of which are also spending a good
deal of money. The CBC has just completed a building
that was to cost $65 million. I do not know if we will ever
be told what it eventually did cost, but if you go to Dorchester Boulevard East you will see spread over three city
blocks the most unbelievable structure you have ever
seen. Now, of course, they are filling the building to
capacity and the costs are soaring.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I did not hear that.
Hon. Mr. Smith: Do not ask him to repeat it; it is bad.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I did not hear your last remark.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You may never hear the last word
on the CBC.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I did not hear the last point you made,
senator.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I was talking about the enormous
building covering three full blocks on Dorchester Boulevard East which the CBC has just recently completed.
Hon. Mr. Smith: How many storeys are in it?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You have to see this building to
believe it.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: How do you spell "storeys"?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: There are quite a number of
"stories."
Honourable senators, just before the last World War the
CNR was running at a deficit of $300 or $400 million a
year and it almost bust Canada. The point I am trying to
make is that the CBC is heading in that direction.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Why is it we need the CBC in Montreal? We have any amount of stations in Montreal and
they can provide the same service. Why do we need the
CBC in Toronto or in other large centers? I could understand it if the CBC was broadcasting something which

SENATE DEBATES

only Indians or Eskimos were interested in. There would,
of course, be no money in that type of broadcast for
anyone else, and the CBC should do it. But to have an
enormous organization such as the CBC producing all
types of films and plays is surely not necessary.
If they wish to produce something in Moncton, then, of
course, the staff from Montreal has to travel to Moncton.
They may only work one or two hours a week but, of
course, they must be there in case they are needed. It
makes absolutely no sense at all. The cost of operating the
CBC will continue to escalate. For heaven's sake, if we
have any sense at all, why do we not sit down and take a
careful look at it. I do not blame the House of Commons
for not doing so. Wherever there is a dictatorship the one
thing the government wants to get their hands on is the
mass media, and once it is in the hands of the government
anyone who does not agree with the government is taken
off the air. It is to our credit that the Canadian Parliament
has not tried to take over the CBC and muzzle it. If you
want to criticize the government the only criticism, in my
opinion, is that it allows a bunch of dummies to run it.
I do not believe the House of Commons can do anything
about it because they are an elected house. However, we
are not an elected house and, therefore, we can do something about it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The House of Commons can or can't?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The House of Commons cannot do
anything about it.

Hon. Mr. Smith: Why?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Because they do not want to put
their hands on it. If they ever tried to muzzle the CBC
everyone would criticize them as they are an elected body.
I can see their point and understand it, and I think it
makes sense. As I said earlier, in any kind of dictatorship
the one thing the government wants to put their hands on
and be in control of is the media. For that reason, I do not
think the House of Commons should go into it. We, however, as an appointed chamber are in a position to go into
it and to straighten the mess out, selling off all the things
we do not need.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The whole thing.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If you want to give me the job of
selling the CBC I could earn a nice commission. I would
sell the whole thing for $300 million. If that were done we
would save an enormous amount of money every year.
The government would lose the approximately $11 billion
Canada has invested in this useless enterprise. However,
if you want to make a gift to your children and grandchildren then dismantle the CBC and sell it off piece by piece.
Otherwise they will be paying for this through the nose
forever and ever.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
may digress somewhat from this very interesting subject
which Senator Beaubien has raised, and ask Senator Grosart a question. I hope his remarks are still fresh in his
mind.
If I understood the honourable senator correctly he said
the total expenditures show an increase of 12 per cent and
this included the transfers to the various provincial governments. Now, transfers, I do not think, can be consid[Hon. Mr. Beaubien.]

March 28, 1972

ered, as far as federal funds are concerned, as expenditures. My question is: What is the overall increase,
according to his calculations, without the transfers?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: That is a very interesting question. In
the first place, I did explain that there is a difference
between the accounting approach and a straight assessment of expenditures. Of course, whether the money is
transferred to the provinces or not, it does not alter the
fact that the federal government has taxed to get that
money.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Or borrowed.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: If you wanted to carry that through
you would never stop because even family allowances are
transfers to individuals. In fact, most of the money is
transferred to someone. I was referring only to the transfers to the provinces which are quite often taken out of
the assessment of the federal total because they are going
to appear in the total expenditures of the provinces.
The 12 per cent is an approximate figure. I think the
actual average was 11.8 per cent. I assume that with these
last supplementaries it would be about 12 per cent over
the period I indicated. If you take out provincial transfer
payments on that broad figure it would drop to about 10
per cent or 9.9 per cent, or somewhere in that area, which
would still be above the rate of annual increase of the
GNP, which in current dollars is perhaps, over that period
of time, about 9 per cent.
* (1450)

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I have one
observation to make and a question to put to the sponsor
of the bill (Hon. Mr. Cook) or the Leader of the Government. I think this debate has been very interesting,
because it shows the inefficiency of Parliament-in which
I include the other place, despite the remarks of Senator
Connolly (Ottawa West)-in really having control over
public expenditures. Sooner or later we will have to
devise some way of giving real control to Parliament over
expenditures by the executive. There is no doubt that the
more we spend the less control we have, and something
will have to be done.
It has been my experience, since I entered Parliament
14 years ago, when we had a budget which was about
one-third what it is today, that the other place is not in the
mood or really able to have control over expenditures,
because while a lot of members there will say the government should spend less, they will seldom point to where
the decrease should take place, since they are afraid of
making enemies of those of their colleagues who would be
adversely affected. Perhaps the Senate is better equipped.
Certainly the speech of Senator Beaubien showed that we
can talk forcefully about some of the Estimate items.
My question to the sponsor of the bill or the Leader of
the Government relates to clauses 5 and 6. I was wondering whether these clauses appeared in previous bills. I
want to put them on the record, because I think they are
important. I did raise this question some years ago. Where
is the line drawn when there is an appropriation bill
authorizing the government to spend money? The public
accounts say that so much money was spent in a given
fiscal year. Where do you draw the line? Which amount is

M-h

99

M-1,98 1972

RENATE DERATES
SENATE DEBATES

reputed to have been spent in a given fiscal year that was
appropriated by a given appropriation bill?
Clause 5 says:
At any time prior to the date on which the Public
Accounts for a fiscal year are tabled in Parliament, an
appropriation granted by this or any other Act may be
charged after the end of the fiscal year for which the
appropriation is granted for the purpose of making
adjustments in the accounts of Canada for the said
fiscal year that do not require payments from the
Consolidated Revenue Fund.
That is normal about Consolidated Revenue Fund payments. I can well understand that if you are paying family
allowances or old age pensions you know where to draw
the line. Clause 6 reads:
The amounts appropriated by this Act may be paid
at any time on or before the thirtieth day of April, one
thotisand nine hundred and seventy-two, and such
payment shall be deemed to have been made in and be
chargeable to the fiscal year ending the thirty-first
day of March, one thousand nine hundred and
seventy-two.
I do not remember having seen these clauses before, but
I remember having asked where the line should be drawn.
How do you decide an amount that has been appropriated
by Parliament should be charged to the Public Accounts
for the year, let us say, 1971-72? We see that with these two
clauses there is some leeway. The government may play
with at least $200 million or $300 million both ways. I do
not think it is satisfactory from the point of the responsibility of Parliament in controlling governmental expenditures. It is too easy to change a deficit of $700,000 million,
for instance, into a deficit of $400,000 million, or even
balancing, having no deficit at all, with clauses like this.
I have on previous occasions asked that our Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance should look into
this and try to find out what should be the rule in deciding
where a given payment should take place in the Public
Accounts. To me, it is most important, if we are to have an
accounting that means something, something that can
really give Parliament-if not the other place because of
the doubts I have raised, at least the Senate-efficient
control over governmental expenditures.
Hon. Mr. Cook: Honourable senators, I fear I do not feel
competent to answer that question. If the Leader of the
Opposition would agreeThe Hon. the Speaker: Do I understand that the honourable Senator Cook merely wishes to answer a question, or
does he wish to speak and close the debate on second
reading?
Hon. Mr. Cook: I had hoped to do both, Mr. Speaker.
The Hon. the Speaker: Then may I remind honourable
senators that if after Senator Cook has answered that
question he goes on with a speech, his speech will have the
effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Keith Davey: Honourable senators, perhaps I
might be permitted to delay Senator Cook momentarily to
make an observation about Senator Beaubien's comments
concerning the CBC. It occurs to me that the surest sign
that spring is in the air is to have Senator Beaubien rise in

his place and launch his annual diatribe against the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We are really off into spring.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It should be spring all the time.
Hon. Mr. Davey: I am delighted to have this certain sign
that spring is here.
I rise also because I am anxious to stress my own belief,
which I hope would be the belief of the majority of honourable senators, that if there could be anything worse
than elected parliamentarians involving themselves in the
affairs of the CBC it would surely be appointed parliamentarians involving themselves in its affairs.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I was wondering how you could get
any worse.
Hon. Mr. Davey: Senator Beaubien is, of course, an old
foe of the corporation. He has criticized the CBC so often
in this chamber in my presence that I honestly think, with
great respect, I çould make that same speech myself,
although not perhaps with the same passion and vehemence. However, I think we should reflect on the real
virtue and value of the CBC in this country, which I
believe is much more than simply providing services to
outlying areas.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: What services?
Hon. Mr. Davey: I was particularly delighted that today
Senator Beaubien gave the CBC that particular credit, as
indeed I think we should. In my opinion, the corporation
is in the forefront of public broadcasting anywhere in the
world. It is a corporation of which Canadians can be
proud. As I have said many times, heaven knows the CBC
is difficult to defend. There are many things wrong with
the CBC. Perhaps one of the things wrong with it is that
Senator Beaubien's comments criticizing the corporation
will doubtless find a place on the national news this eveningHon. Mr. Flynn: I doubt that.
Hon. Mr. Davey: -while those of us who rise in our
place from time to time to defend the corporation will
again be ignored, with a sort of inverted sense of public
relations. In short, honourable senators, I think there are
many things wrong with the corporation, but notwithstanding those things we are better off because of it.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, it
was not my intention to take part in this debate, other
than to say that I certainly enjoyed Senator Beaubien's
remarks about the CBC. I am one of those people who
believe we should give it away if we cannot sell it. We hear
talk about the services to outlying areas, but I would like
to ask some of my colleagues to visit some areas of this
country that are not so outlying. There is a good deal of
the Province of Saskatchewan where the CBC program,
summer and winter, consists of a snowstorm. The reception is unbelievably bad. It has been that way ever since
television was invented. In my opinion, if the CBC got out
of the road and let some other people provide coverage,
and if the CRTC would also get out of the road, we would
have far better television in the remote areas of this
country than we have today.

SENATE DEBATES

(1500)

I do not think that the CBC has been a unifying factor
for Canada. I think it has done as much as, or more than,
any other organization in Canada to tear this nation apart.
The people I happen to represent would be well served
and be most happy to see the end of the CBC. This is not
confined to the area that I live in. I have had the opportunity of visiting other areas in Canada, especially in
Quebec, where there is tremendous criticism of the CBC
and some of its programs in that province.
If we are to have a national broadcasting system
financed by the people of Canada, surely those people
ought to have some say as to how that organization operates. I know it is difficult for Parliament, and especially
an elected body, to stick its fingers into the CBC or any
other national organization financed by the taxpayers of
Canada-for the very reasons Senator Beaubien has
pointed out. On the other hand, surely we ought not to
have a Crown corporation, or whatever one may call it,
with nobody running it, coming to Parliament and getting
millions of dollars to sponsor programs that are detrimental to the unification of Canada and its continuing unity.
Hon. Mr. Davey: Such as? Name one.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Eighty per cent of the programs.
Hon. Mr. Davey: Name one.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Any day of the week.
Hon. Mr. Davey: Name one.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: You can turn on the CBC, if you
have not access to any other channelHon. Mr. Davey: Name one.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Name one? Gracious me, do you
watch it?
Hon. Mr. Davey: You cannot name one.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There are certainly some on the French
network that give publicity to extremist affairs out of all
proportion to their importance.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The public affairs programs generally on the CBC, in my humble opinion, are not designed
to bring about unity in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (de Lanaudière): That is true.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It is all very well if you live in
Toronto. You have cablevision as an alternative, but there
are places in this country where there is no other service
than the CBC. The service is disgraceful. I repeat that
most CBC programs consist of snowflakes on the screen. I
understand that the CBC intends to provide better servicesHon. Mr. Davey: May I ask a question? Most programs
consist of snowflakes on the screen, the senator says. He
is referring to a station in Saskatchewan. I would be
grateful, as a matter of great personal interest, if he would
be specific and say whether he is referring to Regina, or
Saskatoon, or where.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I am not referring to Regina or
Saskatoon, where the stations are in the city limits and the
normal reception is good. I am talking about northern
Saskatchewan and especially northeastern Saskatche[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

March 28, 1972

wan, where the reception is virtually nil. This situation
has existed for as long as I can remember. Why people
even bother to buy a television set I do not know. The
reception is terrible. I am not talking about the hinterland,
I am talking about a heavily populated section of Saskatchewan. I presume that a similar situation exists in
other parts of Canada. People have an alternative in communities that have cablevision, but there are many areas
of Canada which do not have cablevision. There are many
areas from which the CRTC have had applications for
years for cablevision, but still there is no cablevision and
no alternative to the CBC. Surely to goodness there is
room for more than one television station or more than
one or even two national services, CTV and CBC.
Hon. Ernest C. Manning: Honourable senators, as a
relative newcomer to this chamber I have followed with
interest the occasional discussion on appropriation bills.
This is one of the most important subjects, in the interest
of the Canadian people, to be discussed in this house or in
the other place.
The point I wish to make today arises out of a comment
by Senator Beaubien. We can discuss in general terms
these appropriation bills indefinitely, but one doubts very
much if that will make one iota of difference to the general trend of public expenditures by the government.
I agree fully with the point he made that, if we really
wish to make a significant contribution, we can best
accomplish that by zeroing in on specific areas of public
expenditure, and doing a sufficiently thorough study to be
able to point out to the public, and to members of the
other place, arguments pro and con for the continuance or
curtailment of the expenditure, or whatever recommendations may be appropriate in the light of such a study.
Within the broad scope of public expenditures today,
there are some very large items which are debatable,
where it is questionable whether the Canadian public is
getting value for the money being spent. I hope that the
Finance Committee of this house, or some other appropriate body, will pursue this matter further. Let us select two
or three of the more obvious areas of public concern and
see whether we cannot make some meaningful contribution that will influence such expenditures in the future.
As Senator Beaubien mentioned, the CBC is one of the
areas in which there is a great deal of public discussion.
Notwithstanding the observations of Senator Davey, the
only criticism I have of the remarks by Senator Beaubien
regarding the CBC is that he did not say nearly enough,
and he did not say it nearly strongly enough. It has long
been my conviction that the CBC is the most indefensible,
blatant, inexcusable waste of public money in this country
today.
Hon. Mr. Davey: May I be permitted to interrupt Senator Manning to ask him if it would be his preference,
when it comes to broadcasting in Canada, that we have
unlimited, and only, private broadcasting?
Hon. Mr. Manning: I would not say we should have only
private broadcasting. My own assessment is that probably
90 per cent of the services the CBC is rendering could be
rendered better, and certainly at far less cost to the
public, by the private sector. There are areas where the
provision of television and broadcasting facilities is not

March 28.1972

SENATE DEBATES

economic, and there may be a valid argument for the
government providing facilities purely as a service, in
cases of that kind. But I arn at a loss to understand why,
when we have plenty of private capital and private expertise willing and ready to provide both television and radio
services to the Canadian people, we need to spend $350
million of public rnoney, the greater part of which is for
duplication of what the private sector is doing, and what it
is capable of doing on a much larger scale.
*(1510)

Hon. Mr. Davey: I wonder if Senator Manning is aware
that the private television network in Canada is in a great
deal of financial difficulty at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Manning: Yes, I amn, and I think one of the
reasons for that is the CBC.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Manning: When you put the private sector in
competition with a public corporation financed by unlimited amounts of public money, you certainly do not create
a climate in which the private sector has much inducement. But notwithstanding that kind of competition I do
not think there is any dearth of companies and people
trying to get into both radio and television. That is borne
out by the number of applications constantly being made
for new licences.
I was appalled to hear the earlier suggestion of Senator
Davey that appointed bodies, such as this Senate, are flot
the kind of body that should examine into the structure of
the CBC.
Hon. Mr. Davey: I do not; believe I said that the Senate
was flot qualified to examine into the CBC. Indeed, the
Senate Comrnittee on Mass Media did precisely that. We
did examine into the CBC. I do not disagree with you on
that at ail, Senator Manning.
The point I made-and perhaps I did flot make it very
well-was that I felt that we should flot interfere in the
affairs of the CBC or, indeed, muzzle it, to use the rather
strong word which I think Senator Beaubien used. If I amn
mistaken in saying that he used the word "muzzle," then I
apologize to hirn. On the other hand, I certainly agree with
you, Senator Manning. 0f course we can, and should,
examine the aff airs of the OBO.
Hon. Mr. Manning: I appreciate the point Senator Davey
has made. The word "interfere" was used. Perhaps it is a
very good word. I repeat that I arn appalled by any
suggestion that a nonelected body such as the Senate
should not interfere with the CBC. Senator Beaubien says
that the other place, because it is an elected house, cannot
interfere with the CBC. Weil, just what are we saying?
Are we saying that the CBC is sorne sacred thing that
neither the elected body nor this appointed body can
interfere with in any way? That, of course, is the attitude
of the CBC itself. If anybody criticizes the CBC, he is
irnmediately accused of trying to undermine some great,
noble structure that is supposed to be uniting Canada.
I agree fully with Senator McDonald. Ever since it was
set up, the OBO has done more to, tear Canada apart than
it has to unite Canada.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Davey: Could you give us an example of this
tearing apart of Canada which has been done by the
CBC?
Hon. Mr. Manning: I do not want to cite individual
programs, because that irnrediately puts the whole
matter out of perspective, but I agree with Senator
McDonald that most of the so-called public affairs prograrns on the CBC do more harrn than good. I go back to
the days when they had prograrns called "This Hour Has
Seven Days." I arn referring to that type of program. In
my view most of such prograrns are detrirnental to the
unity and interests of this country. The very manner in
which they are presented, and the obvious bias with
which they are presented, is evidence of that to anybody
who watches thern.
I apologize for spending tirne on this matter, because
really it is flot rny main point. Let me corne back to my
main point, narnely, the contribution this house could
make, if it were to select for detailed examination some
major areas of public expenditure, and do a sufficiently
thorough study to corne up with rneaningful answers and
recommendations to guide the other place in dealing with
such expenditures in the future.
Hon. Andr.w Thompaon: Honourable senators, in debating this appropriation bill we seern to have been focusing
rnostly on the CBC. Perhaps because it is not too long
since March 17, I want to enter the fray and make it clear
in the Senate that I do not agree with the wholehearted
and sweepîng denunciations of the CBC that have been
made by Senator Beaubien, Senator McDonald, and Senator Manning. If we look at the CBC and at the international awards which it has received for a great number of its
prograrns, including prograrns on public aff airs, we really
ought to have some pride in the institution. Certainly,
there could be an exarnination of the management of the
CBC and, indeed, of its programrning. However, my personal feeling is that if we are going to deal with the CBC
we should have an opportunity to express our views on it
in a debate in the Senate, rather than discussing it in
passing only as one aspect of an appropriation bill.
So that the Senate will not feel that Senator Davey is a
lone advocate for a positive approach to the CBC, let me
make clear my position in support of him. I think it will be
found that there are other senators in agreement with us
with regard to the CBC.
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I also
rise in order to corne to the defence of the CBC., I do so
particularly because I disagree with certain statements
made by my colleague frorn Saskatchewan, Senator
McDonald. Let me say at once that I respect him very
rnuch, but, obviously, the southern part of Saskatchewan
is in rnuch worse shape than the northern part.
I want to say that the service provided by the CBC to
the northern part of Saskatchewan-and I ar n ot referring solely to the cities-is exemplary and the people are
satisfied with it, considering the problerns that are faced
there. The service provided by the CBC is certainly every
bit as good as, if not better than, the service provided by
the private stations operating in the more remote areas
via satellite.

SENATE DEBATES
I think it is well accepted that the people of our area are
happy with the service provided by the CBC. It is not the
service that the people complain about. The thing that
astounds us in our part of the world-and I am sure
Senator McDonald would agree-is that suddenly $60 million is available for a new headquarters for the CBC in
Toronto, whereas in Saskatoon, when we tried to get a
second station, we were told the money was not available.
Imagine a city of 130,000 people with only one station! We
tried for five or six years to get a second station, but the
best we could do was accept the lesser of two evils, if I
may put it that way. We now have programs piped up to
us from a studio in Regina. We were pleased to get another station, but we were not very happy that it should be
coming out of a southern city. But the CBC tells us it does
not have the money; there just is not enough money. Then
suddenly $60 million is available for Toronto.
That is the kind of thing that does worry us with respect
to the CBC. We are not worried about the so-called service
problem. The CBC has been charged with inefficiency.
Undoubtedly it is inefficient, but I say to members of the
Senate that inefficiency is rampant in almost any kind of
government bureaucratic organization, either federal or
provincial. I do not believe we get the very best value for
our money when governments do things. That is why I am
convinced that socialism will never work. In my opinion
the CBC is a good example of that, but it is not the only
example of government inefficiency.
So far as the programming is concerned, I have to say
that I prefer the kind of programming we have in Canada
from a government-financed, although not influenced,
institution such as the CBC, than the relatively low-quality programming, if I may put it that way, that we see
being produced continually in the United States, where
there is not a government-sponsored television or radio
system.
Certainly, there are many programs that we do not like
in northern Saskatchewan, but I think it is probably
better to have public affairs programs that offend us, and
perhaps create some disunity-and I would agree that
that happens-than to have a kind of programming that
would be equivalent to promotion of the Government of
Canada as a sort of propaganda effort to support the
government, or something of that sort. That is the alternative, because eventually, if we did not have this counterbalance, Information Canada or some such organization,
whatever the party in power may be, would try to influence the people of this country to what in my opinion
would be just as dangerous a level.
* (1520)

Therefore, I believe the CBC has made a significant
contribution to this country, in spite of its weaknesses. I
think it can be said of the CBC that if we did not have it,
we would have to invent it. I should just like to add that so
far as the area of Saskatchewan that I come from is
concerned, with all due respect to my colleague, we are
relatively happy with the service provided by that
organization.
Hon. Edward M. Lawson: Honourable senators, I want
to make a brief comment about the CBC. Senator Buckwold has touched on some of the reactions that we have in
the west, and I have mixed views about many of the good
[Hon. Mr. Buckwold.]

March 28, 1972

things that the CBC does, and some of the bad things.
Perhaps the criticism heard most in the west is that the
title should be changed from the CBC to the TBC-the
Toronto Broadcasting Corporation. I do not mind its
being a propaganda vehicle as long as the propaganda is
from all centres across the country, and teaching and
preaching a little unity from all centres. But it seems to
us-and this may be an unfair criticism-that the bulk of
the programming and, indeed, the control of the programming, is centred in Toronto. I would be most interested in
finding out-and perhaps Senator Davey or somebody
else could tell me-the percentage of programming that is
done in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton, and
other centres across Canada.
Hon. Mr. Davey: The criticism that Senator Lawson has
made is one that has been made in the report of the
Special Committee on Mass Media, so I understand the
point he is making. I think the corporation is attempting
to do something in this area by moving production facilities out of Toronto and Montreal.
Perhaps now is the time for the CRTC, in addition to
insisting on Canadian content, to insist on regional content. In other words, there would have to be a certain
percentage of the programming produced in various centres throughout the country. I take your point, Senator
Lawson, and I agree with it.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I do not think I need to pursue it any
further other than to point out that that is an area where a
committee of this house could function to amplify on that.
The immediate complaint, when you are talking about
spending $60 million more on facilities in Toronto, is
going to be that Vancouver still operates out of an old
automobile warehouse, where I think some good programming is done under terrible conditions. It does seem
that somebody is not moving in the right direction to
dilute this concentration in the one area. I would be happy
to support any type of program that would develop, as
Senator Davey said, a more regional concept right across
the country.
Hon. John J. Connolly: I think that Senator Beaubien
can certainly go home feeling that he has had a good
week. He stimulated a good debate last evening, and he
bas done the same thing today.
Honourable senators, I do not propose to engage in a
discussion about the merits or demerits of the CBC or any
broadcasting facility in this or any other country. However, I do want to say a word about the functioning of the
Finance Committee.
We should keep the function of this committee in perspective. It is only for six or seven years that the committee
has been meeting on a regular basis to examine the Estimates and the supplementary Estimates as they have been
brought down and tabled in this bouse. The program that
has been agreed to through these years has been a very
helpful one. I think that should continue to be a regular
part of the work of the Senate. Were it not for that,
problems of the kind raised by Senator Beaubien, and
other senators who have participated in the debate this
afternoon, might never have come up. Therefore, I say
that the regular work done on the Estimates by the
Finance Committee of the Senate should continue to be
done.

March 28, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

It is my view that special studies, whether concerned
with the CBC or with a ferry company, which I think
Senator Beaubien mentioned, or other projects that
involve huge expenditures of money, are perfectly within
the competence of this committee. It can examine any
specific item in the Estimates, and make a special study. I
do not think there can be any question at all about that.
The very fact that the Special Senate Committee on Mass
Media did look at the CBC indicates that there is a competence in this house to do what Senator Beaubien and
others have suggested. But I plead with all honourable
senators not to push the Finance Committee into a special
area of investigation of such projects to the disadvantage
or exclusion of the general work which it does in connection with its overview of the Estimates.
Hon. Eric Cook: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, if the honourable Senator Cook speaks now, his speech will have
the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is too sad.
Hon. Mr. Cook: Honourable senators, I am in some
doubt as to whether you are going to listen to my program
or turn me off. At the outset, let me state that I do not feel
I am in a position to do justice to the question asked by
the Leader of the Opposition and indeed, if I were to try, I
would probably mislead honourable senators. Therefore,
if it is agreeable to Senator Flynn, I would like to refer his
question to the proper authorities and have the answer
sent to him, and also placed on our record.
I am indebted to all honourable senators who have
taken part in this debate, and particularly to Senator
Grosart and Senator Beaubien for their excellent and
knowledgeable contributions. While I am not always in
agreement with their views, I am bound to say it is always
a pleasure to listen to thern when they speak. Whether a
particular government spends our money wisely or
unwisely is, of course, a matter of opinion, but it seems to
me that all we can do in this chamber is to hope for the
best, and in the meantime, as Senator Grosart, Senator
Beaubien and Senator Manning have suggested, to continue to criticize the Estimates with a view to ensuring as far
as possible that due economy is exercised.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Cook: I do not know whether it is desired that
third reading of this bill should stand until tomorrow, or
whether honourable senators would consent to third reading now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It makes no difference since we shall
not have royal assent until tomorrow. However, I suggest,
since it is not intended to give the bill royal assent today,
that we should follow the rule.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This should be the normal practice, but
in this instance I will not object if the honourable senator
asks leave.
Hon. Mr. Cook moved that the bill be placed on the
Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2, 1972
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Cook, for the second
reading of Bill C-176, for granting to Her Majesty certain
sums of money for the public service for the financial
year ending 31st March, 1973.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I might say
at the outset that the comments which I made on Bill
C-175 apply to the bill now before us. This bill, of course,
deals with expenditures for a different calendar year. The
previous bill disposed of the supplementaries for 1971-72.
In this bill we are being asked to grant interim supply for
1972-73.
Since Senator Cook has explained this bill in his usual
competent manner, and because this is a bill dealing with
interim supply I do not intend to comment at any length
on it. Interim supply, of course, is a necessary part of the
structure of the Estimates and the public accounts.
This is a situation where we are granting interim supply
before Parliament has had an opportunity to examine the
proposed expenditures. As I indicated in my earlier comments, this is a very serious problem for Parliament in the
control of supply. It is all very well to say that this is
merely an interim supply bill and there will be ail kinds of
opportunities to continue examining the items in these
Estimates. However, the fact of the matter is that we are
granting money by way of an appropriation bill which is
an act of Parliament, and therefore approving not only
the activities indicated in the votes contained in this bill,
but also the amounts to be spent. Obviously, the Senate
will not examine the Estimates before the money is granted. We will examine the main Estimates in due course,
however, after some of the money has been spent. This
same situation will apply in the House of Commons. They
will not receive the reports of all the committees which
are examining these Estimates until May 31. Unless these
Estimates can be moved to an earlier period, we will be
dealing with interim supply bills such as this for a long
time to come.
The estimate of spending intentions which are covered
by these Estimates do not include all of the spending of
the government, yet they amount to $16.4 billion for last
year. We began the year at $15.1 billion and added by way
of supplementaries $1.3 billion. I notice that in Bill C-176
we begin at $16.5 billion, which is up one point from $16.4
billion. Who can predict where we will wind up at the end
of the year? We will have supplementary estimates, and
my guess would be that by the time all the figures are in
we will have set an all-time record budget close to $18
billion. There is no way for us to know what may come to
us by way of supplementaries. Certainly if we add some
of these items which are government spending but which
are not covered by the Estimates, the total figure of federal government spending will be around $18 billion next
year.
As Senator Cook has suggested, the bill is in its usual
form with the usual guarantees. I see no reason why

SENATE DEBATES
consideration of this bill should be delayed. In due course
the committee will turn its attention to the main
Estimates.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. Cook: Honourable senators, I move that this
bill be placed on the Order Paper for third reading at the
next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We may wish to raise the CBC issue
agan.
Motion agreed to.
SCIENCE POLICY
CONSIDERATION OF VOLUME II OF REPORT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 23, the
adjourned debate on the consideration of Volume II of the
Report of the Special Committee on Science Policy, tabled
in the Senate on Thursday, February 24, 1972.
Hon. Andrew Thompson: Honourable senators, I should
like to join with the other committee members in paying
tribute to the extraordinary talents and abilities of our
chairman. He has been an inspiration to us. The recognition which the two volumes of the report have received
throughout the world results from his creative direction.
I also compliment the two men who are of great assistance to our committee. I refer to Mr. Pocock-I do not
think I exaggerate when I say he is a walking encyclope-

dia of science knowledge-and Colonel Ostiguy, our able
administrator, who withstood the various pressures in the
publication of this report with calm confidence.
I have been assigned to speak on the first chapter of
Volume II of the report entitled "Challenges and Opportunity for Science and Technology." This chapter is
intended to serve as a general introduction and background in an endeavour to make the public more aware of
the crucial importance of science and technology for the
future of Canadians and mankind in general. Today
research and development are recognized as a vital
ingredient to the bloodstream of an advanced society. In
Canada, the total expenditures on R and D have increased
by an average of 15 per cent a year since 1940-from $20
million a year to more than $800 million by the year 1967.
If the present trend continues, they can be expected to
rise to as much as $4 billion annually by 1980. It has been
estimated that $50 billion annually is being devoted to
research and development throughout the world. According to Aurelio Peccei, an Italian economist and industrialist, for Europe and the United States these expenditures
will amount to $73 billion per year by 1980.

We are long past looking at scientists as cultural adornments that work in cellars and attics. Oliver Wendell
Holmes made the remark that science is a good piece of
furniture for a man to have in an upper chamber, provided he has common sense on the ground floor. Today,
however, throughout the world there is a recognition of
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 28, 1972

the importance of science to the standard of living and the
national objectives of every country.
Chairman Mao's little red book states:
Natural science is one of man's weapons in his fight

for freedom. For the purpose of attaining freedom in
the world of nature, man must use natural science to
understand, conquer and change nature, and thus
attain freedom from nature.
So man, the discoverer, the creator and the entrepreneur, backed by billions of dollars in investment, is
pursuing a relentless ambition to deliberately and radically change both the physical and natural environment of
the earth, and to liberate himself from the limitations of
nature. Unprecedented numbers of scientists are battering down the walls of the unknown, and presenting a
proliferation of new frontiers in knowledge for us to use
or abuse. Senator Cameron has spoken of this tidal wave
of knowledge, and the necessity for Canada to create, to
use his words, a dynamic, growing and innovative scientific and technolgoical information system.
I think it is worth repeating that 90 per cent of all
scientists who ever lived are now alive. Kenneth Boulding,
an economist, in his lecture to the Nobel Conference in
1966, said:
The world of today is as different from the world in
which I was born as that world was from Julius
Caesar. I was born in the middle of human history.
Almost as much has happened since I was born as

happened before.
There are many historians who agree with Professor Herbert Butterfield that for the western world the scientific
revolution "outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and Reformation to
the rank of mere episodes."
There are two extreme positions on this profound scientific and technological revolution. One position emphasizes that it represents the unique opportunity of modern
man. The other fears that the ascendancy of scientific
mode of thought will undermine the traditional values,
ideas, and institutions of civilized society. Let us recall
that most of western man's religions, philosophies, political ideas, and institutions are the legacy of his agrarian
past, and the fear relates to knowledge that accumulates

faster than the wisdom to manage it.
To give an example of the sweep of knowledge and the
changes to our environment by technology which happen
every day, I read the following in the Globe and Mail
today: "GO train to Georgetown by early next year"-this
refers to a commuter transportation system that is being
extended from my own city, Toronto, with all the ramifications it will entail. There is discussion of hydro routes
and the implications, and an article headed: "Testing
possibility of climate control"-a discussion of the St.
Lawrence River and how changes to the icecap would
have an ecological effect in addition to blocking the movement of shipping during the winter.
The same paper reports "the development of a laser
beam so powerful that it can evaporate any known
material." Being so used to reading of new innovations, I
almost missed this: "The Soviets are launching a spacecraft that will land on Venus." Another headline states:

March 28, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

"Protein factor needed for growth of cancerous tumor,
surgeon says." And yet another reads: "Doctor warns of
cancer link with hormone." A talk by Prince Bernhard is
reported which suggests that "900 species of animals and
20,000 plants are in danger of extinction." In the same
edition a headline speaks of "slick lickers" to clean up oil,
a new approach to cleaning up oil on the oceans. On the
same page is a report of an organization of oil companies
to carry on research connected with exploration for oil.
Turning from the environment to other areas, the paper
contains a discussion of the shorter work week, the whole
change towards leisure time, and our pattern of employment. There is an item on the guaranteed income in the
United States. Finally, but not least, there is a report of a
speech by Senator Lamontagne containing criticism of
top management with respect to innovation.
That was the news just for today of this tidal wave of
scientific and technological innovations that is sweeping
over us.

In the first chapter of this volume of our report we
considered both the benefits and perils of science and
technology. Prior to discussing the "two faces," however, I
would like to stress that our committee distinguished
sharply between science, technology, and innovation. We
stated that the natural fruit of science, which is knowledge, and its impact on society can only be beneficial. We
also pointed out that technology can be good or bad, or
both, when it is transformed into innovations. Dr. Von
Karman, who was the first recipient of the U.S. Medal of
Science, stated that "the scientist explores what is, the
engineer creates what has not been."
9 (1550)
In an article appearing in Impact, Harold Foecke
extended this distinction, explaining that the scientist
works from the particular to the general, striving to discover the relationship which explains many specific cases,
and the engineer brings generalization to bear upon particular problems. The scientist asks why, and knowledge
is essentially independent of any value system; but the
engineer asks how, and should work within a value
system.
I make this point of clarification because I want it
understood that the committee does respect the essential
independence which the scientist must bring to his
research. It may appear to some that the report stressed
the perils rather more than the potentials. But perils must
be effectively evaluated and dealt with, otherwise the
potentials might well remain unrealized.
Let us look at some of the benefits. We listed the overall
benefits of increased productivity in the factory and on
the farm. This rising standard of living results in a continuing trend away from working with things toward working with and for people and, of course, increased leisure
time. Six per cent of the labour force of the United States
produces food for that country's population of 200 million,
plus the 160 million to whom food is exported. Today
there is "the green revolution" in which new types of
grain have many times the yield per acre of previous
strains. Science has brought a revolutionary change to
agriculture and has opened up new processes in the food
industry.
25312-17

Biochemist Marvin Johnston of the University of Wisconsin stated:
Our ancestors domesticated various plant and
animal species in the prehistorical past, but microorganisms were not domesticated until very recently,
primarily because man did not know of their
existence.
Japan today has a particularly advanced food industry
based upon microbiology. Much of its food industry is
based on processes in which bacteria are used. Microbiology is used in the large scale production of vitamins,
enzymes, antibiotics, citric acid, and other useful components. Over 25 major United States oil companies are
attempting to develop an economic way of producing
protein from petroleum. Sidney Katz, in an article in the
Toronto Star, reported on the work of Dr. John McNab, a
Canadian scientist with Esso who has been working on
S.C.P., a new food which is manufactured by feeding
hydrocarbon petroleum to bacteria. Mr. Katz reports that
theoretically, under ideal conditions, a single microbe,
which weighs one billionth of a gram, could grow to be
14,000 times the weight of the earth within one week.
Dr. Magnus Pike states, "The scientific knowledge of
how to make food synthetically is already available ...
several individual amino acids are already manufactured
and there would be no major problem in synthesizing the
20-odd which comprise the components of beef protein or
egg-white." Eventually we shall learn to do without nitrogen fertilizer, which is a grave source of pollution, by
developing plants which can extract nitrogen from the air.
The benefits of this green revolution, this revolution in
food processes, should be apparent when we consider that
half of the three and a half billion men, women and
children who inhabit the globe are not being fed adequately, and within 35 years the world's population will
increase to seven billion.
Let us consider another benefit of science and technology-the eradication of pestilence. Microbiology, combined
with clinical research, has drastically reduced the danger
of polio, smallpox, diphtheria, typhoid fever, plague, and
malaria. A breakthrough in medicine, which is compared
to the splitting of the atom, is the discovery of the structure of DNA and the genetic code by James Watson and
Francis Crick. As our report states:
This new development in the life sciences holds the
promise of curing such dread diseases as cancer, correcting the genetic defects that perhaps account for
some 50 per cent of human ailments, expanding the
abilities of mind and body, and ameliorating the erosion of old age.
Mongolism, which occurs once in every 600 births, and
hydrocephalus, or water on the brain, are now within
reach of being checked. Last week, in the Globe and Mail,
Dr. Borstein was quoted as predicting a cure for multiple
sclerosis in five years.
Our report lists revolutionary changes in many other
areas, such as transport, where today's aircraft cross the
Atlantic in one five hundredth of the time taken by
Jacques Cartier.
There have been changes in communications. Today,
for example, one TV channel can transmit on a continuing

SENATE DEBATES
basis, every word and illustration printed in every newspaper, magazine, journal, and book throughout the world
as they are published. In France already Europe's first
medical journal is being distributed in the form of a video
cassette. I mention space technology, observation satellites, nuclear power, computers, and cybernation. There
will be astounding and awesome benefit to mankind from
the permanent scientific revolution during this decade.
We all remember Von Braun's answer to a question
respecting the importance of moon flight:
0 (1600)

I think it is equal in importance to that moment in
evolution when aquatic life came crawling up on the
land.
Let us look at the mysteries of the depths of the oceans.
Dr. F. N. Spiers, head of the Marine Physical Laboratory
of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, says that within
50 years "man will move onto and into the sea-occupying
it and exploiting it as an integral part of his use of this
planet for recreation, food, waste disposal, military and
transportation operations and, as population grows, for
actual living space."
There are over 600 companies in the United States looking at the underwater wealth. The seas cover two-thirds of
the planet's surface. Today Japan extracts 10 million tons
of coal a year from under the sea and, in addition, there is
oil, gas, diamonds, sulphur, cobalt, uranium, and tin
among other resources to be harnessed. Man is learning to
master the depths of the oceans. Dolphins are being studied to ascertain whether they can carry tools, ward off
sharks, and herd fish. There is a whole new concept for
the farming of fish. Just last week I read that the United
States is retiring a secret team of porpoises which they
had trained to detect communist frogmen in Vietnam.
Scientists are working on artificial gills for underwater
living. General Electric claims that these gills may furnish
air for the occupants of underwater apartments and
hotels.
Weather is another example. Weather modification is a
reality, states the American Meteorological Society. The
National Aeronautic and Space Administration is studying the concept of a giant orbiting space mirror capable of
reflecting sunlight on the night-shrouded parts of the
earth.
In our report we list some of the developments that a
group of scientists predict will occur by the year 2000. Let
me just read some of those: Economically useful desalination of sea water-think of what that will mean to many
parched areas of the world-automated language translation, new synthetic materials for ultra light construction,
controlled thermonuclear power, economic feasibility of
synthetic protein for food, widespread use of sophisticated teaching machines, and automated libraries looking up
and producing copy.
Let me read from another time table of genetic developments which is an updated version of the predictions
made two years ago in the Rand-Douglas studies and
includes some items from G. R. Taylor's The Biological
Time Bomb. The dates are those of technical achievement,
and not of widespread implementation. By the year 2000
there will be deep freeze embryos stored and insured
against nuclear holocaust and also for interplanetary
[Hon. Mr. Thompson]

March 28, 1972

colonization; artificial placenta and mechanical baby factory; effective control of most human defects through
genetic manipulation; extensive transplantation of limbs
and organs; single-celled life created from chemicals off
the shelf; intelligent animals produced to do menial work;
and the first cloned, or xeroxed, people-it will be possible to make 50 or 50,000 copies of an Einstein or anybody
else. Of course, such a timetable will and should raise
fundamental questions. Is there a standard of life? What
is man? Who will decide what qualities to preserve, and by
what standards? Who will make the choice between life
and death?
The late C. S. Lewis more than a quarter century ago
wrote, "Man's power over nature is really the power of
some men over other men with nature as their instrument." Eric Fromm wrote that with our technological
revolution "we are at a crossroads, one road leading to the
completely mechanized society with man as a helpless cog
in a machine ... and the other to renaissance of humanism and hope-to a society that puts technique at the
service of man's well-being."
Indeed, as I have been reading these benefits I am sure
honourable senators have been asking other questions:
Are we Canadians tuned in to derive the benefits from the
technological advances which are taking place throughout
the world such as in health, housing, transportation, and
communications? What effect will new discoveries in
agriculture and the synthetic production of protein do to
wheat exports? What effect will the new methods in fishing and the exploitation of the continental shelves of the
oceans have on Canadian maritime employment? What
effect, indeed, will the computer industry have on the
Canadian labour force? These are crucial questions which
we must face, particularly when we think of the growth in
our labour force. Between 1965 and 1980 we will exceed
by over half a million the labour force growth expected in
Britain, West Germany and Italy combined, and equal the
entire existing Swedish labour force.
There are two faces to the scientific and technological
revolution. Francis Bacon is often quoted as having established the legitimacy of the scientific cause, but I sometimes feel some people have not read his essays. I am
thinking particularly of New Atlantis in which he
describes the island where the fathers of Solomon's
House-who were the scientists and the leaders-reserved
to themselves the right to disclose certain of their findings
and to withhold others.
* (1610)

Again, back in 1663 there was concern about scientific
discovery. Richard Hooke, the secretary of the Royal
Society, may have had some doubts when he urged his
fellow scientists to confine themselves to experiments
with nature and avoid "meddling with divinity, metaphysics, morals, politics, grammar, rhetoric or logic."
There are perils in opening the Pandora's box of science
and technology. Barry Commoner, in The Closing Circle,
places the blame for the environmental crisis squarely on
technology. He points out that after 1946 the population of
the United States rose by 42 per cent, but pollution, on the
other hand, rose by as much as 2,000 per cent. He blames
the pollution on synthetic fibres, aluminum, plastics, and
nitrogen fertilizers. North Americans throw away solid

March 28, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

waste each year which could build a wall 75 feet wide by
60 feet high along the Canadian-United States border.
Canadians produce over 673 million tons of solid waste
every year. In the City of Toronto 120,000 tons of paper
garbage are collected each year.
These problems of urbanization will increase. It is
estimated that from 1920 to the year 2000 the urban population in developing countries will have grown from 100
million to 2,000 million. By that time, 38 per cent of the
world population could be urbanized.
Life magazine noted in 1970 that scientists have solid
experimental and theoretical evidence to support each of
the following predictions: in a decade urban dwellers
will have to wear gasmasks to survive air pollution; in the
early 1980s air pollution, combined with a temperature
inversion, will kill thousands in some United States city;
by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of
sunlight reaching the earth by one half; in the 1980s a
major ecological system-soil or water-will break down
somewhere in the United States, and new diseases that
humans cannot resist will reach plague proportions.
Of course, the threat to the stability and livability of the
environment is not confined to the area of the United
States. On the high seas, 70 per cent of the free oxygen
comes from plankton in the oceans. Let me read from The
Observerof December, 1971:
Atlantic plankton pollution shocks scientists: Plankton samples throughout the whole Atlantic Ocean
have been found to contain such unexpectedly high
levels of industrial pollutants called PCBs that marine
biologists are pressing for an immediate international
conference.
We are sadly aware of the pollution in our own rivers
and lakes. The discovery of such pollution is no longer a
front page story. Indeed, we no longer read on the front
page about the high mercury content in game birds or
fish, or of Lebanese people who have been poisoned by
what could be Canadian grain that has been shipped to
them.
It is also disturbing to learn that what are intended as
benefits from our advanced societies to underdeveloped
nations may be dangerous Trojan horses. In Science
Forum for October 1971 there is a chilling account by Dr.
Heyneman entitled "How technical aid programs could
destroy the Third World." He describes how the enormous
dams that have been built on the Volta in Ghana, the
Zambesi and the Nile, in East Africa, Egypt and the
Sudan, have disturbed the course of nature. For example,
the Nile, now freed of silt, which has been held back in a
dam, races downstream undercutting bridges and eroding
banks. Now millions of tons of fertilizer are required to
replenish natural sources which for centuries were fed by
the annual Nile floods. The Nile's load of sediment into
the eastern Mediterranean is gone, and so are 18,000 tons
a year of fish that fed on it. Disease, particularly the
dreaded bilharzia-bloated livers-which affects young
and old, the modern plague of Egypt, is spread, caused by
the snails that now thrive in the sluggish water held by the
dam. That spread of disease has affected between 200 and
250 million people, and according to the article it is directly attributable to damming the Nile.
25312-17 ý

In 1969 the Conservation Foundation in Washington
reported that in San Joaquin, Bolivia, a DDT malaria
control program aimed at mosquitoes had the side effect
of killing off the numerous village cats. In the absence of
the cats there appeared an invasion of a small mouse-like
mammal. This creature, unbeknown to anyone, harboured the black typhus virus. Before this was discovered, and the former chain could be restored, more than
300 villagers had lost their lives.
Senator Lamontagne, in his address to the Convocation
at the University of Toronto last June, warned of this. He
said:
Nature can revenge itself, once its own equilibrium
has been disrupted, and technology can have negative
side effects on man and his environment far exceeding its beneficial contribution.
He pointed out this quandary, that advanced countries are
in the vicious circle of affluence, generating the endless
need for further affluence, producing an economic
growth explosion. On the other hand the developing
nations, like the advanced countries, will be condemned to
an exponential law of growth, although in their case the
explosion will be population rather than economic. The
"green revolution" increases life expectancy, which
results in population explosion rather than in rising living
standards.
Senator Lamontagne, in his report, pointed out that in
the year 2000 the annual per capita income in the United
States is expected to be 115 times higher than in India.
That tragic abyss of standards of living between the quarter affluent and the three-quarters hungry on this globe
will be more vividly apparent to both sides with the
advanced means of communication. Senator Lamontagne
raised doubts whether affluent nations would provide the
required accelerated assistance to the other nations, and,
if they did, whether the poor nations could absorb such
massive assistance; whether, to check the pollution and
the food and the overpopulation crisis, our western society will accept slower or no growth.

•

(1620)

In Limits of Growth, the report Senator Grosart mentioned, written by an internationally eminent group of
scientists belonging to the Club of Rome, they are similarly bleak in their prognosis of man's future. Let me illustrate our problem. In their report, there is a description of
a French children's riddle about a pond with a water lily
in it. The lily doubles in size every day, and in thirty days
it would cover the entire pond, killing the other creatures
in it. The owner decides to cut the plant back when it
covers half the pond. The question is: when will that be?
The answer is the 29th day, so the owner has one day in
which to save the pond. Like the lily in the pond, the
earth's population is growing exponentially, doubling
about every 33 years. So are pollution, the demand for
food, and the use of mineral resources.
For example, it took the entire history of the world until
the mid-nineteenth century to amass a population of one
billion; 80 years to reach a second billion; 30 years to
reach a third billion; and in the year 2000 there will be 6
billion. How long can the population and industrialization
continue to grow on this finite planet? Mr. Meadows, the
author of this M.I.T. report Limits of Growth, comes to

SENATE DEBATES

the conclusion that "all growth projections end in
collapse."
In January, 1972 Blueprintfor Survival was published.
It also projects disaster, and argues for drastic action to
end exponential growth. This report, like the other, is
supported by 33 of Britain's most distinguished and eminent scientists. They want a stable society, a declining
population. They want heavy new taxes on raw materials,
tax penalties on industries which consume amounts of
nonrenewable natural resources, and a tax on throw-away
products. Probably their most controversial request is
that of decentralization and de-urbanization, a return to
village industries and village communes.
Most newspapers in Britain took Blueprint for Survival
very seriously. The Times said "its thesis was too plausible to be dismissed." The Observer stated:
We should regard the "Blueprint" not as a prescription for what must be done-but as a warning that we
have to think hard about what we are doing.
In the controversy over the suggested solutions, Senator
Grosart himself raised the question about maintaining the
high quality of life with zero growth. Others have asked if
we can expect Asians and Africans to live forever at their
low standard of living.
John Maddox, the editor of Nature, a highly reputable
magazine in Britain, in an article on February 3, 1972,
took on all these prophets of doom, reaching back to
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and working through Dr.
Paul Ehrtilch's PopulationBoom, and from there be went
on to criticize the authors of the Blueprint.He argued that
growing countries will emulate the advanced societies by
a matching decline of fertility, and that the price mechanism will take the edge off scarcity and encourage substitution. He decried the practice of scientists in crying
"Wolf."
Let me add that we ended the chapter on "Challenges
and Opportunities" with this comment by René Dubos:
Whether we want it or not ... we shall soon be compelled to reformulate the philosophy of quantitative
growth which has governed the Western world since
the Industrial Revolution.
It would be quite wrong to suggest that the resolution of
such a dilemma should be left to experts who have identified the problems. The decisions required are political.
They are for all of us. But it is important that the scientific community is speaking out.
Our report recommended the adversary method in
order that we could assess the evidence presented from
the conflicting viewpoints of scientists.
It is interesting to see that Charles Leach, science correspondent for the Observer Review, is using this confrontation approach-scientists who are gloomy in their predictions against scientists who are optimistic. I think it is
important that the scientists are speaking out.
C.P. Snow, an eminent author in science, describes
scientists as having "the future in their bones." I am not
sure that the scientists will retain the confidence of the
public as oracles of wisdom if they apply exaggerated
claims. But Stafford Beer, Professor of Cybernetics at
Manchester University, suggests to us:
[Hon. Mr. Thompson.]

March 28, 1972

We (the scientists) must sacrifice both dignity and
scientific nicety and be turned into cathode ray buffoons simply in order to alert our fellow human
beings.
There were many scientists in the early decades of this
century who thought that any social problems resulting
from their researches could somehow take care of themselves. Nobel thought he had made war unthinkable with
his discovery of dynamite. We have his famous remark to
his pacific lady friend:
On the day that two army corps can mutually extinguish each other in a second, all civilized nations will
surely recoil with horror and disband their troops.
I think that the active interest by the scientific engineering and technological community of Canada to the second
volume of our report indicates their sense of responsibility towards the establishment of a framework within
which rational science policies and priorities can be developed. There is an obligation also on the part of us, the
laymen, to develop more awareness of the nature of
science in order to become competent to make sound
judgments of many public policy issues.
Ralph Lapp, a scientist turned writer, states:
We are aboard a train which is gathering speed,
racing down a track on which there are an unknown
number of switches leading to unknown destinations.
Most of society is in the caboose looking backward.
Our committee bas recommended that we should start
looking ahead. Our committee has recommended that the
Economic Council should enlarge its activities and establish a special Committee on the Future with broad terms
of reference, and looking more specifically to 1985 and the
year 2000.

If I may, I should like to read from a release from the
Economic Council of Canada concerning the Senate's
recommendation. It states:
The Council agrees in principle with the recommendation and will devote more emphasis to the long-term
future in its work. As a first step, the Council will
concentrate on future technological change in the
broader context of the evolving social and economic
environment. In this work, the co-operation and support of interested organizations, departments and private institutions will be elicited.
The Gordon commission on Canada's Economic Prospects was one of Canada's only systematic and scientific
attempts to examine the distant future, but its work was
not continued. Canada needs a look-out institution broadly based to examine economic and social matters.
A growing number of scientists throughout the western
world are developing a more systematic approach to the
future. For example, there is a Commission on the Year
2000 of the American Academy of Arts and Science; a
Hudson Institute; a System Dynamic Group of M.I.T.; a
Committee for the Next Thirty Years in the United Kingdom; and both France and West Germany have an Institute of the Future. Nearly 100 major companies, including
Canadian companies, are taking part in the Hudson Institute's four-year study of the period from 1975 to 1985.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is a ten-year period.

March 28, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Thompson: René Dubos said that since we
make so little effort to study the long-range effects of
technological innovations, we are in fact practising, not by
intention but by inaction, a kind of biological warfare
against nature, ourselves, and especially our descendants.
Our commitment to the future does not just require the
gathering of papers by experts; it requires a collective
involvement. We must develop a grass-roots and actionoriented approach, if we want not only to predict but also
to control our future. That means that we have to enlist
the help of voluntary agencies. Organizations of all kinds
should become involved. We need, quite literally, to go to
the people with a question that is almost never put to
them: What kind of world do you want 10, 20 or 30 years
from now? In Future Shock Alvin Toffler states that "we

need to initiate, in short, a continuing plebiscite on the
future." Such local groups, in order to answer such questions, could and should be given the technical assistance
to provide data on the social and economic costs of various goals, so that participants would be in a position to
make reasonable, informed choices among alternative
futures.
There is a consternation that develops within a society
when it is out of control, and that consternation tends to
breed a disillusionment not only with science but with our
institutions and our traditional values. There is a tendency to withdraw, to become apathetic, resigned and
cynical.
Dr. Jay Lipton of Yale University gave a series of talks
over CBC radio in January of 1969. In those talks he
stressed that the overriding significance for every postHiroshima generation is that they feel trapped and suffocated by technology.
Let me say that we could be the first country in the
world to develop such a broadly-based Commission on the
Future. That is why we are asking for this. That is why we
recommended it to the Senate. We see the Senate as the
suitable body for this. It is not, as some people suggest,
just an institution of the past but an institution concerned
with the present and with the future. Of course, the commission should be made up of as many private and public
organizations as possible, because we believe that not only
should there be wide participatory democracy but also
wide anticipatory democracy. Therefore, our committee
recommended that the Senate sponsor a conference for
the purpose of establishing a Commission on the Future
whose responsibility would be to help as many private
and public organizations as possible to forecast, and to
build their future not in isolation but together.
It is interesting to learn that over 75 per cent of the
scientists associated with SCITEC responded in favour of
this recommendation. It is also interesting to note that Dr.
Alexander King of OECD singled out that particular
recommendation in his comments on the second volume
of the report. He said:
-I particularly welcome the proposals concerning the
establishment of a Commission for the Future to help
organizations, public and private, to build their
futures not in isolation but together. This may well
become an essential feature of all national science
policies. After all, there is normally a lag of at least
8-10 years between the conception of a new discovery

and its first application in the form of a new product
or a new process.
Honourable senators, I suggest that as Canadians we
can sometimes become rather pessimistic when we see
global trends going in a dangerous direction. But on the
other hand, if we are able to see the options ahead of us, I
am sure that, as a people, we will have no need to panic or
jeopardize science and technology and thereby deny ourselves the benefit that science and technology can provide. I believe that as Canadians we can invent our future.
I believe further that the Senate can lead the way to the
establishment of a Commission on the Future which
would be the first of its kind in the world.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Martin, debate adjourned.

SCIENCE POLICY
SENATE AUTHORIZED TO SPONSOR CONFERENCE TO
ESTABLISH COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of the honourable Senator Lamontagne, seconded by the honourable Senator Thompson:
That the Senate sponsor a conference to be held in
the Autumn of 1972 for the purpose of establishing a
Commission on the Future, whose responsibility
would be to help as many private and public organizations as possible to forecast and build their future not
only in isolation but together, as was recommended in
Chapter 13 of Volume II of the Report of the Special
Committee of the Senate on Science Policy;
That the Senate specifically assign the responsibility of organizing the said conference to the honourable
senators who are now members of the Special Senate
Committee on Science Policy and authorize the said
senators or a majority of them to incur such special
expenses in connection with the said conference as
may be necessary for the purposes of the said conference; and
That any such special expenses shall be deemed to
be special expenses within the meaning of and shall
be subject to the restrictions imposed by Rules 83A
and 84 of the Rules of the Senate.
[Translation]
Hon. Maurice Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I
would like first of all to thank from the bottom of my
heart those who participated in this debate and congratulated me in connection with the publication of
Volume II.
However, I would like to repeat again, as I have already
stated, that this volume is essentially the joint product of
the members of the committee.
[English]
Honourable senators, in proposing this motion I thought
that since the government is now in the process of implementing more than one-third of the specific recommendations contained in Volume II of our report it was about
time that this chamber should consider the only proposal
we are asking it to approve. I do not intend to make a long

SENATE DEBATES
speech, probably not more than five minutes, especially
following what Senator Thompson has said about its content and its substance.
The committee has come to the conclusion that the
setting up of a Commission on the Future is most desirable to serve as a foundation for a grass-roots movement
of anticipatory democracy in Canada, to make available
to as many Canadians as possible the research on this
subject which is growing so very rapidly in the world
today, and which the Committee on the Future now being
established by the Economic Council will carry out, and
finally to enable the special units on the future to be set
up by many individual organizations in our country, to
meet at the regional and national level, to exchange views
and to attempt to reach a consensus on the economic and
social future to form an international perspective.
This concept, as Senator Thompson has said, is new, but
the consultations we have had with many private organizatiôns in Canada up to now have convinced us that it
would really work, especially in a country like ours. However, because this idea is new, it is not likely to be realized
spontaneously without being sponsored by a responsible
organization.
In the course of its deliberations the committee rapidly
came to the conclusion that the Canadian Government
could not sponsor the creation of this proposed commission because we felt that it should be and should remain a
private institution. I should like to add, however, that I
have had discussions on the subject with the Honourable
Mr. Gillespie, Minister of State for Science and Technology, and he told me that the conference proposed in this
motion was an excellent and imaginative idea, and that he
would like to be associated as closely as possible with it.
On the other hand, when we were discussing this new
concept, we could not find any private organization that
was sufficiently representative of all the different and
varied segments of our society to take this particular
initiative. That is why we are now proposing that the
Senate, with its long-term view, and, as we say so often
here, as a chamber of sober second thought, is the best
base from which to take this initiative which would probably be without precedent in the activities of this chamber. But I cannot find any better reason for establishing
such a precedent than to sponsor a conference for the
purpose of creating a Commission on the Future which
will be, as Senator Thompson has said, a unique organization in the world and which will give a better opportunity
to the diversified elements of our country to meet and to
attempt to determine together their respective futures. We
have often been accused of being an institution of the
past; let us give to our nation another and perhaps more
vivid illustration that we can also be forward-looking and
that we can launch Canada on the difficult but inevitable
path of the future.
Some honourable senators may ask what will be the
cost involved in launching such an unprecedented operation. I wish I could answer this question by producing one
of those $1 items which were discussed this afternoon by
Senator Grosart and to which he is, quite rightly, strongly
opposed. I am quite prepared, however, to say that the
members of the Special Committee on Science Policy are
prepared to go through this new exercise if it is assigned
[Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

March 28, 1972

to us in the same conservative way as we have been
approaching our general terms of reference up to now. We
expect that the people attending the conference will pay
their own expenses. We may have to hire a few more
people because our present very limited staff will be fully
engaged during the coming summer in the preparation of
our next volume which I hope will appear early next fall.
According to our rules we will not, of course, spend any
money unless such expenditure shall have been approved
previously by the Senate Committee on Internal Economy. By this procedure the committee will continue to
exercise its well-established supervision of expenditures,
but there would be the usual additional guarantee that
financial responsibility would be preserved by the Internal Economy Committee.
I should like to underline that the investment involved,
if this motion should be approved, will be very small
compared to the benefits that Canada and the Senate will
derive from it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: In other words, the investment will be
small but the results will be great.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: That is what I said.
That is about all I have to say about this motion, but I
should like to add just one more sentence. My expectation
is that if this motion is approved, Senator Thompson,
young as he is, will live long enough to make another
speech in the Senate in the year 2,000 and then praise this
chamber for having approved in 1972 the motion which I

now propose on behalf of the Special Senate Committee
on Science Policy.
* (1650)

Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, at the
risk of delaying the Senate for a few more minutes, I
wonder if I might ask your indulgence to ask some questions of Senator Lamontagne; otherwise, this matter will
probably carry over to tomorrow.
I am sure that every honourable member of the Senate
supports the enthusiastic principles which have been
expounded by the chairman and so ably presented by
Senator Thompson in what I consider to be one of the best
addresses this chamber has heard in a long time. I feel
that before we give approval to this motion the Senate
should be advised as to two or three matters which are of
concern to me. First of all, I am concerned about the
relationship of the Committee on the Future and the Commission on the Future.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Perhaps we could proceed one
question at a time so that I do not forget my answer to
each question.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: The report indicates the proposal of
two committees, one of which, the Committee on the
Future, is to be established by the Economic Council of
Canada. Senator Thompson has referred to this fact, but
he did not say that the Economic Council was prepared to
support such a committee. He indicated that it approved
of this in principle. On the other hand, the Senate report
states that the commission is to be established to deal with
technical studies and forecasts prepared by the Committee on the Future. I am endeavouring to relate the cart to
the horse.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I feel that the release which
Senator Thompsan has referred to is an interim release. I
have had two meetings aiready with the chairman of the
Economic Council and I arn quite sure that the council
have accepted in principle our recommendation. However, they are going to meet later in April to launch this
operation. I understand that they will organize a committee of experts to look into the future on a multidisciplinary basis. It wiil flot be an expert organization of economists or sociologists alone, but it will include engineers
and systems anaiysts and anyone who can contribute
toward the forecast of the future. Their operation will be
weil under way in the near future.
However, the commission which we are proposing is
only, in part, related to this cornmittee. It will not be
involved in research. Its main purpose wiil be to induce as
many individuai organizations as possible in Canada to
organize their own units on the future and to provide an
opportunity for them to meet together and exchange their
views concerning the future and to arrive at sorne consensus. The commission will not be a research organization.
It wiil be a kind of dernocratic umbreila for ail the different organizations which wiil have established their own
units on the future. I would expect the commission, once it
is estabiished, to gather ail the growing literature which is
being produced throughout the world, in the United
States, Great Britain, Gerrnany, France and other countries. The Commission on the Future wiil, in a sense, be
cornplementary to the Cammittee on the Future which is
to be established by the Econornic Council of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The Commission on the Future would
bear its own financial costs.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I arn interested in the relationship
between this proposed commission and the Science Council of Canada and whether a liaison has been estabiished.
Some of the duties and responsibilities of the Science
Council of Canada invoive the deveioprnent and utilization of scientific and technoiogical manpower, long-term
planning, and technological research and develapmnent. I
want to be sure that the very important work which is
being done by the Science Council of Canada will not be
minirnized or interfered with in any way by this particular
commission.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I arn sure that ail honourable
senators are aware that the Science Coundil of Canada is
a government organization and its exclusive responsibility
is to give public and private advice, if it chooses to, to the
governrnent on science poiicy. It has nothing to do with
studies on the future. It has nothing to do with the kind of
grass-roots movement we are endeavouring to establish
among individual organizations in our country. I can
assure you that the two operations are completely
different.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: My last question invoives the financial aspect of this commission, and this is not only with
respect to funds for the conference which it is planned to
organize. 1 presurne the Senate would want to have some
contrai over that expenditure. This has been indicated by
the distinguished senator. I realize that this new arganization is nat involved in the financing of research. But,

nevertheless, there will be a fairly extensive overhead in
order ta carry out its functions. The report of the Science
Policy Cornrittee indicates the expectation of increased
contributions which are to be made by industry during
the next few years and the greatiy increased allocation of
funds for research.
How will this new commission be financed? Is it expected there wiil be some governrnent participation or will it
be financed through the industries and organizations
which are involved?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: My expectation is that the commission will operate on a relatively small budget, for its
main function wiil be ta endeavour ta sell this concept of
units on the future ta private organizatiails.
*(1700)

We know already that many organizations in Canada,
including industry, are very much interested, not only in
creating these units but also in this concept which would
give thern the possibility and opportunity ta meet. Sa we
expect that the budget of the commission itself will be
relatively small. We aiso expect that this budget wiil corne
from subscriptions rnade by the variaus organizations
which wiii be related ta the commission.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Thank you very much. I wish ta
canclude by sayîng that naturaily aur interest is ta make
sure that the calling of the meeting is not premature. In
other words, I want ta be canvinced that this f ail is the
tirne. I hope that the necessary liaison is taking place ta
ensure that it wouid be reasonably sure of success. If we
look forward ta a Senate participation in sponsoring this,
we want ta make certain that the resuits wili be up ta aur
expectations. If it is necessary ta wait until next spring
rather than this f ail in arder ta do the liaison and necessary homnework, perhaps this will be required. That is the
only reason I raise these questions.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Weil, senator, I can guarantee
you that this conference will be a success. We wiil take
every step ta make it a success. That is why I put the
motion so early, in order ta enable us ta begin the planning and preparation for this conference. If we feel as we
proceed that we wiil not be ready ta make it a success
next fail, then the honourable senator rnay rest assured
that we wiil delay the calling of the conference. The whoie
concept and success of the commission, which we hope
wili be the resuit of that conference, depends prirnariiy on
the success of the conference itself.
Motion agreed ta.

The Senate resurned from Thursday, March 23, consideration of the final report of the Speciai Joint Committee
of the Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, tabied in the Senate on Thursday, March
16, 1972.
Hon. Eug.ne A. Forsey: Honourabie senators, when I
was speaking an this report an Thursday last, it was ail

SENATE DEBATES
honey and butter. I was stating my strong approval of the
general tenor of the report. I was also speaking with
warm appreciation of the splendid work of particular
members of the committee. As those particular colleagues
listened to me or read what I had to say, they must have
felt that it was "Roses, roses, all the way and myrtle
mixed in their path like mad." This afternoon, I am sorry
to say, I am going to strike a rather different note,
because what I want to do today is to start at least-the
task may be a long one-but start at least on the points on
which I dissented from the conclusions of the report or
from various supporting arguments which it adduces for
those conclusions.
I am now beginning what I suppose might by courtesy
be called my minority report. There is no such thing as a
minority report in parliamentary usage, as I understand
it. However, a variety of members of the committee have
presented their dissenting opinions in writing. I decided to
submit mine rather in the form of a speech in the Senate.
The first thing that I take objection to is the very first
line in the first recommendation on the first page of the
report:
Canada should have a new and distinctively Canadian Constitution, ...
I shall deal with the word "new" in a few moments, but
first of all I want to deal with the implication that the
present Constitution is not distinctively Canadian. This is
historically false. I cannot conceive of anything that could
be more distinctively Canadian than our existing Constitution, even the basic written part of it, the British North
America Act.
In the first place, it is a distinctively and characteristically Canadian combination of a British and an American
tradition, of British and American elements. The federal
element is, of course, distinctively North American. It did
not come from Great Britain, it did not come from
France. You can scarcely even say it came from Europe.
True, there have been federations in Europe, but I do not
think that the federation that we set up here owed very
much, if anything, to European example. It owed something, a good deal, to the American example, the example
of the United States. To some extent it was a reaction
against the American example. The other part of our
Constitution, the basic principle of responsible cabinet
government is, of course, distinctively British. But this is a
distinctively Canadian blend. We take British elements,
we take American elements, we take French elements and
we blend them together into something that is distinctively Canadian.
Now, for some people the only things that are distinctively Canadian are things that have been here from time
prehistoric, the aurora borealis, the Canadian Shield.
This, it seems to me, is what they mean by distinctively
Canadian. To say, as I think we must, that our Constitution represents a blend of various elements, represents in
part a blend of various elements from other traditions or
other countries, is not to say that it is not distinctively
Canadian. It is merely to emphasize one particular part of
our distinctively Canadian way of doing things.
Besides, thanks to the defective teaching of Canadian
history in the schools in the last generation or so, a large
number of people are now quite unaware of the way in
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 28, 1972

which our present Constitution, the British North America Act, was drawn up. I found this repeatedly during the
sittings of the committee itself and it is only a few years
back that a jackass of an American reporter, writing in
the New York Times, declared that our Constitution,
which he grossly misdescribed in every other respect as
well, was imposed upon us in 1867 by British overlords. I
think it is necessary to say with all the emphasis at my
command that the British North America Act, except for
two very small points which I shall come to in a moment,
is exclusively the work of people from what is now
Canada and what was then properly described as British
North America, Canadian having in those days a narrower significance. The British North America Act is based
on the resolutions of the Quebec Conference of 1864 and
the Westminster Palace Hotel Conference of 1866-67. At
those conferences not one representative of the British
government was even physically present, and the resolutions which were drawn up were exclusively the work of
the British North American delegates who were present.
Not so much as one squeak, not so much as one whisper,
not so much as one hint in the resolutions came from the
British government.
* (1710)

The resolutions were drawn up. They were taken from
the London conference and were embodied in the British
act, and the legal draftsmen at the colonial office provided technical legal aid, which, I may add, in retrospect,
does not appear to have been quite as efficient or adequate as they thought it was.
What they professed to be doing and did with, on the
whole, reasonable success, was to embody in traditional
British parliamentary legislative language the conclusions
of the conferences held at Quebec and London.
The only things that you can find in the British North
America Act which owe anything at all to the British
government are two points:
First, the title of the country. The Fathers of Confederation wanted to call it the Kingdom of Canada, but the
British government was nervous about this. It was afraid
it would upset the people of the United States and the
Government of the United States. The British government
was naturally and properly anxious to avoid trouble with
the United States, especially as in those days war with the
United States was by no means the inconceivable thing
that it is nowadays. In fact, in the years just before Confederation there had been very serious risk of war
between Great Britain and the United States, as we all
know.
So the British government, shaking in its shoes, its
knees knocking together with fright, said, "Oh, you can't
call it the Kingdom of Canada. Oh, no, no, no, we can't do
that. You have got to call it something else." So Sir Leonard Tilley, reading his Bible that morning, as was his
custom, reading the 72nd Psalm, read, "He shall have
dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the
ends of the earth." It seemed to him almost literally a
heaven-sent solution to the problem of the title or name of
the country, because, after all, here was this new federation, this new nation, this new nationality, which the
Fathers of Confederation felt they were creating, which
would stretch from the St. Lawrence River to the Arctic,

March 28, 1972
March

1972

SENATE DEBATES

"from the river unto the ends of the earth," which was
already going to touch the Atlantic and which they confidently presumed would go clear to the Pacific-"from sea
to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth," the
very thing which is embodied in our coat of arms sculptured over the main door of this building, A mari usque ad
mare, from sea to sea. Here was this conception embodied
in the old Anglo-French word "dominion" which had
fallen out of use in French, but which was preserved in
English.
So the Fathers of Confederation went back to the British government and said, in effect, "All right, if we can't
have 'kingdom,' give us 'dominion,'" and the British government acquiesced. So our official title is not the word
"kingdom", which we wanted originally, but the substitute
word, "dominion."
It is worth noting, incidentally, that when the Secretary
of State for the Colonies presented this proposal to the
Queen-because the delegates at Quebec and London had
asked that the Queen should determine the style and title
of the new federation-he did so in a letter of February 7,
1867, to the Queen's private secretary, General Grey, in
the words:
It is a new title but intended to give dignity to the
federation, and as a tribute to the monarchial principle, which they earnestly desire to uphold.
In other words, he felt-and I shall come back to this at a
later stage-that the word "dominion" embodied the same
kind of principle as the word "kingdom," which they had
wanted to have as the original title of the country.
The second point on which the British government had
some influence was what is now embodied in sections 26
to 28 of the British North America Act. The original
proposals for federation contained no solution to the
problem, no provision for the problem, of an impasse
between the two houses. If the Senate threw out something which the House of Commons had passed, or vice
versa, then that was the end of it. The British government
was worried about this. It had had experience of cases in
which the House of Lords had rejected measures passed
by the House of Commons. It felt there should be some
kind of provision for getting over a deadlock between the
two houses, and it said so to the British North American
delegates and, in fact, proposed a provision which they
turned down.
After further negotiations, they came forward with
what is substantially embodied now in sections 26 to 28 of
the act, and said to the British government, "How will this
do?" and the British government said, "That meets our
objection."
Even there, what the British government proposed did
not get in. On the matter of the title of the country, they
proposed nothing, as far as the record shows. On this,
they proposed something which was turned down. The
two points therefore which were not embodied in the
original resolutions of Quebec and London by the British
North American delegates are points on which we have
got what our own delegates decided upon, not something
that was imposed upon us by Great Britain or anybody
else.
25312-18

There is one other feature of our Constitution where the
wishes of the British government did come into effect.
This is not to be found in the act itself, but in the letters
patent, because it is a matter of the Royal prerogative.
The British North American delegates proposed that
the prerogative of pardon should be exercised by the
lieutenant governors. They thought it would be too difficult to have it exercised by the Governor General in a
day when communications were so sparse, when it took so
long and was so hard to get from one part of the country
to the other. So they said it really ought to be in the hands
of the provincial lieutenant governors.
But the British government jibbed. They said, "This is
part of the Royal prerogative. It should be exercised only
by the direct representative of the sovereign. It should not
be exercised by mere officials appointed by the Governor
General, by subordinate persons" (as the Lieutenant Governors were intended to be), "representatives not of the
Crown but of the Governor General."
Of course, I am well aware that in the decisions of the
judicial committee of the British Privy Council-notably
in The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v.
the Receiver General of New Brunswick in 1892-the
judicial committee promoted the lieutenant governors
into representatives of the Crown for provincial purposes.
But the British government said, "This must be vested
in the representative of the Crown"; and that is where it is
vested. The power of pardon, except, of course, for purely
provincial offences, is vested in the Governor General as
representative of the Crown.
So when people talk about the British North America
Act being a British statute, which it is, and add that it is
something that was imposed by the British government or
the British Crown, they are talking through their hats. It
is a Canadian Constitution, almost 100 per cent Canadian,
99.75 per cent, you might say, if we get into the matter of
decimals as Senator Hayden did last night.
That is the first point that I wanted to make. I object
strongly to the implication that what we have now is not
distinctively Canadian. It may be good, bad or indifferent,
but to say that it is not distinctively Canadian is to fly in
the face of history, to fly in the face of fact.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Even with the obligation to go to Westminster for amendments to it?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: The Fathers of Confederation proposed to put nothing in it in the way of an amending
clause except under section 92(1), for the constitutions of
the provinces, except as regards the office of lieutenant
governor. Why they did not put in an amending provision,
I do not know. There are various surmises that various
people have made. I have made some myself. But they did
not put it in. It was not because the British Parliament
said they could not put it in. I see no reason to suppose
that if they had put something in the British Parliament
would have jibbed at it, and for this very excellent reason,
which anticipates what I was going to say later: Sir John
A. Macdonald-and I will give the quotation when I come
to the appropriate point-laid it down very firmly in the
Confederation debates in the Parliament of the Province
of Canada in 1865, that if the delegates had wanted to

SENATE DEBATES
separate entirely from Great Britain he was perfectly
certain that there would have been no difficulty
whatsoever.
The British Parliament and people, he said, would have
been very sorry but there would have been no intervention by the British Parliament or people to stop the federating provinces from seceding entirely from the British
Empire and breaking any connection with the Mother
Country. If he was convinced of that, as he most certainly
was, and he took great pains to state it very explicitly and
at great length and very emphatically, then a fortiori, I
think if anyone had said to him "Well, what about an
amending provision?" he would have said "Well, certainly,
if you want an amending provision we can have it."
As Senator Flynn has raised the question I will give the
house the benefit of my views, such as they are-and they
are substantially those also of the eminent constitutional
expert, Professor Alex Brady of the University of Toronto-on why there was no amending provision. In the first
place, they were not used to federation. In the second
place, they expected the provinces to sing very small
indeed. They were intended to be hardly more than glorified county councils. In the third place, they had been
accustomed-I see Senator Flynn shake his head. I am
prepared to argue that if he wants to. It is a little aside
from my main point of argument, but if someone wants to
argue it I will argue it, and argue it until the cows come
home.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I was thinking of the attitude of the
Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I am not talking about the Privy Council. There you have a British influence coming in, if you
like. There you have those old scoundrels, those old rascals, as my late friend Mr. Cahan used to call them, the
judicial committee of the Privy Council messing up the
work of the Fathers of Confederation. However, I do not
want to be deflected too much from my main argument.
The third thing was that the provinces had always been
accustomed, if they wanted an amendment to the Constitution, simply to get in touch with the Government of
Westminster and say, "This part is not working properly;
make an amendment." And the British Parliament, unless
it was something that trenched upon foreign affairs or
something of that sort, would say "Yes, certainly, sorry,
we made a mistake," or "We forgot about that." I think it
is perfectly evident that they clearly expected that they
could get an amendment to the Constitution any time they
wanted to merely by asking the British Parliament to
make an amendment, and that this is so is further substantiated by proceedings in connection with the first
formal amendment to the Constitution, the British North
America Act, 1871, where the executive government, without even reference to Parliament, asked the British Government to submit an amending bill to the Parliament of
the United Kingdom, and it was done. It was only when
the Liberal opposition of that day objected and said, "You
should have Parliament making this request, not just the
executive government," that the government turned
around and said "Oh, yes, sorry," and got an address
passed by the two houses, asking for what had already
been requested by the executive government.
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 28, 1972

Indeed, until 1907, on none of the amendments to the
British North America Act were the provinces even consulted. In 1869, when better terms for Nova Scotia were
proposed, providing for more money for Nova Scotia, the
Liberal opposition of that day in the person of the Honourable Luther H. Holton, if I remember correctly, moved
a resolution that this kind of thing should be done only
with the unanimous consent of the provinces. That resolution was heavily voted down in the House of Commons,
and voting against it was every one of the Fathers of
Confederation present at the time, eight in number.
Well, that has taken me a little aside from the next point
I wanted to make, which is the series of remarks which
are to be found here about the inadequacy of the present
Constitution. It is inadequate in certain respects, I am
prepared to admit. Indeed, much of what the report proposes subsequently is an indication of that. But the tone of
the committee about the inadequacy of the present Constitution is patronizing to an insufferable degree. The
Fathers of Confederation are, as it were, gently patted on
the head. We are told, for example, at page 7 of the report,
that it was adequate enough-this is the British North
America Act-"Although the Constitution of a Colony is
not an adequate constitution for a nation"-and I will
have something to say about that colony and nation business in a moment-"the British North America Act could
not be said to have been a failure." How very kind! How
very condescending on the part of the members of the
committee towards the Fathers of Confederation! "It was
an adequate enough Constitution for the Canada of 1867perhaps, the only possible Constitution of that day." Once
again, "Children you did really, really well; with your
little box of blocks you did not do too badly, and you
mustn't feel hurt if we say that it is not quite an architectural masterpiece."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: They should be very proud to think that
this Constitution is, after all, the oldest written Constitution that exists in the world.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I do not see the point of that
interjection.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am saying that in any event, even if we
recommend a new Constitution, the Fathers of Confederation should be proud that this old Constitution that has
to be renewed is probably the oldest written Constitution
that exists in the world.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Yes, that is a very useful point that
Senator Flynn has made; a valuable one.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: The American Constitution is
older.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I think Senator Flynn said the oldest
British Constitution or the oldest Constitution of the British type, the American Constitution being, of course, an
American version of what the French thought the British
Constitution was in the eighteenth century. It was already
rather out of date when they adopted it. It put George
Washington in the place of George III. He did not get the
title he wanted, "Lord High Mightiness," but he was put in
the place of George III. Ours is a more modern version of
a more modern British Constitution than that. However,
at page 7 the committee says:

March 28, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

In taking the position that Canada needs a new Constitution now, we are far from criticizing what our
statesmen have wrought in the past.
Well, I must say that I think as the Fathers of Confederation in the Elysian fields listen to that, if they are listening to the report of the committee, or if they are reading it
by some sort of superphysical process, I must say I think
they will be allowing a gentle smile, a somewhat sardonic
smile, to pass over their faces.
We are told also that a constitution should be a mirror
of a people and an inspiration to a people. That, I think, is
at page 6:
A constitution ought thus to be both an inspiration
and a mirror for its community.
Well, perhaps so; I do not know. I am a little dubious
about whether it is the business of a constitution, primarily at least, to provide memory work for school children or
thrills, whether for children or grownups, and I am not
very sure how far any constitution can be a mirror of the
people for whom it is devised. After all, a constitution is
an instrument of government. It is a framework for government. If you look at the Constitution of the United
States, for example, you do not find very much there
really that you could call a mirror of the United States. If
you called it such now it would be a most distorted mirror.
Think of all that eighteenth century mumbo-jumbo of the
Electoral College, one of the most signal examples of the
fact that the United States Constitution is really a sort of
eighteenth century sedan chair of a constitution, which
only the political genius of the Americans manages to
manoeuvre through modern traffic. Just think of that.
Then look at the American Constitution. What do you get
in the way of inspiration? Of course, you get the Bill of
Rights. In a sense you can call that inspiration, and I
suppose to some extent you can call it a mirror of the
American people. But look what you get in the body of the
original Constitution itself:
* (1730)

... in order to form a more perfect Union, establish
justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the
common defence, promote the general welfare, and
secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
posterity, We the people of the United States do
establish.
That's pretty good, solid, practical, pragmatic eighteenth
century English inspiration. "Justice," "domestic tranquility," "common defence," "general welfare," "blessings
of liberty." Nothing very high-fallutin' or high-flown
about that; nothing very rhetorical about that. Pretty
plain, homespun, eighteenth century English common
sense.
We are told that we should have something very inspiring in this. I do not know quite how you would draft an
instrument of government, apart from a preamble, which
has its uses, that would be very much in the way of
inspiration. If you can get a good preamble, all right,
provided you do not import into it too much in the way of
contemporary ideas which will appear hideously dated to
our descendants. There is always that risk.
The British North America Act, we are told, really had
no feature of this sort. Here it is on page 6:

25312-18l

The measure of the inadequacy of the British North
America Act is that it does not serve Canadians fully
as either a mirror of ourselves or an inspiration or
ideal. As enacted in 1867, it did not attempt explicitly
to set forth any values or goals of that time, except to
adopt "a Constitution similar in Principle to that of
the United Kingdom."
That is not strictly accurate. It did also embody explicitly
the idea of "peace, order and good government." And not
a bad ideal either. It stands up pretty well to "domestic
tranquility," "common defence" and the rest, in the
preamble to the Constitution of the United States. "Peace,
order and good government." The word "order," by the
way, was the British Colonial Office's substitute for the
original "peace, welfare and good government," which the
Fathers of Confederation had wanted to have.
If you look at the time when the British North America
Act was drawn up, more particularly at the time when the
Quebec resolutions were adopted in 1864, and compare
with what the British North America Act said we wanted,
what was going on in the United States at the time, it
seems to me you have got a very explicit ideal set forth. It
seems to me that you have also a very stark contrast with
what had been going on in the United States, and, I might
add, in some sense what is going on there now. "Peace":
there was no peace in the United States in 1864. "Order":
there was disorder on a gargantuan, colossal, titanic scale:
the war between the states, the Civil War. "Good government": over a large part of the territory of the United
States the writ of the central government did not run at
all.
It seems to me that as the Fathers of Confederation
looked across the border at the chaos which reigned south
of the 45th parallel of latitude and the St. Lawrence River,
they might well have said, "We have a pretty good ideal
embodied here in the words 'peace, order and good government.'" And the other ideal, which even the committee's report admits, was also a pretty good ideal, was
parliamentary cabinet responsible government-the most
delicate, the most flexible, the most efficient form of
government that the world has yet found, and the one
most responsive to the public will; far, far, far ahead of
anything the Americans, or for that matter any ruddy
republic in the whole world has ever discovered. I trust
that the word I used then, that good English slang word, is
not unparliamentary. If the Speaker so rules, of course I
should be glad to withdraw it and substitute the word
"crimson," which I presume is prefectly parliamentary.
What we have embodied in those two phrases, "peace,
order and good government," and "a Constitution similar
in principle to that of the United Kingdom," is the ideal
which the Fathers of Confederation set up, which I think
is still a good one, the ideal which was summed up by
Tennyson in two historic phrases: "Freedom slowly
broadening down from precedent to precedent," and
"That sober freedom out of which there springs, Our loyal
passion for our temperate kings."
The report, in one of the early chapters, chapter 3,
observes that the Imperial power of London over Ottawa
in the act is a defect. Well, the Imperial power of London
over Ottawa as set forth in the act was even then fairly
slim, fairly narrow. I have found a tendency among uni-

SENATE DEBATES
versity students in recent years to get the idea that in 1867
we had not responsible government; that the Governor
General was, to use the New England phrase, the horse
and cart and the dog under the wagon. Of course, this is a
travesty of the fact. Responsible cabinet government in
everything relating to our domestic affairs was already
nearly 20 years old in most of the colonies, though somewhat less in Newfoundland. It had been established in
Nova Scotia in February 1848, and somewhat later in the
year in the Province of Canada.
The Imperial power, such as it was in the act, grew
steadily smaller, and rapidly smaller. I think one must
remember the stupendous labours of the Honourable
Edward Blake in 1876, when he was Minister of Justice, in
getting the royal instructions to the Governor General and
the Royal Commission substantially altered in the direction of greater autonomy for the Dominion of Canada.
The report also points out that the British North America Act can still be amended by the British Parliament.
Yes, of course it can. But first of all that is the result of
our own failure to agree on any amending formula. The
British Government and the British Parliament could not
care less; they would be delighted to be rid of this job of
acting as a rubber stamp for what Canada asks for. That
is all they have been doing for a very long time in the
matter.
The other thing is that it is explicitly set forth in the
Statute of Westminster, which is now more than 40 years
old, in section 4 of that Statute, that no law of the United
Kingdom henceforth will apply to any of the dominions
defined in the act, Canada being one of them for the
purpose of the act, except at the express request of the
Parliament of the dominion concerned. So the British
Parliament is, in fact, unless it repeals the Statute of
Westminster, which nobody in his right mind, I think, will
suggest, debarred by its own action from making any
amendment to the British North America Act except at
the request of Canada.
Then there is a reference to the Imperial power of
disallowance of acts of the Parliament of Canada. That is
said to be anachronistic. Yes, of course it is. The last time
it was exercised, and the only time it was exercised, was
in 1873. It is now constitutionally obsolete. It has been
recognized for the last 43.years, officially and formally
recognized, that it is constitutionally obsolete. As I say, it
has been used only once, and that almost a hundred years
ago.
Curiously enough, there is no reference to what I should
have thought was the at least equally obnoxious feature of
the act, the power of the Governor General to reserve bills
of the Parliament of Canada for the Royal pleasure. That,
in fact, was exercised rather longer, down until 1886. It
has never been exercised since. In 1929, the Conference on
the Operation of Dominion Legislation, which declared
the power of disallowance constitutionally obsolete, said
that the power of reservation was constitutionally
obsolete, and added that either of them, or both of them,
could be removed from the constitutions concerned any
time that the parliaments concerned asked for it. If we
want to have those vestigial remainders, those vermiform
appendixes of our Constitution, removed by a surgical
operation, all we have to do is ask the British Government
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 28, 1972

to submit an amending bill to the British Parliament for
that purpose.
Then there is the reference to the dominion power of
disallowance of provincial acts, which has been exercised
112 times, and exercised upon acts of every province of
Canada except Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island,
and exercised last in 1943. There is the statement that
retention of that power of disallowance would make a
mockery of the distribution of governmental power in
Canada. I take leave to contest that statement. Once
again, there is no mention of the power of reservation by
lieutenant governors of provincial bills, although that has
been exercised 70 times, and exercised until 1961. But
whether that means that the committee just forgot about
this, or whether it means that it thinks preliminary reservation of provincial bills still has its uses-as indeed it
may-I do not know. I suspect it was a mere oversight, a
mere lapse of memory.
* (1740)

I want to say here-and this might be described as a sort
of sub-dissent, a secondary dissent-that I am not prepared to admit that the power of disallowance of provincial acts ought to disappear from our Constitution.
Perhaps I should be prepared to admit it if we succeeded in embodying a comprehensive and well drafted bill of
rights in the Constitution; but unless we get that as a quid
pro quo for the abandonment of the powers of disallowance and reservation of provincial legislation, I am very
reluctant to see those powers disappear, even though they
have not been exercised in recent years and even though
probably the failure of the Diefenbaker government to
exercise them on that wicked, vicious, outrageous,
totalitarian legislation of the late and unlamented government of Newfoundland in 1959, even though the Diefenbaker government's failure to exercise these powers on
that occasion has probably driven a nail into their coffin,
even so, I am not prepared to admit that it is altogether
desirable that they should disappear.
We have had, in my lifetime, some of the weirdest and
wildest provincial governments that the mind of man
could conceive. I refrain from naming names. It is a great
Canadian tradition that you must not name names, you
can only hint. You may, to use another New England
phrase, "Come as nigh to it as a pig's snout is to his
squeal," but you must not name names. Any honourable
senator of my age, or older, will readily call to mind
instances of what I have just mentioned, the wildest and
weirdest provincial governments. We have seen provincial
governments which have threatened the stability of credit
in this country and which have ridden roughshod over
fundamental human rights and freedoms.
I am sorry to say that, in some instances, the government here did nothing about it. In others, it showed an
extraordinary zeal, very heartening to a Marxist, in disallowing legislation which touched the fundamental economic interests of the ruling powers in society, but was
extremely coy and reluctant to do anything about invasions of human rights such as the infamous "Padlock
Act" of the Province of Quebec.
It seems to me perfectly clear that there may be
instances in which a provincial legislature can do things
which go far beyond the interests of the province con-

March 28, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

cerned. It is easy enough to say that if the people of the
province do not like it they can turn the government out in
the next election; but in a great many cases a provincial
legislature, operating completely within the ambit of its
jurisdiction, can pass acts which can most fundamentally
affect the interests of people outside the province
altogether. And those people have no redress, then, under
the present Constitution, and they might have very little
redress even under a Bill of Rights, except by operation of
the dominion power of disallowance and the lieutenant
governor's power of reservation-which, incidentally,
might be even more useful than disallowance. Disallowance comes after the damage has been at least partly
done: reservation might even prevent it being done.
We are told also that the British North America Act was
drawn up as the constitution of a colony. I want to draw
attention to the fact that the word "colony" is one that was
very rarely used by the Fathers of Confederation, about
the federation they were setting up. On the contrary, the
word "nation" was constantly on their lips, "a new
nation," "a new nationality," "a new and great nation,"
"une seule et puissante nation," "une nouvelle nation."
The French-speaking Fathers of Confederation were just
as emphatic on this as the English-speaking Fathers.
I want to remind you again that the Fathers wanted to
call this country the Kingdom of Canada; and they
wanted to have the Queen give it the title, and possibly
give it a viceroy, not merely a governor general. The
Fathers of Confederation were extremely emphatic on
this.
If you look at the words of Edward Blake, the great
leader of the Liberal party from 1880 to 1887, and one of
the greatest constitutional lawyers this country has ever
produced, you will see what he had to say on this point.
I took the trouble of mentioning Blake's qualifications,
because I have been horrified to discover, recently, that a
great many of the contemporary political people and their
officials have not the ghost of a notion who Blake was.
This nearly knocked me off my perch. I had not supposed
that anybody engaged in public affairs, with any reasonable degree of elementary knowledge of the Canadian
Constitution and Canadian constitutional history, would
not be aware of who Blake was. However, live and learn.
Blake said in 1876, when he was asking for the changes
in the Royal instructions to the Governor Generalchanges which would expand the autonomy of the country-he said very emphatically:
Canada is not merely a Colony or a Province, she is a
Dominion composed of an aggregate of seven large
provinces united under an Imperial Charter.
He contrasted strongly the words "colony" and "dominion," just as the Fathers of Confederation had contrasted
the words "colony" and "nation." One of them, I think it
was-I do not know now whether it was either Cartier or
Macdonald, said we have the chance to rise from a group
of insignificant colonies to become a great nation, worthy
to take our place with the nations of the earth. Yes, here
we are, here is the quotation, Macdonald in the Confederation Debates,page 43:
To take our position among the nations of the world,
(instead of being) broken up into a number of insignificant colonies.

And he added:
Our alliance will be worthy of being sought by the
great nations of the earth.
Then he added, on the next page:
The colonies are now in a transition state. Gradually a
different colonial system is being developed and it will
become year by year less a case of dependence on our
part and of overruling protectionNote the word "protection" which was very important in
British North America in the 1860s-of overruling protection on the part of the Mother
Country and more a case of a healthy and cordial
alliance. Instead of looking upon us as a merely
dependent colony, England will have in us a friendly
nation, a subordinate but still a powerful people.
You can say that there was an element of a colonial
attitude in that, as indeed there had to be, considering the
situation at the time. But when people talk to me, as one
witness did, before the committee, about Sir John A.
Macdonald and his colleagues having a colonial mind, it
makes my blood boil. I said to that gentleman, who was an
Old Countryman, though not actually English, I said to
him, rather rudely, I fear: "Well, at all events, whether he
was colonial minded or not, Sir John A. Macdonald had a
healthy dislike of what he called 'overwashed
Englishmen.'"
I get tired and sick of hearing this kind of talk about the
Fathers of Confederation being, as it were, merely a lot of
mixed up kids with a dreadful sense of colonial inferiority. The record does not bear it out. Look at what Creighton says in his Life of Sir John A. Macdonald.
You will find Sir John actually, when he was proposing
to set up the high commissionership in London, talking
about the relationship of Canada to Great Britain as being
somewhat analogous to that of Hungary to Austria, and
that was just a short time after the famous Ausgleich of
1867, which set up the dual monarchy of Hungary and
Austria as associate states-to use the language of the
St-Jean Baptiste Society of Montreal. They were to be
separate powers with only certain very limited common
matters, foreign affairs and finance and, I think, customs
tariffs under the control of a joint authority.

e

(1750)

Actually, you had, therefore, Sir John talking in 1880 or
1881, just before the establishment of the high commissionership, of the relation of Canada to Great Britain in
those terms, and he talked of the high commissionership
as a quasi-diplomatic position.
Well, so much then for this nonsense about our present
Constitution not being distinctively Canadian. If ever anything ever was distinctively Canadian, it is. Possibly we
can now produce a new or revised constitution which will
be even more distinctively Canadian, although I think we
shall have our work cut out for us to do it.
Now I want to turn to this other thing that comes at the
very beginning, that we must have a new constitution.
There are a variety of statements on that point.
First of all, on page 1, we have the statement that the
constitutional imperative that we must have a new constitution came to the committee from the views expressed by

SENATE DEBATES
very many Canadians in all parts of the country. It says
on page 1:
-the views expressed to us by very many Canadians
in all parts of the country, as well as our own analysis
of ideas and events, have convinced us that Canada
needs a new constitution now.
And then a bit later:
The need for a new constitution has been amply
demonstrated.
And then if you turn to page 7 you find the words:
Moreover, the people now want a new constitution.
At this point I want simply to say that in all the hearings
at which I was present and, as far as I can judge from
reading the record, in the other hearings, the amount of
demand by the people for a new constitution was pretty
small. I think that if you put it all together it would not
cover fiv.e pages of the record. You had a great many very
able and learned experts on the Constitution saying they
thought we did not need a new constitution. Certain
amendments, yes. Specific amendments, yes. But not a
new constitution. I think that statement that the people
now want a new constitution is simply not warranted by
the evidence which came before us. I am almost inclined
to say that the drafters of the report, in effect, constituted
themselves the three tailors of Tooley Street: "We the
people of England."
"The people now want a new constitution." I do not
know where the evidence for that is. Of course, if you talk
about the people who came before us and said they
wanted to get out of Canada, if you talk about the separatists and say that these are the people who want a new
constitution, then you are in another universe of discourse. I do not think they want a new constitution. They
merely want to get out. That is all.
It is just as if Northern Ireland became a part of the
Republic of Ireland and decided afterwards that they did
not want to be a part of the Republic of Ireland any longer
but wanted to get out. That would not constitute a
demand for a new constitution of the Republic of Ireland.
That would merely constitute a demand for secession.
Well, we did hear a good deal about secession; a good deal
about separatism. That to me is not a demand for a new
constitution.
If you say, oh, well, really, you know, they are not
saying that everything has to be done all over again from
scratch; they are not saying that you have to start with a
tabula rasa, a clean sheet, and produce something absolutely brand new; no, they are not. They speak of using
parts of the old constitution.
More remarkable still, if you go through the substantive
proposals of the committee and add them all together, it
seems to me very dubious whether you can call them a
new constitution. I do not think you can-not by the
committee's own definition. It says on page 7 at the very
end of chapter 3:
The present constitution needs a fundamental recasting. It needs to be rethought and reformulated in
terms that are meaningful to Canadians now.
Well, I do not see anything in the substantive proposals
of this report that constitutes a reformulation, a funda[Hon. Mr. Forsey.j

March 28, 1972

mental recasting or a rethinking. What you have got is a
large number of very sensible substantive proposals
which would give us a revised constitution. They are
sensible in the main, although there are a few that I
should jib at.
The committee says:
The limited goal of "constitutional review" established by the first Federal-Provincial Constitutional
Conference in 1968 has long been outmoded.
I cannot agree with that. I do not think there is any
ground for saying so. It seems to me that the very sensible, specific proposals made by the committee, which do
not in my judgment involve a rethinking, a reformulating
or a recasting of the Constitution, but merely some
improvement to the existing Constitution, it seems to me
that those particular proposals are adequate. They are
well substantiated. They are supported by a large body of
evidence and they can be argued on a reasonable basis.
The statement that Canada needs a new constitution,
and must have a new constitution, and have it now is
nonsense. And the proof of that is the committee's own
substantive proposals.
I would add this: that it not only is nonsense but it could
be dangerous nonsense. Nothing is more dangerous than
to give people the idea that they are going to get something far beyond what in fact you have any intention of
giving them. And if you say, "We must have a new constitution fundamentally recast, fundamentally rethought,
reformulated-tararara-boom-de-ay," you are going to
awaken in the minds of a great many unthinking people
the notion that you are going to have something ganz
neues, as the Germans say, completely new, and you are
not-not if these proposals are adopted. You are going to
have something revised, improved, amended. But, if you
give people to understand that they are going to get something which they are certainly not going to get if these
proposals are adopted, then you just give ground for
every tub-thumper, blatherskite, demagogue and cocksure jackass that happens to be loose in the country, and
heaven knows there are enough of them of various kinds
and descriptions. So that is my first and main objection.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: If I may interject, did you not say
you had fifteen objections? I cannot anticipate that this
interesting discourse of yours will be completed by six
o'clock. May I suggest, therefore, that you adjourn it yourself? As you know, we have sat all afternoon. We like to
hear you, but you could start all over again tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Not fifteen, eight or ten. I am perfectly
prepared to do that, Senator Choquette. In fact, I was
about to add that before I proceeded to any other specific
part of this I should like to suggest the possibility of
adjournment of the debate. However, it may be that there
is some small point that I can make before six o'clock. It is
possible that that is so. Let me look at the notes which I
have put down here for my guidance. Yes, there is one
small point that I think I can make very briefly.
There is a proposal in the committee's report on the
subject of the Bill of Rights, at page 20, to which, in
common with the members of the New Democratic Party
on the committee, I object. I think it is superfluous, to say
the least. The proposal is:

Mirch 28, 1972
March

28

1972

SENATE DEBATES

The right of the individual person to the enjoyment
of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the public good and for just
compensation.
The proposal is that that should be included in the Bill
of Rights. I think that is unnecessary. I adopt the words
which were used by the two New Democratic members of
the committee, Mr. Brewin and Mr. Rowland, where they
say:
History has demonstrated that similar efforts to protect property have been used by courts to frustrate
legislative supremacy in relation to social questions.
In our view the Bill of Rights should be confined to
human rights and should not attempt to protect property rights.
I think anybody who is acquainted with the history of
judicial procedures and decisions in this country and in
other British countries, other countries of the British tradition, is bound to come to the conclusion that the rights
of property will be amply protected by the courts under
the existing provisions of the ordinary law. That particular provision, therefore, I find myself in disagreement
with. I do not think it is a matter of enormous importance,
but I did want to say that on this particular proposal-and
there is one other to which this applies also-I find myself

for once in association with some of my old friends I knew
in the days when I and they were in the CCF.
0 (1800)

This is a good place, from everybody's point of view, for
me to ask for the adjournment of the debate. I am sorry
that I am going into this matter in such detail, but I think
it fundamental to do so because there are so many misconceptions abroad and so much misinformation abroad
on this subject, and so many foolish ideas being trumpeted by ignoramuses up and down the country that I think it
essential to set forth certain views which it seems to me
are more sensible than some of those that I hear proclaimed even, alas, in certain unfortunate, defective parts
of this report.
If I may adjourn the debate now, I should like to say
that next time I propose to discuss the question of the
monarchy, on which I take the strongest possible objection both to the proposals of the report, for a change and,
perhaps even stronger objection-if it is possible to be
stronger than strongest; very strong objection at all
events-to the means by which it is suggested the matter
should be settled, namely, a plebiscite. I can think of no
worse, more ineffective, more foolish and, indeed, more
dangerous way of dealing with this subject than by means
of a plebiscite.
I should like to ask permission to adjourn the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Forsey, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

ROYAL ASSENT
NOTICE
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that he had
received the following communication:
GOVERNMENT HOUSE
OTTAWA
29 March 1972
Sir,
I have the honour to inform you that the Right
Honourable Gérald Fauteux, P.C., Chief Justice of
Canada, in his capacity as Deputy Governor General,
will proceed to the Senate Chamber today, the 29th
day of March, at 5.45 p.m., for the purpose of giving
Royal Assent to certain Bills.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Louis-Frémont Trudeau

Assistant Secretary to the Governor General
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate
Ottawa.

PARLIAMENT HILL BILL
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-78, respecting the use of the expression "Parliament
Hill".
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, with
leave of the Senate, I move that the bill be read the second
time now.
Honourable senators, Bill C-78, an act respecting the use
of the expression "Parliament Hill," is a short, concise,
private bill, that was presented by a very distinguished
and senior member of the other house yesterday. In
perusing the records of the House of Commons I find that
five speakers took part in the discussion on second read-

ing and in Committee of the Whole, and there was
unanimity from all quarters in the house in support of the
bill. Therefore, it is a pleasure for me to have the privilege
of introducing the bill here. It is my hope that we can deal
with it as expeditiously as the other place did, in the hope
that it could become law later today, if senators see fit.
As I said a moment ago, the bill is straightforward,
consisting of three clauses. The main purpose of the bill is
to preserve the description "Parliament Hill" to this area
of Ottawa, Parliament Hill, and to prevent the use of this
expression for any other purpose.
I have been informed that on two or three occasions
recently attempts were made to use the name "Parliament
Hill" in a commercial sense. It is my understanding that
one of our new hotels, recently completed in this city,
attempted to use the name. There was general concern on
the part of people, not only in Ottawa but in other parts of
Canada, about the use of the words "Parliament Hill." A
farm close by Ottawa used this term in registering some
of its purebred cattle over the last year or so. There is also
a sporting clothes store in Ottawa which is using the
name.
It seems to be the wish of this house and of the other
place that the name "Parliament Hill" should be preserved for the area of Parliament Hill. When this problem
was brought to the attention of the people using the name
commercially, some of them graciously withdrew from
the use of the name that they had adopted for their
commercial enterprise. I feel that they, along with all
Canadians, would be happy to see this expression preserved for Parliament Hill itself.
0 (1410)

It would not be my intention to send the bill to committee, as there are only three clauses in it. The first and
second clauses outline the powers of the bill and how
anyone who disobeys this law, if it becomes law, can on
summary conviction be penalized. The third clause of the
bill limits the power so f ar as the members of both houses
of this Parliament are concerned. I recommend the bill to
your consideration in the sincere hope that we will be able
to proceed with it through all of its readings today so that
it may become law before our Easter recess.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, with the
exception that one fact seems to have been overlooked in
the drafting of this bill, I would have been happy to agree
with the suggestion of the Deputy Leader of the Government that this bill receive its three readings today and
then royal assent at 5.45 this evening, because I am in
complete agreement with the purposes of the bill. The fact
which has been entirely overlooked in the other place, but
which is of considerable significance, is that the words
"Parliament Hill," although they have been used traditionally to describe the federal Parliament site, have also
been used to describe the Quebec Parliament site. If we
were to pass this bill the way it is written now it would
mean that those words could not be used to describe the
site of the provincial Parliament of Quebec.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

I am not in the least opposed to the views expressed by
the sponsor of the bill, but I do think it would be a
mistake, an error at least so far as diplomacy is concerned, if this bill were to be passed without some consultation or some amendment.
In the short time that I had at my disposal to consider
this bill this morning, I was, after some discussion, able to
come up with an amendment which I will put forward in a
few moments. First, however, I want to indicate to the
Senate that clause 1, paragraph (a) says:
1. Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act of
Parliament or regulation thereunder, no person shall
use the words "Parliament Hill" in combination
(a) to describe or desigriate a property, place, site or
location other than the area of ground in the City of
Ottawa bounded by Wellington Street, the Rideau
Canal, the Ottawa River and Bank Street,
Moreover, the sponsor of the bill has indicated that it is
the desire to prohibit anyone from describing, for
instance, a farm by the words "Parliament Hill." Therefore, by virtue of clause 1, paragraph (a), we would prohibit the use of "Parliament Hill" to describe the Parliament site in Quebec City. I doubt that this was the
intention of the sponsor of the bill. I know it passed three
readings in brief order in the other house, but that does
not mean a thing. This is indeed one instance where
second thought is useful, and that is why I suggest that we
should agree some time before 6 o'clock to an amendment
along the lines of the one I am about to suggest, or that we
should refer it to a committee. I would have no objection
one way or the other.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Do you have a copy of your proposed amendment?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I have it here and I shall pass it over to
you when I have dealt with it.
I would add as subclause (1) of clause 1 the following:
Nothing in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this
section shall be deemed to prohibit the use of the
expression "Parliament Hill" where it is currently in
use as the description of the premises occupied by the
legislature of any province.
That would cover the case of Quebec City and the sites,
where applicable, of other provincial legislatures. It
would certainly meet the objections that might be raised.
You can readily realize what would be the feelings of the
members of the National Assembly in Quebec if we told
them they could not use the name "Parliament Hill" in
reference to the site of the Parliament buildings in
Quebec.
If it is acceptable, honourable senators, we can deal
with the matter in this fashion, but otherwise I would
have to suggest that it be referred to committee or else I
would have to refuse-and I do not want to do this-leave
to proceed with third reading.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, if I might say
a word at this stage, I must admit I was never aware that
the Parliament buildings in Quebec City were referred to
as "Parliament Hill." I think the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Flynn) has a valid argument. I wonder if we
could leave this matter until later this day because I

would like to have an opportunity of consulting with the
sponsor of the bill in the other place. I would do that
immediately if we could agree to revert to this matter
later this day.
Hon. Alan Macnaughton: Honourable senators, perhaps
I might make a suggestion at this point. I am not at all
sure that every parliament is located on a hill; it could be
a square or an area of land with another designation. So if
you restrict the use of the word "hill"-and here I am
thinking of Victoria, British Columbia,-perhaps the
people who are charged with drafting this could consider
one or two other words in association with the word "hill."
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I
wonder if there might also be a restriction on the use of
the word "parliament" rather than simply on the words
"Parliament Hill."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: In combination?
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Without combination. To me it
would be just as obnoxious to have a "Parliament Hotel"
as to have "Parliament Hill Hotel" or the "Parliament
Night Club" or "Parliament 'Bodeeshop"' or whatever it is
that they have in Ottawa. We did the same thing with the
use of the word "royal" a few years ago. I wonder if
Senator McDonald could inform us as to whether they
have considered the word "parliament" as well as the
word "hill."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There are cigarettes called "Parliament."
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Some consideration has been given
to it. There is, as Senator Flynn said, a brand of cigarettes
called "Parliament."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And there is a cigar called "House of
Lords."
Hon. Mr. McDonald: There is also a sauce called "H.P."
which stands for "Houses of Parliament." And if you look
at the English-speaking nations of the world you will find
this expression used in many instances. I believe if you get
involved to that extent, it would be a rather sticky wicket.
* (1420)

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: We could not make this retroactive
any more than we did the word "royal."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Oh yes, we can.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Normally you would not wipe out
the word "parliament" from Parliament cigarettes. However, you could prohibit its use in the future.
Hon. Mr. Cook: There is a good whisky known as
"Houses of Lords."
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I am a
little bit surprised and amused that this controversy
should arise over the use of the words "Parliament Hill,"
because strictly speaking, of course, no provincial legislature has the right to call itself a "parliament." I know the
Ontario legislature started it.
The late Dr. Beauchesne, that eminent, unsuccessful
Conservative candidate and authority on parliamentary
procedure, wrote a learned article many years ago which
pointed out that a legislature had no right to call itself a
parliament. The British North America Act says plainly

SENATE DEBATES
that there is to be "one parliament for Canada." Various
legislatures have usurped the title of parliament for themselves. The Legislature of Quebec, of course, rectified this,
in part, by calling itself the National Assembly. Perhaps a
solution would be for the people in Quebec to change the
name to "La colline du parlement" to "La colline de
l'Assemblée nationale"-I don't know. But I cannot help
feeling a certain amount of amusement over this tempest
in a very curious kind of teapot.
Hon. 1. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, so that we
can be properly confusedHon. Mr. Flynn: You do not need to rise after Senator
Forsey has spoken.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Just in case the sophistication of Senator Forsey's remarks may have missed the Leader of the
Opposition, I feel I should make this comment. First of all,
I am not sure that we have a constitutional right to designate the use of the words "Parliament Hill" unless they
have had proprietary right under a trademark. This has
been suggested. However, I feel that even more important
than that, the legislation is badly worded. Clause 1 says:
Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act of
Parliament or regulation thereunder, no person shall
use the words 'Parliament Hill' in combination
(c) in association with a commercial service rendering establishment.
I would suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Government
that if this legislation is to be returned to the other place
that the words "in association with a commercial service
rendering establishment" should be amended to read, "in
association with a commercial establishment" so that we
avoid giving examples of bad syntax and questionable
grammar to our children.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate adjourned until
later this day.
ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT ACT

BILL C-172 (TEMISCOUATA)-FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-172, respecting the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, with
leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 44(l)(f), I
move that the bill be now read the second time.
Honourable senators will recall that a few days ago we
had four bills similar to Bill C-172 dealing with the changing of the names of federal constituencies. This constituency is represented by Mr. Gendron in the other place
and he is anxious, because of the attitude of the people
whom he represents, to have the name changed from
Témiscouata to Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata.
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 29, 1972

My understanding is that this is the second time this
proposal has been made, and that the former member for
the constituency had the name changed prior to the last
redistribution. However, when the independent commission made a decision that there should not be double-barrelled names, of course, the name reverted. It is the wish
of the present member and the people of the area to revert
to the name that was first brought in during 1958-62, or
around that time, namely, Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I have
already expressed my views with respect to this type of
bill, but I do not recommend that we give different treatment to this from that given to other bills. The only point I
wish to add is that I know the riding pretty well, having
spent something like 15 or more summers there. In fact, I
have been going there since 1930. We used to call it Témis.
I met the member, Mr. Gendron, at lunchtime and suggested that he might compromise and change the name of
the riding to Témis, in lieu of Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata. In any event, it would be unfair, I suppose, to
delay the passage of this bill, since we have passed the
others on division. I think we should let it pass on division.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Unless we make it Jean-François
Pouliot.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That would be even more verbally complicated but, historically speaking. probably better.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the honourable
Senator McDonald, seconded by the honourable Senator
Bourget, that this bill be now read the second time.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On division.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time, on division.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: With leave, now.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the honourable
Senator McDonald, seconded by honourable Senator
Bourget, that this bill be now read the third time.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On division.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed, on
division.

INTERNAL ECONOMY
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SENATORS TO ACT
BETWEEN SESSIONS AND PARLIAMENTS-DEBATE
ADJOURNED
Smith moved, with leave of the Senate and
Hon. Donald
notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(h):
That during any period between sessions of Parliament or between Parliaments, the Leader of the Gov-

275

ernment in the Senate and a senator to be named by
him from time to time and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, or a senator to be named by him
from time to time, be authorized to act for and on
behalf of the Senate in all matters relating to the
internal economy of the Senate; and
That within fifteen days of the commencement of
the next ensuing session there shall be laid on the
Table, by or on behalf of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, a report covering in reasonable
detail all matters relating to the internal economy of
the Senate arising during any such period.
The Hon. the Speaker: With leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(h), it is moved by the honourable Senator Smith, seconded by the honourable Senator
Carter, that during any periodHon. Senators: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Allister Grosart: I was hoping that His Honour the
Speaker might read the motion again, because it was my
impression that the motion contained no reference to His
Honour the Speaker. Am I correct in that?
Hon. Mr. Smith: That is correct. The motion does not
include His Honour the Speaker, because in the past it has
never been the practice to include His Honour as a
member of this interim committee. This is the usual
procedure in the present circumstances, when we are
faced with a long adjournment and the possibility of other
events between now and June 1973.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: There used to be three.
Hon. Mr. Martin: There are now four, one to be named
by the Leader of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Grouart: Your Honour, I had not completed my
remarks to the motion. I asked a question. I would now
like to suggest that regardless of the fact that this may be
the usual format, the Senate should reconsider the matter
at this time.
Surely the role of His Honour in the administration of
the affairs of the Senate has both a constitutional and a
practical aspect which should be considered in turning
over, in effect, the internal economy of the Senate to
honourable senators, no matter how distinguished, who
do not have the overall responsibilities that naturally fall
to His Honour the Speaker.
I am not suggesting an amendment at this time, but I
hope there might be some discussion or explanation as to
why His Honour the Speaker is not included in this very
important interim committee.
Hon. Paul Martin: There is certainly no objection to
that. I had nothing to do with the framing of this, but I
suspect-I may be wrong in this, and we could let this
stand until later this day so that the point I am about to
suggest might be examined-that our situation is that the
Speaker of the Senate, like the Senate itself, in the event
of certain eventualities is no longer functus officioHon. Mr. Flynn: He becomes functus officio.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Martin: -whereas in the other place there
seems to be a difference in that arrangement. However, if
this constitutional explanation has any validity, then that
would be the explanation, but so that it can be examined
we could let this matter stand until later this day. If that is
not the reason, or if there is not another good reason, then
we might give consideration to the point that Senator
Grosart has made.
I would suggest, if it is agreeable with Senator Smith,
that we let this stand until later this day so that the reason
can be examined. I suspect that is the legal reason.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I would hope that the examination
that might take place in the interim would go beyond the
point I made, and would consider the suggestion made by
the Leader of the Government as to the lapse of what I
believe he called functus officio for His Honour the
Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That applies to the whole Senate. In
other words, the Senate and the Speaker might become
functus officio. I think that is what the leader means. We
lose all authority if the house is dissolved. This is a difficult problem, I agree.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am not suggesting that the house is
going to be dissolved. I am not dealing with that issue.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I know that; you are too careful.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I say, if there is a difference
between the continuing role of the Speaker in this place
and the Speaker in the other place, then that is something
we should examine. Unless my memory and information
are incorrect, an essential part of the functioning of Parliament, certainly in the other place, is the continuing role
of the Speaker as, if I may use the term, the operational
housekeeper in those matters that may necessarily come
up even during dissolution.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We will examine that matter.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Perhaps Senator Forsey may be able
to inform us as to the status of the Speaker of the other
place in that kind of eventuality, and I would suggest, if
there is a difference in the status of the two Speakers, that
perhaps we should examine it and correct it. There are
matters which come up even during dissolution-and I
can recall some myself-when the Speaker of the Senate,
perhaps in relation to a visit by distinguished visitors, has
a very essential role to play. To suggest that because
Parliament is dissolved the Speaker of the Senate ceases
to have the constitutional right to act in that capacity
seems to me to be quite absurd.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, my recollection is that in the other place the position of the Speaker in such circumstances is governed by statute, although
I am not absolutely certain of that. I see the Leader of the
Government thinks that is so.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You are right.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I should have thought that the position
of His Honour the Speaker of this place in such circumstances might be regulated by the terms of his commission, because, after all, the Speaker of the Senate is a
Crown appointment. I should have thought that the terms
of his commission would set forth the period for which he
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

March 29, 1972

was appointed. Whether the appointment is for the period
of a single Parliament or during pleasure I do not know,
but I should have thought the commission might have
shed some light on that.
* (1440)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: During pleasure.
The Hon. the Speaker: Before I ask honourable senators
if this motion should stand until later this day, I might just
point out that the appointment of a Speaker in the Senate
is by virtue of an order in council which stands, as far as I
am aware, until another order in council is passed
appointing another Speaker. These are things that might
be verified.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, perhaps I
might, with your leave, make one or two points. I will not
speak for more than a minute or so, because this matter
will be considered later. In view of the misunderstanding
that perhaps arose out of the kind of motion it is, I should
like to say, more particularly for the information of our
newer senators, that there is a distinct difference, in more
ways than one between the offices of the Speaker of the
Senate and the Speaker of the House of Commons.
As His Honour the Speaker has just pointed out, one
difference is that he is appointed by an order in council,
whereas the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected
by all members of the House of Commons, and he is the
first commoner who is charged with being the impartial
person to look after the interests and housekeeping of the
House of Commons. He personally is chairman of the
Internal Economy Commission, and it is in his executive
position, which covers a great many areas, that he runs
the whole show, if I may use that slang expression.
He is charged with a very great responsibility. Whether
it is by practice or by statute I do not know, but I recall
that after quite a number of elections I have observed,
whether there is a change of government or not, that the
Speaker of the other place has some function during an
interregnum, which is recognized. He carries on, because
he is the chief executive, looking after the hiring of staff
and getting ready for the new Parliament. He can hand
over those functions only when the new Speaker is elected
by the House of Commons.
We save our Speaker the embarrassment of having
responsibility on the Standing Committee on Internal
Economy, Budgets and Administration, although in the
last year or so His Honour the Speaker has been kind
enough to invite us to hold our meetings in his chambers,
where he offers us the best coffee in town, at no extra
cost.
When we try to pass direct responsibility over to the
office of our Speaker, I think we are doing something that
should not be done. I believe it would be acceptable if the
Leader of the Government in the Senate commenced the
practice of inviting His Honour to act on that committee
which may sit during long adjournments, recesses, and so
on. His Honour the Speaker is as interested in our welfare
as anyone else. Perhaps this suggestion should be spelled
out, and we could talk about it later on. I would like to see
it taken under advisement. I do not think we should try to
impose on His Honour other responsibilities than those
that are his as an equal of all honourable senators.

March 29, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

There are certain implications in this, and because of
that fact we speak to each other in the fashion we do. We
do not address Mr. Speaker; we address each other,
although His Honour very often brings us to order, and
we thank him for it. I hope that what I have said is
helpful.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: I think we have complicated this
question by bringing in the name of the Speaker. I have
sat on this group from 1958 until very recently. It was able
to deal speedily with urgent matters that arose between
sessions. Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) sat on this
group, the members of which were chosen, as much as
possible, from those living in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Smith: Yourself included.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I will put myself last. There was
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West), Senator Power, who was
writing his book in Kingston but spending most of his
time in Ottawa, and myself. Quite often we were called
upon to sign resolutions, or to meet urgently and deal with
matters here.
It is not my wish to say to His Honour the Speaker,
"Stay out of this," but if we have four members who can
be called upon to deal with urgent matters between sessions we will be doing very well, and will not complicate
things by asking His Honour to stick around Ottawa,
Quebec City, or Montreal and be available on short notice.
I think that was the purpose of this interim committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I wonder if I might intervene again. I
think Senator Choquette has, out of his practical experience, perhaps suggested a way out. I have before me a
communication on this point made by a very distinguished law clerk of the Senate, W. F. O'Connor, who was
parliamentary counsel to the Senate, and whose reputation is, of course, known. Speaking of the office of Speaker, he said:
The Speaker is, in a sense, a two-way conduit
whereby access is had to the Senate Chamber from
the outside and from the Senate Chamber to the outside. In the Senate Chamber, the Speaker, as first
among equals, performs duties at the opening of Parliament, during sessions of Parliament and at the closing of Parliament which are so familiarly known that
I need not recite them. Outside the Senate Chamber
his office accompanies him and dignifies him but the
history of that office as disclosed in the Senate
records shows from their beginning that in deference
to that very dignity which attaches to his office he
should be protected from responsibility for or in connection with matters of administrative detail. This has
been done by express committal of such matters to
others. Those who have the responsibility of administration, however, ought to, and do, confer with the
Speaker upon matters which touch the administration
of his office, and he has the indubitable right to
approach those so responsible, to suggest to and to
reason with them. They, in their turn, although in the
last analysis supreme within their ambit of authority,
should be considerate of and defer to the views of the
Speaker when they are adhered to concerning any
matter that touches the administration of his office.

It seems to me that these words of the former distinguished law clerk of the Senate are not without relevance
to this discussion, and when we are considering this
matter later this day perhaps these observations of Mr.
O'Connor might be borne in mind.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I just make this
further comment. When Mr. O'Connor's observations are
considered in the discussion that may ensue on this point,
will it be remembered, first of all, that Mr. O'Connor was
describing a situation that has changed very greatly?
Secondly, of course, Mr. W. F. O'Connor could be wrong,
as the Leader of the Government will remember in the
famous advice he gave in a case in which Windsor was
very much involved.

But that is not the point. The point is that we should not,
I think, rely too greatly on the opinion given about the
status of the role of His Honour the Speaker at that time,
because clearly it and many other traditions and customs
of this chamber have changed in the meantime.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would the honourable senator excuse
me, I have to leave the chamber at the moment.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate adjourned until
later this day.
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD
STORAGE FACILITIES AT SASKATOON-QUESTION
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, in the
City of Saskatoon the Quaker Oats Company has
announced that it will cease milling operations in the near
future. This will leave unused grain elevator capacity of
about 2 million bushels. I would ask the Leader of the
Government to inquire of the minister in charge of the
Wheat Board if these facilities can be utilized for grain
storage, or put to any other use that may benefit the grain
industry of Saskatchewan, and, if so, what action the
government has taken or will take.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, the Leader of
the Government has been called out of the house to
receive a very urgent message. I am sure my honourable
friend will be satisfied if at this time I ask him to give me
a copy of the question. If it is possible, I will ask the leader
to have it answered before the end of this day, since the
house may not be sitting for a few weeks.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Thank you. I shall do that.

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
CONSIDERATION OF FINAL REPORT OF SPECIAL JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
the final report of the Special Joint Committee of the
Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution of
Canada, tabled in the Senate on Thursday, March 16,
1972.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, this after-

noon I want to start in on the subject of the recommendations of the committee on the monarchy. I believe I have
left my copy of the committee's report upstairs. I took it
back up there last night. Does anybody happen to have a
copy? I took it up last night for the purpose of verifying
something for the Hansard reporters. Perhaps a page
could go up to my office and get a copy of the report
there. C'est le volume bleu; il y en a plusieurs. I can start
in, however, without the advantage of having it before me.
The report gives an uncertain sound on the subject of
the future of the monarchy in Canada. It also suggests a
method for dealing with the subject of keeping the
monarchy or replacing it by something else, unstated,
unspecified, simply described in very vague terms as a
Canadian head of state.
I take strong objection to the recommendation of the

report, that the monarchy should, in due course, be
replaced-because that is what it appears to say, though
in quavering and halting tones-and I take objection also
to the proposed method of dealing with it by what is

called a popular consultation, which I take to mean a
plebiscite.
The first thing I want to say about the existing
monarchy in this country is that the fact that it exists is
once again our own decision. It is not something that is
imposed on us and it is not something that was adopted in
a fit of absent-mindedness by the Fathers of Confederation or because they were colonial minded or because they
were stupid or because they were ignorant. It was deliberately adopted by the Fathers of Confederation, unanimously, and with their eyes wide open.
Here is what Sir John A. Macdonald said on the subject
of Resolution No. 4 of the Quebec Conference, which is
substantially embodied now in section 9 of the British
North America Act. At page 34 of the original edition of
the Confederation Debates, Sir John said, on this subject:
If therefore, at the Conference, we had arrived at the
conclusion, that it was for the interestAnd observe the word "interest," not "sentiment," not
"tradition"-"interest."

March 29, 1972

A severance, of course, from the United Kingdom, the
British Crown.

-I

am sure that Her Majesty and the Imperial Parlia-

ment would have sanctioned that severance.

That resolution (on the Executive authority) met with
the unanimous assent of the Conference. The desire to
remain connected with Great Britain and to retain our
allegiance to Her Majesty was unanimous. Not a
single suggestion was made, that it could, by any
possibility, be for the interestObserve the word "interest" again.
-of the colonies, or of any section or portion of them,

that there should be a severance of our connection.
And Sir George Etienne Cartier, at page 59, observed that
the Americans, and I quote directly:
... had founded Federation for the purpose of carrying out and perpetuating democracy on this continent;
but we, who had the benefit of being able to contemplate republicanism in action during a period of
eighty years, saw its defects, and felt convinced that
purely democratic institutions could not be conducive
to the peace and prosperity of nations. We were not
now discussing the great problem presented to our
consideration, in order to propagate democratic principles. Our attempt was for the purpose of forming a
Federation with a view of perpetuating the monarchical element. The distinction, therefore, between ourselves and our neighbours was just this: -In
our
Federation the monarchical principle would form the
leading feature, while on the other side of the lines,
judging by the past history and present condition of
the country, the ruling power was the will of the mob,
the rule of the populace.
In another place, which can be found at page 50 of the
Carleton edition of the Confederation Debates, Sir
George said:
We all desire to live under the British Crown.
Now, that does not settle the question of whether we
should or should not have a monarchy. Obviously, it does
not.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It was said over 105 years ago.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: It deals only with the single point that
it is sometimes alleged that this was something that we
had no say about. We had our say and it was a unanimous
say and a unanimous verdict in favour of the monarchy at
that time, among the Fathers of Confederation. Anyone
who wants to challenge this, let him produce the records
to challenge this or to challenge the assertion of Sir John
A. Macdonald, that the desire of the Fathers of Confederation on the subject was unanimous. I have never seen
any evidence to the contrary.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No one is challenging this. We are trying
to find out what is the will of the people today, not what it
was 105 years ago.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Sir Robert Borden once said that the
quality most required in a Prime Minister is patience. If
the honourable Leader of the Opposition will just have a

Government or the Leader of the Opposition or Senator
Beaubien or my friend Senator Molson, who actually are
physically, shall we say, biologically, the inheritors of
these two traditions. Nevertheless, I do feel this very
strongly. I have always felt proud of the French past as
well as the British past of this country. I have always felt
that these two inheritances were part of the Canadian
tradition. They are not by any means the whole of it. We
have added to them. We have modified them. We have
changed them. We have improved upon them. We have
borrowed from other traditions and doubtless we shall do
so again, and more. But these, to my mind, are a part of
what it means to be a Canadian.
Some people are just tone deaf to history. They are tone
deaf to the glory and the message of England and of
France and of Scotland and of Ireland. I think that that is
a great pity. I think they are missing something. I think
that it means that their Canadianism is not as deeply
rooted as it might be. The tendency nowadays to despise
our roots and to insist that we must start afresh from
nothing, it seems to me, is a dubious tendency. A people
which forgets its roots, which loses its roots, is a people
with a very doubtful prospect before it.
Some years ago a versifier who shall remain anonymous put the theory of "pure" Canadianism-"pure" in
quotation marks-in these terms, somewhat sardonically:

point.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I will never be Prime Minister, I can
assure you.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: It could sometimes be a useful quality
for a Leader of the Opposition as well. However, the
single point I am making now is that this was our own
decision. Do not let anybody start this claptrap about how
it was imposed upon us, how the Fathers of Confederation were just a set of jackasses who did not know what
they were doing.
The next point I want to make is that another objection
that is often made nowadays to the retention of the
monarchy is that it is part of our British heritage. This
objection rolls off me like water off a duck's back. The
civil law of Quebec is a part of our French heritage: it is
not the same as the law of France, but it is based on the
same principles as the law of France. Similarly, our
monarchy is not the same as the British monarchy-as
anybody can see by looking at various aspects of it-but it
is based on that. Certainly it is a part of our British
heritage. But this does not worry me in the least. The
common law, which is the basis of the civil law of the
other provinces, other than Quebec, is another part of our
British heritage. The whole basis of our constitutional law
and our criminal law is part of our British heritage. We
got these things, whether we like it or not-it is a sheer
fact of history-we got them from Great Britain; not from
the Laurentian Shield, not from Paris, not from Rome, not
from Budapest or Berlin or Vienna; we got them from our
British heritage.

ed of an expression of Dr. Healy Willan, the composer,
who in a moment of exasperation once referred to such
people as "the intelligentsia, though God knows why
they're called so."
We are tired of this kind of thing. We do not see any
reason why we should be spoken of as if we were mere
commuters from London or Edinburgh or Dublin or Cardiff. A great many of us have our roots in this country and
on this continent a very long way back. Our colleague
Senator Rowe, for example, can trace his ancestors back
on the soil of what is now this country, the Province of
Newfoundland, for nearly 400 years-about 350 years.
People like myself can trace their ancestors back for 200
years or thereabouts in this country and for 300 years or
more on this continent. We do not feel we are commuters.
We do not feel we are Englishmen, Scotsmen or Irishmen
who just happen to live on this territory and who owe our
allegiance to England, to Scotland or to Ireland.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Mine only goes back 150 years.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: We are tired of having this kind of
thing thrown at us, and we have had it over and over
again. We are tired of being told that we must forswear
our heritage and that all the perfumes of the Laurentian
Shield will not sweeten the Anglo-Saxon hand.
I must point out that I have never yet heard any of these
people in the intelligentsiaHon. Mr. Thompson: May I ask the honourable senator a
question? You say you are tired of being told this. Who is
telling you this?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: His strawman. He always has a
bunch of strawmen, you know. There is always a man he
meets on the corner somewhere and he demolishes him
and then he goes off on a tangent again.
If you are going to talk about the monarchy, then stick
to that. I do not want to have to dictate to you, but please
stick to the subject.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: If there are any honourable senators
who do not like the way I am developing my argument,
they are perfectly at liberty to leave. These things, I think,
need to be said and I propose to say them. This has
something to do with the monarchy, because it is attacked
on the ground that it is a part of our British heritage, and
I am dealing with that particular point. I am not going to
say very much more about it. I can only say to Senator
Thompson-excuse me for pointing, I should not have-I
can only say to Senator Thompson that he has evidently
been much luckier than I have. I have been moving in
academic circles to a considerable degree for some time,
and I can assure him that among a great many of the
academic people this is exactly the kind of thing that I
have encountered again and again and again. The avantgarde people, or the people who think they are avantgarde; the "progressive"-in quotation marks; the enlightened people! This is the kind of thing I have had from
them again and again and again. And I am sick of it. I
think there are other people in this country who have had
it and I think they are sick of it. I might add that the
people I am talking about are English-speaking people.
They are members of the English-speaking intelligentsia,
the English-speaking academics. I am not talking about

seem to ask the French-Canadians or the UkrainianCanadians, like my friend and colleague Senator Yuzyk,
to forswear their heritage or hang their heads in shame,
and groan and lament the fact that they have not got a
purely Canadian ancestry reaching back to the days when
the first immigrants arrived here from Asia ten thousand
years or so ago. They are never asked to forswear their
heritage, but we are. Again and again we have been asked
to do this. So, I have no apologies to make for the British
origin of the monarchy, any more than I have for the
French origin of the civil code.
a (1510)

Now, to something that may meet with a little more
approval from some honourable senators and may appear
more to the point. First of all, why change? What solid
reason is there for changing from the existing system to
something different? A great deal can be said on this, but
I am going to try to be rather brief about it. My feeling
about any legislative change is that it has to prove its case.
I have no belief whatever, and never have had any belief
whatever, in change for the sake of change. If something
is working reasonably well, why on earth, with all the
things we have to deal with that are not working reasonably well, why on earth fiddle and mess about with something that is working reasonably well? If somebody can
show me something that the present monarchical system
in this country is doing that is really harming, substantially harming, anybody in the country, then that is another
question. I have never heard it yet.
Then the second question I want to ask is: Change to
what? Here again we are left very much in the air, as,
indeed, I think the Prime Minister pointed out when discussing this matter some little time ago on the public
platform. There are 57 varieties of republic to choose
from, and in fact that is probably an understatement of
the number. I do not know what we are going to be asked
to replace the monarchy by, whether it is a Maoist republic, a Nasserite republic, a Soviet republic, a Gaullist
republic or a republic à la United States, or a republic
such as they have in India. I would presume that the
committee, if it has any views on this subject-it is a little
coy about it-thinks of something along the lines of a
parliamentary republic such as they have in India. But
there is nothing very definite about this. I do not know
what title would be given to the presiding officer of the
possible replacement of the monarchy. I have heard it
suggested that he might simply be called the Governor
General, but I do not know how satisfactory that would
be. A high personage in the Department of External
Affairs told me that when the present Governor General
was making his tour of various countries as the Canadian
head of state, the Department of External Affairs was
embarrassed by the fact that his title was Governor General, that people wanted to know where he came from and
who he was governor generalling for. They found this
very difficult. But, if you preserve the title, it seems to me
that you will have exactly the same difficulty and,
anyway, I am not really terribly worried about whether
foreigners misunderstand our institutions or whether they
do not; I am more worried when our own people misunderstand them. I do not see why we should go around
changing our institutions just to please, to tickle the ears

March 29, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

of, foreigners, or to make it a little easier for them to
understand something.
As for the business of the method of change, the suggestion is that the matter should be dealt with by "a popular
consultation." Now if I am right in thinking that that
means a plebiscite, I think it is just about the worst
possible way that we could deal with this. As things stand
at present, let me remind honourable senators, we can
abolish the monarchy tomorrow by a simple act of the
Parliament of Canada, just as easily as we can pass the
bill which came up to us today and which has been
deferred until later, just as easily as we can pass a bill
amending the Criminal Code, just as easily as we can pass
a bill for the abolition of the Senate or for the reform of
the Senate. There is no difficulty about it. The proposal
that the committee makes is apparently that there should
be some kind of plebiscite before any such action is taken.
I venture to point out that we have had experience of
two national plebiscites in Canada. One was in 1898 on the
subject of prohibition, and the other was in 1942 on the
subject of freeing the Mackenzie King government from
its pledges in regard to conscription for overseas service.
In both of those cases the majority in the country as a
whole voted one way, and the majority in the Province of
Quebec voted the other way. In the first case the result
was nothing; the thing was just consigned to limbo and
never heard of again. In the second case, as we all know,
very considerable difficulty followed, and the fact that
there had been a plebiscite, I think, did very little to ease
the difficulties, and I think that is putting it mildly.
Now it seems to me that quite possibly you might have,
if you held a plebiscite on this subject, a very large
majority in the country as a whole, or a small majority in
the country as a whole, for one course, and perhaps a
large majority or a small majority in a considerable segment of the country-perhaps the Province of Quebec,
perhaps the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario, or perhaps
the Prairie provinces, I do not know-a majority the other
way. And it seems to me that this would have a divisive
effect.
What better have you got to suggest? One suggestion
that I think was made in the committee was that we
should leave the thing as it was; leave it to Parliament to
decide; let the two houses after due deliberation decide
what they want to do. Then you will make the decision
with some idea of what you are going to put in its place,
rather than submit to the people in a plebiscite the question, "Do you want to retain the monarchy?" They do not
know in the least what you are going to put in its place, or
at least they may not know, since there is nothing on the
actual ballot paper to tell them, and they may have to
make up their minds, after a fashion, in ignorance of what
they are really deciding. Some of them might say, "Well,
we don't want to retain the monarchy," but if presented
with the alternative which appeared to be satisfactory to
Parliament, they might say, "Oh gosh, we didn't realize
that that was what we were letting ourselves in for. We
don't want that. That is worse than the monarchy."
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask Senator Forsey a question?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Certainly.

Hon. Mr. Martin: You said that the decision could be
taken by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Was any consideration given in the
committee as to the position of the legislatures in the
provinces? If there was, or if there was not, what is
Senator Forsey's view as to the legal and constitutional
participation of the provinces in such a matter?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I do not think that any consideration,
to the best of my recollection, was given to the question of
the position of the provinces in the matter. I should suppose that if we passed an act here repealing section 9 of
the British North America Act, the provinces also would
cease to have a monarchical system of government,
because the lieutenant governor being then appointed,
presumably still, by the head of state, whatever he was
called and however he was chosen, would no longer represent the Crown. He would represent something else; I do
not know just what, a president or what-not; or it might be
provided that he should be elected by the provincial electorates. There might be a number of consequential
amendments which would probably have to go with the
repeal of section 9 of the British North America Act.
The other point, however, is that possibly the provinces
should have something to say in a change of this magnitude, as some people at least consider it; and it is noteworthy, I think, that in the proposals for constitutional
amendment embodied in the Fulton-Favreau formula and
again in the proposals in the Charter of Victoria, the
provinces were to be given a distinct say in the matter.
Anybody who cares to look up either of those documents
will see exactly what was proposed. But certainly the
provinces-in the one case one-third of the provinces with
half the population, and in the other case, with the complicated machinery provided, a certain number of the
provinces-would have had a veto on any change in this
matter, anything affecting the office of the Queen or the
Governor General or the lieutenant governors, in the Victoria charter formula.'It seems to me that there is very
good ground for asking why on earth we should not leave
this question to be handled by the process of constitutional amendment proposed in the Victoria charter.
0 (1520)
I am very reluctant to support anything on the subject
of constitutional amendment which runs counter to the
proposals of the Victoria charter, and I am opposed for
what I consider to be substantial reasons. For one thing,
the proposals embodied in the Victoria charter were the
products of long, intricate and difficult negotiations
among the various governments concerned and they
represented some kind of tentative consensus, at least, of
those governments' views. In the second place, I am particularly uneasy about setting aside those proposals in
favour of something adopted by even so good a parliamentary committee as this. The people who drew up the
Victoria charter were people of great experience, most of
them with very considerable experience, in the responsibilities of government.
The provincial leaders who were assembled were people
who, I think it may safely be said, knew from long experi-

SENATE DEBATES
ence how the people of their provinces felt, or at least they
had a pretty good idea how they felt.
By contrast, I have looked at the membership of our
special joint committee on this matter and have found
very few members who had had any experience in the
responsibilities of government. As far as my memory
serves me-and I may have omitted somebody because I
have forgotten exactly who was in the various cabinetswe had three members who had been in cabinets of the
Dominion of Canada: the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Senator Maurice Lamontagne, and the Honourable
Walter Dinsdale from the House of Commons side. As far
as I know, we had only two members of that committee,
Mr. Fairweather and Mr. McQuaid, who had been members of provincial cabinets. There were three members on
the committee when it reported, who had been in dominion cabinets and five out of thirty who had any experience
as ministers of either dominion or provincial cabinets.
There were another 64 people who were also listed in the
report who sat on the committee at one time or another.
But of those, only two members, Senator Connolly
(Ottawa West) and the Honourable Marcel Lambert from
the House of Commons side, had experience in the
responsibilities of government.
I think it is rather rash for people on a committee such
as ours, most of whom have had no experience in the
responsibilities of government, however wise and however learned they may be, I think it is rather rash for them
to set aside the considered verdict of the people at the
Victoria conference in favour of some other method, and
it seems to me a very risky method, of effecting any
change that may be deemed desirable.
That we have the power to change is undoubted. We can
get rid of the monarchy tomorrow if we want to. If we
leave the Constitution the way it is, we can get rid of it by
a very simple process, the ordinary process of legislation.
I am against the attempts to get rid of the monarchy for
the reasons which I have indicated, and I could expand at
great length on this. But, thank heaven, I shall not.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask Senator Forsey another
question which, in a sense, is kindred to the question
which I asked earlier, and which is relevant to the last
observation? What is Senator Forsey's authority for
saying that the act proposed could take place by an act
only of the Parliament of Canada? Surely, section 9 of the
B.N.A. Act does not give exclusive authority to the federal
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Section 9 of the British North America
Act does not give exclusive authority to anybody. But as
far as I can make out, it is not one of the parts of the act
which still remain subject to formal amendment only by
the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It seems to me
quite clear that it comes within the ambit of section 91(1),
an amendment of the Canadian Constitution, except in
regard to matters which are specified. Indeed, I think this
is one reason why the exception was made, both in the
Fulton-Favreau formula and in the Victoria formula: to
remove from the Constitution this exclusive power of the
Parliament of Canada to do this, just as at present the
power of the Parliament of Canada can abolish the
Senate. But it was not deemed desirable either in the
Fulton-Favreau formula or in the Victoria formula that

March 29, 1972

this should be done without the provinces being involved
in the matter. This was the considered decision of these
mature and responsible statesmen of long experience in
governmental responsibilities.
I hesitate to set up my layman's view of the meaning of
any part of the British North America Act as against the
view, however tentative, of members of the Bar, and especially one as eminent as the Leader of the Government.
But this is my opinion, for what it is worth.
Hon. Mr. Martin: No, I was not suggesting that.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Now I pass on to another subject, the
recommendations in regard to the Senate. I am not wildly
enthusiastic about these recommendations. However, on
the whole, I think they are reasonable. I feel they are
about as good as we can get, and I feel there is good
argument to be made for them. I think it is safe to say that
there were certain leading members of this committee
who had quite different ideas on the subject at first; and
what emerged was something of a consensus after some
rather drastic modifications of certain proposals which
had been submitted by leading members of the committee. I was quite happy with the original proposals, or
moderately so in any event. And I am reasonably happy
with these proposals, with one exception, and that is the
proposal that the retirement age for senators be lowered
to 70. If anybody says, "He is just afraid of being put out
on his ear in a couple of years," I reply that the report
makes it perfectly clear that it does not apply to existing
senators, so I can regard this with an air of complete
detachment.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Can we be sure of that?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I am against this principle of retiring
people from such offices at the age of 70. I expressed my
dissent from the change in the tenure of judges, other
than those of the Superior Courts, last session I think it
was, when the same provision was inserted, that judges
should retire at 70. I think it is a very dubious proposition
indeed. I would like to point out that Mr. Gladstone was
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the age of 85;
Sir John A. Macdonald was Prime Minister of this ccuntry at the age of 76; Sir Charles Tupper was Prime Minister at the age of 75; Sir Wilfrid Laurier was Leader of the
Opposition at the age of 77; Mr. St. Laurent was Prime
Minister at the age of 75.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think he died at the age of 79.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Sir Wilfrid Laurier was 79?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: When he died, yes. I like to pit my
memory against yours occasionally.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I hope you will and will look it up.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I will look it up.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: He was born late in the year 1841 and
died early in 1919, which would put him in his 78th year. I
checked on most of these matters in the Parliamentary
Guide.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Well, I am closer to his age than you are.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Bien, c'est une bagatelle; ce n'est pas
grand-chose.

SENATE DEBATES

He was reasonably elderly, and well over 70.
0 (1530)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is the essence of much of your
speech.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Mr. St. Laurent was Prime Minister at
75, and he did not retire then because of any age limit. He
retired because of the verdict of the electors of Canada,
possibly a verdict which they subsequently had cause to
wonder about. Churchill was Prime Minister of Great
Britain at 80.
To turn to the Bench, Sir Lyman Duff was Chief Justice
at 79, and we lost from the Bench two such eminent jurists
as Mr. Justice Rand and Chief Justice Cartwright because
of the operation of the 75-year age limit, which I think was
a lamentable impoverishment of the Supreme Court
Bench.
If we turn to this house, we all know that there have
been members of this house who have been exceedingly
active, vigorous and valuable members at an age far over
the age of 70. There are some here now who fall in that
category, and there have been others in the past. My mind
turns at once to our late colleague. Senator Roebuck, and
to the honourable Senator Crerar, whom I knew personally and whom I can certify from personal knowledge to
have been in full possession of his wits and a very vigorous mind when he retired from this house, I think just
before his ninetieth birthday. The reason he retired then
was simply a matter of not being able to come up here and
leave his wife, who was ill, in Winnipeg or bring her up
here. He was not retiring because he felt that he was
senile, or falling into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, not
at all, but he felt that he could no longer, with proper
regard for the health of his wife, continue to come up here
and perform his senatorial duties.
So I object very strongly, although it is only a minor
point, to this proposal that the age of retirement from the
Senate should be 70 years of age. This view is, of course,
altogether contrary to the prevailing opinion. Nowadays
for some people, of course, everybody over 30 is absolutely ga-ga, utterly useless. They might as well be dead,
perhaps better; simply cumbering the ground. But I have
never believed in the infallibility of age and I have never
believed in the infallibility of youth. I think age, even
considerable age, has sometimes some very valuable contributions to make. I welcome the proposal that people
should be let in here at an earlier age and, in fact, that
appointments should be made at a much earlier age. I
think this is an excellent idea, but I think also that the
more senior members of this house have in many
instances, at all events, a very distinct and valuable contribution to make.
Now I turn to another point, and here I am getting
almost to the end, the proposals about the House of Commons. There is in the report, at page 37, recommendation
43, a proposal that is intended to cut down the overweening power of the executive over Parliament. This is an
intention, an aim, with which I have considerable sympathy and I can see good reasons for it, but I think the
proposal that is in here pours out the baby with the bath
water. I think it goes beyond what is required. I do not
know exactly what would do the job effectively, but I am

sure that this does it much more than effectively, too
effectively. It goes beyond what is required.
The proposal is, first, that every House of Commons
should continue for a maximum period of four years
instead of five. Why, I do not know. At present, in effect, it
usually does last four years. Very rarely, only twice that I
can recall, no, three times, has a Parliament here run its
full, maximum duration. Ordinarily it is dissolved at the
end of approximately four years, give or take a few
months. If you put in this maximum four instead of five, I
think the probability is that you would then get dissolution really every three years. Then some bright young
radical would come along and say, "You know, we ought
really to call it a maximum duration of three years"; and
eventually they might get down to the terms of the Great
Charter of the Chartists of the 1830s in England, annual
parliaments.
I do not know the reason for this four instead of five,
but that is not of great importance. What follows, however, is. There should be a term-we have not got a term
now in this country for anybody above the rank of
municipal councillor-the proposal is that for the first
time there should be a fixed term for Parliament of four
years, subject only to the power of the Crown to dissolve
in certain very special circumstances. First of all, when
the government is defeated on a motion expressing no
confidence in the government, which, incidentally, may be
exactly one of the times when it is not desirable to have
dissolution. I shall come back to that in a moment.
Second, when the government is defeated on a vote on a
specific bill or portion of a bill which the government has
previously declared should be construed as a motion of
want of confidence. Or, third, when the House of Commons passes a resolution requesting dissolution of Parliament. I think those are foolish proposals.
In the first place, if a government is defeated on a
motion of want of confidence, in very many cases the
obvious thing is to have a fresh election. But, first of all,
suppose that election results in a tie. There are 264 members in the House of Commons. You could have a tie. It is
not, perhaps, very likely, but you could have it. I made
this point in the committee just a few days before the
election on November 28 in Newfoundland produced
something like a tie. Everybody was inclined to say, "Oh,
pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh; this is a figment of your exuberant Newfoundland imagination!" A day or so later they
were not quite so sure that it was a flight of my
imagination.
There have been two cases in the history of this country,
one in Prince Edward Island in 1859 and one in Newfoundland in 1909, after the election of 1908, when a new
legislature could not elect a Speaker and therefore could
transact no business at all. If you had this proposal
embodied in the Constitution of Canada and you happened to get a tie as a result of an election, it would be
impossible for the new Parliament to transact any business; at least it might be, it might simply not be able to
elect a Speaker and the Crown would be debarred from
dissolving Parliament for a fresh election, as it did in
Prince Edward Island in 1859 and in Newfoundland in
1909.

SENATE DEBATES
When I pursued this point in the committee somebody
said, "Oh well, but you have to realize that people are
reasonable and, of course, even if there was a tie, they
would find some means of electing a Speaker. You have to
assume that they would be reasonable and show common
sense." I think possibly the arrière-pensée in the remark
was that, "Of course, you cannot expect people in Newfoundland, who are notoriously flibberty-gibbets, to be
reasonable but, well, you know, if you take the people of
this country as a whole, 264 members representing the
people of this country as a whole, you can count upon
them to be reasonable."
Well, my dear old friend and former leader, Arthur
Meighen, had great faith in the reasonableness of the
population of the country and the reasonableness of the
House of Commons. But having watched his career, and
having watched a few other events in the political life of
this country over a considerable period, I am afraid I have
not the same faith in the reasonableness, even of members
of Parliament. I can well believe that after a hotly fought
election, if you got a tie, it might be very difficult and,
indeed, quite impossible, to elect a Speaker. Then you
would have a complete impasse, a complete deadlock, a
complete breakdown in the whole machinery of government. The house could not function, no business could be
transacted and a new election would be completely impossible until four years had elapsed. This, it seems to me, is
a most radical proposition indeed. I do not think this is
what the proposers intended or what the committee
expected. I do not think they realized the implications of
it. I tried to point them out, but they were like the deaf
adder that stoppeth her ears.
* (1540)

Suppose we get over that hurdle. Suppose we get a
situation such as arose here after the election of 1925, a
situation that has arisen subsequently several times,
although in a less aggravated form. Suppose you have a
situation where no party has a majority. The existing
government decides, as it has a perfect right to do, that it
will meet the new House of Commons and see what the
new House of Commons says, see whether the new House
of Commons wants it or whether it does not want it. Now,
suppose, at the very first division of the session, presumably on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the
Throne, or it might be on something else, the government
is defeated-not by any means a fanciful idea. Then the
government, under the terms of this proposal, could perfectly well go to the Governor General and say, "Look, we
want a dissolution. A motion has been passed expressing
no confidence in the government." Of course, the Governor General, under the traditional reserve powers, could
still say no; but, on the other hand, he might feel it was
very difficult for him to say no. He might feel that the
parliamentary situation was such that it was unlikely that
any other party could form a government and get and
keep a majority. But this might be exactly the time when,
with a newly elected House of Commons, it was undesirable to have a fresh election a mere matter of a month or
so after the previous one.
Then I was told, "You have no need to worry about that,
because this is not at all likely to happen." I do not know,
but I have my doubts about that.
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 29, 1972

Then there is the further case of what happens if a
government with a clear majority in the House of Commons decides on a great new policy of momentous importance. My mind goes back to the first election that I
remember, the election of 1911. The Liberal government
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier had decided on a new departure in
fiscal policy, the Reciprocity Agreement, the Taft-Fielding
Agreement with the United States. It looked like a sure
winner. At first the Conservative Party scarcely dared to
dream of opposition. Then it began to pluck up heart, and
it engaged in obstruction, prolonged obstruction, facilitated, of course, in those days by the fact that there was no
closure rule and there was no limitation on the length of
speeches; and the Conservative Party obstructed so successfully that eventually Sir Wilfrid Laurier asked for
dissolution of Parliament and got it, and the people of
Canada were then able to pronounce on that great new
issue of public policy, the Reciprocity Agreement, and
they pronounced decisively against it.
Now, whether they were right or wrong, for the moment
does not matter. The only point I am making is that one of
the most valuable features of our constitutional system at
present is that an opposition which feels that it has the
country behind it on a great new issue of public policy can
still, in spite of the changes in the rules, obstruct, and
should obstruct.
I am an earnest believer in parliamentary obstruction
on matters of sufficient importance. It is like marriage in
the Anglican Prayer Book: not by any to be taken in hand
lightly, unadvisedly or wantonly, but reverently, soberly,
discreetly and in the fear of the Lord.
If you have a big enough issue, parliamentary obstruction is a vital and necessary and salutary part of our
parliamentary system. If you had this kind of proposal
adopted, it would be impossible, in my judgment, to prevent a government from embarking on a great new issue
of public policy and putting it through without the people
being consulted.
When I put that point to the committee they said, "Oh
well, the House of Commons could vote for its own dissolution." Well, really, one wonders about what on earth
goes on in some people's heads! Can you imagine, honourable senators, a government with a large majority in the
House of Commons, confronted with parliamentary
obstruction on a great new issue of public policy which it
was very anxious to carry, turning around and asking the
House of Commons to vote for its own dissolution? I find
it very difficult to imagine, but then I am a humdrum
person and have not got the poet's fancy, glancing from
heaven to earth, from earth to heaven, and giving to airy
nothing a local habitation and a name.
It seems to me that these proposals are singularly ill advised and, indeed, might be subversive of some of the
most valuable parts of our constitutional system.
Next, I come to the recommendations on the Supreme
Court of Canada. With most of them I find myself in
accord. With one of the smaller variations from what was
tentatively agreed to at Victoria, again I find myself in
accord. But with the proposal respecting appeals from
purely provincial legislation, with the exception of those
involving constitutional questions-a very large exception
which could perhaps drive a coach and four through the

March 29, 1972
March

29

1972

SENATE DEBATES

rest of the proposal-that any province would be free to
declare that the appeal should stop with the Court of
Appeal of the province, I disagree.
Here I tread on delicate and dangerous ground, because
I am not a lawyer; but with due diffidence and humility I
venture to question the wisdom of this proposal. First of
all, because it was not adopted at Victoria, where the
wise,
government, those
of
heads
responsible
experienced, even wily politicians were assembled. For
what must have been cogent reasons, they did not adopt
it. I am perfectly certain the proposal must have come
before them, because it has been part of the public
domain for a long time.
In the second place, I am against it because I have some
reason to doubt whether the leading practitioners at the
Bar of Quebec are really in favour of it, in contradistinction, shall we say, to some of the professors of lawespecially the younger professors-and certain members
of the Bar of Quebec whose interests are perhaps rather
more political than legal. I cannot speak with any assurance on this, but I have some reason to doubt whether the
leading practitioners of the Bar of Quebec are in favour
of this kind of proposal.
In the third place, I fortify my lay opinion by the very
strong opinion of Professor W. R. Lederman of Queen's
University, now the senior professor of constitutional law
in this country, and the distinguished member of the Bar
of both Quebec and Ontario, who recently retired from
the deanship of Osgoode Hall, Professor Gerald E.
LeDain, Q.C.
I commend to honourable senators who are inclined to
take this proposal in the report seriously, the perusal of
Dr. LeDain's article in the Revue Juridique Thémis 1967,
headed, "Concerning the Proposed Constitutional and
Civil Law Specialization at the Supreme Court Level," in
which he discusses other matters as well. He deals with
this sort of proposal, and with the intricate connection
between civil law in Quebec and the federal law, even the
English common law, going back before Confederation, if
I recall the terms of the article correctly. I think that this
particular proposal of the committee is somewhat naive in
believing that you can easily disentangle these various
matters and even in believing that you can easily disentangle ordinary cases involving ordinary law, shall we
say, from cases involving constitutional law. It is almost
incredible to anybody not acquainted with the subject
how often in what might seem to be matters not involving
constitutional law at all constitutional points can come up.
The Supreme Court of Canada would be in a much better
position to deal even with the constitutional cases if it had
the experience of dealing with the intricate interconnections between provincial and dominion law, between civil
and common law, in the ordinary cases which come
before it.
O (1550)

I am aware, of course, that the Supreme Court of
Canada is now overloaded with work. I can see solid
reason for doing something about that. But I think it is
possible to relieve it of that overload of work without
embarking on so radical a proposal as this. I leave discussion of that to gentlemen, or ladies for that matter,
learned in the law.

There are three other small points which I want to
mention by way of dissent from the recommendations.
There is the proposal that the ratification of treaties
should no longer fall to the executive government but
should be done by Parliament itself. I think this might
lead to a very great deal of waste of parliamentary time. It
is not a very important point, but I am not very enthusiastic about this particular proposal. I do not think it has
very much value, and it has, on the other hand, a disadvantage in that it might result in parliamentary time being
occupied quite unnecessarily with a great many matters
of no vast importance to the country.
Next, there is the part of the report that deals with
social security, and that sort of thing, where there is a
vague and delicate reference to section 94A of the British
North America Act. I am sorry, but there is nothing in the
report that suggests what, if anything, should be done
about section 94A. At present, as I understand it, there are
two schools of thought about what section 94A means.
Some eminent lawyers say, and my own opinion is that
they are indubitably correct, that section 94A gives paramountcy in all the matters concerned to the provinces.
Other eminent lawyers say that, in fact, it does not, and
that it gives the provinces merely what I think they call
residual power in the field. I am inclined to think that this
matter should be cleared up.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Concurrent power.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Yes, it is concurrent, but in my view
and that of Professor Lederman and Professor F. R.
Scott, the paramount power rests with the provincial
legislatures if there is a conflict, whereas the Commons
chairman of this committee and ex-Dean Maxwell Cohen
of the McGill Law School take the contrary view that the
paramount power does not rest with the provincial legislatures in such matters as old age security, pensions, and so
forth. I think that should be cleared up.
There is also a recommendation, rather en passant, that
section 92, head 10, paragraph (c), ought to be got rid of,
the subsection and paragraph which provide that the Parliament of Canada can assume exclusive jurisdiction over
local works which it declares to be for the general advantage of Canada or two or more provinces. It is possible
that the other recommendations of the committee would
make this power superfluous. I am doubtful about that. I
think it is a very valuable power to have in there. It has
been used a great many times. Professor Andrée Lajoiefor the benefit of the Hansard reporter, I may add that
Professor Lajoie is a lady; whether it is Mademoiselle or
Madame, I do not know-Professor Andrée Lajoie, of the
University of Montreal Law School, has written a Most
du
valuable book on this subject, Le PouvoirDéclaratoire
Parlement,in which she lists something like 500 instances
in which the power has been used. If you look at her list
you will see it has been used in some very important cases
and some very valuable cases, and cases where otherwise
we would have been faced with some very serious practical difficulties. I mention just one: the mines of Flin Flon,
Manitoba, are partly in Manitoba and partly in Saskatchewan, and that is exactly the difficulty. I do not know
where you go down; whether you go down into the thing
in Manitoba and work at the mine face in Saskatchewan,
or vice versa; but the fact is the operation is carried on

SENATE DEBATES
under the soil of both provinces. As we all know, under
the common law the jurisdiction of the legislative authority, whatever it is, goes down into the ground until, presumably, it meets the conflicting jurisdiction of Australia
or China, and up into the air indefinitely until it meets the
conflicting jurisdiction of Mars or Saturn. Well, the jurisdiction of the Legislature of Manitoba and of the Legislature of Saskatchewan in a matter of labour relations
ordinarily is plenary over such things as mining. This
does not come under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of
Canada. You have a situation there where if a man went
down into the mine, we will say, in Manitoba and engaged
in a strike he might be engaging in a legal strike according
to the Manitoba Labour Relations Act, and when he got
out to work at the face he might be engaged in an illegal
strike according to the Trade Union Act of Saskatchewan;
or vice versa.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There is a very easy solution: Locus
regit actum.

Hon. Mr. Forsey: All I can say is it raises a serious
practical difficulty, and the solution found was to declare
the Flin Flon mine a work for the general advantage of
Canada. Of course, the classic instance is the grain elevators, where the Supreme Court of Canada gave a signal
illustration of the truth of Mr. Bumble's proposition that,
"The law is a h'ass," by declaring the grain trade of
Canada a matter of a merely local or private nature, or
words to that effect, and the only way to get around it was
to declare all grain elevators, past, present and future,
works for the general advantage of Canada and bring
thern under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada
where obviously, in common sense, they belong. Anything
else would have been totally impractical and ridiculous.
There have been other cases which mystify me, such as
the fact that the Ottawa Street Railway was declared to be
a work for the general advantage of Canada, so that if it
wanted to raise its rates it had to go before the then Board
of Railway Commissioners of Canada to get it done and
not before the provincial board where you would expect it
would appear.
There have been a number of somewhat frivolous
instances, but there have been a lot of important instances
where this power has been exercised. I should be reluctant to see it taken out unless we are very sure that the
substantial value which it may have would be provided
for in the committee's other proposals with regard to
trade and commerce and the instrumentalities of trade
and commerce. It may be that those will cover the gap. I
merely sound, as it were, a warning note; I utter a caveat
at this point.
And now, what honourable senators have been waiting
for with anxiety and with diminishing hope, I come to my
last point, and I can be very brief on this.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think we have time.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: That is with regard to the legislative
jurisdiction over income controls. The proposal of the
committee there is substantially that in a time of emergency the provinces should cede-delegate-to the Parliament of Canada the power to control prices and incomes.
I find myself in agreement with the two NDP members of
the committee that this is a poorly drafted recommenda[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 29, 1972

tion and that, in fact, it does not go far enough; that in fact
we should have here-and I am speaking from memory as
to what they say, but I think this is it-that we should have
concurrent jurisdiction for the Parliament of Canada and
the legislatures of the provinces over prices and incomes,
with the legislation of the Parliament of Canada prevailing in case of conflict. In other words, this matter should
be dealt with as agriculture and immigration are dealt
with under section 95 of the present Constitution. I think
that is a sensible proposal. I think it is not really essentially very different frorn what the committee had in mind,
but I think it is better drafted, more effective and clearer.
With that, honourable senators, I finish my dissenting
opinions, my "minority report."
* (1600)

I want finally simply to emphasize again that when I
have uttered all these caveats and all these dissents, when
I have made all these criticisms, some of thern pretty
severe and couched in pretty strong language, I still think
that on the whole this is a sensible report, that it is
recommending on the whole the right things, that its
proposals will be for the good of the country, and will
commend themselves, in time at least, in the main, to the
judgment of both houses, and of the people of this
country.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Yuzyk, debate adjourned.
ADJOURNMENT
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions:
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, with
leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(g), I
move that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Thursday, April 13, 1972, at 8 o'clock in
the evening.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, before the
motion is put, I am pleased to advise members of the
Senate that the President of the United States, Mr. Richard M. Nixon, has agreed to address the members of the
Senate and the House of Commons in the chamber of the
House of Commons at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 14, 1972, on
the occasion of his forthcoming visit to Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Adjourning until April 13 will give
honourable senators an opportunity to despatch some
business that night, and to hear the President, along with
members of the other house, on the following day.
Motion agreed to.
POVERTY
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed frorn Thursday, March 23, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Croll, calling
the attention of the Senate to the Report of the Special
Committee of the Senate on Poverty in Canada, tabled in
the Senate on Wednesday, November 10, 1971.
Hon. James Duggan: Honourable senators, I want to
express my thanks, as other honourable senators have

done, to the members of the Special Senate Committee on
Poverty. They have produced a hard-hitting and thoughtprovoking report. I do not agree with all its details, but I
do agree with the committee chairman, Senator Croll, that
poverty in all its aspects needs to be widely discussed, and
that the committee's report serves as a convenient vehicle
for such a discussion. I am pleased therefore, to have the
opportunity of adding my bit to this dialogue. I like to
think there will be such a ground swell of public discussion on poverty that more enlightened views will inevitably result. These views Canadians will have the opportunity of expressing in a democratic fashion in the not too
distant future.
Newfoundland was well represented on the committee
by Senator Carter and Senator Cook. From what I read in
the press and from what I have been told, the committee
managed to do a lot and see a lot when they visited
Newfoundland and Labrador. They met and talked with
people in St. John's, Cornerbrook, and a variety of communities such as Fogo Island, Cox's Cove, Lourdes, St.
Anthony, and Port au Choix.
In Newfoundland and Labrador it is of very special
importance that government planning and policy, especially those policies which most directly affect the lives
and livelihoods of poor people, are not drawn up and
decided in isolation from the wishes and the local knowledge of the people.
Donald Snowden, Director of Memorial University's
extension department, and a man recognized throughout
North America as an expert in rural and northern affairs,
said that there is no group of people in Canada, including
those living in the Arctic, that are as isolated as the people
living on the Labrador coast, nor are there any as poor.
Because of this isolation it is doubly difficult to get across
to the people what is available to them. I was particularly
pleased, therefore, to see on page 79 of the report that
Newfoundland's Department of Social Services and
Rehabilitation was singled out and commended by the
committee for its booklet Directory of Services Provided.
What does the report say to me? It says, for one thing,
that the problem of poverty will not be overcome under
the current systems. A new system will have to be devised,
or the gap between the haves and have-nots will become
so great that it will become a most divisive force in
Canada.
It is interesting to note that one and a half million
people who comprise part of the work force do not earn
enough money to file income tax returns. Of the six and
half million who did file returns for 1967, more that 40 per
cent had annual incomes of under $4,000.
In the debate on the White Paper on Taxation, and
indeed in every such debate on changing the tax system,
the implication is present, that the most important priority of the tax system is the promotion of economic growth.
The assumption is there throughout the debate, that if the
economy of the country flourishes all members of society
will benefit. This being so, the argument runs, we should
do nothing which might interfere with the promotion of
economic growth; incentives should be built into the
system; nothing should be done to discourage investment;
and if there is a deviation from the principles of equity,
this is the price which must be paid for our growth.

The fallacy, however, lies exposed before us. We have
had in this country a period of virtually uninterrupted
economic boom since 1939. Yet poverty is still very much
in evidence. In many respects, it appears that economic
boom does not benefit those people at the very bottom of
the economic ladder at all. In fact, with national average
incomes rising, plus the growth of inflation, there is some
evidence that those at the bottom are, in real dollar terms,
being left farther and farther behind the rest of society.
Further, the very evidence of the affluent society which
the poor see around them exacerbates the gap, and feeds
the hopelessness and frustration of those at the bottom.
To have been poor in the 1930s was not necessarily a
social crime, or even an insuperable barrier to advancement. To be poor in 1972 is to be a modern-day leper, and
the chances of overcoming the poverty barrier are becoming insuperable.
It appeared to the committee that the best way to
combat the problem is to hand out money to the poor, to
bring them to, and in some cases above, the standard
needed to live decently in this country.
0 (1610)

The committee estimates the cost of its program as one
per cent of the gross national product. Whatever the cost
is, the report indicates we cannot afford not to implement
the program. The committee said very little about the
savings that would occur-savings that would be made by
cutting out all the other social assistance programs. In
addition, such a plan puts cash in the hands of people
whose needs will cause them to spend the entire amount.
They are consumers. This being so, huge amounts of
money will be poured into the system, which will result in
greater profits in all sectors of business, thus yielding
higher tax revenue without a rate increase.
Also, the money channelled into low-income families
will in many cases be sufficient to help them to help
themselves, thus adding to the rolls of taxpayers and
eliminating people who will have to take advantage of the
plan-in other words, the working poor.
We all know that economic growth and industrialization
is leaving behind a large segment of the population which
is ill-prepared and ill-equipped to make a major change in
its life style. Small farmers and fishermen now enjoy a
way of life that should not really be changed, unless they,
as individuals, wish it to be so. This culture and this way
of life should be allowed to continue, and the people who
opt for it should be allowed to enjoy their lives with the
dignity of an adequate income.
Can poverty be described simply as inadequate income?
The Poverty Committee, the Economic Council, and the
Vanier Institute of the Family have all taken the position
that poverty is much more than this. The Vanier Institute
has suggested that the very essence of poverty is the
exclusion, the involuntary exclusion, of some persons
from the broader participation in the economic and social
life of Canada which is open to most Canadians. If this is
indeed the case-and I think it is reasonable to suppose it
is-then the phenomenon of poverty in an affluent society
is a far more serious and less tractable problem than we
have yet recognized and admitted.
If the essence of poverty is exclusion, then the inadequate incomes of the poor may be a symptom or even

SENATE DEBATES
perhaps a cause, of this exclusion. This question was
explored in the brief of the Vanier Institute to the Senate
Committee on Poverty, and I thought its central theme
might be of interest to this house.
The hypothesis put forward by the Vanier Institute was
that there is in Canada pervasive discrimination against
the poor, discrimination which deliberately or inadvertently has become embedded in the policies of nearly all
our major institutions. The brief summarized some of the
earlier testimony presented to the Senate committee as
well as the results of some recent research in Canada. In
institution after institution-in the courts, in the school
systems, in the operation of various government programs such as housing, in the tax system, in the labour
market, in the markets for consumer goods-evidence
was available at least to suggest that, even where ability to
pay was not involved, the poor were worse off than the
non-poor.
a (1620)

Of course, it would not be surprising, where personal
expenditures are necessary to acquire certain goods and
services, that the poor should have access to less than
others. However, where ability to pay is not a criterion
upon which goods and services are distributed-as it is
not intended to be in our schools, our system of justice,
our labour markets, the amount of information by which
and the honesty with which consumer goods are sold, and
in many other areas-there is evidence that the poor are
still at a disadvantage.
If poverty in an otherwise affluent society is indeed a
phenomenon of exclusion-an exclusion which those
upon whom it is forced would willingly forego, witness the
calls of our excluded people for education, not hand-outs;
for jobs, not welfare-what are the implications? The first
implication is that the causes of poverty are not likely to
be found in the characters of the poor themselves, but in
their circumstances and environment. The second
implication is that the crucial sources of bias must be
sought out and altered. This will not be an easy task.
Institutionalized bias is a reflection of either inadvertency, or past or current attitudes. It would be foolish to
suppose that all discrimination against the poor is accidental, even though some part clearly arises from an
underestimation of the costs of poverty, or of the benefits
which will accrue from eliminating it. Progress, then,
depends upon changed attitudes, and without strong leadership attitudes change slowly. We need strong leadership
in Canada dedicated to opening opportunities for the
disadvantaged.
What is to be done? To my knowledge there is no public
or private agency pursuing the general study of poverty
under terms of reference sufficiently broad to comprehend the problem. There are, of course, many specialists in various fields and jurisdictions who are looking at
such things as low-income housing, income maintenance
programs, legal aid, and a host of other special aspects of
the phenomenon of poverty. It is the interrelated impact
of all these factors which bears upon the poor, however,
and to suppose that we will succeed in understanding
poverty with unco-ordinated and specialized efforts carried on in isolation is unwarranted. It is also wasteful. It
seems to me that the major recommendation of the Pover[Hon. Mr. Duggan.]

March 29, 1972

ty Committee's report, namely, that a Council of Applied
Social Research be established at the national level, is one
that all honourable senators should support.
I have already referred to the opportunity Canadians
will have before very long to express their dissatisfaction
with the continued and undeniable existence of poverty in
this great and prosperous land. I cannot help but agree
with one of this continent's authorities on poverty when
he says that we-and by "we" I mean all of us who have
earned the title of senator as well as those who are members of the House of Commons-have contributed to the
invisibility of poverty by our refusal to accept it as a valid
issue, a fact of our life in the seventies.
As long as we avoid the issue of poverty, the poor do not
have a chance. The only way their lot can be improved is
to make poverty an issue, bring new information to the
people, wake up the nation, and issue a challenge and a
call to action.
In my view, that challenge and call to action came loud
and clear when the Special Senate Committee on Poverty
issued its report last November. It is our job now to see
that this challenge is met, bearing in mind that widespread poverty and concentrated wealth cannot long
endure side by side in a democracy.
We may have sufficient time but, if we do not hurry, we
could be too late.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, for Hon. Mr. Williams, debate adjourned.
AGRICULTURE
DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING STANDING SENATE
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 16, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Argue, that
in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in the interest
of both eastern and western agriculture, to establish a
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider
legislation and other matters of concern to agriculture
that may be referred to the said committee by the Senate.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, I
should like to say at the very beginning of my remarks
that I rise to support the proposal presented to this house
by Senator Argue respecting a standing Senate committee
on agriculture. As he pointed out during his remarks,
agriculture has always played a leading part in the economy of this country. It seems to many of us from western
Canada, and also, I gather, from eastern Canada, who
have been or are engaged in the agricultural industry, that
this industry, on many occasions, has not received the
attention from Parliament that it ought to have received.
Perhaps one of the reasons for that is the fact that this
house has never, to my knowledge, had a standing committee charged with the responsibility of looking into the
problems of agriculture.
I think if the Senate is prepared to accept Senator
Argue's motion and we do set up a standing Senate committee on agriculture, that committee will be charged not
only with the responsibility of reviewing legislation concerning agriculture which originates in either this house
or the other place, but also with the responsibility of

March 29, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

looking into some of the many problems confronting
agriculture today which, in many cases, are a repetition of
the past. Since Day One agriculture has been faced with
very difficult problems. Nor would the future of agriculture indicate to us that those problems are going to disappear. Rather, they are going to multiply.
I can think of many areas in which agriculture faces
difficult problems, but I will confine my remarks to western agriculture because I know something about that,
whereas I am not that conversant with the agriculture in
other parts of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You were a minister of agriculture at
one time.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: But in a wheat province.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Did you say "a weak province"?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: No, wheat. I resent the implication
that it is weak.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Perhaps it became weak since you left.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am sure he said that in a kindly way.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It is true that I served as minister
of agriculture in my own province for a short time, and I
can tell honourable senators from my experience there
that agriculture is certainly a portfolio with enormous
headaches associated with it. It was at that time, and it is
today.
At any rate, one of the greatest problems confronting
agriculture today is that created by surpluses. It seems
that no matter what product you ask the farmers of western Canada to produce, they produce it in surplus. Probably the only exception to that rule is beef cattle. The only
reason that we are not able to produce beef cattle in
surplus is that we have limited rangeland available to
produce calves. Of course, the only way today by which
you are able to increase your production of beef is
through the production of more calves, and that will not
be possible on any great scale until such time as we are
able to develop in this nation, probably through the development of hybrids, a grain that can be produced in sufficient quantities and, consequently, cheaply, to enable us
to produce calves in confinement.
* (1630)

When that day comes western Canada will also produce,
I suspect, beef in surplus for a short period of time. I say
that because when you look at the statistics on the human
consumption of beef and the rise in population, the indications are that if we are not able to produce calves in
confinement the price of beef will go so high that it will
only be the affluent part of our society who will be able to
eat beef, and no one wants to see that situation come
about.
Recently we have faced great difficulties in Canada,
particularly in western Canada, because of the surplus of
cereal grains, and the present minister who is responsible
for the Canadian Wheat Board has probably done as
much as, if not more than, anybody else in attempting to
alleviate some of these problems, including any minister
responsible for the Wheat Board throughout history.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
25312-19

Hon. Mr. McDonald: However, he has not been able to
find answers to all the problems. He has searched for
advice and help from virtually every farm organization in
western Canada. He has searched for help and advice
from individuals throughout western Canada. It seems to
me that if a standing Senate committee could be helpful to
the minister in this area, he would certainly welcome that
help, and it is my hope and belief that a committee of this
house could be helpful to him.
We have a series of problems confronting us concerning
the movement of grain in western Canada, and these
problems commence with our farm elevator system. I
have made this statement before inside and outside this
house, and I want to repeat it today. In my opinion, the
country elevator system was designed to handle the crops
of 50 years ago and little has been done to update the
system to meet the needs of the 1970s and the 1980s.
Certainly we have built some larger elevators with larger
scales and high-speed buckets, but the design of the elevators and the procedure for handling grain are virtually the
same today as they were when I was a boy delivering my
first load of grain to the elevator.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That was a long time ago.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes, a long time ago.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But the Leader of the Government
remembers it well.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: But even apart from the design, in
my opinion, we have to give real consideration to the fact
that the cost of building and operating the system is borne
by the producer, and even those companies engaged in the
handling of grain in western Canada are advocating a
different system so far as country elevators are concerned. I noticed in the last report of the Saskatchewan
Wheat Pool a reference to this fact. They point out that
under their country elevator system of consolidation they
were able to do away with 19 stations last year. But,
honourable senators, 19 stations is not a large number. I
think of my own home town, with a population of less
than 200 people, a town that in 1945 had 325 permit books
at the local elevator. At that time there were four elevators in the town. That meant that there were 325 local
farmers delivering their grain to four elevators. Today
there are about 125 farmers delivering their grain to those
same elevators. Those figures indicate to me that there
are too many grain elevators in my home town which, I
suggest, is no different from many other small towns in
the prairie regions.
In my view this problem can only be solved if we are
able to implement a rail line rationalization program. This
proposal has been under study for many years but little
has been done to bring about such a rail line rationalization. Most people in western Canada feel that we should
have a rail line rationalization as long as we do not
remove the rail line from their home town. The problem is
that you cannot have this rationalization without somebody losing a railroad.
This situation arose a few years ago right through the
southern half of the constituency which I used to represent in the provincial legislature. A branch line of the
Canadian National Railways was removed and, of course,
there was a great outcry from the people in the area, and I

SENATE DEBATES
bore the brunt of most of it since I was the sitting member
of the legislature for the area. Hearings were held
throughout the constituency before the line was abandoned. I would point out that this was a situation where
two rail lines, CPR and CNR, were running parallel, in
some instances only 300 or 400 yards apart and in other
instances four or five miles apart. Predictions were made
at that time that the communities located on the line to be
abandoned would dry up and blow away, and those that
were left on the line which was not to be abandoned
would grow up by leaps and bounds. That was 15 years
ago. What has been the result?
The result bas been that the communities situated
where the line was torn up, for some strange reason or
other, are the ones that are growing and prospering, while
those that are still served by the rail line are the ones that
are disappearing. The moral of the story is that a rail line
of itself does not necessarily mean that communities
located along it will prosper and grow. This is not necessarily so.
In this connection, honourable senators, I had an opportunity in 1961 to visit a wheat-growing area of northern
Texas. I made it my business to visit a grain-handling
community called Hereford, where they had what we
would call a country elevator-I say that because it was
performing the same function as a country elevator
here-but which was designed more in the fashion of an
inland terminal. It had a storage capacity of one million
bushels and was operated by one full-time employee and
one part-time employee. It was not situated on a railroad,
so every bushel of grain was trucked in and out. The area
it served was different from most areas of western
Canada in that practically all the grain that went through
that elevator was either consumed in the immediate area,
or was trucked by highway into California which is not
too far distant from that particular place. That situation
does not apply to the prairie regions of Canada where the
great bulk of the grain has to be transported for long
distances either east or west to elevators that are located
on water.
At any rate, it is my hope that a Senate committee
would give some consideration to this problem of country
elevators and rail line rationalization in western Canada.
*

(1640)

We look forward to exporting all the cereal grains for
which it is possible to obtain markets. In most instances in
recent years-as a matter of fact throughout history-we
have been able to supply these grains to our customers
abroad. However, we are now faced with a situation
where this is not possible. For example, the Canadian
Wheat Board was not able to bid on the April sale to
Japan because they did not believe it would be possible to
move additional grain through the port of Vancouver.
I also understand the Soviet Union has been bargaining
with the United States for the purchase of wheat, and
discussions have taken place as recently as March 6 last. I
believe the only reason the Soviet Union is discussing
wheat sales with the United States at this time is because
they cannot be guaranteed deliveries from Canada at the
time they need delivery of the grain. This is partly
brought about by our port facilities, especially those on
the west coast.
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

March 29, 1972

It seems to me we cannot afford to sit idly by and watch
potential markets being lost to our competitive friends
simply because we are not able to supply the product
when our customers want delivery.
Since March 6 an announcement has been made by the
Minister of Transport that the Government of Canada will
be taking over the facilities at Prince Rupert. This is a
good move on two counts: first, the facilities at Vancouver
are obviously not able to handle the volume of grain; and,
secondly, operations at Vancouver, especially during the
months of January and February, are often disrupted
because of the snow and mud slides in the Rockies. These
new facilities will make it possible to use a different rail
line through the Rockies, and thus provide two
alternatives.
I commend the government for having made this move.
I hope the industry itself will improve and build new
facilities at Prince Rupert so we will be able to use the
new port facilities and supply some of the market which,
at the moment, is being lost.
There is another problem in western Canada associated
with our grain handling facilities. Not too many years ago
there was an abundance of grain handling companies
vying for the farmers' business in western Canada. I feel
in that day and age there were too many companies. Many
of them were not large enough to modernize and compete
in this competitive industry. I am rather concerned when I
see the direction in which we are moving at the moment.
It is quite possible that in the near future we could be left
with only two grain handling companies in western
Canada. The reason I say this is because of the number of
grain companies that have sold to, or been taken under
the wing of, one or other of the two great co-operative
movements, namely the wheat pools and United Grain
Growers.
A few days ago you may have noted in the press a
report of the Federal Grain Company to the three Prairie
pools. It was not only the Federal Grain Company which
disappeared because, when it was purchased by the three
Prairie pools a week to ten days ago, the Federal Grain
Company had already taken over 21 other grain handling
companies in western Canada. So there were literally 22
companies which were purchased and went into the ownership of the Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba wheat
pools. I repeat that if this trend continues it is quite
possible that in the near future we will be left with only
two major grain handling companies.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Is this due to the tax situation?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I will come to that in a moment,
Senator Burchill.
I believe that progress is best accomplished through
competiton, and I do not care whether the system is privately owned, co-operatively owned, or government
owned. I feel that any organization which operates without competition is not giving its best service, and it does
not matter whether you are dealing with grain handling
facilities or flying airplanes, or dealing with national publicity. Competition is the spice of life and we need it in the
grain handling industry. God knows that our grain handling companies with competition have refused to mod-

March 29, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

ernize for long enough. What will they do if there is no
competition?
Senator Burchill asked a moment ago whether it was
due to tax policies that the Federal Grain Company was
sold to the three Prairie pools. I feel it was, and I have
here some rather interesting figures. During the last fifteen years the Federal Grain Company had an income
before tax of over $51.5 million. It paid out $23,781,236 in
income and corporate taxes to the federal government,
and the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. During the same fifteen-year period, the Alberta Wheat
Pool had a net profit of $57,249,802. On those earnings
they paid tax, not of some $23 million as the Federal
Grain Company did, but of $1,938,000.
Now that the three Prairie pools have taken over the
facilities of this large, privately-owned Canadian company, the governments of the three Prairie provinces will be
losing revenue of approximately $20 million a year. I
know of no way in which a privately-owned company
which pays a corporation tax of 51 or 52 per cent can
compete with co-operatives which are not required to pay
corporation tax.
Hon. Mr. McNamara: Honourable senators, I would like
to ask what amount these pools paid by way of patronage
dividends over this period of time.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes, I am coming to that point. I
cannot give you that information. I thought that figure
was in the annual report, but I do not see it. All I can give
you is the amount of money they paid each year per
bushel of wheat, oats and barley. I do not want to go back
as far as the year 1925-26, but during 1925-26 on the
average they paid out, by way of dividends, about 4j cents
per bushel of wheat. This was the argument used by the
wheat pools for not paying corporation tax. They indicated they were paying a patronage dividend to the producers. They said, "But, we pay a patronage dividend to
the producer, and the producer pays income tax on it."
* (1650)

That is true, but it is also true that in many instances the
dividend, so-called, paid to the producer is nothing more
or less than a piece of paper which says, "We owe you
$200. You pay the tax on it, and we do not receive the
$200." In many instances monies remain in the hands of
the pool for 30 years, and there is not even any interest
paid.
Now, if this is a logical argument to avoid paying corporation tax, then I am not a very logical man. I would think
that if they are going to give me a piece of paper that says
they owe me $200, and I have to pay tax on it even though
I never receive the $200-well, I have been looking for a
business like that for years, and I defy anyone to compete
with me if I am able to do that and he is not.
My point is that under the taxing laws of Canada today
two companies are encouraged to eventually own all
facilities in the prairie provinces as far as grain handling
is concerned. I repeat my earlier observation that while it
does not matter to me whether they are co-operatives or
shareholder-owned companies, I do not want to see only
two companies involved in grain handling in western
Canada. I think this is bad for the industry, and it is
certainly bad for the farmer. The farmer, I believe, wants
25312-19)

a choice, and under the present set-up, where we do have
the choice, most of our farmers are delivering to one or
other of the pools or co-operatives.
For instance, in the year 1970-71 the Saskatchewan
Wheat Pool handled 51.48 per cent of all grains. One of the
reasons why the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool got this percentage of grains is that it is a good, well run organization.
I happened to be a member of a wheal pool committee for
many years, and I repeat that I do not think there is any
grain-handling system in western Canada that runs a
better operation than the Saskatchewan Wheal Pool, but
that is no reason for them to run it all. I should like to see
the laws of the land amended so that other companies can
enter and compete in the industry.
If this motion is agreed to by the Senate today, as I hope
it will be, this is another matter which can be considered
by the committee. Hearings can be held and expert witnesses called in the hope that we can be of assistance to
those who are charged with responsibility for agricultural
policies. Be they in the Department of Agriculture, the
Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, or the
minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, it
matters not. I am certain that they would welcome any
assistance that a committee of this house might offer.
It is my hope that honourable senators today will support the motion of Senator Argue.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: At the risk of disappointing my honourable friend, I move the adjournment of the debate.
I am willing to yield to the Leader of the Government,
who was the agricultural expert for several years in the
other place, but if no one else wishes to speak, I move the
adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate adjourned.
PARLIAMENT HILL BILL
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from earlier this day the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, for the
second reading of Bill C-78, respecting the use of the
expression "Parliament Hill".
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I am willing
to yield to the deputy leader.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators,
when this matter was adjourned earlier today, my purpose in asking for that adjournment was to afford me the
opportunity of discussing this matter with the sponsor of
the bill in the other place, and also with those having more
knowledge of the law and the Constitution of Canada
than I. During the intervening period I have been able to
find a section in the British North America Act dealing
with the words "Legislative Assembly" as they refer to the
seat of government in a province. I refer to section 71,
which states with regard to the Province of Quebec:
There shall be a Legislature for Quebec consisting
of the Lieutenant Governor and of Two Houses, styled
the Legislative Council of Quebec and the Legislative
Assembly of Quebec.
I recognize the argument of the Leader of the Opposition concerning the common usage of the word "Parlia-

SENATE DEBATES
ment." It is used not only in Quebec. I know it is used in
my own province. There, despite the fact that the government buildings are referred to as the Legislative
Assembly, most people taking a cab downtown instruct
the driver, "Take me to the Parliament Buildings." So
there is general usage of the words "Parliament Buildings," despite the fact that the British North America Act
tells us that in such a case it is a legislative assembly. I
suppose they should be referred to as "the legislative
buildings."
However, in view of section 71 of the British North
America Act, I doubt the wisdom of accepting the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. Following his presentation, I wonder if we ought not to refer the
bill to committee, rather than attempt to deal with it
today. Then the suggestion of Senator Prowse as to the
wording could also be considered. If we are prepared to
give the bill second reading, I am prepared to move that it
be referred to committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, bill referred to the

INTERNAL ECONOMY
SENATORS AUTHORIZED TO ACT BETWEEN SESSIONS
AND PARLIAMENTS
The Senate resumed from earlier this day the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Smith:
That during any period between sessions of Parliament or between Parliaments, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and a senator to be named by

him from time to time and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, or a senator to be named by him
from time to time, be authorized to act for and on
behalf of the Senate in all matters relating to the
internal economy of the Senate; and
That within fifteen days of the commencement of
the next ensuing session there shall be laid on the
Table, by or on behalf of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, a report covering in reasonable
detail all matters relating to the internal economy of
the Senate arising during any such period.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, as far as I am
concerned, after private consultation with two former
Speakers of the Senate-and I think the present Speaker
has also agreed-I see no reason why we should amend
the motion. If there is no objection, it should pass as
presented.

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD
STORAGE FACILITIES AT SASKATOON-QUESTION
ANSWERED
Leave having been given to revert to Question Period:
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

March 29, 1972

Hon. Paul Martin: Earlier today Senator Buckwold
asked a question regarding the Quaker Oats Company, as
follows:
In the City of Saskatoon the Quaker Oats Company
has announced that it will cease milling operations in
the near future. This will leave unused grain elevator
capacity of about 2 million bushels. I would ask the
Leader of the Government to inquire of the minister
in charge of the Wheat Board if these facilities can be
utilized for grain storage, or put to any other use that
may benefit the grain industry of Saskatchewan, and,
if so, what action the government bas taken or will
take.
In reply, I can confirm that the Quaker Oats Company
has ceased, or will be ceasing, milling operations in the
near future. I am informed that the Quaker Oats Company will be placing its grain elevator facilities on the commercial market. I am not in a position to confirm whether
or not there is a potential purchaser in the offing, but it is
not the government's intention to interfere in what it
hopes will prove to be a normal commercial transaction.
Grain storage is one obvious purpose to which the facilities could be put by the purchaser.
This being the last meeting of the Senate before the
Easter recess, I should like to extend to His Honour the
Speaker and to all honourable senators good wishes for a
very happy Easter.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Seconded, and unanimously carried.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I move that we adjourn during pleasure for royal assent at approximately 5.45 p.m.

UNITED NATIONS
CANADIAN DELEGATION TO THIRD CONFERENCE ON
TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT, AT SANTIAGO, CHILE
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, may I be
permitted to draw to the attention of the house the fact
that the Leader of the Government, the Honourable Paul
Martin, is obviously not in his place. The reason for his
absence is that he is in Santiago, Chile, where he is leading the Canadian delegation to the Third United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development.
As honourable senators know, UNCTAD is an organization of the United Nations which is responsible for the
promotion of trade, particularly with a view to encouraging trade with some of the less-developed parts of the
world. I am informed that there will be considerable discussion there on problems related to access for products
of the developing world to markets of industrialized countries. The conference will consider programs to assist the
less-developed countries, and there is likely to be some
discussion of monetary problems and the operation of the
international monetary system.
I am informed also that this conference is a very large
one. One hundred and thirty countries will be represented, in addition to representatives of the whole United
Nations system.
In closing, I point out that it is appropriate that Senator
Martin should lead the Canadian delegation to this third
conference of UNCTAD, inasmuch as he led the Canadian delegation to the first conference held in Geneva in
1964.

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I move,
with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule
45(1)(g), that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday, April 25, 1972, at eight o'clock in
the evening.
Motion agreed to.

POVERTY
DEMONSTRATION IN MONTREAL-QUESTION 0F
PRIVILEGE
Hon. David A. Croil: Honourable senators, I rise on a
question of privilege. I should like to quote frorn a news
story in the Montreal Gazette of Wednesday, April 12,
1972, which reads in part as follows:
About 75 inner-city residents were ejected by police
from the Point St. Charles welf are office yesterday
after protesting the suspension of $10 dietary supplements for nearly 400 Point welf are families.
The anti-poverty demonstrators also occupied the
Centre St. Office to try to instaîl a welfare information booth.
No arrests were made by police who read the "Riot
Act" to protesters from the Point Equal Rights Movement (PERM).
When they refused to leave, police carried each
demonstrator downstairs from the second floor office
to the street.
The $10 per month allotrnent, according to the
Social Welfare Act (Bil 26), may be given to seriously
undernourished recipients who require a high protein
diet.
Last summer a Montreal Catholic School Commission study revealed that more than haif of 3,424 children from eight inner-city schools were physically
sick-due in part to poor diet.
More than 10 per cent were so fil they required
hospital care.
That is the end of the quote.
Hou. Mr. Choquette: I hope it is the end of your speech
too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What is the point of privilege?
Hon. Mr. Croil: I arn about to raise the point of prîvilege.
Hon. Mr. Wcilker: What are you running for?
Hon. Mr. Croli: I think I have given enough background
to make the point that neyer before in this country, to my
knowledge, has the "riot act" been used as a response to
the appeals of undernourished people seeking nourishment, or poverty-stricken people seeking food. This is a
travesty of justice, an unwarranted, unjustified and
unprecedented abuse of process.
If you look at sections 65 to 69 of the Crirninal Code, you
will see that the reading of a proclarnation-usually
terrned the "riot act"-converts the potential offences of
riot and unlawful assembly, which are punishable by a
maximum of two years' imprisonment, into offences punishable by imprisonment for life. I shahl read the
proclamation.
Hou. Mr. Walk.r: Before you do that may I ask whether
anybody was charged?
Hon. Mr. Croil: Apparently no arrests were made.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Then why read it?
Hon. Mr. Croli: I think it is important that I should read
it to indicate the possibilities that arise following the reading of the "riot act."

Hon. Mr. Walker: There are possibilities in everything.
Hon. Mr. Crail: I quote frorn section 68 of the Crirninal
Code as foilows:
Her Majesty the Queen charges and commrands al
persons being assernhled imrnediately to disperse and
peaceably to depart to their habitations or to their
lawful business upon the pain of being guilty of an
offence for which, upon conviction, they may be sentenced to imprisonment for life. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.
That, honourable senators, is the proclamation. I arn distressed to think it has corne to this anywhere in Canada. I
presumne, as a matter of jurisdiction, we cannot interfere
with the administration of justice within a province.
Nevertheless, I rise to protest, and protest I do in the only
way I know how.
METROPOLITAN ILARION OHIENKO, PRIMATE 0F THE
UKRAINIAN GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH 0F CANADA
TRIBUTES
Hou. Paul Yuzyk: Honourable senators, I would like to
inforrn the members of the Senate that on March 29
Metropolitan Ilarion, the spiritual leader of the Ukrainian
Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, died in Winnipeg at
the age of 90 and was buried yesterday, April 12. In the
scholarly world he was known as Dr. Ivan Ohienko.
His Grace, Metropolitan Ilarion was born in Brusyliv,
Ukraine in 1882. After comnpleting his studies at the University of Kiev, he taught philology and was active in the
field of education. Dr. Ivan Ohienko supported the cause
of Ukrainian independence after the downfall of Russian
monarchy in 1917. During the existence of the Ukrainian
National Republic (1917-1921) he was minister of education and religious affairs in the government, and the
founder and rector of the University of KarnenetzPodilsk.
After the Russian communist conquest of Ukraine, Dr.
Ohienko went into exile in Poland where, at the University of Warsaw, he was professor and chairman of the
Department of Old Church Slavic from 1926 to 1932. In
1940, during the Second World War, he was ordained
bishop of the Orthodox Church, but was unable to exercise his duties very long because of the war conditions. In
1944 he sought refuge in Switzerland, and three years
later in 1947 carne to Canada where he settled down
permanently in Winnipeg.
In 1951 a special synod (sobor) of the Ukrainian Greek
Orthodox Church of Canada elected Metropolitan Ilarion
as head and primate of the Church with the See in Winnipeg. Here he becarne Dean of the Faculty of Theology at
St. Andrew's Coflege and honorary professor in the
Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Manitoba, at which time I was a rnernber of the staff until my
appointrnent to the Senate in 1963.
Metropolitan Ilarion was an outstanding scholar and the
author of over 1,000 books, essays, sermons and articles.
Recognized as the greatest authority on the Ukrainian
language, he worked for many years on the translation of
the Bible into modern Ukrainian, which was published by
the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1962, the fulfilment of a cherished dream. Because his writings are so

SENATE DEBATES
numerous, and so many of a high calibre, it would be
unfair if I began to list only some of them. Suffice it to
say, his contributions to scholarship are in many fields.
Having known the Metropolitan personally for over 20
years, I would like to pay him the highest of tributes. I can
say with full conviction that he was a man of high principles, high morals, great integrity, high standards, and
sincere friendship. His love of the Ukrainian culture and
language he transmitted to the young generation through
his publications, his speeches, his teachings, his discussions, and his example of devotion and hard work. He has
left an indelible impact on the development of Ukrainian
education and culture in Canada. This great scholar,
teacher, and clergyman has influenced millions of people
throughout the world, and he will live in the fond and
grateful memories of his beloved people for many generations to come.
* (2020)

About 2,000 people paid their last respects to this great
man at the solemn funeral which was held yesterday in St.
Mary's the Protectress Cathedral in Winnipeg. The majestic Byzantine-Rite Pontifical Liturgy was celebrated by
five bishops, a large number of clergymen, a fine choir,
and hundreds of responding faithful.
At the dinner in honour of the deceased, which was held
following the funeral, condolences and tributes were
expressed from Ukrainian churches, universities, organizations, and leaders of communities throughout the world.
Telegrams of sympathy were also conveyed by Governor
General Roland Michener, Lieutenant-Governor Stephen
Worobetz of Saskatchewan, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau, Premier Edward Schreyer of Manitoba, Premier
Allan Blakeney of Saskatchewan, and other Canadian
leaders. I had the honour of representing the Senate at
this funeral.
I should like to repeat in part what I stated at the
funeral dinner. I said that the Speaker and the members
of the Senate sent their heartfelt sympathy to the surviving children and their families, Mr. George and Mr.
Anatoly Ohienko of New York, and Mrs. Lesia Bida of
Sherbrooke, Quebec, and to the bishops, the clergymen,
and the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church
of Canada. It was a great privilege to have this distinguished man, Metropolitan Ilarion Ohienko, as a citizen of
our country, which has greatly benefited from his scholarship and leadership. May his example inspire many
people to greater and nobler heights in the fields of education, better human relations, and cultural and spiritual
progress.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, we are all
most indebted to Senator Yuzyk for drawing our attention
to the sad death of Metropolitan Ilarion Ohienko. It is
obvious from what Senator Yuzyk has said that Canada
has indeed lost a significant church and educational
figure. He has been in Canada for a quarter of a century,
yet he died full of years having had several careers in
Europe. Obviously he was a scholar, a writer, an educator,
and a statesman as well as a churchman.
I think it is also noteworthy that men of his eminence
should come to Canada to minister to the peoples from
whom they sprung, the people whom they know, whose
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.)

April 13,1972

culture they understand, whose religious traditions they
enrich and embellish.
Our sympathy goes out in full measure to all his relatives and to his colleagues in the Ukrainian Orthodox
Church.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT, 1971

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED
Hon. John M. Macdonald moved the second reading of
Bill S-2, to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971.
He said: Honourable senators, generally speaking,
under the Unemployment Insurance Act unemployment
insurance benefits are payable to an insured person who
qualifies to receive such benefit. In order to qualify, a
person's employment must, of course, be one which comes
under the definition in the act of an insurable employment, and "insurable employment" is defined as employment not included in "excepted employment." Subsection
(2) of section 3 of the act sets out what is excepted
employment.
Under paragraph (a) of section 3(2), one type of excepted employment is that of a person who is over 70 years of
age or to whom a retirement pension has at any time
become payable under the Canada Pension Plan or the
Quebec Pension Plan. Under section 31 of the act an
initial benefit period shall not be established for a person
70 years of age or over or to whom a retirement pension
has become payable under either the Canada Pension
Plan or the Quebec Pension Plan.
Honourable senators, all this simply means that a
person 70 years of age or over is not eligible to draw
unemployment insurance, no matter if he is working in
the same manner and in the same job as when he was
under 70 years of age. The same situation applies if a
person is entitled to a pension under one of the two plans I
have mentioned.
In my opinion, this provision does not make sense. If a
person 70 years old or more is employed and wants to
work, and is capable of doing so, then I say good luck to
him or to her, and if in the course of his employment there
are idle times then, of course, he should be able to draw
unemployment insurance benefits in the same manner as
a younger person.
I do not know the reasoning behind this provision in the
act, or if there was any reason. I would hate to think it
was put there to act as a pressure to keep older people out
of the work force. I would not expect there would be so
many as to make any substantial difference to the labour
market, and neither would I expect that people of this age
would be a source of competition to younger people, as
older persons would have special skills which would not
be too common. If the reason for this willful discrimination is to force or pressure older persons out of the labour
force, then our economic situation must be much worse
than I think it is. It must be bad if the balance is upset by
the employment of persons over 70.
I realize, of course, that the unemployment situation is
bad, but I do not think it would be helped to any great
extent by such tactics. It is a grave injustice to people over

Arl1192SENATE
70 years of age to have this provision mn the act, and that is
why I would like to see it eliminated.
Again, I cannot understand why the same provision
should apply to those to whom retirement benefit is payable under the Canada Pension Plan or the Quebec Pension Plan. Surely if a person has made his contribution to
a pension plan he is entitled to the pension when it
becomes due. The fact that he is entitled to a pension
should have no bearing whatsoever on his employment
after he receives such pension or is entitled to it, and if he
gets employment while on pension then he should, as a
matter of right, be covered and protected by unemployment insurance.
*(2030)

Honourable senators, I suppose one only realizes the
full effects of the provisions I have mentioned, and which
by this bill I seek to have removed, if he cornes up against
a particular case. It was brought home to me last year
when I learned from a friend and long time neighbour
what had happened to him. He was and is a wireless
operator who worked for many years with the Marconi
Company and retired on pension when he was 65. Being
an active man who enjoys good health he wished to continue working, and has done so. He has worked as a
wireless operator on ships, and his services have been in
considerable demand during vacation times and when
because of illness or other reasons the regular operator
could not work. At times he has made several long voy-

25312-20

DEBATES29

297

ages. Being very competent and reliable, his services have
been in demand. Indeed, last year he was the operator on
the first ship to go from Canada to the People's Republic
of China. This ship was sold to the government of that
country. I may add he tells an interesting story of what
they saw in that country or rather what they were shown
as they could not do any sightseeing without a guide.
In any event this man is now over 70 years of age. He is
willing, capable, ready and, indeed, anxious to keep working. His type of work is not steady and there are bound to
be times when he is unemployed; if he were a few years
younger he could draw unemployment insurance during
such periods. Yet, because he is over 70, he cannot qualify
for such insurance.
Honourable senators, the whole thing is just too ridiculous. Perhaps it will be said that this bili is being introduced just to correct a situation relating to one man. I
would be surprised if there are not more in the same
category. But even if there is not, and if only one person
suffers an injustice on account of these provisions in the
Unemployment Insurance Act, then that is good and sufficient reason to change the act and so remove the injustice.
Honourable senators, believing, as I do, that Bill S-2 will
remedy an injustice and corrc:.ct a most illogical situation,
I ask you to support it.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West), for Hon.
Mr. Martin, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, April 25, at 8 p.m.

1972

UNITED NATIONS
TWENTY-SIXTH SESSION-THIRD COMMITTEE OF
GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Hon. Renaude Lapointe rose, pursuant to notice:
That she will call the attention of the Senate to the
work of the Third Committee of the General
Assembly of the United Nations during its twentysixth Session, held in New York from 21st September
to 22nd December, 1971.
[Translation]
She said: Honourable senators, several of my honourable colleagues who came to New York as observers to the
United Nations General Assembly have summarized their
impressions in an interesting review of the activities of the
United Nations and the role of our country within the
organization. As a member of the Canadian delegation in
1970 and 1971, I was privileged because in 1970 impressive
ceremonies marked the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the United Nations, and 1971 was the year when
China was admitted to membership and a new Secretary
General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, of Austria, was elected.
Today, I shall speak mainly of the activities of the Third
Committee, because it includes almost equal numbers of
male and female representatives and is often, although
unjustifiably, considered to be concerned only with issues
related to women or families, whereas its concerns, which
are defined as social, humanitarian and cultural, involve
problems related to humanity as a whole.
However, let us start at the beginning. During the
United Nations' first ten years of existence, the Human
Rights program was first geared toward the definition of
principles and their integration in a series of international
instruments. These are the Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and several other agreements and declarations
derived from the United Nations Charter and also from
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was
promulgated in 1948.
* (2010)

Unfortunately, enforcement of those rules did not
follow the legislative pace of the United Nations. And so,
from 1955 on, the program was modified and divided into
three parts:
First, every three years member states must report to
the Secretary General on progress achieved and difficulties encountered in their respective countries; in addition,
every year the Third Committee makes a survey of the
situation with regard to the signing and ratifying of the
various pacts and conventions.
Secondly, a series of comprehensive studies, based on
information provided by governments, several non-governmental organizations and reputed scholars, emphasize
the general evolution, the progress accomplished and the
steps taken to protect human freedom throughout the
world; those studies also contain objective recommendations.
Thirdly, at the request of the governments, UNO gives
assistance on any matter related to human rights, provided that assistance is not already supplied through technical aid programs. It also organizes symposiums in order
25312-20J

to bring the leaders together to stimulate their awareness
of problems, and it grants scholarships to the graduates of
under-developed countries and enables them to study in
foreign countries the human right protection systems
built into the administration of justice, or the organization
of social security, et cetera.
It is therefore in the light of all information provided
especially by the Economic and Social Council and by its
Commission on Human Rights, that the Third Committee
of the General Assembly is entrusted with the final examination of the cases under consideration and with the
passage of the resolutions aimed at their settlement. Once
ratified by the General or Plenary Assembly, the resolutions being carried by the various committees compel the
Secretary General to have them enforced.
For example, if the Third Committee-made up of as
many representatives as there are member countries in
the United Nations-recommends by a majority vote that
an international congress, let us say on youth and the use
of drugs, be held, the Secretary General must take the
necessary steps so that the congress is held. However,
when a recommendation entails some expenditures it
must, before it is passed by the Plenary Assembly and
thus binds the Secretary General, be approved by the
Fifth Committee which deals with the UN budget.
A glance at our orders of the day of our 1971 session will
convince you of the variety and great number of questions
under consideration. Some points are raised each year,
particularly by concerned group. The Afro-Asiatic group,
for example, is specifically anxious to carry on the debate
on the abolition of racial discrimination of all kinds as
well as on the right of people to self-determination and the
granting of independence to colonized countries and
nations. For these reasons, year after year, we hear the
same speeches condemning the policy of apartheid in
South Africa, the colonialist policy of Portugal, which still
maintains under its rule Angola, Mozambique and Bissau
Guinea, the obstinacy of South Africa in refusing to end
its trusteeship over Namibia or South West Africa and
lastly the racist regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia. Having
now a majority in the UN, African and Asian delegates
can easily obtain a priority for subjects that are of high
concern to them. We should probably feel the same way if
we were in the same situation. What is somewhat absurd
is that representatives of those same countries in other
committees also want to examine these problems under
another aspect, be it political, economical or legal. Last
year, for instance, during the same week, four committees
were discussing apartheid separately, which many people
feel is a duplication that should be corrected.
Socialist countries also have their favourite subjects,
their hobbyhorses. Two items that are boring to most
delegations but are steadfastly maintained on the agenda
are the punishment of war criminals and measures to be
taken against nazism. Here again, we have to put up with
long repetitious speeches and endorse resolutions that are
practically carbon copies of those of previous years. What
the socialists want is to bring all countries to subscribe to
the Convention on the imprescriptibility of war crimes.
They also want to emphasize that there are still staunch
supporters of nazism in West Germany and elsewhere,
and that contemporary expressions of nazism, combining

SENATE DEBATES
racial prejudice, discrimination and terrorism, exist particularly in South Africa and should be fought.
Other points, however, are of more general interest. On
the humanitarian level, for instance, the very complex
matter of respect of human rights in time of armed conflict-that is, the protection of civilians, the wounded, war
prisoners, and journalists-took up a number of the Committee meetings. After first being considered in 1970, this
matter was referred to a conference of government
experts, sponsored by the International Committee of the
Red Cross, which took place in Geneva in the spring of
1971; then discussions were resumed in New York last
fall.
The crux of the problem is that, valuable as they are,
existing humanitarian tools such as the Geneva Conventions of 1949 are inadequate. We must take into account
contemporary methods of combat such as guerrilla, as
well as new facts which have an impact on the respect of
human rights. It is felt that while enforcing stricter
respect of existing conventions, we must also formulate
additional regulations applicable to all kinds of armed
conflict. To this end, it is very important to maintain close
co-operation between the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross. A second session of the conference of experts is to be held in Geneva in the spring, and
all signatory states to the Geneva Conventions have been
invited.
In those 1949 Conventions, there is no mention, for
instance, of the use of napalm and other incendiary weapons which are considered very cruel. Our Committee,
therefore, requested an objective and comprehensive
report on this matter by qualified government experts.
A preliminary project concerning protection of journalists was also discussed at length. Socialist countries particularly consider that journalists, who, according to
them, are often infiltrated by spies and undesirable
individuals, deserve no more protection than is granted to
noncombatants. However, many delegations are in favour
of issuing a safeguard card to bona fide journalists who
would undertake to show an objective attitude and
respect for the laws of the host country. The extent and
duration of such protection, problems of indentification
of journalists, the procedure to be followed for issuance
or withdrawal of cards and the limits of their validity in
space and time, such are only some of the details which
will require further discussion next fall.

But the most important point for the WEO group,
which, as honourable senators know, means West Europeans and others-the word "others" including Canada,
the U.S.A., Australia and New Zealand-was the project
of creating the post of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a project strongly opposed by
the Socialist and the Arab groups, and which gave way in
1970 to regrettable incidents and obstruction inside the
commission. Discussed briefly in 1970, its consideration
had been deferred until 1971, and, in between, a consultation process took place and an informal aide-mémoire
was circulated among all permanent missions.
(Hon. Miss Lapointe.]

April 25, 1972

Together with many Latin American countries, the
WEO group expressed the opinion that the achievements
of the UN regarding universal promotion and protection
of human rights had not fulfilled the promise of the charter. The disparity between the achievements of the UN in
the field of legislation and in the field of implementation
had led, seven years ago, the delegation of Costa Rica to
reintroduce the idea proposed in 1950 by the delegation of
Uruguay of creating the post of High Commissioner.
The Costa Rica suggestion was referred to the Commission on Human Rights, which placed a concrete proposal
before the Economic and Social Council, usually called
ECOSOC, which in its turn recommended that the
assembly adopt a resolution establishing that post.
One of the arguments most commonly used against the
creation of this office is based on the belief that it would
interfere in the internal affairs of states. But the sponsors
answered that there was a serious misconception in that
belief. Basically, they said, the main emphasis of the mandate is on assistance to states. The point of departure was
that governments are interested, or should be interested,
in safeguarding human rights, and that they might well
wish to avail themselves of international assistance for
this purpose, which could be done in a variety of ways. To
sum up, the sponsors expected the High Commissioner to
let himself be guided in all his activities by a very high
degree of political judgment and understanding, and they
repeated that his task is not to exert political pressure but
genuinely to assist countries in the promotion of human
rights.
Another argument was that the High Commissioner
would be so flooded with complaints from individuals
that it would be impracticable for him to deal with all of
them. Should that hypothesis be true, answered the sponsors, it must be taken as a genuine sign that people all
over the world consider the present system to be seriously
lacking, and that consequently the expected flood of communications constitutes an additional argument for the
creation of the post.
Some delegations also feared that the appointment of
the High Commissioner might come as a political decision
putting in danger the impartiality and independence of
the appointee. So the sponsors agreed to make an important change as compared to the draft submitted by the
Economic and Social Council and to propose that the
High Commissioner be elected by the assembly.
The sponsors were, of course, aware of the fact that the
financial situation of the UN had given rise to misgivings
on the part of some delegations as to the wisdom of
incurring additional expenditure. But they stated that
financial difficulties should not be allowed to stand in the
way of desirable programs and activities within the UN
and that each new proposal had to be judged on its own
merits. As for the financial implications, the secretariat
was foreseeing an expenditure in the order of $350,000 for
the first year. But the sponsors added that the estimates
would have been carefully scrutinized by the competent
organs of the UN.
In spite of what we might call an active lobbying on the
part of the WEO group and in spite of the efforts of the
Swedish representative who introduced a draft resolution
on behalf of nine countries including Canada, and who

Avril 25, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

delivered a solid speech prepared in co-operation with the
Canadian expert on the subject, Professor R. St. John
MacDonald, dean of the faculty of law at the University of
Toronto, who among others also spoke vehemently, the
opposition group stood unyielding. A further study of that
point has even been deferred until 1973 by a surprise
amendment in plenary. That was the last blow, showing
that the idea of a High Commissioner for Human Rights is
far from being ripe.
[Translation]
Our proceedings are not, however, limited to the items
enumerated, since there were 17 on our agenda, which is
much too heavy. Priority was given to the study of a
lengthy quadrennial report, completed in 1970, on the
world wide social situation. This report included no less
than 16 booklets and several appendixes and it was discussed at length, particularly by delegations who felt that
the situation in their country was not represented with
sufficient objectivity or accuracy, and who were unhappy
with the criteria for comparison. Canada recommended
that the next report, due in 1974, contain more structural
and intersectorial analyses and we stressed the usefulness
of family planning programs and the necessity that social
aspects of development be given the same importance as
economic aspects.
Each year also, the Third Committee receives the High
Commissioner for Refugees, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan.
He submits his annual report and receives solemn pledges
from member countries for payment of their contribution
for the following year. The Canadian pledge was for $400,000 in 1970, and the same amount in 1971, representing a
very generous contribution. In 1971 a special resolution
was concerned with assistance to East Pakistan refugees
in India. Programs for assistance in cases of natural
disasters are also examined by our Committee, which has
voted in favour of the appointment of a co-ordinator, not
for disasters, but for assistance in cases of disaster, in
order to avoid delays, disorder and waste resulting
specifically from lack of co-ordination of external aid in
periods of emergency. The office of the co-ordinator will
be located in Geneva.
Following a very lively discussion the Third Committee
has adopted another resolution approving the twinning of
cities as a way to promote international co-operation.
That proposal had been put forward by the representative
from France on behalf of his country and of some twenty
other countries. The purpose of that proposal is basically
to twin towns of developed countries with towns of developing countries under the sponsorship of the World Federation of Twinned Cities which is connected with the UN.
But several countries, especially New Zealand and Australia, were against granting that federation a monopoly
in that field and making it the only recipient of UN aid.
Therefore the initial proposal has been amended considerably. At the end of the meeting which had been both
very long and boisterous, the chairwoman-a brilliant
Finnish lawyer who is considered as a possible deputy to
the Secretary General-fainted and was unconscious for
15 minutes.
Each year, the Social and Economic Council divides
among the various greater committees the study of the
questions which appear in its report. Last year, we had to

examine the following topics: the death penalty; youth
and habit-forming drugs; human rights in the administration of justice; the rights of the mentally retarded; the
commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights; and, last, the question of
the United Nations Children's Fund, better known as
UNICEF. Owing to lack of time, these subjects, were only
examined superficially although the first ones were
extremely important, and we adopted "full speed" resolutions which had been prepared by some delegations
which, having previously been members of the Social and
Economic Council, have a more thorough knowledge of
these questions.
*

(2030)

Unfortunately, the way in which the agenda is prepared
at the beginning of the session is completely unrealistic. It
is proposed to fit the study of some 17 points, several of
which are major ones with a number of subdivisions, into
the rigid frame of about 85 meetings. Well, we know from
experience that it is very easy for such or such a group to
filibuster by making the discussion of a topic drag on in
order to delay consideration of the next item with which
they do not agree. The result is that by the beginning of
December, half the topics still remain to be considered.
This is the reason why some matters are put on the
agenda year after year without ever being seriously considered, as they are given last priority.
This has been the case with the following matters: freedom of information; elimination of all forms of religious
intolerance; human rights in the face of scientific and
technological advances; and criminality and social development. As for the matter of elderly people, which had
been neglected for several years, it made some progress in
1971 when our Committee asked the Secretary General to
have a study conducted on the situation of elderly people
in several countries which have reached various stages of
development, and to prepare for 1973, jointly with specialized agencies, a report containing guide lines on which
national policies may be based.
The position of Canada in the Third Committee is that
of a moderate country which, while belonging to the
group of wealthy nations, tries and manages to preserve
friendly relations with all other delegations, no matter
how radical, how anti-imperialist and how anti-capitalist
they may be. As far as human rights are concerned,
Canada could have a more dynamic attitude. Judging
from the letters we receive, enlightened Canadians would
like to see their country take a more active part in international co-operation in this sphere. We are aware that
because those are problems which involve divisions of
jurisdiction between the federal government and the
provinces, Canada had to move with caution in this field,
especially when it had to sign conventions, because several of them, at least in part, come under provincial jurisdiction-among them, the convention on the elimination of
all forms of racial discrimination which was finally signed
by Canada in October 1970, and the Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights.
According to the Department of External Affairs, the
federal-provincial consultation mechanisms are rather
weak, which means that the importance of those international conventions is usually ignored and that provincial

SENATE DEBATES
agreement has been difficult to obtain. Those mechanisms
must therefore be improved, the agreement and support
of the provinces obtained more quickly with regard to the
signature and ratification by Canada of UN conventions.
We agree that the task is very complex with a government
system such as ours, or that of Australia or the United
States.
[English]
In conclusion, I should like to say that the Third Committee is, in a way, the last section of a channel through
which the suggestions and draft resolutions related to the
Declaration of Human Rights must pass in order to be
either rejected, or approved with or without modifications, before attaining the binding stage in plenary session. In my opinion, a rationalization of the procedure in
that committee, as in the others, would surely produce
better results. The United Nations is working at it. But we
must not expect too much, human nature being what it is.
When the high ideals of the Declaration of Human
Rights are set against the actual situation in the world,
one may be overwhelmed with pessimism, but one must
keep in mind that the task is immense and unending. One
of the most significant developments is the fact and
almost all the constitutions or basic laws of states adopted
in recent years contain provisions relating to human
rights and fundamental freedoms. For many new countries, the declaration has served as a model. At least, this
fact is a promise of better things.
Our own federal legislation is more and more in gear
with the Declaration of Human Rights as well as with the
idea which is central to the Prime Minister's philosophy,
that the basis of political society is the individual human
being, possessing "inalienable rights over and above capital, the nation, tradition, the church and even the state."
As the Prime Minister said once when visiting Australia,
the goals of government should be to realize "maximum
human dignity, maximum human welfare, maximum
environmental quality and minimum violence in human
relationships." These are certainly the long-term goals of
the United Nations, particularly the goals of the Third
Committee on which I had the honour to serve.
OFFICIAL REPORT
TRANSLATION SERVICES-QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, before the
Orders of the Day are called I should like to rise on a
question of privilege.
[Translation]
I refer to a serious mistake in the French text of my
speech on the Constitution which I made on March 28. As
recorded on pages 270 and 271 of the English text, I
stated:
[English]
There is a proposal in the committee's report on the
subject of the Bill of Rights, at page 20, to which . .. I
object. The proposal is:
The right of the individual person to the enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived
thereof except in accordance with the public good
and for just compensation.
[Hon. Miss Lapointe.]

April 25, 1972

The proposal is that that should be included in the
Bill of Rights. I think that is unnecessary.
[Translation]
In the French version, we find this:
Au sujet de la Déclaration des droits, à la page 20, le
rapport du comité contient une proposition à laquelle
je m'oppose. Voici la proposition:
Le droit de tout individu à la vie, à la liberté et à la
sécurité de sa personne, et le droit de ne pas en être
privé, sauf en conformité des principes de justice
fondamentale.
Of course, honourable senators, this is not the same
thing at all, and I strongly object to this being given as the
translation of what I said in English, as follows:
The right of the individual person to the enjoyment
of property, et cetera.
This should read, I suggest, as follows:
Le droit de l'individu à la jouissance de ses biens et
le droit de ne pas en être privé, sauf en conformité du
bien public et contre un dédommagement équitable.
I ask the editors of Hansard to make the necessary
correction.

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
CONSIDERATION OF FINAL REPORT OF SPECIAL JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, March 29, consideration of the final report of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on the
Constitution of Canada, tabled in the Senate on Thursday,
March 16, 1972.
Hon. Paul Yuzyk: Honourable senators, the preparations
for the celebration of the centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 stimulated a general public interest in the
Constitution of Canada. The mounting difficulties which
arose between the federal government and provincial governments regarding powers of jurisdiction with respect to
the new problems confronting the emerging new society
led to several federal-provincial conferences which followed the Confederation of Tomorrow Conference sponsored by the Government of Ontario in November of 1967.
When it became apparent that progress in constitutional
revision was painfully slow at these top-level meetings,
the government decided that if global revision was to be
achieved Parliament and the people must necessarily be
involved.

Accordingly, in January 1970, a Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on the
Constitution of Canada was established to make a comprehensive review of the Constitution. The report of this
committee was tabled in both houses on March 16 this
year.
It is important to note that in its two years of intensive
effort the committee held 145 public meetings, including
72 sessions in 47 cities and towns located in all the provinces and territories. The 1,486 witnesses who appeared
before the committee ranged from acknowledged experts,

A

SENATE DEBATES

leaders in various walks of life, representatives of various
institutions and organizations to students and common
people, such as individual labourers, farmers, housewives,
trappers and others. The evidence was published fully in
both official languages in the records of Parliament-93
volumes-and is available to all who may wish to study
this important material.
This was a large-scale national exercise in participatory
democracy. It was the first time in the history of Canada
that a parliamentary committee undertook such an ambitious series of hearings to gauge public opinion on such an
important matter that would affect the lives of every man,
woman and child in this country. Many mayors and citizens expressed their great delight and gratitude to have a
parliamentary body visit their area and hear their opinions on vital issues; we heard many requests for parliamentary committees to hold similar meetings on important topics in the future from time to time throughout
Canada. This method of ascertaining public opinion falls
just short of conducting a referendum.
We should remember that Canadians won their democratic rights, their freedom, independence and sovereignty not through revolution, although rebellions took place
in 1837, but through the process of evolution. Let us
remember that many countries, such as France, the
United States, the Soviet Union and others, created their
constitutions dramatically in the wake of revolution with
bloodshed. Canada, however, inherited the British tradition, and our Constitution, the British North America Act
of 1867, came as a result of long and arduous discussions
over a period of three years. At that time, Canadian
parliamentarians, the founding fathers, under the leadership of Sir John A. Macdonald, were not under any threat
of internal violence or coercion from Britain or the United
States. Firm negotiation and reasonable compromise
were the methods employed to draw up the Constitution
and also to bring about the subsequent amendments,
always in times of peace. We are probably one of the few
countries of the world which have taken the matter of
total constitutional revision beforehand directly to the
people.
The final product of the committee is a report which
embodies recommendations hammered out as a tolerable
and reasonable compromise. It reflects an agreement
arrived at by representatives of all the political parties as
well as their differences of opinion within the parties.
Taking into consideration the consensus of public opinion, when it was clearly evident, as well as their own
personal views, the members of the committee, who themselves are fairly representative of Canadian society, have
presented proposals that reflect the main streams of opinion of this diverse society. Consequently, it was not a
unanimous report. Uppermost in the minds of these parliamentarians, however, were the best interests of Canada
as a whole.
It would not be fair if special tribute were not paid to
those of the committee who performed the lion's share of
the heavy work. I mention in particular Dr. Mark MacGuigan, a former professor of law, who was the co-chairman
from the House of Commons side from the very beginning
to the end; he wrote a great part of the original draft. Of
course, special mention should be made of Senator Gildas

Molgat, my colleague from Manitoba, the co-chairman
from the Senate who assumed his duties towards the end
of the hearings. Both of these gentlemen were excellent
chairmen of public meetings and internal meetings of the
committee; both displayed fairness, sympathy, understanding and a deep knowledge of the people, their problems, aspirations and needs.
* (2050)

Special mention should also be made of the members of
the steering committee, the immediate staff and the
clerks, who spent many extra hours and days preparing
the draft of the various sections of the report, and their
revisions, for presentation to the many sittings of the
committee. For their great input and hard work they
deserve special thanks. And of course all other members
of the committee deserve the deep gratitude of the
Canadian people for their contributions and sense of
duty, especially for the sacrifices made of much overtime,
patience and even health.
It would be impossible for one person to examine adequately in a normal speech this comprehensive report
which contains six parts divided into 37 chapters presenting 105 recommendations. I shall therefore confine myself
to the field of my special interest for which I was given
responsibility as member of the all-party steering committee which consisted of seven persons. Although I was
heavily involved in all sections and aspects of the report,
my special responsibility was the place and the rights of
the non-British, non-French ethno-cultural groups in the
new Constitution of Canada.
Honourable senators, at the time when the Joint Parliamentary Committee came into being I took the stand that
a new constitution is essential to Canada. In my speech to
this chamber on February 17, 1970, I stated:
Yet it must be remembered that the British North
America Act is in fact a colonial statute, passed by the
British Parliament in London over a hundred years
ago. There is no doubt that it is out of tune with
modern times. The situation in our country has drastically changed, for in the hundred years we have
evolved from a preponderantly stable agricultural
society to a vast industrialized, technological, urbanized and affluent society active in world affairs, and
as a result our needs have greatly changed. Even if
some of the provisions require little or no change, it is
obvious that new provisions are required to meet new
needs, and a general overall revision to improve the
document is necessary.
Consequently, I am in full agreement with Recommendation 1: "Canada should have a new and distinctively
Canadian Constitution, one which would be a new whole
even though it would utilize many of the same parts." The
arguments for a new constitution are set out in chapter 3.
Stating that a new constitution ought to be "both an
inspiration and a mirror for its community," the committee defines the purpose of a constitution as being "to
distribute the powers of government according to the
wishes of a particular national community and to enunciate its fundamental values and common goals." The committee goes on to say that the British North America Act
with all its amendments "does not reflect the Canadian
reality of today: an independent, democratic, officially

304

SENATE DEBATES

bilingual, multicultural, federal state," which is now the
Canadian identity and will be for generations to come. In
the hearings across the country there was a strong current
in favour of a new constitution that would be distinctively
Canadian and functionally contemporary.
For reasons of functionalism and flexibility and to meet
the regional differences the committee recommends
greater decentralization in areas of culture and social
policy and greater centralization in the regulation of the
economy. This means the expansion of provincial powers
in income support, marriage and divorce, educational
television, criminal law, taxing powers and some international arrangements, sharing powers with the federal government with respect to appointments to the Senate and
Supreme Court and limitations with respect to federal
spending in fields of provincial jurisdiction. On the other
hand, federal powers are to be increased with respect to
jurisdiction over air and water pollution, international
and interprovincial trade and commerce, incomes, securities regulations, financial institutions, unfair competition
and foreign ownership.
Considerable federal government administrative decentralization is proposed in order to allow more regionalized
government service which would be closer to the people
of these regions and therefore more efficient. Such a
redistribution of powers, it is believed, would produce a
more viable federal system serving the best interests of
Canada as a whole and also her people and their particular needs in the various regions.
It is recommended by the committee that "the Canadian
Constitution should have a preamble which would proclaim the basic objectives of Canadian federal democracy." This is the only place in the Constitution where it can
be stated in broad terms what kind of a country Canada is
and what she aspires to be. The Canadian nation is distinguished as "a free people in a free society; a country
characterized by rich diversity in linguistic communities,
cultural heritages and regional identities; a country where
individual fulfilment is the fundamental goal of society; a
country where individual Canadians look to the state not
simply as a vehicle by which to serve their own self-interest but as a vehicle by which they can contribute to the
well-being of other Canadians."
The basic objectives of Canada that should be included
in the preamble to the new constitution are the following:
1. To establish a federal system of government
within a democratic society;
2. To protect and enhance basic human rights;
3. To develop Canada as a bilingual and multicultural country in which all its citizens, male and female,
young and old, native peoples and Métis, and all
groups from every ethnic origin feel equally at home;
4. To promote economic, social and cultural equality
for all Canadians as individuals and to reduce regional economic disparities;
5. To present Canada as a pluralistic mosaic, a free
and open society which challenges the talents of her
people;
6. To seek world peace and security, and international social progress.
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.]

April 25, 1972

One of the most controversial recommendations was
number 7, which deals with self-determination:
If the citizens of a part of Canada at some time democratically declared themselves in favour of political
arrangements which were contrary to the continuation of our present political structures, the disagreement should be resolved by political negotiation, not
by the use of military or other coercive force.
a

(2100)

Some Quebecers argued that their province should have
the right of self-determination and even secession. The
committee referred to article 1 of the United Nations
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966)
which states:
All peoples have the right of self-determination. By
virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and
cultural development.
Although the large majority of French Canadians live in
Quebec, there are large numbers occupying large areas in
New Brunswick, Northern Ontario and elsewhere. It is
fundamentally a question of self-determination for a
people or self-determination for a province; the two are
not equivalent, as people are a natural entity and a province is an artificial one. Since the preamble should recognize that the existence of Canadian society rests on the
free consent of its citizens and their collective will to live
together, differences and disagreements should be settled
by peaceful means. All peoples of Canada will be able to
achieve their aspirations more effectively within the proposed more flexible federal system.
The committee endorses the entrenchment of certain
basic political, legal and human rights, to be included in a
Bill of Rights as part of the Canadian Constitution. Guaranteed should be political freedoms of conscience and
religion; of thought, opinion, and expression; of peaceful
assembly and of association; the inalienability of the right
to citizenship; protection of a citizen's life, liberty, and
security of his person; protection against arbitrary seizure
of his property, except for the public good and for just
compensation; prohibition of discrimination by reason of
sex, race, ethnic origin, colour or religion; prohibition of
discrimination in employment, or in membership in
professional, trade or other occupational associations, or
in obtaining public accommodation and services, or in
owning, renting or holding property; as well as other
provisions contained in the Canadian Bill of Rights of
1960.
The committee considered the arguments against the
entrenchment of a Bill of Rights, but came to the conclusion that an entrenched Bill of Rights was a more effective guarantee to individuals. Succinctly stated, it is a
question of who would have the final word-a court which
has the right to interpret what a legislature enacts, or a
legislature which has the right to amend a judicial interpretation. I do not want to discuss all the arguments pro
and con; I am satisfied that courts in a democratic society
eventually accept what the majority wants, and that competing interests of majority rule and minority rights are in
accordance with the essence of democracy. Canada is a
country of numerous minorities, all of whom want fair
treatment.

SENATE DEBATES

Probably one of the most important questions to be
settled in a new constitution is that of language rights.
Because language is a vital part of the culture of most
peoples, its recognition is of great symbolic importance.
Consequently, chapter 10 on Language Rights is one of
the longest in the report.
After having studied the report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism and the Official
Languages Act of 1969 as well as the reactions of the
public, the committee recommends that English and
French be constitutionally entrenched as the two official
languages of Canada. Four other recommendations deal
with the right of any person to use either official language
in the federal and provincial legislatures and the territorial councils, in dealing with judicial or quasi-judicial federal bodies or with courts in New Brunswick, Ontario,
Quebec and the Territories, and recognition of the parents' right to choose the language of instruction in publicly supported schools where a sufficient number of persons could justify the provision of necessary facilities.
Since French is in an inferior position, federal and provincial governments are urged to upgrade French and to try
to achieve linguistic equality throughout Canada.
To the non-French, non-British ethno-cultural groups
who are interested in preserving and perpetuating their
cultures as part of the Canadian mosaic the key recommendations are numbers 27 and 28. Giving recognition to
the multicultural reality of Canada, the committee states:
The Constitution should explicitly recognize the right
of Provincial Legislatures to confer equivalent status
with the English and French languages on other languages. Federal financial assistance to support the
teaching or use of other languages would be
appropriate.
In the text explaining these recommendations the report
refers to the population statistics of Canada. It is noted
that during the period 1871 to 1961 the British element
declined proportionally from 60.55 per cent to 43.85 per
cent, the French element remained almost constant,
declining only from 31.07 per cent to 30.38 per cent, while
the other ethnic groups rapidly increased percentagewise
from 8.38 in 1871 to 25.77 in 1961. "It is expected that the
1971 census figures will show a further increase in the
percentage of Canadians who are neither British nor
French, largely at the expense of the British proportion."
Recognizing in the preamble of the new Constitution
that Canada is multicultural rather than bicultural or
unicultural, which seems to be an obvious fact, the committee considers nevertheless that this "needs formal
emphasis." There neither is nor should there be any official culture in Canada. It is further stated that:
One of the deepest aspects of our national character
has been its cultural tolerance towards minority
groups. Canadians do not feel the need to impose a
common culture nor to divorce people from their cultural roots. Al democracies allow their citizens freedom under law, but many do not go so far as to allow
cultural freedom. Canada must continue to do so, but
more consciously and more effectively.
Taking into consideration that there are large groups of
Canadians who speak German, Ukrainian, and Italian
and smaller numbers who speak many other tongues,

305

particularly in the Prairie provinces where some of these
languages are spoken more than French, the committee in
majority approved constitutional recognition for these
languages. These ethnic groups of the third elementnon-British, non-French-have "made a great contribution to the development of Canada in the years since
Confederation, and it would be fitting to recognize it in
the Constitution". One way of recognizing this contribution is to regard their languages not as foreign but give
them the status of Canadian languages as an integral part
of the Canadian linguistic fact.
Realizing that there are inherent limitations of constitutional provisions respecting languages, the committee has
decided that since the languages of the third element
ethnic groups are "regional rather than national" in the
context of Canada it would therefore be appropriate that
specific recognition be given to them at the provincial
level. This recommendation would confer no additional
rights upon the provinces, for by section 92(1) of the
B.N.A. Act, they already possess the power to amend their
own constitutions, and by section 93 they have the power
to make laws in relation to education. Several of these
languages are already taught in the elementary and
secondary public schools and at the universities of some
of the provinces.
The committee advises that:
* (2110)

The Constitution should therefore provide in its section on language rights that Provincial Legislatures
may confer rights on other language groups with
respect to use in the Legislatures themselves, or in
government administration, the courts, and education
in publicly-supported schools.
The obvious conclusion is that where it would now be
impractical to make official other languages besides English and French, there is nothing in the Constitution to
prevent them from achieving official status in the provinces, and this is even encouraged. It is made clear that
the officiality of English and French "does not confer any
priority with respect to culture."
Since the new Constitution would recognize bilingualism and multiculturalism, it is logical that this fact be
appropriately reflected also in the policies of the provincial governments, including educational policies. I refer,
honourable senators, to chapter 29 on Education. This
means that the federal government must have certain
obligations in this respect to the provincial governments.
The report therefore concludes:
Moreover, where a Province confers a particular
public right upon a language group, it would be
appropriate for the Federal Government to provide a
measure of financial assistance. By doing so, it would
help the Provinces to provide a valuable public service to a group of citizens.
Honourable senators, I am satisfied that the members of
the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution of
Canada, in dealing with the problems of the non-British,
non-French ethno-cultural groups, were as objective, fair,
understanding and sympathetic as could be expected of
them. The committee carefully studied the briefs and
submissions of the organizations that represented these

SENATE DEBATES
groups, and in general adopted the recommendations
which were consensual and practical, keeping the best
interests of Canada in mind.
Personally, this report gives me a great deal of deep
satisfaction. It embodies most of what I have been striving
and fighting for since I became a member of the Senate in
February 1963. Gaining recognition of language and cultural rights for the ethnic groups of the third element in
the new Constitution of Canada is the fulfilment of my
life dream and my steadfast endeavours which, I am
pleased, received the backing of the leaders and the
Senate body. This I gratefully acknowledge.
I have delivered several speeches in this chamber on the
topic of the Canadian identity, multiculturalism and the
rights of the ethno-cultural groups. My maiden speech of
March 3, 1964, was published as a separate pamphlet by
the Queen's Printer with the title "Canada: A Multicultural Nation." It was subsequently reprinted several times in
pamphlet form and used frequently by ethnic groups in
the hearings of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism
and Biculturalism. On October 1, 1968, I drew the attention of the Senate to the concern of these groups about
constitutional changes proposed at the federal-provincial
conferences.
Then, with the support of an ad hoc committee of the
Senate, consisting of Senators Maurice Lamontagne,
David Croll, Norman A. M. MacKenzie, James Gladstone
and myself, with funds supplied by the Department of the
Secretary of State and the Ontario government, and with
the support of the Canadian Folk Arts Council, on
December 13, 14 and 15, 1968, I convened the Thinkers'
Conference on Cultural Rights, in which leading Canadian leaders and representatives of 20 leading ethnic groups
participated together for the first time in Canada. The
resolutions rejecting the concept of biculturalism and
endorsing official recognition of multiculturalism, the
papers and reports were all sent to the Prime Minister of
Canada and all the Premiers of the provinces, from most
of whom came a favourable response. I gave a report of
this important conference to the Senate on July 8, 1969, in
the debate on the Official Languages Bill, in which I
supported the bill but urged that the non-English, nonFrench languages be recognized as Canadian languages.
Finally, on February 17, 1970, following the launching of
the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Constitution of
Canada, I delivered a lengthy address on constitutional
revision in which I supplied statistics, a graph and a chart,
and in which I advocated that a bilingual and multicultural Canadian nation was the all-inclusive Canadian
identity.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: May I ask a question of the honourable senator? What did he mean when he said, or recommended, that languages other than French and English be
recognized as Canadian languages? Recognized where
and how?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Recognized generally in the Constitution, in the terms that we have it recognized here. Canada
is a bilingual and multicultural nation, and since multiculturalism includes languages, all these languages should be
considered as Canadian and not foreign. That is what has
taken place now, as recommended by the joint parliamentary committee. The committee has given general recogni[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.]

April 25, 1972

tion. But the most important thing is that these languages
be given recognition where they can be used most effectively, which is within the system of education and within
the provinces. The joint parliamentary committee recognizes that the provinces have jurisdiction in this field and
that they can give recognition to these languages and
cultures within the education system as well as within
legislatures and courts. That is what I have been referring
to.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Are you dreaming? Are you
serious?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: I am very serious, Senator Choquette. It
is very important that these languages, which are part of
the Canadian scene, should be recognized as Canadian
languages. I do not say as official languages because
reports from both Houses of Parliament would have to be
printed in those languages. I merely claim that these languages should be recognized as part of the Canadian
scene and should be encouraged to develop within
Canada. Eight years ago this concept was scorned; today
it has received general acceptance, thanks in a great measure to the attitude of the young generation.
* (2120)

In conclusion, I would like to quote from my maiden
speech of March 3, 1964, referring to the recognition of
multiculturalism and the implementation of the principle
of unity in continuing diversity:
A great architect of Canada, Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, under whose administration the Prairies
were peopled by various groups of the third element,
left, some 60 years ago, the following message for
future generations:
I have visited in England one of those models of
Gothic architecture which the hand of genius,
guided by an unerring faith, has moulded into a
harmonious whole. This cathedral is made of
marble, oak and granite. It is the image of the nation
I would like to see Canada become. For here, I want
the marble to remain the marble; the granite to
remain the granite; the oak to remain the oak; and
out of all these elements I would build a nation great
among the nations of the world.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: It is significant that Prime Minister
Trudeau used a part of this quotation when the present
Government launched its new policy of multiculturalism
on October 8, 1971. It is also significant that President
Richard Nixon of the United States used this quotation
when he recently addressed a joint session of the Senate
and House of Commons in Ottawa on April 14 this year.
President Nixon identified this as the Canadian way and
exhorted us to remember these truths, "that variety can
mean vitality-that diversity can be a force for progress."
Regardless of how we identify Canada-whether in
terms of geography, governmental institutions, natural
resources or human resources, such as ethnic and cultural
communities-these are not enough. A state is constituted
paramountly by the collective will of the people to live,
work and sacrifice together for the common good. If this
will falters, then inevitably the nation falls. We know from
history and experience that the common strain binding

Canadians together is a pervading goodwill towards persons and people other than their own, and their love of
this great land. In their extensive travels throughout our
vast country, the members of the Constitution Committee
witnessed the vibrant spirit of Canadians of ail backgrounds, and therefore look with confidence to a better
future for Canada.
In the words of the report, "a modern Constitution for
Canada is ultimately a restatement of our faith in ourselves and our country." Our faith in freedom and democracy, truth and justice, equality and brotherhood, co-operation and peace as an antidote to tyranny, hate, bigotry,

prejudice, discrimination and war has been the strength
that has brought about and maintained Canadian unity,
which has produced progress, prosperity and general happiness for Canadian citizens. This faith and work has
built a great and dynamic Canadian nation. With continuing mutual understanding, goodwill, faith, and adherence to these high principles we will build a new and
better Canada. To facilitate the fulfilment of our worthy
aspirations, a new modemn constitution is vitally and
urgently needed, for which this report is an indispensable
basis.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

MR. RICHARD M. NIXON
PRESIDENT 0F THE UNITED STATES 0F AMERICA
TO
MEMBERS 0F THE SENATE AND 0F THE HOUSE 0F COMMONS
IN THE
HOUSE 0F COMMONS CHAMBER, OTTAWA
ON
FRIDAY, 14TH APRIL, 1972, AT 3: 10 P.M.
Mr. Nixon was welcomed by the Right Honourable
P. E. Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada.
Rîght Hon. P. E. Trudeau (Prime Minister): Mr. President of the United States, Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr.
Speaker of the House of Commons, members of the Parliament of Canada:
On behalf of the people of Canada, and of their parliamentary representatives gathered in this chamber, I
extend to you, Mr. President, and to Mrs. Nixon, a warm
welcome to Ottawa.
You, sir, are the flfth holder of your office to hanour a
joint session of the Parliament of Canada. Because your
colleague President Eisenhower visited this place twice,
your address will be the sixth such to be heard here.
[Translation]
You see before you, Mr. President, Canadians from
every corner of this f ar-flung land we caîl Canada. They
reflect nat just the geography of the country but as well
the great mixture of peaples which. adds such richness
and variety to aur national if e. The different origins of
many of these men and women, and the languages they
speak, illustrate the diversity of Canada. Their presence
in the Chamber symbolizes our unity of purpase and our
devotion ta our parliamentary heritage. Part of that tradition was carried from France to England by the Norman
conqueror nine centuries ago. It blassomed there and
found its way naturally to Canada where it serves us
admirably, and distinguishes us from the many countries
elsew-here in the hemisphere.
[English]
Your presence here today, Mr. President, is striking
evidence of the flexible yet harmonlous relationship

which has evolved aver the years between the United
States and Canada. Our two countries and our two peapies have much in common, but they are nat identical in
their moods nar in their interests, and it is a disservice ta
a proper understanding of one anather if we overlook
these distinctions. Our friendship is more dynamie
because of aur differences, and aur relationship deeper
and wider. Those differences stem from. a past which,
parallel ta yaurs, is distinctive; and from governmnental
institutions which preserve like values but by different
means.
In aur meetings this marning we spake a camman ianguage, emplaying familiar idioms, recalling an entwined
history, and discussing prablems identifiable ta each in
ternis af values we share and respect. What ather two
cauntries in the warld can affer ta their peaples and
leaders such a cantributian ta understanding?
What is the effect on Canada and Canadians of thc
existence next daar ta us of the great country of America?
Certainly, it is one af stimulation. There is little that
the United States daes that is not feit or naticed in
Canada. Your lofty goals, your good natured hospitality,
yaur successes and yaur faîlures, your accamplishments
and yaur shortcamings, your thrabbing vitality, are al
deeply imprinted in the collective conscience of Canadians. Understandably, there is littie that Canadians do
which they do not compare with similar activity in the
United States.
Our relatianship with you is too complex ta be described, too involved ta be understaod fully, tao deeply
entrenched ta be dîsregarded. We are no more capable of
living in isolation framn you than we are desirous of doing
so. For thase reasons, the basic friendship of Canada in
the past several decades has been taken for granted by
the 'United States, as we have accepted yours. I assure

It is that friendship that has contributed immeasurably
to the high degree of economic well-being, physical
security and general happiness enjoyed by the peoples
of both countries.
It is an expression of that friendship that we welcome
you, Sir, to this special session of the Parliament of
Canada.
[Translation]
Mr. Richard M. Nixon (President of the United States):
Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr. Speaker of
the Senate, Mr. Prime Minister, hon. members of the
Parliament of Canada, distinguished hosts and friends, I
deeply appreciate your kind invitation as well as your
cordial welcome.
[Englsh]
To all of you who have welcomed Mrs. Nixon and me
so warmly on this occasion, I trust you will make
allowance for my attempt to speak in the language I
studied 37 years ago. When I tried it today, before I
came, on our top linguist in the American government,
General Walters, he said, "Go ahead, you speak French
with a Canadian accent".
I will have to admit that I am not very much
at home in the French language but, as a former parliamentarian in my own country, I feel very much at
home in this Chamber. I am grateful for the high privilege
which your invitation represents. I am grateful, too, for
this chance to return to Canada, and for the opportunity
of signing here an historic agreement to restore and protect forever the quality of our Great Lakes which we
share together. That agreement testifies to the continuing
vitality of our unique relationship which has been
described so eloquently by the Prime Minister. In discussing that relationship today, I wish to do so in a way that
bas not always been customary when leaders of our two
countries have met. Through the years our speeches on
such occasions have often centered on the decades of
unbroken friendship we have enjoyed and our four thousand miles of unfortified frontier. In focusing on our
peaceful borders and our peaceful history, they have
tended to gloss over the fact that there are real problems
between us. They have tended to create the false impression that our countries are essentially alike. It is time for
Canadians and Americans to move beyond the sentimental rhetoric of the past. It is time for us to recognize that
we have very separate identities; that we have significant
differences; and that nobody's interests are furthered
when these realities are obscured.
Our peaceful borders and our peaceful history are
important symbols, to be sure. What they symbolize, however, is the spirit of respect and restraint which allows us
to co-operate despite our differences in ways which help

us both. American policy toward Canada is rooted in that
spirit. Our policy toward Canada reflects the new
approach we are taking in all of our foreign relations, an
approach which has been called the Nixon Doctrine. That
doctrine rests on the premise that mature partners must
have autonomous independent policies; each nation must
define the nature of its own interests; each nation must
decide the requirements of its own security; each nation
must determine the path of its own progress. What we
seek is a policy which enables us to share international
responsibilities in a spirit of international partnership.
We believe that the spirit of partnership is strongest
when partners are self-reliant. For among nations, as
within nations, the soundest unity is that which respects
diversity, and the strongest cohesion is that which rejects
coercion.
Over the years the people of Canada have come to
understand these concepts particularly well. Within your
own borders, you have been working to bring a wide
variety of peoples and provinces and points of view into
a great national union, a union which honors the integrity of its constituent elements. It was Prime Minister
Laurierwho said of Canada's differing components: "I
want the marble to remain the marble; I want the granite
to remain the granite; I want the oak to remain the oak".
This has been the Canadian way. As a result, Canadians
have helped to teach the world, as Governor General
Massey once said, that the "toleration of differences is
the measure of civilization".
Today, more than ever before, we need to apply that
understanding to the whole range of world affairs. To
begin with, we must apply it in our dealings with one
another. We must realize that we are triends, not because there have been no problems between us, but
because we have trusted one another enough to be candid about our problems and because our candour bas
nourished our co-operation.
Last December your Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau) and
I met in Washington and he asked me if I thought the
United States would always want a surplus trade balance with Canada so that we could always export capital here. My answer then, and my answer now is no.
As I said to him at that time, we in the United States
saw this same problem from the other side before World
War I. We then depended on European capital for Our
development and we wanted to free ourselves from that
dependence. So, we fully understand that Canada is in
that same position today.
Canada is the largest trading partner of the United
States.
It is very important that that be noted in Japan, too.
Our economies have become highly interdependent.
But the fact that our mutual interdependence and our
mutual desire for independence need not be inconsistent
traits. No self-respecting nation can or should accept the
proposition that it should always be economically dependent upon any other nation. Let us recognize once

310

April

and for all that the only basis for a sound and healthy
relationship between our two proud peoples is to find
a pattern of economic interaction which is beneficial to
both our countries and which respects Canada's right
to chart its own economic course. We must also build a
new spirit of partnership within the western hemisphere
that we share together. It has been said that Canada is
bounded "on the north by gold, on the west by the East,
on the east by history, and on the south by friends".
We hope that will always be the case. We hope it will
be the case not only with respect to the United States,
your immediate neighbour on the south, but with respect to all your southern neighbours and ours, who are
bound by the great forces of geography and history which
are distinctive to the New World. But geography and
history alone do not make a community. A true community must be a living entity in which the individuality of each member is a source of pride to all members,
in which the unity of all is a source of strength to each.
And the great community of the Americas cannot be
complete without the participation of Canada. That is
why we have been encouraged by the recent decisions of
Canada to upgrade its participation as an observer in the
Organization of American States to ambassadorial status
and to apply for membership in the Inter-American Development Bank. For both of these institutions made the
abstract concept of community within the Americas a
living reality.
A sound concept of community is also important in
another international area that we share, the Atlantic
Alliance. Just one month after my inauguration as President of the United States, I observed that a new spirit of
co-operation within that alliance was essential as we
began a new search for co-operation between East and
West. The recent agreements concerning Berlin, and the
fact, for example, that thousands of families were reunited this Easter for the first time in many years, are among
the first fruits of a new era of East-West negotiation.
But, as we seek better relations with our adversaries,
it becomes all the more important to strengthen the
alliances with our friends. We must never forget that the
strength and the unity of the West has been an indispensable element in helping to bring about the new era
of negotiation with the East. That is why we began our
round of summit talks last December by meeting with the
Prime Minister of Canada and then with the leaders of
other close allies. This is why our East-West conversations
will always be accompanied by full and genuine consultations within the Atlantic Alliance.
This alliance began as a way of pooling military
resources. Today it is a way of pooling our intellectual
and our diplomatic resources as well. Like our federal
approaches to nationhood, like our Canadian-American
brotherhood, like our inter-American neighbourhood, the
Atlantic Alliance has achieved a creative unity in which
the individuality of its members is respected and
advanced.
Let us now turn to the world as a whole, for this is
where the challenge of building a true community will be

25

1972

most difficult and most important. We in Canada and the
United States, have always been proud to live in what is
called the New World. Today there is a new world coming for everybody who lives on this globe. It is our responsibility to make this new world a better world than
the world we have known. Canadians and Americans
have fought and died together in two world wars in this
century. We live now in what has been called a postwar era. But mankind has known a long succession of
post-war eras. And each one of them has turned out to be
a pre-war era as well. The challenge we face today is to
build a permanent post-war era, an era of lasting peace.
My visit to Ottawa comes midway between my visits
to Peking and Moscow. In many respects these journeys
are very different. In the People's Republic of China, we
opened a new dialogue after 22 years of virtually no
communication. In the Soviet Union, there is an opportunity to bring a continuing dialogue to productive conclusions. But in their central aim these journeys to
Peking and Moscow are alike. Neither visit is directed
against anyone, adversary or ally. Both are for the betterment of everyone, for the peace of all mankind. However, we must not allow the fact of summit meetings to
create any unrealistic euphoria.
The responsibility for building peace rests with special
weight upon the great powers. Whether the great powers
fulfil that responsibility depends not on the atmospherics
of their diplomacy but on the realities of their behavior.
Great powers must not treat a period of detente as an
interlude between periods of tension. Better relations
among all nations require restraint by great nations, both
in dealing with each other and in dealing with the rest of
the world. We can agree to limit arms. We can declare our
peaceful purposes. But neither the limitation of arms nor
the declaration of peaceful purposes will bring peace if,
directly or indirectly, the aggressive use of existing weapons is encouraged. The great powers have a responsibility
for the aggressive actions of those to whom they give the
means of embarking on such action. The great powers
must use their influence to halt aggression, not to encourage it. The structure of world peace cannot be built unless
the great powers join together to build it. Its strength will
grow only as all nations, of all political and social systems,
come to accept its validity and sustain its vitality. This
does not mean the great powers must always agree.
We expect to continue to have profound philosophical
and diplomatic differences with the Soviet Union and
with the People's Republic of China in a number of areas.
But, through opening new lines of communication, we
hope to increase the chance that in the future we shall
talk about our differences and not fight about them. As
we have prepared for both these journeys the experience
of Canada has been most helpful. I am grateful to both
the Prime Minister and to the Opposition Leader, Mr.
Stanfield, for sharing their insights with us as we embarked on these endeavours. As we continue together our
common quest for a better world order, let us apply the
lessons we have learned so well on this continent: that
we can walk our own road in our own way without

April 25.1 1972

SENATE DEBATES

moving farther apart; that we can grow dloser together
without growing more alike; that peaceful competition
can produce winners without producing losers; that success for some need not mean setbacks for the rest; that
a rising tide will lift ail of our boats; that ta go forward
at ail is ta go farward together; that the enemy of peace
is not independence but isolation; that the way ta peace
is an open world.
And let us remember taa, these truths that we
have found together, that variety can mean vitality; that
diversity can be a force for pragress; and that aur ultimate destiny is indivisible.
When I spoke at the St. Lawrence seaway ceremonies
in 1969, 1 borrowed some words from the monument
there which I had joined Queen Elizabeth in dedicating
just ten years before. That monument, as its inscription
puts it:
bears witness ta the comman purpose of two nations
whase frontiers are the frontiers of friendship, whose

ways are the ways of freedom, whose works are the
works of peace.
The truth ta which the inscription testifies is of profaund importance ta people everywhere in this warld.
For the ability of aur two nations, Canada and the
United States, ta preserve the frontiers of friendship, ta
walk in the ways of freedam, and ta pursue the works of
peace provides example and encouragement ta ail who
seek these same objectives, wherever they may live.
There is nothing more exciting than a time of new
beginnings. A member of this body caught that spirit
when he spoke in Parliament about the beginnings of
Canadian nationhood 100 years aga. Listen ta him:
Blood pulsed in aur veins, new hopes fired aur
hearts, new horizons lifted and widened, new visions
came ta us in the night watches.
May that same sense of excitement inspire aur two
nations as we help lead the world ta new beginnings
today.

DOCUMENTS TABLED
Hon. Paul Martin tabled:
Copies of a communiqué issued by the Department
of External Affairs on April 4, 1972, respecting the
Canadian delegation to the Third United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
UNITED NATIONS
THIRD CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT,
SANTIAGO, CHILE
Hon. Paul Martin rose, pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Third United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, which opened in Santiago, Chile,
Thursday, 13th April, 1972, and in particular to the
participation therein of the delegation from Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, as you are aware, I have
just returned from having attended the first two weeks of
the Third United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which is being held in Santiago, Chile, the first
United Nations Trade and Development Conference to
take place in Latin America.
The first of these conferences, which I attended as
Secretary of State for External Affairs, was held in
Geneva in 1964. The second conference was in Delhi in
1968 when my then colleague, the Minister of Trade and
Commerce, the late Honourable Robert Winters, was head
of the Canadian Delegation.
Regarding the conference in Santiago, I would like to
say that the President of that country, President Allende,
and the President of Mexico, addressed the delegates. So
did a number of figures well known to me and undoubtedly to other honourable senators, such as the Secretary
General of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim; the Secretary General of UNCTAD, which is an acronym for
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,
Secretary General Perez-Guerrero, a distinguished statesman from Venezuela; and the World Bank President,
Robert McNamara; as well as the President of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Environment to
be held in Stockholm, Mr. Maurice Strong of Canada.
This is, of course, a conference of governments. It is the
largest conference of sovereign governments ever held in
the history of the world and it is being conducted at the
ministerial level. For instance, Germany has sent Dr. Karl
Schiller who heads the two ministries of Economy and of
Finance; France sent Giscard d'Estaing, its Minister of
Economy and Finance; from Britain came Michael Noble,
the Trade Minister; the European Communities were
represented by their President, Sicco Mansholt; the Minister of Industry and Commerce of Trinidad and Tobago,

Mr. Padmore came, as did Trade Minister Mishra from
India, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Trade and Industry of Australia, J. D. Anthony. The conference will continue for another month, but a number of
the ministers have already returned to their home countries to speak on the conference. For example, I find that
there was a debate last Wednesday in the British House of
Lords on this subject.
It is too early to forecast the outcome of this conference,
the importance of which I hope to establish before I have
taken my seat. I can at least say that the main issues are
now before the delegates. These issues are vital to the
future peace of the world, and in the effort which has
been made by most countries to improve the standard of
living of people in underdeveloped nations of the world.
There is the question of how the international monetary
system should be reformed, and in what form. There is
the subject of improved access to major world commodity
markets. There is the matter of the debt burden borne by
some developing countries, and the terms and conditions
on which aid is being supplied. And there is the dilemma
of how to aid the least developed-that is the poorest-of
the developing countries.
0 (1410)

There is no doubt that the way the trade and monetary
crisis of last autumn began and eventually evolved did not
sit well with governments of the developing countries.
Countries which are in chronic balance of payments difficulties do not have much sympathy when a great nation,
which has been running a consistent trading surplus,
finds itself experiencing a few difficult years. Some did
not like the surcharge temporarily imposed on their
exports; some were disturbed by the effective revaluation
of their currencies in relation to the dollar; some were
concerned at the diminution in the value of the dollars
they were holding as reserve currency; all the developing
countries were annoyed that the Smithsonian Agreement
was concluded last December in Washington by a small
group of the wealthiest countries, without apparent concern for the effects of their decisions on other members of
the international community.
We in Canada have some understanding of the perspective of developing countries on this issue, and believe that
developing countries have a valid claim to a larger voice
in determining future arrangements, which Canada
believes should be conducted within the framework of the
International Monetary Fund. And I was instructed by the
government to say so and did. We support the full participation of all members of the IMF organization, which
includes many developing countries, and the evolution of
a monetary system suited to the present.
The process of monetary reform which is now under
way in the International Monetary Fund will involve one
of the major adjustments in the economic area.
I think I can say that Canada was as concerned as any
country at the disturbance of the international trade scene
in the latter part of 1971. As a result, we regard the

SENATE DEBATES

I saw in yesterday's Globe and Mail that John Hannah,
the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, spoke on Thursday in Washington
to an international development conference on behalf of
President Nixon. He indicated American willingness to
join other nations in making up to $2 billion available to
developing nations to help finance their economic growth.
The timing and the procedures appear to be open for
negotiation.
I do not have before me the full text of Mr. Hannah's
remarks, but it does seem to represent an attempt to meet
the developing nations' claims for additional multilateral
financing, and the $2 billion figure is the same one
Canada proposed as an objective for concessional financing through the multilateral agencies.
It will be recalled that the Canadian Secretary of State
for External Affairs, Mr. Sharp, said not too long ago, as
indeed was emphasized in the Foreign Policy Review, that
it was the intention of the government more and more to
allocate its assistance
funds through multilateral
organizations.
I told the conference that we would hope that the funding of these agencies might reach this $2 billion figure as
and when new levels of subscription are agreed upon. I
did not mention a target, but the largest of the multilateral
aid agencies is the IDA, and in due course there will have
to be negotiations looking towards the fourth replenishment of the fund of this body. I indicated to the conference that if this proposal is accepted, Canada would be
prepared to shoulder a proportionate share of the burden.
I was told privately that this was regarded as a very
positive initiative, and we have strong hopes that the
proposal will be endorsed by the conference in Santiago.
An extension of this issue of assistance to the development countries is that of helping the poorest or less developed of the developing countries. The President of the
International Bank, Mr. McNamara, in, I thought, a very
lucid statement, pointed out the plight of the poorest
countries-those with a per capita GNP of less than $200 a
year, but which contain 67 per cent of the world's population-which during the first development decade of the
1960s grew at only 1.5 per cent annually. Mr. McNamara
told us that the 6 per cent gross goal established for the
second development decade could not be met without
substantial flows of official development assistance, and
current and projected flows of the official development
assistance were wholly inadequate. These are his words:
Unless ODA expands, the poorest countries will
simply be unable to reach their objectives, and many
of the others will face increasingly serious problems
of debt.
There are a group of 25 countries earmarked as the
least developed of the developing countries. For many of
them, an improvement in trade does not help them very
much because they have so little international trade. We
hope that our initiative for financing the multilateral
agencies will be of particular use to these poorest countries. I may say that the vast majority of our own official
development assistance loans are interest-free, have a tenyear grace period, and a maturity of fifty years.
I also told the conference that Canada would recommend acceptance of a new development assistance com[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

mittee of the OECD terms target requiring a 25 per cent
grant element threshold for official development assistance, and a grant element of 86 per cent on the overall
official development assistance program. I am hopeful
that something can be done at this third conference for
those less-developed countries. There will continue to be
discussions at the conference, not only between developed
countries as to the level of assistance but between groups
of developing countries in regard to the priority that
should be given to helping these less-developed nations.
* (1430)

Honourable senators, I should provide a caution that
the success or failure of this conference will not be determined at its conclusion. The success of the first conference in 1964 was certainly not apparent at that time. It
became more apparent by the second conference in Delhi
in 1968; and I think many of us at Santiago were more
aware of the achievements of UNCTAD II than were
some of the delegates who took part in the Delhi conference in 1968. I would therefore suggest that we may have
to defer our final evaluation of the results of this conference perhaps even until the next conference takes place
some four years from now.
I may say that I regard this organization of UNCTAD as
one of the most important of the various international
organizations set up under the auspices of the United
Nations. Since the end of the war, countries like Canada
have been giving grants in aid to help raise the standard
of living of the nations that represent the majority of the
people in the world. The richer nations of this period have
become richer and, notwithstanding the great volumes of
assistance that have been accorded, the poorer nations
are becoming poorer. This is the stark fact in characterizing the nature of the gap that exists between the developed and the underdeveloped nations of the world.
We have our problems at home, of course. We have our
poor, we have our undeveloped areas. So have other
nations. However, I can say with much conviction that,
unless the kind of effort that is now under way in Santiago succeeds, the prospects for the world are indeed
very bleak. It is not possible to narrow this gap simply by
increases in the amounts of moneys that nations allocate
to other countries for development purposes. The more
effective way will be to increase the trading capacity and
the trading opportunities of these developing nations.
At the first conference in Geneva we took the position
that the way to do that was through the discussions that
were then under way at the GATT. We continued to rely
on the GATT as the foremost instrument to develop the
trade of the world. But we have to recognize that this can
best be done, as far as the less-developed nations are
concerned, less on a basis of equal treatment than on the
recognition of their special economic needs. This is very
closely related not only to improving their standard of life
but to the efforts that are being made in many agencies,
by all governments, in trying to establish stable conditions
that will lead to peace in the world. Unless this problem is
solved there will be no peace. Thus there is no problem
more important than the problem faced by the sovereign
nations of the world in Chile at this time.
The Chilean government had taken great care in providing for the delegates a very satisfactory new conference

because most of the legislation to be presented involves

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
CONSIDERATION OF FINAL REPORT OF SPECIAL JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
the final report of the Special Joint Committee of the
Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution of
Canada, tabled in the Senate on Thursday, March 16,
1972.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I rise to
say a few words in our consideration of the final report of
the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House
of Commons on the Constitution of Canada. I do not
believe my remarks will prove to be earth-shattering, or
that they will much affect the course of Canadian history,
but there are a few things that I consider should be said,
even though I may, as a result, be mistaken for some kind
of devil's advocate.
If I were a high school teacher examining this report as
a term paper, I would give the committee a "B" for bravery, an "E" for effort, a "V" for variety, and quite good
marks for scholarship.
I cannot recall in recent times a committee with such a
constantly changing membership. This committee was set
up as a joint committee of 20 members of the House of
Commons and 10 members of the Senate. However, the
members of the houses who served on it from time to time
were much greater in number, and even the joint-chair[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

April 26, 1972

manship changed after June 29, 1971 with Senator Molgat
replacing Senator Lamontagne as co-chairman on behalf
of the Senate. About the only constant factor was Mark

MacGuigan, M.P. This constant flow of new blood may

have been either invigorating or debilitating but, at any
rate, that is why I give the report a "V" for variety.
* (1450)

The report was evidently not unanimous. There have

been leaked or otherwise disclosed a variety of "minority
reports," and even Senator Forsey's remarks, though partially concealed behind a veil of compliments-

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is usual.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: -constituted

in themselves a

minority report of considerable importance in that they
attacked, chapter and verse, some of the basic assumptions and conclusions of the majority report.

The point I am making is that the committee was given
an impossible task-let's face it-of producing a consensus that does not exist, or of establishing or recognizing a

demand by the Canadian people for drastic changes in the
Canadian Constitution-a demand that, to my mind, is

equally non-existent. In terms of political realism-realpolitik-there is no evidence that there is any such consensus or demand. Most of the provinces have had general elections since the committee was established. In none
of those elections, so far as I am aware, was the Constitution ever a factor, except that the Quebec election might

be regarded, at least in part, as having been a vote for the
federal option. There is public apathy in Canada towards
constitutional reform as such, although there is evident a
genuine and general desire that Canada continue as a
federation with Quebec constituting an integral part
thereof. The latent fear of Quebec's potential separation
from the union is the only unifying factor of any real
importance.
As stated in an editorial in the Montreal Gazette on
March 29, 1972:
It has not helped to impress the public with the
seriousness of the subject by stating that the need for
a new constitution is urgent. After all, the public can
see how the federal and provincial governments are
acting, and they are not acting as if the need is urgent.
The Victoria conference failed, without bringing the

country to the verge of collapse.
The emphasis on urgency has begun to sound a little

foolish because it is plain that very few Canadian
politicians have any reforms that they want to make
in the basic law of the country. This is even true in
Quebec to some extent, as the differences of opinion
among Quebec members of the constitutional committee showed.
If there is going to be a new constitution or a radically revised constitution, it is clear now that it will
come only after piecemeal and painstaking negotiation. So let us all stop talking about urgency.

The basic fact to remember, in my opinion, is that at

least in democratic countries, constitutions are not arbitrarily imposed; rather do they grow, like Topsy. The
Canadian Constitution in particular has been far from
static since Confederation. It has proven to be much more
flexible than was dreamed of in 1867. Canada has since

Anril 2,

1972

SENATE DEBATES

then become to all intents and purposes a sovereign state,
the master of its own destiny. It has been proven capable
of empirical response to the pressing needs of the people,
once these are fully formulated and agreed upon. Accordingly, much of the demand for federal aid to the provinces
has been met by the distribution of largesse in the form of
shared cost programs, opting-out formulae, equalization
payments, and the like. Whatever else these devices may
have accomplished, they have certainly eased the pressure for constitutional change.
In my own opinion, there is no present need or popular
demand or consensus, certainly no hue and cry, for any
massive constitutional resettlement. The time is obviously
not ripe for any such major project; to use the American
expression, there is no "clear and present danger." The
Prime Minister was probably right the first time when he
said that there is nothing much wrong with the present
Constitution. We have all learned to live with it, and even
to adjust it from time to time as the specific need arises.
We all know now that the federal-provincial conferences
on the Constitution have been completely unproductive in
terms of any single constitutional change. On the comparatively simple matter of patriating the Constitution
with a formula for amending it entirely within Canada, no
doubt the Fulton-Favreau Formula (FFF) and the Victoria Charter came close-close, but no cigar!
Perhaps we need a short rest-the pause that
refreshes-in our pursuit of constitutional change. There
are a lot of new provincial governments which will
require time to reconsider constitutional issues, and these
issues are still largely ill-defined. The constitutional aspirations of the Province of Quebec remain obscure to me.
There are problems among even the separatists-which
kind of separation, and what price separatism? And the
federalists in Quebec have not yet, with any apparent
consensus, answered the basic questions: "What kind of
federation?" or "What price federalism?"
To take but a single example of provincial attitudes, an
article entitled "The Constitution Question", under the
byline of Nick Hills, in the Montreal Gazette of April 21,
1972, discusses the position of the new Conservative government in Alberta:
As far as Lougheed is concerned, there is no sense
in having any further review of the Constitution
unless it includes machinery for changing the allocation of resources and responsibilities between Ottawa
and the provinces.
The Victoria Charter, he leaves no doubt, is a useless scrap of paper simply agreed to by a previous
Alberta government. That agreement is not binding
on the Conservatives.
As for further constitutional changes, if they do not
deal with what Lougheed considers to be a crisis
created by the labyrinth of federal-provincial costsharing agreements, then Alberta will not sign.
* (1500)

I was tempted at one time to review all the recommendations made in the report and to comment upon them.
However, I am satisfied that this too would be an exercise
in futility, and I will spare the senators the experience of
listening to such a speech.

317

While I will refrain from commenting, except in general
terms, on the report as a whole, I propose to venture some
remarks on the specific proposals for Senate reform
embodied therein. I point out that not all of these so-called
"reforms" are contained in chapter 13, entitled "The Senate." At least one-a vital one for the Senate-is contained
in chapter 5, entitled "Amendments to the Constitution."
At the present time the Senate has an absolute veto on all
constitutional amendments, because of the convention
which requires as a conditional precedent a resolution of
both houses calling upon the Parliament at Westminster
to amend the Constitution. The present report supports
the recommendation in the Victoria Charter which gives
the Senate a merely suspensive veto, for 90 days only,
over all constitutional amendments.
I need hardly say that such an amendment could provide for the abolition of the Senate or for a vast reduction
of its powers. The Senate would indeed be at the mercy of
the constitutional formula, just as the House of Lords is at
the mercy of the House of Commons at Westminster.
Without arguing at the moment that the Senate should
have an absolute rather than a suspensive veto in other
respects, it seems to me that at the very least the Senate
should retain its absolute veto in all constitutional amendments touching and concerning the powers, privileges and
immunities of the Senate. Such proposed amendments
should require the concurrence of the Senate as well as
that of the House of Commons. For myself, I could agree
to no less. In agreeing entirely to the proposals of the
Victoria Charter and of the present report the Senate
would be signing its own potential death warrant. Not
even a hardened criminal is asked to do that, and whatever our demerits in the eyes of some detractors, we are
not hardened criminals.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: May I be permitted to point out to
the honourable senator that while the Victoria Charter
provided for only a suspensive veto on constitutional
change, such change could not affect the powers of the
Senate unless made with the consent of at least six
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I am coming to that. I would not
leave that in abeyance, because my thought would not be
complete.
In the White Paper of October 1969, entitled "The Constitution and the People of Canada", it is said at page 26:
The Government of Canada has therefore advanced
proposals in the area of central institutions which
would preserve the essentials of the present system
and put them beyond reach of impulsive change.
I say "Amen" to that.
If the Senate's powers initially are to be severely curtailed, there should at least be no further or future curtailment without the consent of the Senate. I believe this is, or
should be, the attitude of most honourable senators. Certainly, it is mine. I could not vote for any formula that did
not contain this minimal constitutional safeguard.
I turn now to chapter 13Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): May I ask the honourable senator a question? I quite follow.his argument,
which I think is well founded, but would he not agree that
any proposal to limit the powers of the Senate must first

SENATE DEBATES

of all be agreed to by the Senate before it is put into
effect?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Not according to this recommendation, because there would be a delay of 90 days and in
other matters not constitutional there would be a delay of
six months, and if after that time the Senate could not
agree, then it would become law as enacted by the House
of Commons. But I am coming to that explanation in a
minute.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I think perhaps the
honourable senator is one step ahead of me. I am a step
back, saying that if these restricted powers that are to be
imposed upon the Senate are in fact to come into being,
would not the consent of the Senate be required to bring
them into being?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I am only saying that I am not
ready to sign such an agreement.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That is fair enough,
but we still have to agree here, before these powers can be
restricted..

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Oh, yes.
I turn now to chapter 13, entitled "The Senate." There
the first recommendation is that in respect of all legislation the Senate should have merely a suspensive veto, in
this case for six months. I think that is what my honourable friend across the floor was asking about. The formula reads as follows:
-a bill may become law without the consent of the
Senate (1) if the House of Commons, having once
passed it, passes it again no less than six months after
it was rejected or finally amended by the Senate or, (2)
if, within six months of third reading of a bill by the
House of Commons the Senate has not completed
consideration of it, and the House of Commons again
passes it at any time after the expiration of the six
months, but any period when Parliament is prorogued
or dissolved shall not be counted in computing the six
months.
In support of this recommendation, the report says at
page 34:
The veto power of the Canadian Senate is unlimited.
This in itself is a contradiction.
Even in the case of money bills (while it is true that
the Senace cannot initiate them or increase the
amount), it can refuse to pass thern or can reduce the
amounts. There has been no change in this power
since 1867. On the other hand, the constitutional
power of the British House of Lords, on which our
Senate was basically patterned, has been reduced. In
the case of the Senate a curbing of its veto power
would, paradoxically, strengthen it, and do so without
weakening the House of Commons. It would increase
the possibilities of confrontation, but avoid the perpetuation of deadlock by ultimately giving the House
of Commons its way.
I, for one, am not convinced by this argumentation.
There has been no abuse of the Senate's power of veto in
the last 50 years, and there has not even been any need of
[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West).]

April 26, 1972

a conference to resolve a so-called deadlock since 1947.
Obviously, the Senate would be weakened, and its influence and prestige considerably reduced, by this unnecessary innovation. I have failed to detect any public clamor
or mandate for the proposal. It appears based not on
practical politics, but on some intellectual hypothesis. If it
is adopted, the proper expression in future would be "the
sovereignty of the House of Commons" and no longer "the
sovereignty of Parliament": the expression "sober second
thought" would have to be replaced by a "frantic second
glance." I would not regard such changes as salutary.
Like Senator Forsey, I am a conservative constitutionalist, but in my case the "c" in conservative could be in
either upper or lower case.
* (1510)

Honourable senators, I am not opposed to all of the
recommendations for Senate reform contained in the
report. I believe that money bills, other than appropriation bills, could usefully be introduced in the Senate. I
have no disagreement either with the report's recommendation concerning the distribution in the House of Commons. And our work has become such that 130 is not an
unwieldy or inordinate number, though I am not sure
where we would put them all.
I believe also that the report makes a good case for the
gradual appointment of one-half the senators from panels
submitted by each province or territory. The panel system
need not really involve any formal constitutional change
in the method of appointments by the Governor General
on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. It could
become by general agreement a constitutional custom or
convention. The advantages would be several. It would
give the provinces and territories a real stake in the functioning of the Senate, and so would go a long way towards
ensuring its continual existence far into the future. It
would be, in effect, the joint creature of the federal, provincial, and territorial governments.
But it would have one further beneficial effect that has
not yet been adverted to in this debate. It would tend to
restore to a great extent the "adversary system" which
lies at the root of our legislative and judicial systems. In
support of what I have just said-I am sure that Senator
Connolly sees this coming; it really enforces what I have
just said-I quote the remarks of my honourable friend,
Senator John Connolly, as reported in the Debates of the
Senate of February 25, 1969, at page 1063:
Honourable senators, in my own considered opinion
when the number on the Opposition benches falls
below 35 per cent of our membership the result is not
good for this house or for the work it does ... The
onus upon the leader opposite is oppressive when he
has too few people around him. Perhaps the leader of
the opposition party in the country should have the
power to nominate a panel in such circumstancesunless, of course, by provincial nominees the opposition benches are going to be filled up. But is that an
assured possibility?
This is Senator Connolly asking that question, the same as
I would.
I pay my tribute to the work that is donc by the
Opposition here. If we ignore their problems-however misguided their political philosophy may be-

April 26,1972

SENATE DEBATES

I did not want to eliminate that.
-I say we ignore their problems at our peril.
The Conservative side of this house has from time to
time been badly outnumbered by the Liberal side,
although this kind of imbalance was not contemplated by
the Fathers of Confederation. I remember in 1957 there
were only five Conservatives in this house. There were, as
we all remember, Senators Haig, Aseltine, Felix Quinn,
Marcotte and Horner. Some of them were aging and had
difficulty in holding their own against such a huge Liberal
majority.
Moreover, if the new proposal were implemented, it
might reasonably be expected that our numbers would
increase sufficiently to permit us to fulfil our traditional
constitutional role effectively. There are a lot of Conservative provincial governments, and provincial or territorial points of view could be presented directly in this
chamber.
The scheme might be difficult to work out technicallyperhaps the purely provincial appointees could have limited tenures so that they would not be completely out of
step with current provincial governments-but I am all
for it in principle, as I have already indicated. I am quite
sure the technical details could be worked out, although
this does not appear to have been done as yet. In such
matters, perhaps we have a long way to go, but if we know
our destination we can surely get there.
My own view is that we should now "cool it" so far as
major constitutional reconstruction in Canada is concerned. It seems to me that the Prime Minister has already
"cooled it," the authorized expenditures for the federal
secretariat on the Canadian Constitution having already
been vastly reduced. I venture further to suggest that
proposals for constitutional reform will not be a significant element in the forthcoming general election.
Despite the exhortations in the report to beat the drums
and sound the trumpets for constitutional reform, I am
afraid that the drums will be still and the trumpets muted.
It is in the foregoing context that I think this report
must be evaluated. It has been a good intellectual exercise
and the dedication of Mr. MacGuigan and the myriad
members of the committee are commendable. But, as far
as any immediate effect upon the existing Constitution is
concerned, it is likely to be an exercise in futility.
Honourable senators, I could be wrong. I have been
wrong before. The report, as its advocates insist, might
prove to be a veritable bonanza, a milestone on the road to
constitutional progress. But, in this case, as I said before, I
am the devil's advocate. I am also from Missouri.
By and large, I agree with the recommendations dealing
with the qualifications of senators. Certainly the property
qualifications are both unrealistic and unnecessary today.
I remember in 1957 or 1958 when Senator Monette was
summoned to the Senate. I think he happened to be on a
hunting trip. He was told that in order to qualify he
should have property worth at least $4,000 in that particular area, Mille Isles, which is situated close to Lachine,
where he was to be appointed. I remember his telling me
that he had to telephone a notary in the middle of the
night and say, "Buy me a garage, buy me a vacant lot, buy
me anything that is worth at least $4,000, because I have to

qualify." I wonder if today one could get a vacant lot for
$4,000 in any area in any province.
a

(1520)

The same may be said of the Quebec restrictions requiring residence on property holdings in the electoral divisions of the old Province of Lower Canada. As the report
states, "The Senate must be representative of all facets of
society."
The report recommends that any Canadian be eligible
for Senate appointment at age 18-I do not know how that
strikes honourable senators-and that future appointees
to the Senate shall retire at age 70. If the Senate is to
retain its traditional role as the house of sober second
thought, perhaps 18 is too young, although if it is to
become a house of "frantic second glance," perhaps the
young could glance as well as anyone else. Again, there
will be argument concerning the retirement age. In these
days, judging from the contributions being made to the
work of this Senate by those who are in their 70s, I am
inclined to think that the age limit should remain at age
75. Certainly there should be no retroactive provision in
this regard.
I do not think that the committee, the Senate, or the
country should be unduly dismayed by the slow progress
being made in the way of constitutional reform. Neither
Rome, nor the Canadian Constitution, was built in a day.
The ordinary people of Canada are not alarmed. Walter
Bagehot, the great constitutionalist of an earlier day,
regarded conservatism as deeply ingrained in human
nature-an expression of the secret wish of "all ordinary
decent people, poor and rich, to lead the life to which they
had been used, and to think the thoughts to which they
have been accustomed."
Honourable senators, I hope that what I have said will
be recognized as the blunt truth. However, I know that, as
Bismarck once said, "Nothing can be regarded as true
until it has been officially denied by the Government."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I move adjournment of the debate. I
would not want it to end on such a happy note.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate adjourned.
AGRICULTURE
DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING STANDING SENATE
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, March 29, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Argue, that
in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in the interest
of both eastern and western agriculture, to establish a
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider
legislation and other matters of concern to agriculture
that may be referred to the said committee by the Senate.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I have only a
few remarks to make on this motion. I agree that it is
desirable to establish a Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture to consider legislation and other matters pertaining to agriculture that may be referred to that committee by the Senate. My problem had to do with procedure. I wanted to look into the meaning of the motion and
the way it might be implemented if passed by the Senate.

SENATE DEBATES

As I see it, if we pass the motion-and there seems to be
general support for it-it would not have the effect of
amending the rules of the Senate. lt would not, by its mere
passing, create another standing committee of the Senate.
This would require another motion. I was not sure about
that, and I had in mind that the motion could be amended
by adding "and this question be referred to the Rules
Committee for consideration and report."
However, since coming to the conclusion that it does not
automatically create a new committee I do not intend to
move that amendment at all, and I will accept the motion
with the reservation, as I think would be the practice, that
before such a committee is created the Rules Committee
should look into it. When we revised our rules the Rules
Committee adopted the principle of reducing the number
of committees because of the difficulty in manning so
many of them at the same time, and because of this I
doubt that we should have a committee which would have
only the problem of agriculture as its responsibility. It
may be that agricultural problems are not, let us say, well
assigned in the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce because it is such a busy committee. Perhaps the Rules Committee will be able to designate another committee to which agriculture could be
referred, and where it could be better taken care of.
That is the only point I wanted to make. Since another
procedure has to follow this motion in order to create this
standing committee, I will say simply that I am in agreement with the idea that the committee should be able to
devote a large part of its time and efforts to this very
important aspect of our economy. Therefore, as far as I
am concerned, this motion can be adopted, subject to the
remarks I have just made.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, may I ask the
honourable senator whether he would not agree that if the
motion now before this house passes it would amount to a
directive to the Rules Committee to re-examine the
present committees, especially the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce to which
agriculture is now assigned, and make a report to this
chamber for a second decision?

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That was my feeling, and that is the way
I thought it would have to move. Of course, it could be by
way of a direct amendment to the resolution calling for an

amendment of our rules thus bypassing the Rules Committee, but I hope this would not be the case. I feel that the
Rules Committee is the proper committee to consider the
establishment of such a committee, and whether other

matters should be included in its terms of reference.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I think that
Senator Argue's proposal for the establishment of a
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture is good. The
debate thus far, I think, has indicated that there seems to
be a gathering consensus that this should be done. As I
listened to the debate, I wondered why this move had not
been initiated a long time ago. It is inconceivable that the
Parliament of Canada could establish parliamentary committees that were not capable of addressing themselves to
the problems of agriculture. There is a Standing Committee on Agriculture in the other place. That place is not
charged exclusively with responsibility for the consideration of agricultural policy and agricultural matters and,
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

April 26, 1972

therefore, it would seem desirable that there should be an
additional forum presented through the Senate for consideration of agricultural problems.
O (1530)

Having stated my support in principle of the proposition
put forward by Senator Argue, I am wondering if some
examination must be made of some of the remarks of the
Leader of the Opposition. I agree with Senator McDonald
that if we pass this motion today we will be giving a clear
direction to the Standing Committee on Standing Rules
and Orders to change the rule so as to make it fully
consistent with the terms of this motion. It is not a ques-

tion of two bodies having co-ordinate jurisdiction. This
will be a direction to our Standing Rules and Orders
Committee; it will have no option but to bring forward a
change in the rules that will withdraw from the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce's
plenitude of powers particular responsibility for considering matters that come under the agricultural category.
While there will be an opportunity for further consideration of the matter, there will not be a further opportunity
for disputing the principle, assuming the passing of this
motion.
I suppose it will always be open to any senator to
propose that the committee on agriculture to be set up
pursuant to this motion should have other functions. I am
not suggesting that now. There was a suggestion made
during the course of our deliberations that consumer
affairs might well be included for consideration by a
Senate committee such as the one now proposed on
agriculture. I am not making that suggestion, but it is
conceivable that at some future date such a matter might

well be included, either as part of the responsibility of
such a standing committee or as a subject that should be

removed from the present powers of the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. Indeed, I

think Senator Lafond did propose such an amendment to
this very motion.
Honourable senators, I rise simply to give support to
this motion. I think the quicker such a committee is set up
the better it will be in the interests of this house. I think it
will prove to be a constructive effort.
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I am
impressed with the point made by the Leader of the
Opposition. That is not to say I do not completely support
the proposition put forward in the motion of Senator
Argue, because in my opinion there certainly is need to
establish a committee on agriculture. But I am beginning
to become a little concerned about the number of proposals for special committees of the Senate, even though our
work is more and more in that important direction.
Hon. Mr. Martin: This is not a proposal for a special
committee. This proposes the establishment of a standing
committee.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I apologize. It is for a standing
committee. In due course there will be a motion by Senator Croll for a standing committee on aging. When we
were discussing the Speech from the Throne I indicated
that in my opinion a standing committee on urban affairs,
in view of the urbanization of our country, is absolutely
essential. It seems to me almost as ludicrous not to have a

Anril 26, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

standing committee on urban affairs as not to have a
standing committee on agriculture in order to review the
appropriate legislation in a very special way.
I do not know, perhaps because of inexperience, how
the Senate will handle these proposals. They are all, I
believe, very urgent. I put this forward merely for consideration by the government leader before we finally decide
on the establishment of a committee on agriculture. The
matter should be reviewed by the Standing Committee on
Standing Rules and Orders together with the other considerations, bearing in mind that there will be other similar proposals. I personally intend to propose a committee
on urban affairs in due course.
The Standing Rules and Orders Committee should look
at the whole situation so that we know in which direction
we are going. I merely draw this to the attention of the
government leader, and perhaps it might be considered.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must
point out that if the honourable Senator Argue speaks
now his speech will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, I have been
delighted with the support this proposition has received in
the chamber generally. Along with my leader, Senator
Martin, Senator McDonald, and others, I have certainly
wondered from time to time why the Senate was not able
to have, and did not have, a standing committee on
agriculture. While we may be short-handed from time to
time, I feel that if senators decide, as I expect and hope
they will, that this committee is of sufficient importance,
steps will be taken to obtain the necessary attendance at
committee meetings to make it function. I think this will
be forthcoming. I do not think it appropriate for me to
name them, but from conversations with some honourable senators there is no doubt in my mind that if the
Senate feels agriculture is of importance, as stated in this
motion, such a committee can be manned.
We should no longer allow ourselves to be in the position we were in at the end of last session, when major
legislation came in at the last minute and was referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce without, in my judgment, proper consideration
being afforded to those measures at that time.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: With great respect, it was the timing
that was bad. I disagree with what the honourable senator
has just said. I think the timing was bad; it was not a
question of having a committee or not.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I would think it was a question of not
having any committee, because the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce dealt with
amendments to the Income Tax Act by having meetings
prior to the measure coming before this house.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It took only a few hours.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The Leader of the Opposition was not
here so he does not know.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I was not here, nor were you. You were
hiding in your office.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Some of us made a special effort to
attend, after having been placed on the Standing Senate
25312-21

Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce in this
emergency situation. We did the best job we could at that
time. I am still thoroughly convinced that had there been
a standing committee on agriculture during the last session, we would not have been in the bind we were in on
that particular piece of legislation, because such a Senate
committee could have been dealing with the subject
matter thereof at a very much earlier date.
* (1540)

Honourable senators, to me agriculture is of major
importance in Canada, even though the numbers engaged
in it may be declining. It is important because of the
economic contribution which the agricultural industry
makes to the whole economy. It is of importance today
because of the growing value of agricultural exports on
the international market and because of the increasing
importance of agricultural commodities in international
trade. Agriculture is important because a great part of the
poverty of Canada is found in rural areas. If such a
committee as is proposed at this time is in fact established, Senator Michaud has asked that it make a particular study of the grave economic situation in the agricultural County of Kent in the Province of New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Welch: I wonder if the honourable senator has
any idea of the number of farmers who are on welfare
because the welfare system is paying too much money.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I do not have the statistics. I have the
statistics which Senator Michaud put before the Senate as
to the exodus of farmers out of Kent County, and they are
absolutely astounding. That evidence alone suggests an
important activity for this committee. However, a substantial percentage of the poverty of this nation is found
in rural areas, and the whole question of poverty cannot
be thoroughly and adequately dealt with until some further consideration is given to the agriculture industry
itself.
Honourable senators, I am very pleased at this time to
ask the Senate to make a decision on this motion, which
expresses:
That in the opinion of this House it is desirable, in
the interest of both eastern and western agriculture,
to establish a Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider legislation and other matters of concern to agriculture that may be referred to the said
Committee by the Senate.
Motion agreed to.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
LABOUR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTES AFFECTING PUBLIC
SERVICES-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 16, the
adjourned debate on the motion of honourable Senator
Haig that the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be instructed to examine and report
upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public services.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I am
afraid I am going to be known as the "instalment plan

SENATE DEBATES

senator" because I make my speeches on the instalment
plan. This is perhaps an indication of my quality of
unstrained mercy towards the chamber, but it may
become a little tedious and I venture to express the hope
that it will not in fact become a habit of mine.
Hon. Mr. Argue: More and better publicity.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: This I have no control over. There are
about seven points I would like to make, very briefly, in
finishing up what I have to say on this subject.
First of all, I think it must be pretty generally recognized that the present situation in regard to disputes in
public services is not really thoroughly satisfactory to
anyone. It may be the best we can do-I am not certain of
that-but it does seem to me that it cannot be regarded as
completely satisfactory to anyone. It certainly is not satisfactory to the public to have certain essential services
disrupted or partially disrupted for considerable periods
of time. It certainly cannot be satisfactory to the workers
concerned to have their earning power, for one reason or
another-good reasons or bad-interrupted for considerable periods of time. This is something they would like to
avoid.
There is of course a superstitious belief in some quarters that workers spend most of their time dreaming of
the days when they can go on strike, the exquisite and
delightful experience of going on strike and being on the
picket line and being without anything but strike pay, if
that, during the period they are out. You do not need very
much knowledge of the labour movement from the inside
to realize that this is a somewhat comic view of the frame
of mind of workers. Workers are just as anxious to avoid
strikes as anybody else. If anything, I should think they
are much more anxious to avoid strikes than other people
are.
If there is some way of reducing the number of strikes
and reducing the duration of strikes, without doing violence to what workers regard as their essential rights, you
would find a warm reception for any such proposals in
the ranks of the workers of this country.
Honourable senators, the situation cannot be satisfactory to the employer, the Government of Canada or a crown
corporation, again for perfectly obvious reasons. It means
a loss of revenue, it means inconvenience and public
exasperation, pressure upon the employer, whether the
government or a crown corporation, to manage things
better; complaints, rows, rumpuses, difficulties. So I do
not think it is altogether idle to have some properly qualified body make an adequate investigation into the working of the present legislation dealing with this matter. In
other words, I am not prepared to say that we live in the
best of all possible industrial relations worlds, whether in
the public service or in a crown corporation.
The second thing I want to say is that I hope people will
not run away with the idea that there is some magic in
compulsory arbitration. Sometimes some people seem to
regard compulsory arbitration in the same light as the old
lady who remarked that she was so devoted to that
blessed word Mesopotamia in the scriptures, she had got
such comfort out of it. To some people, the phrase "compulsory arbitration" is a sort of magic phrase and all you
have to do is invoke the magic and there you are. I think a
[lon. Mr. Forsey.]

April 26,1972

little experience of industrial relations might dispel this
view. Quite a number of years ago I was asked by the
Montreal Board of Trade to take part in a panel discussion on compulsory arbitration. The other people who
were taking part were a representative of the Canadian
Pacific Railway-a very high management official-a representative of, I think, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce or the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, some
employer organization, and a member of an industrial
relations firm which was notorious in the labour movement for its strong management bias.
I was put in the favoured position of speaking last.
When it came my turn to speak, I was obliged to say: "Mr.
Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry, it is a dreadful confession for a labour representative to have to
make, but I entirely agree with what the other members of
the panel have said"-because every one of them had
damned compulsory arbitration with bell, book and
candle; they said it just would not do, it was undesirable
and was unworkable. I do not think that completely setties the question, because that was a general opinion,
about compulsory arbitration in general.
9 (1550)

Of course, if you want to bolster this objection to compulsory arbitration in general, you have really only to look
at countries like Australia and New Zealand where there
has been a system of compulsory arbitration for a great
many years and you will see that it simply has not prevented strikes. The last time I looked at the statistics over
a long period of years-it was some time ago now-I think
it is safe to say that, although on the whole the strikes in
Australia and New Zealand were rather shorter on the
average than the strikes here, there were more of them,
and, in proportion to the size of the working force and the
degree of industrialization of those countries, the time lost
from strikes was greater than it was in this country. And
this was not for a particular year. If you take a particular
year you may find the comparison is different, but this
was over a long period of 25 or 30 years-something of
that kind-taking good years and bad years alike.
You have to ask yourself, in fact, how effective a system
of general compulsory arbitration would be; how practical it is. It is one thing for this to work even as well as it
does in Australia and New Zealand with their very different tradition from ours-different not only in the matter
of labour relations legislation, but different in the balance
of social forces. You have had, for example, in both of
those countries for a long time a Labour party. Well, here
we have had nothing much of the sort. We have had what
you might call a sort of hemi-demi-semi-labour party for a
good many years now, but it has never been one of the
major parties of the state in the sense that the Australian
and New Zealand Labour parties have been. It has never
been within reach of achieving power in the country as a
whole, although it has, of course, done so in certain provinces. But in Australia and New Zealand you have had
repeatedly over long periods and for many years back
labour governments-governments made up of the
Labour party, supported in general by the trade unions.
This is the kind of situation we have not had here. It is a
tradition we have not had here and an atmosphere we
have not had here.

Canada, or should we consider the whole field? There, of
course, the results of our investigation would be in part
somewhat academic because we have no power to do
anything except whisper in dulcet tones to provincial governments what we think it might be wise for them to do.
Still, a cat can look at a king, so I suppose a Senate
committee could, respectfully and with genuflections and
expressions of deepest humility and respect, proffer
advic.e to provincial governments on this subject.
* (1600)

My final question is this: if we are going to have an
investigation of this sort, whether in the broadest terms or
in relatively narrow terms, should it be entrusted to this
committee, the particular committee that is proposed? At
the moment it does not seem possible for us to entrust it to
anybody else if we should decide to have the investigation.
But with great respect I must again suggest, as I think I
did earlier, that the committee would at least need some
enlargement of its membership or some change in its
membership-it could not be an enlargement, of course,
under the rules-but some change in its membership to
give rather more expression to the experience and the
opinions of people with a union background-and there
are a few of us in the house-or industrial relations
experts like my honourable friend, Senator Goldenberg
who possesses in this field a quite unrivalled experience. I
should say that if this investigation is to take place and is
to be entrusted to this committee-and I think I am
repeating myself here, but I have no hesitation in doing so
because I think the point is so important-it would be
indispensable to have on that committee Senator Goldenberg, and I think it would be equally indispensable to
have on that committee Senator Lawson and probably
one or two other senators who have had labour experience. I again repeat that I have no desire to be on this
particular committee myself; it would be a matter of sheer

April 26, 1972

duty and nothing else if I were persuaded or coerced into
it.
But I think that it would probably be better, and this
would probably involve putting the matter off to another
session, it would probably be better, even at the risk of
incurring the frowns of Senator Buckwold, to consider
the desirability of re-establishing the Standing Committee
on Labour and Immigration. We used to have one-or I
should say that you used to have one, because it was long
before my time in this house-you used to have a Standing Committee on Labour and Immigration. Now perhaps
those should not be bracketed together and perhaps there
should simply be one on labour, or perhaps not. But I
rather think that it would be desirable to consider this
matter very carefully indeed before passing this motion,
and to consider whether it is not desirable that the investigation should be conducted, if the Senate decides upon it,
either by a standing committee on labour or a special
committee set up for this particular purpose. The more I
have thought about this motion, the more I have been
uneasy about the prospect of entrusting this investigation
to the Committee on Health, Welfare and Science as at
present constituted. Again I hasten to add that I am not
for a moment suggesting that the members of that committee are not the most admirable characters, splendid
citizens, vastly endowed with all sorts of intellectual and
emotional gifts and splendid fellows in every way, but
simply I wonder whether they have been chosen for that
committee with this kind of investigation in mind. I
wonder simply whether we ought not to have a committee
with a somewhat different basis of choice to look into a
matter of this complexity and importance.
With those somewhat scattered reflections, honourable
senators, which are not, I hope, without some practical
value, I conclude the second and last instalment of my
speech on this subject.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

great deal of discussion and work, Senator Goldenberg
presented this solution, which was satisfactory to all.
The second amendment applied to paragraph (c), which
limits the use of the words to a commercial service rendering establishment. That is a rather awkward
phraseology. The amendment simply changes it to read
for the provision of commercial services. That makes
neater language and is the only difference. Had we
changed the original clause, as was suggested, it might
have reduced the application of the prohibition against
the commercial use of this phrase outside the capital
region. The way it is now, we limit the use of the Hill to a
particular locality, to within the capital region itself. So
there cannot be any repetition of the kind of situation
which led to the introduction of this bill, which was
brought about by a new hotel in this city deciding to call
itself the Parliament Hill Inn, or something like that.

PARLIAMENT HILL BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED
Hon. J. Harper Prow.e, Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs,
reported that the committee had considered Bill C-78,
respecting the use of the expression "Parliament Hill",
and had directed that the bill be reported with the following amendments:
1. Page 1, line 9: After the word "location" insert the
words "in the National Capital Region".
2. Page 1: Strike out line 17 and substitute therefor the
following: "establishment providing services."
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Prow.e: With leave, now.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would the honourable senator be good enough to tell us the significance of
these amendments?
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Yes. The amendments are very simple.
The point arose that in describing Parliament Hill it has
been the practice in some of the provinces, in particular
the Province of Quebec, to refer locally to the location of
the provincial legislature as Parliament Hill. It was not
the intention of this bill to interfere with that practice in
the provinces. It was first suggested that we might change
the first part of the bill, and the insertion of the reference
to the capital region would accomplish that. By reference
to your copy of the bill you will realize that this would
weaken paragraphs (b) and (c), which refer to a limitation
on the use of the words for commercial purposes. These
paragraphs set out a difference. It was decided after some
discussion and by agreement with all involved and interested that limiting the use of the words as to the location
of any place in the capital region would not impinge in
any way on the rights of the provinces or others outside
the area whom we particularly wish to protect. After a

The other amendment still leaves a completely broad
application of the limitation of the use for purely commercial purposes. In other words, we have dealt with the
complaints raised by my honourable friend, the Leader of
the Opposition in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Flynn), without
derogating from the general effect of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I thank the honourable senator for his explanation. I am sure that with the
kind of able counselling which he could provide, and with
the additional counselling which he could obtain from
Senator Goldenberg, legally this document will be unimpeachable. I understand that it is a private member's
public bill. May I ask the chairman whether the sponsor in
the other place has agreed to the changes suggested?
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Yes. Probably the answer might come
from Senator Goldenberg; but perhaps I could say that he
was careful to see all persons concerned with the bill. As
it now stands, it has the agreement of the sponsor and the
Leader of the Opposition on any regional objections, and
as far as I know the bill overcomes the objections of
anyone who had an objection up to this point. Like the
wedding: now all in favour hold their peace.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I had not realized
that it had the able counselling of the Leader of the
Opposition. I should have mentioned him.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Senator McIlraith agrees.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I want to
say what I had hoped to say when the bill was up for
second reading, by way of tribute to the mover of the bill
in the other place who, I understand, will soon be a
member of this place, if in fact he is not already gazetted.
I think it is the appropriate moment to say that the Honourable George McIlraith was a very fine member of
Parliament and an excellent Leader of the House of Commons. He never put a foot wrong in that capacity, which
you could not say of all his colleagues in that particular
administration.

SENATE DEBATES

I think also one might say of him-and I think he might
have echoed himself the statement of Sir William Harcourt-that:
To all who have taken part in the noble conflicts of
parliamentary life, the chiefest ambition is to stand
well with the House of Commons.
I think it can be said of the Honourable George McIlraith,
as he leaves one house to become a member of the other,
that he stood well with the House of Commons and realized that "chiefest ambition" of those who have ever "taken part in the noble conflicts of parliamentary life."
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask the honourable senator
where he gets his pipeline?
Report adopted.

April 27, 1972

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have put
the motion subject, of course, to leave being granted. Do I
understand that leave is being granted to proceed with
third reading?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We want to clear the way, in any event.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Let us hope it satisfies all.
Motion agreed to and bill, as amended, read third time
and passed.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: With leave of the Senate,
and notwithstanding Rule 45(l)(b), I move that the bill be
read a third time now.

INCOME TAX ACT
NOTICE OF INQUIRY
Hon. Louis P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, I give
notice that on Tuesday next, May 2, 1972, I will call the
attention of the Senate to the dividend tax credit provided
for by section 121 of an Act to amend the Income Tax Act
and to make certain provisions and alterations in the
statute law related to or consequential upon the amendments to that Act, Chapter 63, Statutes of Canada,
1970-72.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Perhaps there is one reason why leave
should be given.

ADJOURNMENT

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: May I ask the Leader of the
OppositionHon. Mr. Flynn: Mr. Speaker, it is on the question of
leave and not third reading. I am trying to find out whether we should give leave today. Apparently Senator Forsey
has provided the reason. The sponsor of the bill in the
other place might join us. Since the Leader of the Government has indicated that he does not know anything about
it, I think we should force him to stand up and say
whether or not the sponsor of this bill in the other place
has been appointed to the Senate. Is it official or not? If it
is official I will give leave without any hesitation, because
I would not want him to come here and discuss a bill
which he sponsored in the other place. I want to clear the
matter up and welcome him to this chamber with open
arms. Before giving leave I should like to hear from the
leader whether Mr. McIlraith is now a member of the
Senate, and, as well, if there are other appointments.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: You want to know too much.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It might be relevant to the present bill,
for all we know. And I should like to know whether some
of those appointees will be sitting on this side of the
house.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not know that I can satisfy Senator Flynn on the last point he has raised.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would be very surprised if you did.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am not in a position to say whether or
not the information given to us by Senator Forsey is
accurate until such time as the Prime Minister himself,
who is the head of the executive, makes an announcement. No one should know better than the Leader of the
Opposition that it would be wrong for me to anticipate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Shall we postpone third reading, then,
until later this day?
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, I
move with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule
45(l)(g), that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday, May 16, 1972, at 8 o'clock in the
evening.

Honourable senators, I was hesitant to rise on the
motion for adjournment in view of the inquiry that was
placed on the Order Paper by Senator Beaubien. I am
sorry that Senator Beaubien has had to leave the chamber, but I think I can assure honourable senators that
Senator Beaubien will have the opportunity to deal with
his inquiry probably much earlier than May 16.
* (1420)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Is that a definite assurance that we will
have occasion to deal with it?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: If you think my statement is worth
that much, there will be such an occasion. However, I
know you are all aware that the flow of work from the
other place to the Senate has not been great, and there is a
possibility that there will be some delay in work coming to
this house from the other chamber. I suspect, and I have
every reason t believe, that we will be recalled prior to
May 16. On the chance that this legislation might not come
to us, the decision has been made that we should adjourn
until May 16, subject to recall. I repeat that I fully expect
we will be recalled before that date. However, committees
of the Senate will continue to sit during the adjournment,
and I will be moving a motion later on with respect to the
Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs. I want
honourable senators to know that there is every possibility we will be called back before May 16.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Do I take it that the motion was not
designed to delay the debate suggested by Senator
Beaubien?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Not at all.

SENATE DEBATES

April 27, 1972

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Would the acting leader, or the deputy
leader-I never know which; I have been praying that the
Leader of the Government would clarify the situation one
of these days-say whether it is sure that we are going to
meet in any event on either May 16 or before?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I think it is as sure as all other
eventualities are sure at the moment.
Motion agreed to.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING
ADJOURNMENTS OF THE SENATE
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, I
move, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule
45(1)(h):
That the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign
Affairs have power to sit during adjournments of the
Senate.
It is my understanding that the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will be meeting on May 11,
when the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce will
be the witness. Apparently that is the only early date on
which he can appear. That committee will therefore meet
on May 11.
Hon. Mr. Martin: As well as other committees.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes.
Motion agreed to.
FISHERIES
BAN ON COMMERCIAL FISHING OF SALMON-ECONOMIC
EFFECTS ON NEW BRUNSWICK-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. G. Percival Burchill rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
serious effects on the economy of New Brunswick and

especially of Northern New Brunswick of the recently

announced ban on the commercial fishing of salmon.
He said: Honourable senators, the announcement by the

Minister of Fisheries that the situation regarding the
diminishing run of Eastern Atlantic salmon has become

so grave that it is necessary to ban the operation of the
commercial fisheries in New Brunswick for a period of
years came as a profound shock to the people in my area,
the people who live along the Miramichi River. For generations salmon fishing has not only been a very important
part of our economy, but also part of the warp and woof
of the lives of the people connected with that industry.

The minister also announced that compensation will be

paid to commercial fishermen whose earnings are affected by these river closures.
I used the word "generations", and it is interesting to
note that in 1775 Benjamin Marsten reported to Edward
Winslow, a high government official at Halifax who had
sent him to inspect the northern part of New Brunswick.
According to The Winslow Papers, a historical volume
compiled by the late Rev. Dr. W. O. Raymond of Saint

John, New Brunswick, Marsten reported to Winslow on
the Miramichi River as follows:

The salmon fishing on this River is an object worthy
of the attention of the Government but unless it is
attended to it will be ruined by the ignorance and
avarice of those concerned in it.
It has failed very much this season, no doubt
through the impolitic methods used to catch the fish
which is chiefly by set nets which are extended from
each side so as to leave the fish very little room to run.
One of the reasons why the early pioneers settled on the
Miramichi River was the opportunity it gave to fish for
eastern salmon, and that fishing has been carried on
through cycles of good years and cycles of poor years. It
has always been an important element in the life of the
community.
I recall when I first came to Ottawa being introduced to
the then Deputy Minister of Fisheries who, when he found
out where I came from, said, "Oh, you live on the greatest
salmon river in the world." I thought that was a great
compliment and I never forgot it.
But we have fallen on sad times. The salmon runs have
been diminishing. The commercial fishery has been carried on by what are known as "drifters" and "set net
fishermen." The drifters tow nets outside the mouth of the
river, while the set neLs are used by fishermen who own
stands at locations along the river to the head of the tide,
which is roughly a distance of 50 miles. The angling pools
are on the upper reaches.
As I said, the catches over recent years have been
diminishing. Many causes, both domestic and international, have been blamed for it. Pollution caused by spraying
to control the spruce bud worm infestation, and by industry and the up-river communities, has been attacked, and
good results have been obtained. Pollution in the river is
under much better control than it has been for some time.
These are local problems.

Fishing of eastern salmon by foreign nations on the
high seas, since an American submarine discovered the
feeding grounds, is beyond our control. The catch by
Denmark alone last year was four times that of all our
own mainland fishermen.
Honourable senators, it may be worth-while to trace the
natural life cycle of eastern salmon. Spawning takes place
on the gravelly beds at the heads of the branches of the
river. The eggs develop there, and for the first two or
three years the tiny fish are known as fry. Further on in
their growth they are known as parr. Later, in the fourth
year, they are known as smolt. After that they become
grilse and salmon. At this stage they leave in the fall of the
year to return the following year to the river where they
were spawned. But now they do not return because both
grilse and salmon are caught in the deep-sea fishing
grounds off Greenland.
( 1430)

Figures obtained from the department indicate what is
happening to the fish and where they are going. From the
figures that have been given me it would appear that 44

per cent are taken off Greenland; 19 per cent off Newfoundland; 18 per cent by drifters; 5 per cent by set net
fishermen; and 2 per cent by anglers. Only 9 per cent,
according to the department's figures, escape for
spawning.

SENATE DEBATES

The tragic result is that there are not enough salmon or
grilse free for spawning to continue and maintain the
annual catch. If this continues, of course, the species can
become extinct, and that is the problem we are facing at
the present time. Last year the drift net season was shortened by about one and a half weeks. The season opened
on June 16 last year, whereas in former years the opening
date was June 7. The tie-up season, when no fishing is
allowed, was two and a half weeks in June, which is prime
fishing time according to what the fishermen tell me, as
against two weeks in July in former years. In this way the
season for the drifters was curtailed.
Similarly, the anglers were restricted in 1971 to 20,736
days compared with 30,001 days in 1970. The fish landed
by anglers dropped from 19,088 pounds in 1970 to 9,670
pounds in 1971. The commercial catch in 1971 was down
to 175,000 pounds from 332,000 pounds the previous year.
The value of the commercial industry, of course, showed a
corresponding drop from $282,000 in 1970 to $151,000 in
1971.
The department was kind enough to furnish me with
figures of landings and values in Northumberland County
for a number of previous years. It is very interesting to
look at the record of these years. I am referring now to
commercial fishing.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Senator, are the figures you are
about to give in respect of Canadian fishing only?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes. In fact, I am referring only to the
Miramichi River. In 1952 there were 131,000 pounds of
salmon landed with a total value of $117,000. In 1953 there
were 215,000 pounds landed with a value of $83,000, which
shows that the price of salmon that year was very much
lower. In 1954 the landings increased to 485,000 pounds
with a value of $200,000. In 1969, 15 years later, there were
353,000 pounds landed with a value of $234,000. In 1971, as
I said before, the landings amounted to only 175,000
pounds with a value of $150,000, as against 332,000 pounds
with a value of $281,000 in the previous year. I felt that
those figures should be included in the record.
What I said about the Miramichi River applies to every
salmon river in New Brunswick. Saint John harbour
salmon and Restigouche salmon have gained a national
reputation. To counter the situation with which we are
faced today, angling has already been banned on the
Saint John River. That is the situation as it stands at the
present time.
Honourable senators, to bring you up to date, the minister himself is meeting with a representative group of the
whole body of fishermen on the north shore this afternoon in Chatham, New Brunswick, to outline the policy
which has been adopted by the government. This policy
means the termination of the industry for a period of
years. What are we going to do about it? As I say, the
announcement by the minister that commercial fishing is
to be banned has had a profound effect on the whole
community. The people living there feel very sad and
bitter about it.
My own view is that if this is a correct and sound policy
in the present circumstances, then angling on that river
should be restricted also. It does not seem fair or equitable to me that regulations should be made that deprive
[Hon. Mr. Burchill.]

April 27, 1972

people of what has been part of their livelihood, even
though they are to be financially compensated, while at
the same time anglers are accorded the right to fish as
usual. I suggest that all should be treated alike.
Furthermore, honourable senators, if we are at the
mercy of the Danes, as would seem to be the case at the
present time, I think the government's representations to
Denmark on this matter should be supported by a unanimous resolution of the Parliament of Canada indicating
that the people of Canada are 100 per cent behind the
government.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, I should like
to make a few remarks on this important subject. In view
of the fact that this chamber will not sit until the end of
the adjournment of which notice has already been given, I
feel that something more needs to be said at this time.
* (1440)

I wish to begin by indicating that the point made by
Senator Burchill towards the end of his remarks, that
some contribution towards this conservation plan should
be made by the anglers, needs urgent attention. I can only
speak for the anglers with whom I have fished for salmon
for a good many years. Senator Burchill has fished for a
good many more years than I have, and I am sure more
successfully. I have fished on many different rivers in
eastern Canada-and this includes only two provinces; I
have not been able to fish on many of the streams which I
am sure Senator Paterson has. However, all those with
whom I have angled know the great thrill and sportsmanship of dry and wet fly fishing on our beautiful rivers, and
I think they would be very positive in their approach to
this matter and willing to make their contribution.
Senator Burchill speaks as a salmon fisherman. Perhaps I speak as a "has been" salmon fisherman when I
say I wish I could have had the opportunities that people
like Senator Burchill, Senator Paterson and Senator
Molson have had. Their efforts toward the preservation of
this magnificent species are appreciated.
We hear people talk about fishing for various kinds of
fish all over the world. We catch the biggest fish in the
world off the coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.
There is a specimen of a tuna in the town hall in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, which is where I live, that weighs, if I
remember correctly, 968 pounds. Fish weighing in excess
of 1,000 pounds have been caught in the waters off Nova
Scotia and Newfoundland.
I have talked to many fishermen who have had experience with all kinds of fish, and no one has ever disputed
that the salmon is the king of them all. For anyone who
does not have to fish for a living, there is no more magnificent aspect of sport than to be successful at salmon fishing. It is a wonderful sport. Even if you do not catch a
fish, there is great anticipation. On a beautiful sunset
evening you almost feel compelled to get down on your
knees in the boat and thank God that such a privilege
exists, and that we still have clean water and clean air.
It would be a very serious matter to ban sport fishing
completely in such provinces as Newfoundland and Nova
Scotia, although to a lesser extent in Nova Scotia. I say
this because there is no way by which compensation can
be worked out for the great number of people involved in

April 27, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

servicing salmon fishing camps as guides, in transportation, and in provisioning. If someone can suggest where $4
million to $5 million can be obtained to compensate these
people for their loss of earnings, then I would say there
should be a 100 per cent restriction for a few years on all
of these rivers. I do not think this is feasible, but a compromise might be suggested to the minister responsible
for fisheries. The compromise could take the form of
cutting the bag limit from five to one salmon per day.
One salmon would make me very happy, as I am sure it
would most people who go salmon fishing. Anyone who
catches more than one or two salmon is a fish hog.
Anyone who catches salmon in excess of his own needs in
an isolated camp is worse than a fish hog. I have seen
people cast salmon aside in the inland waters of Newfoundland merely because they had landed them, and
there was not a living soul around to eat them. And in the
summer salmon will not keep.
Let us consider the industry and the servicing of these
fly fishermen. I do not know the value of the salmon
caught inland. There used to be a business not too far
from where I lived in Nova Scotia which owned small
hotels and camps. During one season 10 or 15 years ago
someone figured the price of salmon on the market in that
area at 50 or 60 cents a pound, but every salmon caught on
the Medway River was estimated to cost the sportsmen,
who came from every part of the country and from south
of the border, $25 a pound.
By the way, some famous public personages fish in the
rivers of Nova Scotia, and they are great advertisers of
our facilities, our country, and the kind of people who live
here. I do not think we want to miss out on that.
I suggest that the compromise could be a reduction of
the bag limit on all salmon fishing. I do not exclude from
this proposal the ban on the many rivers in my province,
Nova Scotia, and the Province of Newfoundland, the offshore waters, and harbours. Netting is still going to be
permitted on the rivers, harbours and salt waters, and it
will be permitted close to the shores of all of the salmon
rivers in Nova Scotia. I feel that the least we can do in
Nova Scotia is to have our bag limit reduced. I do not
think that net fishing in Nova Scotia is a valuable industry. It does not employ very many men, and it is not an
important source of revenue.
There has been a great change in the attitude of the
people of Nova Scotia. I can recall the backing some of us
received from the then Member of Parliament for QueensShelburne, and our former colleague, the late Senator
John Kinley. We said it was a shame to see all those nets
across the Medway River and up into the Mersey River.
My first memory of salmon is those nets stretched across
the river for about eight miles. Some people suggested
that those nets should be removed in order to ensure the
retention of this fish as a national resource. There was
strong opposition to the position taken by Senator Kinley,
but he took it because he felt he was right in agreeing with
the proposal made by those who were regarded as conservationists. He agreed with the Department of Fisheries
which was prepared to restrict this fishing. He took his
share of lumps, but he made a great contribution to the
salmon industry on the Medway River. The fishermen in
the harbour and the lower reaches of the Medway River

25312-22

voluntarily agreed to remove their nets over the weekend,
and to enlarge the mesh of their nets to permit the escape
of the smaller fish. The grilse, which in our waters would
be three or four-pound fish, could get up the river to
spawn, and come back later accompanied by their
progeny.
* (1450)

Contributions have been made from all angles. The
people are logical and sensible. Do not let us underestimate them because they do not have a higher education.
Some of my best instruction in zoology and botany-in
matters pertaining to flowers and animals-has come
from these so-called undereducated people who live in the
backwoods by our salmon streams. I have a great regard
for them and the feeling they have for the things of
nature. I am not so sure that the great horde of salmon
fishermen who descend on the rivers have had an opportunity to acquire the point of view I have over the years. I
can only hope our schools will teach some of this.
I have no criticism at all of Senator Burchill's remarks,
but I suggest that we provide compensation for those
affected who were engaged in net fishing in New Brunswick and the offshore area in the vicinity of Port aux
Basques. I do not think this point was made, and perhaps
I should interpolate now that it has been established that
the great bulk of the fish caught away off the shore of the
Port aux Basques area is the Greenland stock we have
been discussing, and which has been decimated by the
Danes. It has been established that in general the stock of
fish that has been netted in the Greenland area is the
stock of fish that is heading for the mainland of New
Brunswick, probably up the Saint John River where great
reaches go back for several hundreds of miles, and up the
beautiful Miramichi where the salmon were once so thick
that you could walk across on their backs, as some of the
fishermen told me when I went fishing with them.
I wish to make the point, though, that we have various
stocks of fish, and it has never been established that any
of the Greenland stock enter the rivers of Nova Scotia or
Newfoundland. For that reason the ban does not extend
to the rivers of those provinces.
I have something else to say with respect to the Danes. I
do not think Senator Burchill meant to be hard on the
Danes, because I believe they are having a difficult time
to do what is right. In my view, this will have an effect on
the conscience of those who attend the meeting of the
International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries which, I understand, is to be held at the end of
May. I think they will learn the extent to which we, with
the support of our people, are willing to go in order to
preserve this resource. They will have second thoughts,
and rather than Denmark being the only country which is
a signatory of the convention which established the International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries
to oppose the proposal to ban the offshore netting in
Greenland, this time they will have a change of heart and
support this measure. The fact that Canada is going as far
as she is, will have a really serious effect on those intelligent and fine people, as some of us who have had contact
with the Danes over the years believe them to be.
Honourable senators, we should be grateful to Senator
Burchill for bringing this to our attention. I only wish now

that he had given notice of a motion endorsing a resolution similar to that passed in the other place, which might
have strengthened the hand of Mr. Davis, the Minister of
the Environment and the minister responsible for fisheries, when he goes to Washington with his officials a month
or so from now. Perhaps it is not too late, and we may still
have a chance of adopting such a motion before the meeting is held. If so, I would be glad to give it my support.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Molson, debate adjourned.
POVERTY
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, March 29, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Croll, calling
the attention of the Senate to the Report of the Special
Committee of the Senate on Poverty in Canada, tabled in
the Senate on Wednesday, November 10, 1971.
Hon. Guy Williams: Honourable senators, to start with,
I wish to impress on you and to convince you that there is
no poverty like Indian poverty in Canada today. Let me
quote from Proceedings No. 16 of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the revision of the Indian Act of 1886, which was finally revised in
1952. This is evidence the committee heard in its examination and consideration of the Indian Act, and it was given
on May 2,1947:
In those three years, gentlemen, I have seen some
conditions that are difficult for some people to
believe-conditions that they cannot believe actually
exist in this big country. I have seen poverty in its
worst form amongst our people.
Honourable senators, I made that statement 25 years
ago almost to the day. A quarter of a century has gone by,
and I did not dream at that time that I would be quoting
myself or repeating myself in this upper chamber of the
Parliament of Canada. Today I believe the situation, the
state of poverty, is no better. In fact, it is worse today than
it was at that time. Poverty, like isolation, comes in many
forms, and I think one of the many reasons for Indian and
Métis poverty is the fast pace of today, compared with the
leisurely horse and buggy days-and they were not too
long ago. We now have the jet age, exploration of the
moon and space, and new scientific discoveries almost
every day among the civilized nations. Rapid communications and transportation facilities make possible travel to
any part of the world in a matter of hours instead of days
or months.

The Indians of Canada were not involved with, nor did
they participate in the advancement of, the strange society of people who came and took over the country. In fact,
they were isolated in their own domain, their own country. How could they participate? Their way of life was so
different. They were several centuries behind the organized and civilized newcomers.
At a later date, reservations were set aside for the
Indians. Confederation came, and certain powers were
given to the provinces. The isolation of the Indians was
then nearly complete, but they were not really aware that
their way of life was slowly but surely being taken away.

Their way of life had been simple. They were guided by
the four seasons of the year in pursuit of their needs,
particularly the winter season.
The land was self-sufficient. There was no want. What is
known as Canada today was truly a land of abundance.
The buffalo roamed the plains in their thousands. The
Europeans came and purposely killed them to near
extinction, causing the Indians to starve. That noble
animal, the buffalo, was the mainstay of the plains Indians. The hides sheltered and clothed them, and the meat
was their main diet.
The rivers, lakes and forests were full of fish and game.
The coastal waters of British Columbia abounded with
thousands of the giant mammals, the whales, which are
no longer hunted by the Makahs and Nootkas, the Indians
on the west coast of Vancouver Island. The whales are so
few in number today that the whaling industry no longer
operates. Along the coastal waters of British Columbia,
Washington, Oregon and California the sea otter with its
luxurious fur became extinct, and only a few hundred
remain in the Aleutian chain of Alaska.
What I have said so far are all negative points, but they
are contributing factors to the roads, trails and by-ways
which, without alternatives, have led the Indian to his
present high state of poverty.
Dr. Diamond Jenness, an anthropologist brought from
the United States to give evidence before the Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the revision of the Indian Act, said in his evidence in 1947 that the
Indian was not a normal person, that he was sick and
suffering from malnutrition. I think he was right.
The Indian people are loyal to Canada, despite discrimination and poverty, and they desire to live as other
Canadians. Freedom from want and freedom from fear
are two of the four freedoms. The Bill of Rights must be
instrumental in enabling the Indian to regain his lost
confidence, in order to prepare himself for the day of
equality in our society, and to take his rightful place in the
Canadian way of life.
The land of abundance became a land of foreign laws
and regulations introduced by the federal government. At
a later date the provincial governments introduced restrictive measures, including hunting and fishing laws. The
actions of the two levels of government completed the
trails that led to a Total State of Poverty-in capital
letters-for the Indian people.
The Government of Canada must take a new look at the
situation as it affects 250,000 Indians and possibly 300,000
or 400,000 Métis, and, if seeing is believing, it should cut
down on moneys going for aid to other nations.
In 55-54 BC the Romans invaded Britain. They took
over the country, and for 400 years did much for it. They
built good roads, some of which are still in use today,
although rebuilt to accommodate the mobility requirements of the times. The Romans then left Britain and the
good roads. At this time I should like to remind honourable senators that, like the Romans, they and their people
have been here for better than 400 years. Please do as the
Romans did: leave the good roads behind.
Welfare and education costs are very high in British
Columbia. I think this has some bearing on the reason

ki

97 1V2

SENATE DEBATES33

why there is so much poverty among Indian people. For
instance, the per capita cost of Indian infant welfare and
other welfare which is paid out of federal funds, in contrast with that for the Province of British Columbia, is
$11.82 per day. My information is that over 25 per cent of
welfare recipients in British Columbia are from among
our Indian people, and better than 50 per cent of the total
amount of money goes in administration costs. Elementary and secondary education is provided under contract
with the province in integrated schools. More than 50 per
cent of the Indian population of British Columbia is of
school age. The cost goes as high as $2,700 per student,
which is paid by the federal government to the province.
* (1510)

Ail home owners in British Columbia qualify for the
provincial home owners' grant of $185, which is deducted
from their land taxes. In undeveloped areas or locations
the land tax may not amount to $185, so the owner pays a
token tax of $1. Non-Indian property may be adjacent to
an Indian Reserve, and for the suma of $1 the non-Indian
children can go to the same integrated school that adjacent reserve children go to at a cost to the federal government of $2,700. An Indian child could be sent to a private
school for that amount. It does not make any real sense to
me, but I amrn ot suggesting that the Indian children
should go to school for a buck.
Indian Reserves in Canada are rich in resources. Development of those resources will, in the majority of cases,
bring the Indian people out of poverty. Real estate development under leases and rentals will bring in considerable revenue te, offset the poverty that exists, and will, in
due course, make the Indian people of British Columbia
self-sufficient.
The government must give more consideration to getting the Indian population out of its present state of poverty. The available resources on the reserves-and in British Columbia there are over 1600 reserves-can be utilized
to bring in revenue. With this type of program we believe
the Indian population can become self-sufficient, and we
can wipe out poverty and the large amounts of welfare
payments.

Honourable senators, I think the Indian has been portrayed for too long in a way that does not bring about a
true sense of his responsibility to himself. It is high time
that the Government of Canada gave a realistic portrayal
of the true Indian, his character and culture, which
Canada is so proud of today.
I want to relate an experience I had in Japan during
Expo '70 when I attended the celebration of Canada Day
in the amphitheatre where there were nearly 50,000
people. At that time I was only a few feet away from our
Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau. I f elt very proud to be a Canadian then. When you
see nearly 50,000 people waving the Canadian flag it does
things to you. In another city we had time to attend a
theatre, and there was a preview shown which portrayed
an Indian-in fact, he was from Alberta and I recognized
him-sitting on a noble horse in full regalia, and that also
did things to me.
These are points that I want to present to honourable
senators. This government, in the near future, should
review and give careful consideration to the state of the
Indian people. There is no poverty like Indian poverty.
Honourable senators, again I have spoken.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, debate adjourned.

The Hon. the Speaker having informed the Senate that
there were senators without, waiting to be introduced:
The following honourable senators were introduced;
presented Her Majesty's writs of summons, which were
read by the C]erk; took the legally prescribed oath, which
was administered by the Clerk, and were seated:

PARLIAMENT HILL BILL
CONCURRENCE BY COMMONS IN SENATE AMENDMENTS
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons 10
acquaint the Senate that they have agreed to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-78, respecting the use
of the expression, "Parliament Hill", without amendment.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators. 1 rise on a
point of order. I am wondering whether this report is now
debatabie. If it is, perhaps the new member of this chamber from Ottawa, the honourable Senator Mcllraith,

might have somnething 10 say. It would create a precedent,
his having already spoken in the other place on this bill. I
arn just putting the question to you, Mr. Speaker.
The Hon. the Speaker: In answer to the point of order
raised by the Leader of the Opposition, I must say that
there is no point of order justified in this circumstance. 0f
course, this does not prevent the honourable Senator
Mcllraith from saying a few words if he so wishes. I am
sure that ail honourable senators would agree 10 this, but
it is up 10 the honourable Senator Mcllraith.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I should like 10
join with the Leader of the Opposition. Afler ail, the
Senate is master of its own rules and if the Senate feels il
wishes 10 hear Senator Mcllraith then that is aIl that is
required.
In joining with the Leader of the Opposition I point ouI
that this bill came 10 us from the other place bearing
Senator Mcllraith's sponsorship. Il is significant that the
bill was amended by this chamber, sent back 10 the other
place and accepted by that body. Senator Mcllraith is
living testimony of the wisdom of an Upper House.
Hon. George 1. McIlraith: Honourable senators, I should
first like 10 thank the Leader of the Opposition and the
Leader of the Government in the Senate, and alI honourable senators, for the rather unusual courtesy extended 10
me here tonight. It is, I believe, a very unusual one, and il
is also rather surprising 10 me.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Enjoy il while you may.
Hon. Mr. Mcllraith: I shail flot speak about the bill
because I thînk its purpose is seif-evident, but I should
like 10 thank honourable senators for the improvemenîs,
otherwise called amendments, made 10 the bill in Ibis
place before il procured final passage. 1 believe I should
add nothing more on the subject tonight. I thank you.

INCOME TAX ACT
DIVIDEND TAX CREDIT-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Louis P. Beaubien rose pursuant to notice:
That he will cal the attention of the Senate to the
dividend tax credit provided for by section 121 of an
Act to amend the Incorne Tax Act and to make certain
provisions and alterations in the Statute law related to
or consequential upon the amendments to that Act,
Chapter 63, Statutes of Canada, 1970-72.
He said: Honourable senators, I am honoured to be the
first on this side of the Senate to say how pleased I am at
the presence of the charming lady and the three distinguished gentlemen who have just been appointed to the
Senate. I extend to them my very sincere congratulations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators, I wish to say a
few words about the dividend tax credit. The dividend tax
credit was introduced in 1952. At the beginning of the war,
the corporation tax was 15 per cent, and in 1952 it was 50
per cent. It seemed terribly unfair that the shareholders
who owned the company should have to pay the full tax
on the dividends they received after the company had
already paid a tax of 50 per cent of its profits. Therefore,
the dividend tax credit was brought into being.
Up to the end of 1971, the dividend tax credit was quite
simple. You calculated the tax payable on your income
and from the tax you otherwise would have to pay you
deducted 20 per cent of your Canadian dividends. That
worked out pretty well. However, it did seem somewhat
unfair that a man who earned $12,000 a year would pay a
tax of $200 a month while a man receiving $12,000 a year
in Canadian dividends would pay a tax of $400 a year.
That is roughly the figure. With that in mind, the Minister
of Finance introduced a new dividend tax credit system.
In doing so he brought out this raspberry-coloured book
which on page 36 explains the new system.
The example on this page shows a taxpayer receiving
$300 in dividends. To this he must add one third of this
amount; in other words, $100. This process is known as
grossing up. The example goes on to show how the taxpayer calculates the tax he owes on the $400, and then
deducts the $100 from the tax payable.
When the minister appeared before the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, we pointed
out that section 121 of Bill C-259 says that you can deduct
only four-fifths of the amount you added in the grossing
up process. The minister explained it in this way, and his
explanation is given in this little book brought out by the
Department of National Revenue (Taxation), entitled
"Tax Reform and You-Highlights for Individuals."
On page 11, the booklet tries to explain why you deduct
only four-fifths of the amount of the grossing up instead
of the $100 as previously announced. You are told that the
remaining one-fifth is in effect being allowed as a reduction in provincial taxes. I do not understand or agree with
that at all. Actually, the provinces do not give you any
reduction. Take Ontario and British Columbia, where the
taxes are the lowest. You calculate your federal tax and

SENATE DEBATES
add roughly 30 per cent. You get no reduction due to the
dividend tax credit. In the different provinces the amount
you add on varies. I have the new tax form here. It goes
up to 42 per cent in Manitoba.
The Minister of Finance, in his examples here-and I
am still on page 36 of the "raspberry" bookHon. Mr. Walker: That is what you are giving him.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Which minister are you referring to, Mr.

Turner or Mr. Benson?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I am referring to last summer. He
says that if you are in the 25 per cent bracket, then you
would be better off under the new system. His actual
words are "Marginal Rate of the Taxpayer." To my mind,
a man with an income of $13,000 in 1971 would have been

in the 25 per- cent marginal rate. He could deduct $1,000

personal exemption together with $100 for medical and
charitable expenses. The taxable income would then be
$11,900, and according to the scale in 1971 the tax on that
would be $2,835. However, if you add on the old age
security, the social development tax and the surtax,
taking into account the abatement of 3 per cent, you end
up with a total of $3,245 of ordinary tax. Twenty-five per
cent of $13,000 would be $3,250. I am, therefore, just about
hitting the nail on the head.
Now, if an individual had dividends in 1971 consisting of

$13,000 and nothing else, and was taxed as a single taxpayer, his total tax in Ontario would have been $645.
Under the new system he pays a tax of $698. That is not a
large increase but, mind you, we were told that if you
were in the 25 per cent tax bracket your taxes would be
reduced. If you go to the 40 per cent tax bracket you are

supposed to be even.
* (2020)

I have in my hand a document prepared by the Thorne,

Gunn organization in which there is given as an example
the case of an individual with an income of $21,000 in
Canadian dividends, with no other income, and taxed as a
single taxpayer. The total tax paid in 1971 was $2,235 but
for 1972 his tax bill will be $2,829, which is an increase of
approximately 26 per cent. If one happens to reside in
Quebec-and I shall deal in more detail with the situation
a little later-the increase is enormous.
I should say, honourable senators, that there are many
things in the new tax bill that make sense. As you know
the top income tax rate is reduced from 84 per cent to 61
per cent so that people in the higher income brackets are
going to fare much better than heretofore. But there is a
tremendous increase in what I consider as being the
medium income bracket. I have here an account that I
have been looking after on which the tax in 1971 was just

over $4,000, but this year it amounts to $5,400, which is an
increase of $1,400 or 32 per cent. I should point out that
this person is a resident of Quebec.
It is my view that we are going to see certain changes on

the part of the investing public. As you know, Canadian

corporations, where you have what I might call a mixed
bag, yield about 4 per cent. It must also be kept in mind
that from now on there is no provision for depletion
allowances. If you look at our better corporations you will
find that many of them were directly or indirectly
engaged in the extraction industries, and their sharehold[Hon. Mr. Beaubien.]

May 15, 1972

ers were allowed to reduce their tax liabilities through a
depletion allowance-CPR, International Nickel, Noranda, Steel Company of Canada, Dofasco, Imperial Oil, to
mention just a few.
To many people the abolition of the depletion allowance

will make quite a difference.
Now let us look at the situation of a taxpayer receiving

dividends of $40,000. Having provided for the various
exemptions available, the tax in 1971 was $7,907-and
here I am speaking of a resident of Ontario; the situation
of a Quebec resident is even worse-and in 1972 the tax
amounts to $9,642. However, as you get into the higher
income brackets the amount paid in tax is reduced. If you
are sufficiently fortunate to have an income of $400,000 a
year, your tax payable would be less than it was last year.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Do you have to go that high to obtain a
reduction?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: No, but you have to go pretty high.
Honourable senators, in 1960 the budget for the Province of Quebec was $600 million. The budget for 1972-73
amounts to $4.6 billion. The amount which was spent on
education in 1960 was $100 million, and for the current
year it is $1.2 billion. When you look at these tremendous
increases you can see why the province is terribly
strapped for income, and perhaps you can understand
why the rates are higher. However, I think it is a terrible
mistake to set rates that are in some cases 20 per cent
higher than in the Province of Ontario.
There is one thing that sticks in my crop. In the Province of Quebec you have to make out an income tax
return for the federal government, and then you must do

exactly the same for the province. You need duplicates of
all the documents and T-forms. All this bas to be checked
by the provincial staff, even though the federal government is prepared to do the work for nothing.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Would that explain the present
turmoil?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I do not know how to explain that.

My point is that there is a large staff checking everything,
and then another staff does the same thing over again. It
is a terrible waste of energy and money, and it makes
absolutely no sense at all.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Langlois, debate adjourned.
FISHERIES
BAN ON COMMERCIAL FISHING OF SALMON-ECONOMIC
EFFECTS ON NEW BRUNSWICK-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, April 27, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Burchill,
calling the attention of the Senate to the serious effects on
the economy of New Brunswick and especially of Northern New Brunswick of the recently announced ban on the

commercial fishing of salmon.
Hon. Hartland de M. Molson: Honourable senators,
before speaking on this subject I should like to add my
word of welcome to the four new members of this chamber who have joined us this evening. We are very happy,
and indeed fortunate, that another lady has been called to

May 15, 1 Ma 95,1

SENATE DEBATES

our ranks as well as the three distinguished gentlemen
who, I am sure, will add greatly to our deliberations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Of course, this strengthens the Liberal
membership.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, there are not,
unfortunately, many members of the chamber who
remember Senator Reid of New Westminster, who
occupied this seat some years ago.
Tom Reid was easily identified as a braw Scot when he
spoke. He was a loyal British Columbian who devoted a
great deal of his time to the survival of the Pacific salmon.
He became the chairman of the International Pacific
Salmon Fisheries Commission, and once a year he gave us
a most interesting speech on the progress of that long and
difficult struggle in the course of which, by international
agreement and good will, the Pacific salmon was saved
from extinction. Today it remains one of the great fish
crops for the benefit of mankind.
* (2030)

A distant cousin of the Atlantic salmon, the Pacific
salmon is now thriving as a result of the negotiated realistic quota system implemented through the co-operation of
the United States, Canada, Japan, and Russia.
Now it is the turn of the Atlantic salmon. I would say,
first, that it is encouraging that the Government of
Canada has finally become sufficiently concerned to take
drastic action in an effort to prevent the extinction of this
species. The action announced by the Minister of Fisheries is the subject of Senator Burchill's inquiry. The question is really whether or not this action has come too late,
and whether it is the best possible action in the
circumstances.
Before getting too deeply into the question of its survival, we should understand the fish causing the problem.
The Atlantic salmon, properly known as Salmo salar,
frorn the Latin saliremeaning "to jump," is one of the few
species of anadromous fish, namely, those which must
ascend the rivers or streams to breed in fresh water
before returning to spend much of their adult life in the
ocean. While this is an unusual performance, it is really
insignificant in comparison with the almost incredible
way in which the salmon arrives back at its own river
under the natural urge to spawn.
Returning from the ocean, nature has given Salmo salar
an astonishing navigational system which brings him
back to the coastline of his youth, where a little understood sense of smell enables him to detect water emerging
from the river of his birth, so that he returns to that river
and no other. Of course, once in a while a mistake is made
and the salmon goes into the wrong river, but it is very
rare indeed.
In the process of propagation, the female beats out a
hollow in a clean gravel river bottom and after laying her
eggs, which are then fertilized by the male, she covers
them up with the gravel, which must be clean and relatively porous so that the eggs are kept fresh by a current
of water until they hatch out as alevins.
From this stage the young fish grow to be fry, and then
to be parr, spending two or three years in the river in this

process. A parr is about four inches long, and when it
grows beyond this stage it becomes a smolt. A smolt is not
only bigger, about eight inches long, but its whole chemistry has undergone a startling change, which makes it turn
downstream instead of upstream, and thus takes it down
the river to the sea.
It spends a short time in the brackish water at the river
mouth, becoming accustomed to its new salt environment,
and then goes off to sea to its formerly unknown feeding
grounds.
If it returns after one year at sea it is known as a grilse,
and usually weighs from two and a half to five pounds. If,
on the other hand, it spends two years or more at sea it
comes back as a real salmon, which is not only larger but
has changed in appearance so that it now has a square tail
instead of the forked tail of a grilse. It would then weigh
anywhere from six pounds up, depending on how long it
had been at sea.
After spawning, the salmon will again leave the river
for the sea and return to spawn again if it survives,
although the number which succeed in repeating the journey is very limited. I believe that occasionally salmon
have been recorded spawning as many as five times, and
reaching an age of eight or nine years.
Honourable senators, I have expanded a little on the life
of the Atlantic salmon because, unless we appreciate how
difficult it is for this magnificent fish to survive the
normal perils of nature, it is hard to understand why it is
necessary to go to so much trouble to protect the species.
The greatest threat to salmon survival at the moment is
unquestionably the Greenland and Davis Strait fisheries.
This attack on salmon began in 1964, after the discovery
of the mysterious feeding grounds of the salmon in the
ocean by United States nuclear submarines in transit
under the polar ice cap.
The statistics are quite startling. In considering the
pounds of fish taken in these fisheries it must be remembered that they are caught before they have reached full
maturity, and therefore the number of fish for the weight
is proportionately higher. The adult fish, taken in this way
at sea, averages probably seven pounds, against, perhaps,
10 to 12 pounds if allowed to return to his river.
The effect of this increasing northern fishery has been
disastrous on our large salmon. Let me give honourable
senators some figures illustrating the effect on the
Canadian driftnet catch. In 1967, Canadian driftnets took
1,186,000 pounds. In 1970 this figure had decreased to
457,000 pounds. In 1971 the catch was almost insignificant,
being 186,000 pounds. During those same years, the total
taken by Greenlanders, Danes, and Faroese had risen to
5,852,000 pounds in 1971, from 4,740,000 in 1970 and 3,530,000 pounds in 1967. In other words, in five years the
Canadian driftnet catch had decreased by 84 per cent,
while the total northern fishery had increased by some 65
per cent. It is my understanding that it was agreed that
the total northern take would not exceed the 1969 record
level of 4,880,000 pounds. However, as I have said, the 1971
catch was 5,852,000 pounds.
The argument that the Danes are not responsible for the
decreasing breeding stock in our Atlantic rivers simply
does not hold water. As I have emphasized, the take last

SENATE DEBATES
year in the Greenland and Davis Straits fisheries had
risen to 5.8 million pounds of immature fish, while the
total Canadian take including that of the driftnets, which
used to be greater, had declined substantially. In total, our
commercial fishermen last year took only 3.9 million
pounds, whereas in 1970 the figure was 4.8 million pounds
and, in 1967, 6.1 million pounds, being a decrease over the
five years of 36 per cent.
The anglers, about whom I shall have more to say,
succeeded in taking 12,600 salmon and 47,000 grilse last
year, down from 21,400 salmon and 63,500 grilse in 1970,
and the much greater number of 37,500 salmon and 68,250
grilse in 1967. This is a decrease in five years of 66 per
cent for salmon, and 31 per cent for grilse.

Dr. F. R. Hayes of Dalhousie University has stated that
"no one knows what percentage of salmon spawned
in
Canada migrate to Greenland or how many of the salmon
reaching Greenland ever return," but I am informed that
Dr. Hayes is now out of touch with recent developments,
having been away from the Fisheries Research Board for
some time. Tagging of fish has proved that about 50 per
cent of the off-shore catch originates in Canadian rivers.
Scientists who are now associated with salmon studies,
either with the Fisheries Research Board or in other capacities, have the benefit of much later research.
Unfortunately, because there is a natural loss there is
not equally convincing proof that these fish would all
return to our rivers if allowed to escape, but there is
enough indication to give rise to an assumption that a
reasonable percentage of the 5.8 million pounds would
have succeeded in finding its way back to Canadian
waters. I make one other point. The 5.8 million pounds
represent, perhaps, 800,000 salmon. These fish were not
bred in the rivers of Denmark or Germany, and very few
were bred in the rivers of Greenland.
I quote from the International Atlantic Salmon Foundation Quarterly Newsletter, May 1971:
Recapture of tagged smolts in the Greenland fishery
during 1970 has confirmed that the major part of the
West Greenland salmon stock has been derived from
rivers in Canada and the United Kingdom.
There is simply no justification for the defence that the
Danes are not taking large quantities of Canadian bred
fish, and that consequently they are not having an adverse
effect on the fishery.
Denmark has already agreed with the United States to
phase out the deep sea fishery by 1976. This is probably
too late, and Canada has refused to enter into any agreement of this kind as it believes that deep sea fishery
should be terminated immediately. Hopefully the Danes
will respond to Canada's representations by adopting a
less rigid stand at the forthcoming meeting of the International Commission of the Northwest Atlantic Fishery,
ICNAF, in Washington at the end of this month.
Several suggestions have been made both in and out of
the House of Commons in recent days to boycott Danish
imports. I see from the Saint John Telegraph-Journalof
May 5 that the five main fishermen's associations of New
Brunswick have gone on record as supporting a boycott
on all goods imported from Denmark and that a resolu[Hon. Mr. Molson.]

May 15,1972

tion to that effect passed unanimously. I should also like
to direct the attention of the house to a recent United
States act-Public Law 92-219, 92nd Congress, H.R. 3304,
December 23, 1971-the effect of which is to "prohibit the
bringing or importation into the United States of fish
products ...

from a country ...

directly or indirectly con-

ducting fishing operations in a manner or under circumstances which diminish the effectiveness of an international fishery conservation program." Consideration
could be given to promulgating such retaliatory legislation here if the Danes cannot be persuaded to alter their
attitude vis-à-vis the deep sea fishery, but personally I
believe that it would not achieve the purpose.
As to the suggested boycott on Danish goods, I would
remind honourable senators that Denmark has sent us
many splendid new Canadians, and amongst them a
winner of the Victoria Cross. Thomas Dinesen came from
Denmark to serve in the Black Watch of Canada, and on
August 12, 1918 was awarded our highest decoration for
outstanding gallantry in the Battle of Amiens. Historically
Canadians and Danes have been good friends, and friends
should be able to settle differences by discussion. My
inclination would be to support Senator Burchill's suggestion that we back up our representatives at the ICNAF
meetings at the end of May by unanimous resolutions of
both houses.
There is certainly much cause for criticism of the way in
which the development of industrialization and the infrastructure have polluted our rivers. However, recent years
have finally brought an awareness of the dangers and
problems, and our rivers have come back even after DDT
spraying. Some lakes, rivers, and streams have become
polluted to the extent that the Atlantic salmon can no
longer find the proper environment in which to spawn,
but both provincial and federal governments have taken
drastic steps in implementing serious pollution abatement
programs relating directly to salmon at a cost of millions
of dollars.
Furthermore, Canada spends large sums of money on
salmon research as well as on breeding for stocking purposes. These amount to at least $6 million annually.
Unfortunately, it is estimated that over 40 per cent of the
benefits of these programs accrue to the Danes, who only
have to wait to reap a rich harvest in international waters.
It might be pointed out that all over the world restrictions on both commercial fishing and angling for salmon
have been increasing in little steps year by year. Some
countries which have historically followed this pattern
have now few or no salmon left. Canada has been doing
the same but the yearly take has been declining, and it is
now time to take more sweeping measures.
The Province of Quebec has already taken certain steps
to reduce its take. Regulations relating to net restrictions
and reduction of catch limits were promulgated early this
winter, and briefly are as follows:
(A) In areas of sites where it is necessary to facilitate
reproduction of the species or to promote sport fishing under Department control, commercial fishing
will be abolished or commercial fishing licenses will
only be renewed for bona fide fishermen, that is, those
who are not regularly employed in an industry other
than the fishing industry, who draw a sizable portion

Mav 15 1972S

SENATE DEBATES

of their income from commercial fishing and who live
in that area.
(B) The issuance of commercial fishing licenses will
be restricted as follows:
1. No new license will be issued;
2. No licenses can be transferred, except from
father to son, providing that the latter is able to fish
himself and can be considered a bona fide fisherman, or to the widow of a license holder, providing
that she resides in the place where the license is
used;
3. Fishing nets will be limited to the number and size
authorized in 1971.
4. No salmon fishing net can be moved towards a
salmon estuary.
5. People whose licenses are not renewed because of
this new policy will be able to receive compensation
for their salmon fishing equipment.
(C) The number of catches will be reduced in more
heavily fished areas and where the drop in salmon has
been more marked:
1. As far as sport fishing is concerned, the daily
catch will be reduced by one salmon in all rivers
where the limit was more than two salmon. This will
apply to the Gaspé area and in the area west of the
Rivière au Bouleau on the north shore of the St.
Lawrence.
2. The opening of the commercial fishing season will
be postponed from May 15, as it was previously, to
June 1 throughout the province.
3. The commercial fishing will close on July 31,
rather than on August 15, in the Gaspé area and in
the area west of Rivière au Bouleau on the north
shore of the St. Lawrence.
4. Salmon trap weekly closing time will be extended
by 12 hours. The traps will now be closed between 8
a.m. Saturday and 8 a.m. Monday.
It should be noted that these new restrictions imposed
by the Quebec government were enacted upon a recommendation of the Quebec Atlantic Salmon Council some
months ago. Such a policy should prove reasonably effective for Quebec because there is no driftnet fishery
associated with these rivers. Should Quebec adopt an
identical strategy to that of the federal government with
respect to a ban on commercial fishing, which does not
seem impossible at this time, proper care must be taken to
compensate the fishermen in an adequate manner.

e

(2050)

The question should now be asked whether it is necessary to bear down so heavily on the commercial fishermen for the purpose outlined. Senator Burchill presented
the case of several hundreds of great people who, like
their fathers and their grandfathers before them, made a
living from the commercial catch of Atlantic salmon. The
minister has said that the fishermen affected will be compensated. If a complete ban on commercial fishing is
necessary for the survival of the species, there is no doubt
that those whose livelihood is affected should be compensated, and compensated fully. No one could quarrel with
this proposal. In looking at the figures for 1971, I see that

the commercial fishermen of New Brunswick harvested
only 272,000 pounds. If these figures were to be repeated
this year there is no doubt help would be required. Fair
compensation might be the answer.
Senator Burchill said on April 27 last that if commercial
fishermen are deprived of the right to fish, then anglers
should be treated in the same way. This seems to be only
fair. We should take a close look at what is best. We must
ask ourselves whether depriving people of the opportunity to catch salmon on rod and reel would benefit the
community and help to preserve the species for the
future, or whether a ban on angling would cause hardship
to a lot more people who can least afford it. Would it work
to improve the chances of survival of Salmo salar as a
species, or would it accelerate its destruction? Here are
some hard facts. Anglers are the biggest source of funds
for the population associated with the salmon fishery, and
this by a very considerable amount. Surveys were carried
out in 1967 which show quite clearly how important this
source of revenue is for people in Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and, to a lesser extent, Nova Scotia.
This same situation is recognized in Scotland, Ireland,
and most other countries where the salmon provides a
crop.
Broadly speaking, salmon caught by the angler in
Canada brings in an average value of about $70, whereas
a fish caught commercially has a value of no greater than
$4. However, the rod catch now represents only some 2
per cent of the total salmon crop, or 5j per cent of the
total Canadian catch. Five years ago, when the surveys I
mentioned were taken, angling accounted for about 15 per
cent of the Canadian catch, and the value of the commercial catch was $2,693,896 for 738,100 salmon, while angling
took only 138,104 salmon but contributed a value of
$8,862,000. With your leave, honourable senators, I would
like to place on the record a breakdown of these figures
by provinces.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Perhaps I may give a concrete example. In doing so I
would like to use as illustration a river with which I have

SENATE DEBATES

been familiar for over 35 years. This river is in Gaspé,
emptying into the Baie des Chaleurs, and it has historically been considered a good salmon river. The fruits of
netting near the river mouth are not of great importance
to the community, but angling there is of the greatest
importance. This has been amply demonstrated by
representations made on behalf of local families to the
Quebec Government that it do all that is possible to
improve the angling.
I would estimate that some 60 families receive an important part of their annual cash income from the angling
activities of the camps on this river. In the last ten years
guarding expenses alone have contributed $311,296. Last
year there were some 20 guardians employed for several
months, in addition to a full-time chief guardian. The cost
of guarding in 1971 was $42,250. In addition, perhaps 50
others were employed as guides and staff. There are the
taxis and trucks used, the provisions purchased, as well as
gas and oil, outboard motors, repairs, and a host of other
expenses associated with these operations.
I am sure that this small community benefits to an
extent well in excess of $100,000 per annum, while the
number of fish taken has been pathetically small in recent
years. Apart from the economic aspect, 40,000 smolts have
been planted in the last 10 years, and over a longer period
1,585,000 fry have been put in the river in an effort to
maintain the breeding stock.
I believe this is a typical salmon river, and if angling
ends what will happen in this community? First, the
camps will be abandoned. Secondly, the 20 guardians will
not be employed. Thirdly, the guides, camp staffs and
others will not be employed, nor will the operating
expenses I mentioned before be incurred. There is not a
shadow of doubt that the moment the guardians are withdrawn the river will be invaded by people with nets and
other gear, and it will be cleaned out. There will be no
more angling, no more commercial fishing, and no more
salmon, and the community will have suffered very serious economic loss.
The total take on this river by anglers last year was 243
salmon and 123 grilse, in a total of 659 rod days. This
means that an angler would take two or three salmon and
one grilse in a week's fishing. It cannot be said to have
been good fishing, but it is these devoted anglers and river
people who have guarded the salmon coming to spawn,
who have restocked the rivers, who have assisted the local
communities, and who have developed a mutual respect
and affection between those who live and work and those
who come to fish on these rivers.
Thus, it is clear that angling provides substantial
income and employment to an important segment of the
Canadian seaboard population, and its total effect should
not be lightly eliminated.
The fisheries minister's ban on commercial salmon fishing is certainly a step in the right direction. However, my
own instinct would probably have been to adopt less
drastic surgery. If asked, I would perhaps have been
tempted to reduce the number of commercial permits
where possible, and then put severe restrictions on the
netting season to permit a sufficient escape of salmon for
breeding purposes. I would still have provided compensation for those whose earnings were affected, but I think
[Hon. Mr. Molson.]

May 15,1972

on a smaller scale. In my view, such restrictions should
apply, not only to the Miramichi and Port aux Basques
waters, but to all the waters and salmon rivers on our east
coast from Labrador south, including Newfoundland and
Nova Scotia, and should be accompanied by reduced
limits for anglers.
I say that the restrictions should apply to all waters on
our east coast because I must, with respect, disagree with
Senator Smith, who said that Nova Scotia and most of
Newfoundland were not included in the commercial ban
because salmon taken in the Greenland fishery and the
high seas do not come from the rivers of those provinces.
While it is true that grilse apparently do not venture so f ar
on the high seas, our best information is that there is no
foundation for this belief, and that the large salmon being
taken by ships of the Danes, West Germans, Norwegians,
Faroese, and others come from all North American rivers
from Newfoundland southward, as well as those of the
United Kingdom and Europe. One country they do not
come from is Denmark.
As I said, I might have chosen this approach of much
reduced and controlled netting, but I am willing to believe
that the government has had the widest possible advice,
and so chose its announced policy. Certainly at this
moment, the question of Salmo salar'ssurvival is critical
and I agree that drastic action bas to be taken.
O

(2100)

Honourable senators, to sum up, I would like to put my
points very briefly:
1. Continuing and stronger efforts should be made to
convince the Danes to halt immediately their deep sea
fishery, as this is definitely the greatest threat to the
survival of the Atlantic salmon at the present time.
2. Restrictions on commercial fishing, such as those
recently promulgated by the government, are justified
and should be helpful in at least maintaining stocks of the
species at their current level.
3. Although I believe that limitations on angling are vital
to a complete conservation program, I must reiterate that
a total ban on angling will cause undue hardship to an
important segment of our society. Moreover, as I
explained, such action would remove any protection the
Atlantic salmon might have in the rivers. It would leave
no doubt that the species would disappear.
Hon. Frederick William Rowe: Honourable senators, I
had not intended to speak on this matter but while listening to the very informative and well-documented statement by Senator Molson, several points came to mind. I
should like to make a few comments and then direct a
question to Senator Molson.
This is a very important matter which affects all
Canada and particularly eastern Canada. Senator Molson
referred to the discovery by an American nuclear submarine of the feeding grounds of the salmon in the Atlantic
Ocean, thought now to be under the ice floes near Greenland. He said that the Danes have taken advantage of this
discovery and have been decimating, virtually destroying,
this great species.
I accepted the statement, as I am sure most Canadians
have, that the feeding grounds were discovered by this
submarine. However, a few days ago I saw a statement in

M

May

15 ,v1972
15

1972

SENATE DEBATES

one of our local newspapers by a prominent marine biologist-his name eludes me for the moment, though I have
no doubt about his credentials-in which he stated that it
is utter nonsense to claim that an American nuclear submarine discovered the feeding grounds of the Atlantic
salmon. He said that these grounds were known to marine
biologists for many years, and that what happened was
that the salmon changed their feeding grounds because of
changes in oceanic conditions, water temperature, and
other factors. He says the salmon have now moved into
this area and the Danes are in a position to take advantage of this migration.
In one of today's Newfoundland papers there is a letter
to the editor by a well-known student of salmon biology.
In his opinion, the greatest destroyer of the Atlantic
salmon is not the coastal commercial fishermen of Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Quebec, the Labrador coast,
or Denmark; it is the common eel which infests the estuaries, rivers, and lakes of Newfoundland and Labrador,
and, I believe, the mainland too.
I am not a salmon fisherman, either commercial or
sports, but I do a lot of swimming and I know that it is
impossible to swim in a lake, pond, river, stream or estuary of Newfoundland and Labrador without coming into
contact with or seeing eels. These predators exist in the
millions and most of them are three to four f eet long.
Those who catch salmon say that if you leave them in
the water for a short time they will be immediately
attacked by eels. I am not suggesting that the eels would
be able to attack live, free salmon. But the point made by
this writer was that these millions of eels do more to
destroy the embryonic salmon, the parrs and smolts, than
all other factors put together.
I am not an expert. I know nothing more about these
matters than does the ordinary casual observer, but it
strikes me that when we have disagreement on two such
fundamental points as those I have enumerated, there is
need for a tremendous amount of research. It strikes me
that we may have taken action-I am not implying that we
have, but certainly it would be dangerous if we have taken
action-without there having been sufficient scientific
inquiries spread over a long period of time.
It has just come to my mind now that my maternal
grandfather was a salmon fisherman in the great Notre
Dame Bay of Newfoundland, into which two of the largest
rivers in Newfoundland empty, the Exploit and the
Gander. One of the great salmon fisheries of Newfoundland is to be found in that bay. I am reminded of the fact
that, long before I was born, there was a four- or five-year
period when the Atlantic salmon, as we now call them,
virtually disappeared from the waters of Newfoundland.
Everyone said the salmon had been caught out and would
disappear completely. But it did not disappear, it came
back in even greater numbers.
I cite that as another indication of the need for more
basic research on a matter which so fundamentally
affects our economy. I would like to throw this out in the
sense of a question, not entirely a rhetorical question, to
my honourable friend, who is obviously a student of this
matter. In his opinion, is there not a need for far more
research than is being done at this moment?

Hon. Mr. Moison: Honourable senators, I am not a biologist or a geneticist, so I am reluctant to express my own
opinions too loudly. With regard to the first point, that the
salmon feeding grounds have always been known, I do
not think that is well borne out historically. I say that
after thinking about it for a few minutes, but I am quite
prepared to accept the fact that the Danes knew their
location before the salmon moved to another area.
However, that does not alter one point I have made, that
since 1964, 5,800,000 pounds of salmon have been taken in
one year from of an area where none were taken before.
Those salmon had to be bred somewhere, and the information that we have indicates that 50 per cent come from
the Canadian rivers.
The second point about eels is one about which I really
know nothing at all. The river I mentioned as my example
has water which, if honourable senators will forgive the
comparison, resembles gin; it is so clear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Then it is good water.
* (2110)

Hon. Mr. Molson: The water is so clear that if a newspaper-even the Globe and Mail-were to sink to the bottom
in ten feet, you could still read it.
That river has been fished and records and diaries have
been kept for over 100 years, but none of us who fish there
have ever seen eels in it. I find it difficult, therefore, to
believe that there are eels in that river. Thus, the little fish
such as the parrs and the smolts could scarcely be
attacked in the river. If salmon are attacked in the coastal
waters near the mouth of the river, then I suspect strongly
that the salmon caught or observed there would bear
marks or scars which could be identified as from the
attacks of eels.
We take salmon that have seal marks on them. We take
salmon that have been attacked by otters. Regrettably, in
recent years most of the salmon taken in that river, as
well as in a number of other rivers, have had extraordinarily ugly neck wounds caused by nylon nets. These
nets have actually worn away pieces of the flesh at the
back of the head, under the chin, and at the fins, and so
on.
I believe that if eels really were a menace at the mainland, they would have been observed. I do not know at all
about Newfoundland and Labrador, but if eels had been
the main problern in the Gaspé and the Baie des Chaleurs
areas, I am sure traces of thern would have been detected.
The third point the honourable senator made-and it
has been mentioned before-was that it has been noted
that the salmon takes vary enormously from year to year.
I believe that is absolutely true. The cyclical aspect of this
affair has been noted many times. One biologist mentioned the other day that it was a ten-year cycle. I have
heard it said that it is a five-year cycle. From records I
have seen I believe you could take your choice, but there
certainly are cycles. There are the lean years and there
are the fat years. It is not a seven-year cycle as in the
Bible, however, but either a five-year cycle or a ten-year
cycle. At any rate, for reasons that I do not know, there
definitely does seem to be a period of waxing and waning
so far as the salmon crop is concerned.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Carter, debate adjourned.

COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO STUDY LEGISLATION
Hon. Salter A. Hayden. with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(e), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce be authorized to examine and
consider any bills based on the Budget Resolutions
relating to income tax in advance of the said bills
coming before the Senate; and
That the committee have power to engage the services of such counsel, staff and technical advisers as
may be necessary for the purpose of the said
examination.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I first inquire if there is
leave before I put the motion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure honourable
senators to adopt the motion.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, you will recall
that a motion of this nature was presented by me to the
Senate last fall at a time when the summary of tax reform
legislation was tabled in both houses, and the bill implementing the summary of tax reform legislation was presented and tabled in the other house. At that time the
committee went into action even before Bill C-259 had
passed in the other place, and we conducted public hearings over a period of possibly two and a half months.
During that time we made three reports to the Senate
reviewing the representations that had been made to us,
analyzing the scope and effect of them, and making certain recommendations as to changes. In those reports we
went so far as to include a draft form of amendments to
Bill C-259 which would give effect to those recommendations.
Bill C-259 subsequently passed and received royal
assent without any amendments having actually been
made, but there was an undertaking that in the new year
an amending bill would be introduced. Certainly when an
amending bill was introduced it would give the Senate the
opportunity, if it still felt the same way about the recommendations, to- make those amendments, in line with the
recommendations, to the amending bill.
We are now at the stage where there was a budget
statement and report on May 8, and attached to that was a
draft form of a bill providing for amendments to the
Income Tax Act.
At this stage, therefore, our concern is to learn as quickly as we can to what extent the recommendations of the
Senate committee, made last fall, have been recognized
and accepted and are included in the amending bill. In
order to do that as thoroughly as possible, it would be

necessary to convene the Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce to examine the recommendations and the amending bill to determine to what extent
these recommendations, and proposed amendments, have
been reflected in the bill. Also, to the extent that they have
not been reflected in the bill, the committee could inquire
as to the reasons why such proposed amendments have
not been accepted. Having received al that information,
we would be in a position to determine to what extent, if
at all, we should provide for amendments to this amending bill.
Honourable senators, I can tell you I do not propose to
speak at any length today on the recommendations which
we made. They are in the reports which are in the hands
of all senators and have been so for some time. I do say it
is important that we reorganize our team of technical
advisers, which we had last time, and set to work in
advance of the bill coming over to us, to determine the
nature and effect of the amendments and whether they
have gone as far as we recommended; and if they have
not, why they have not; and whether we still are prepared
to affirm our conviction that those amendments which we
recommended are amendments which should be made.
Honourable senators, I can tell you that there were a
series of amendments to which we attached a lot of importance. They had to do with profit-sharing plans and
deferred profit-sharing plans of employees. I assume that
senators are aware of what is included in that description.
Briefly, a profit-sharing plan is a plan under which
employees make contributions to a fund which is administered by a trustee or trustees. They make that contribution on a percentage basis of their annual salary. The
employer also makes a contribution to the fund. Then the
fund is in business. The fund may acquire shares of the
company for whom these employees are working, or other
shares. Usually the fund itself has income and it has
capital gains in the fund.
In the profit-sharing plan, when the employee makes his
contribution annually, he makes it out of tax-paid dollars.
That means that he is not entitled to deduct any amount
such as he is entitled to deduct in the case where he is
contributing to a pension plan. In the profit-sharing plan,
annually, the trustee figures out the interest of each
employee and what his percentage interest is in the earnings of the fund, both the income earnings and the capital
gains earnings, and then the employer's contribution is
treated in the same way as a salary paid to an employee. It
is treated as income of the employee.
B

(1410)

In the profit-sharing plan, annually the trustee makes a
calculation as to what is the income tax payable by the
employee by reason of these different items, but excludes
therefrom, of course, the employee's contribution, since
he has paid that contribution with tax-paid dollars.
In the amendments we recommended that the
employee's profit-sharing plan in relation to capital gains
in the fund, and in relation to capital gains which are part

SENATE DEBATES

of the payment out, should be subject only to a capital
gains tax and not to income tax. But under the bill as it
then stood all the amount of payments out, whether they
were of a capital nature or an income nature, were treated
as income and were subject to income tax. Then in some
cases there is a distribution in kind out of the fund. In
other words, shares of various companies which are held
in the fund on a pro rata basis are distributed in lieu of
cash to the employees.
So far as the original bill was concerned, all this, and
the value of all this, was income in the hands of the
employee. We took the position that after all we now have
a capital gains tax and anything that is by its nature a
capital gain should attract only a capital gains tax. The
amendments do recognize this recommendation in relation to profit-sharing plans and they do recognize that the
capital gains element in the trust fund, the capital gains
element in what is paid out, should be treated so that it is
subject to a capital gains tax and not be treated as
income. As you know, of course, the capital gains tax is
substantially less than what would be the marginal rate of
any employee who was subject to a tax on these amounts.
Then the amending bill also provides that where there is
a distribution in kind-for instance, shares are distributed
out of the fund to employees-that the distribution will
attract capital gains only where there has been a realization of gain. So long as they hold the shares which are
distributed there will be no capital gains tax incidence,
but the moment they are sold and there is a gain then they
attract capital gains tax.
We made this recommendation as well for deferred
profit-sharing plans, but this has not been accepted by the
legislation which I am discussing. We should ascertain
what the reasons are. The committee was certainly
impressed with the fact that this was an important element which should be thoroughly considered, because the
great feature of the deferred profit-sharing plan is the
lump sum payment that comes out at the end of the road.
People for a period of a lifetime contribute to a trust fund
with tax-paid dollars and when, at the end of the road,
they receive the lump sum payment they are taxed on that
lump sum payment. The lump sum payment to the people
who are members of a plan of this kind has been a very
attractive feature because it represents an amount of
money that they can use. For example, this was one way
of saving where they could pay off a mortgage or could
acquire an interest in a business after they had ceased to
follow their regular line of employment.
These were the great attractions of a lump sum payment. And under the lump sum payment feature there
was a provision that when they were taxed on the lump
sum they were entitled to the averaging provisions which
were then in the Income Tax Act. Those averaging provisions meant that their marginal rate would be the averaging of the previous three years, of their earnings in the
previous three years of their employment. This was some
relief against having to pay the full amount of income tax
on a very substantial sum of money which would only
accrue in one year. Furthermore, in going back to the
previous three years of employment, the level of tax and
the level of income would have been very much lower.
iHon. Mr. Hayden.]

May 16, 1972

So, honourable senators, you have the distinction made
in the amending bill as between profit-sharing plans and
deferred profit-sharing plans under which the tax is
deferred to be paid at the end of the road. Now, you might
consider that because of this there should not be extended
to them the rights given under profit-sharing plans, which
make the distinction between income and capital, and the
right to take this averaging under section 36 of the old act
which I have explained to you. I say this because under
the bill as it then stood if you took the averaging under
section 36, you could not take any other averaging rights.
The amending legislation does permit an employee of a
profit-sharing plan and of a deferred profit-sharing plan
to take advantage for a period of time of the averaging
under section 36, and he may also take advantage of the
general averaging provisions in the bill. Then the
employees of profit-sharing plans have the distinction as
between income and capital, and they are taxed on the
elements in the fund which are income at their marginal
rate of tax and on the elements that are capital at the
capital gains rate.
But, honourable senators, the particular provision
which we recommended has not been accepted in relation
to deferred profit-sharing plans, and there are thousands
and thousands of people who are members of these
deferred profit-sharing plans. If I remember correctly,
one group appearing before us, representing two companies, had at least 20,000 members. This makes us realize
that we are dealing with a substantial number of people
who would be adversely affected in the sense that when
they come to receive their lump sum payment they are not
going to receive that for which over a longer or shorter
period of time they have contributed.
Let me make it quite clear that I am not expressing a
view one way or the other as to what should be done with
this dividend, but I was a member of the committee and I
know that the committee was unanimous in its recommendations. Therefore, I think we should find out the reasoning or the logic behind this. In fact many of the other
recommendations which we made were accepted, but I
would say that the majority have not been accepted and
no reasons have been given for this. There has been no
comment at all in connection with quite a number of the
recommendations made by the Senate, and I think it is
important that we should know why. The only real way to
learn that is by having this bill studied in committee
where we can hear the minister, the departmental officials and the members of the public, who are vitally
concerned and who made representations, to determine
whether there was a valid reason which prevented the
acceptance of the recommendations or whether some
points in connection with them had not been properly
considered. Then your committee can report to the Senate
the grounds upon which certain of their recommendations
should not be pursued further, or whether the reasons
given to the committee were inadequate and the Senate
should insist upon these amendments being accepted.
a (1420)

We did have certain undertakings from the then Minister of Finance in relation to some of these items. His main
undertaking was that there would be an amending bill
introduced early in the new year. Many of us felt that even

May 16. 1972
May

16

1972

SENATE DEBATES

without such an undertaking, all of our recommendations
would be accepted. But, obviously you could not insist on
that because there could be factors in connection with
these recommendations, such as an incidence of tax, matters affecting the revenue, or other elements with which
we would not be as thoroughly aware as would the ministers. However, this is the information we should obtain
now in order that we may give intelligent consideration to
the recommendations which we feel should be implemented into law. The only way that I am aware of to deal with
this effectively and thoroughly is by studying the bill in
committee where we can consider all of the angles and
submit a report to the Senate, and that report can be
accepted or rejected in whole or in part.
Let me illustrate by referring to the item of passive
income in Bill C-259. This is a case where the arm of the
law was reaching out to tax certain earnings of subsidiaries of Canadian companies operating abroad. In some
instances, if the income was of a passive nature and was
not generated by an active business, whether it came by
way of dividends to the Canadian parent company or
otherwise, the income would be subject to full rates of tax
and would not qualify for dividend credits. We specified
that there should be some clarification as to what constitutes an active business and how the operation abroad
should be analyzed to determine whether or not it is
passive income.
We also suggested extending the period respecting the
rule as to passive income before such rules would come
into force. This report proposes that the introduction of
rules respecting the taxation of passive income be
deferred from its original date of 1973 to 1975 to permit a
further examination of their impact. It also provides that
there should be a de minimis rule, which means that if the
amount being considered as passive income does not
exceed $500 in this area it may be disregarded as passive
income and you do not pursue the matter any further. In
our recommendation we felt this amount was too low to
bring about the full impact of the rules as to passive
income. Whether the rules, when formulated, will deal
specifically with our recommendation is something which
will have to be determined.
We made quite substantial recommendations in connection with non-resident owned investment corporations,
and nothing has been done with respect to them.
We recommend that the basic herd concept in connection with farmers' operations should be maintained as it
was in the original act. There is nothing in the bill which
deals with that.
We also recommended that there should be a roll-over in
connection with the sale of farm property by a father to
his son or sons who remain on the farm and continue the
farming operations. We recommended that if there is any
gain between the cost to the original farmer and the price
or value at the time of sale to the son or sons, instead of
having a capital gains tax applied at once-which might
present difficulty for the farmer or his family in finding
the money-there should be a roll-over of the capital gain;
in effect, a deferral of capital gains tax. The impact of
capital gains tax would come in only as and when the
f arm was sold and vacated by the family.

There are quite a number of these items. Since a
number of senators may not be familiar with the reports
which have been made, it would be a mistake, in my view,
to go into detail with respect to all the items contained in
our recommendations, as to how many recommendations
have been dealt with positively and how many have not.
I have mentioned certain items for the purpose of
indicating the direction in which, in my opinion, the consideration of the committee should go. There has been a
great deal of publicity given to the recommendations
made by the Senate and to their importance. There have
even been acknowledgments from the Minister of Finance
and others within the government on the extent and thoroughness of the consideration given to Bill C-259 by the
Senate committee. However, we would be failing in our
responsibility, and would do less than a full and complete
job, if we did not follow up our work by determining the
extent to which our recommendations have been accepted, and why some have not been accepted.
The committee should have an opportunity of reporting
on whether, in its view, the reasons for not accepting the
Senate's recommendations are sound and valid, or whether the Senate amendments should be insisted upon.
Even if the committee makes a recommendation to the
Senate, in the final analysis it is the Senate which passes
on whether there should or should not be an amendment.
It is much better to be in a position of having knowledge
of all the background and circumstances, which can be
obtained through the work of the committee, than simply
to deal with the bill on a hit-and-miss basis without being
fully possessed of the reasons underlying the decisions
which led to the framing of the bill and the inclusion of
some things which we thought should be contained therein, but excluding other items which we thought should
also have been dealt with.
That is the reason why I now move-and this is in
accordance with our procedures-that the bill relating to
income tax, arising from the budget resolutions, be
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, I wish to say
one word concerning Senator Hayden's request that the
Senate obtain adequate staff to look into these amendments to the Income Tax Act. I think Senator Hayden has
just given us the reason why we have never had a staff
that is adequate. Here is a bill that is extremely complicated. It was presented in the other place just a few days ago
and yet Senator Hayden can get up and without a note in
his hands he can review the bill and tell us what is in it or
what is not in it. He is in a position to do that because he is
one of our most distinguished tax lawyers and, as well, he
has a large office in which he has some very able young
tax lawyers under him who are prepared and willing to do
this work. They are, of course, Mr. Arthur Scace, Mr.
Stephen Smith and Mr. Douglas Ewens. These people
have never been paid by the Senate. This work is all done
gratuitously. The point I am trying to make is that the
Senate must have a staff for this type of thing. Senator
Hayden is not going to do this forever. I do not think any
other one of us could get up with a bill just introduced in
the other place and adequately explain what it contains.

SENATE DEBATES
* (1430)

An Hon. Senator: You could do it.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I believe the Senate should at least
have a nucleus of staff that can do this type of work. It
has been done for years now by Senator Hayden, but I
think the day is going to come when he is not going to
want to carry on with it. Perhaps Senator Hayden and the
Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance should get together and agree on an adequate
staff. I think it is essential that the Senate does have a
staff that can help whoever has to deal with these matters
when Senator Hayden decides to step down.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators, I am not
going to hold up this resolution by refusing to give consent, though I do not agree with it. On another occasion I
intend to express the reasons why I do not agree with it. If
you read the record you will notice that the Honourable
Edgar Benson indicated that we were doing some special
pleading, as was done here on the floor by Senator
Hayden today, in saying what he did instead of just presenting the resolution.
I think I should make clear to Senator Beaubien that we
are not poor relatives. The White Paper and the tax
reform legislation studies cost the Senate half a million
dollars. Of that figure, $200,000 or a little more was spent
for specialists and experts.
The reason I am really consenting to the motion today,
instead of holding it up, is that as I heard the motion
Senator Hayden said "to present a bill to the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce."
My own feeling is that there will be no bill while this
Parliament is in session. For that reason I am prepared to
let it pass.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Did I understand the honourable
Senator Hayden to say that his proposal was that the bill
itself arising from the budget papers be referred to the
committee or that the substance of the bill be referred to
the committee?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is correct. In the Ways and
Means report of May 8 you will find a copy of the proposed legislation. There is a precedent for this. It has been
done before by the Senate by referring to committee the
proposed legislation before it has gone into the form of a
bill and been considered by the other place, which is the
ordinary way in which the bill would come to us. The
Senate has done it before not only in connection with the
bill that came in last year but at a much earlier time, that
being in the forties. The language which I have used in
this resolution is exactly the language which was used
then.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am still not quite clear on the
answer. Am I incorrect in my assumption that the substance of the tax reform Bill, to give it its short title, was
referred to the committee and not the bill itself prior to
the bill reaching us here?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What was tabled in this house last
year were the bills arising out of the summary of the tax
reform legislation and any bills relating thereto. That was
the form in which the matter was referred to the
committee.
[Hon. Mr. Beaubien.]

May 16, 1972

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I do have some
remarks to make regarding this motion, but since this
motion has come from the Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce,
who is not a representative of the government, I think the
Leader of the Government should make clear the position
of the government on this motion before I deal with it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: My honourable friend has to choose
when he speaks.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You have to make up your mind occasionally, even if it is only the first time. You have to make
up your mind and not wait until after I have spoken to
distort the meaning of my words as you did the last time.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Honourable senators, perhaps we are
talking about a non sequitur if Parliament is going to be
dissolved on Friday next, as I understand it is, from very
prominent members on the government side of the house.
If it should not be dissolved, has the honourable senator,
our esteemed chairman of this committee, any acknowledgment by the Honourable John Turner, our new Minister of Finance, that the very definite undertakings of the
former Minister of Finance will be carried out in incorporating the recommendations of our committee into
legislation early this year?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I only know things that are reported
to this side, and I am sure my honourable friend was in
the way of hearing them as I was. My understanding was
that the undertaking Mr. Benson gave when he was before
the committee was not a personal undertaking. At least,
he did not couch it in that language, as you will see if you
go back and read Hansard. I think there has been
acknowledgment recognizing that his undertaking was
not a personal one. I recognize too, of course, that no
matter what the undertakings might be, the moment the
bill gets into the Commons the fate of the bill depends on
the vote it commands. Therefore, the undertaking could
not be said in that sense to be an undertaking of every
member of the House of Commons. I regard the undertaking of the minister, for what it is worth, as being an
undertaking of the government at that time.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I should like to say to Senator Walker
that Senator Hayden himself has personally given the
answer. Some of the Senate amendments have been
accepted by the government.
Hon. Mr. Walker: A great many.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, a great many, and they will be
incorporated in legislation ultimately to come before us.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Since the Leader of the Government has in very short terms indicated his position, I
suppose he has used his right to speak on this motion and
will not try to follow me and distort the meaning of the
motion or what I might say.
I am pleased to give my views on this motion. I remember too well when we passed a similar motion last September. It will not come as a revelation to many members of
the Senate that we passed a similar motion on September
14 last in connection with Bill C-259, the so-called tax
reform bill, of which so many now have doubts, doubts
pertaining to its practical implications. When the motion
to refer the subject matter of Bill C-259 to the Standing

Mav 16. 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce was
proposed by Senator Hayden, Senator Martin said he was
in agreement, and added:
* (1440)

In the way proposed, therefore, the effective date
for implementation of the bill can be met, and at the
same time the two Houses of Parliament, each exercising in the proper way their respective legislative
functions in accordance with section 18 of the B.N.A.
Act, will be able to discharge those functions. However, we are making it clear at this stage, as the
Leader of the Opposition has done, and as Senator
Hayden did, that we are not dealing with the principle
of the bill; we are anticipating the bill, and we will
deal with it properlyI underline "properly"; these were the words of the
Leader of the Government on September 14:
... in a legislative way after we have had an opportunity of giving it the study that will enable us to be
fully informed as to the nature of the bill or what
changes should be made to it.
That is the background to the first motion of this kind,
which was passed by the Senate last September.
When Senator Hayden notified me this morning that he
intended to present this kind of motion I told him that I
was in agreement with it in principle, for the reasons I
had given in September: that we were to look into this bill
merely from a technical standpoint, that we would call on
experts to tell us what the practical consequences of the
amendments proposed would be, and whether there was
acceptance of the suggestions made by the committee last
year, about which the then Minister of Finance said he
might do something in an amending bill that would be
coming to us early in 1972. We are now in the middle of
May. I do not know if it is still early for the government. I
think it is late for the government in other respects.
I am willing to support this motion, but I do not want
the Leader of the Government to come and tell us, when
the bill reaches us, that we need not deal with it in the
ordinary way, that the committee has done the job, and
that therefore the Senate can take a day on second reading and a day in committee to deal with it and pass it. The
government leader seems to be of the opinion that any
time we take a good close look at legislation providing
government handouts, government vote-buying, we are
exercising undue influence on the legislative process and
that this might result in a popular cry for our abolition. If
we fail to do our job properly because we fear being
abolished then we deserve to be abolished. I have had just
about enough of this sort of servility.
I am going to follow the wish of the Senate here. I am
going to follow the desire of the chairman of the committee. I am going to work on that bill. But if the same thing
happens as happened last December, I can assure the
Leader of the Government that he will hear from me.
Motion agreed to.

INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
THIRTEENTH ANNUAL MEETING AT QUITO, ECUADOR

Hon. Paul Martin rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Thirteenth Annual Meeting of the Inter-American
Development Bank, held in Quito, Ecuador, 8th to
12th May, 1972, and in particular to the participation
therein of the Canadian delegation.
He said: Honourable senators, the board of governors of
the Inter-American Development Bank held its thirteenth
annual meeting last week in Quito, Ecuador. I had the
honour to lead the Canadian delegation to this meeting in
the capital of Ecuador, which is located on the equator
two miles high in the heart of the Andes.
The meeting was significant for Canada. Despite our
association with the IDB dating back to 1964, this was the
first time that we attended as a member of the bank. We
acceded formally to membership in the IDB on May 3 last,
when, on behalf of Canada, our ambassador at Washington affixed his signature to the original instrument of
agreement at the bank's headquarters.
I was accompanied on the delegation by Mr. Gérin-Lajoie, President of the Canadian International Development Agency, and by a group of officials from the Department of External Affairs, the Department of Finance, the
Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, from
CIDA, and from the Export Development Corporation.
I should like to note that we were greeted cordially by
the president of the bank, the distinguished former Minister of Finance of Mexico, Antonio Ortiz Mena, by Francisco Morales Bermudez of Peru, who is chairman of the
bank's Board of Governors, and by the President of the
Republic of Ecuador, General Lara. In his address to the
governors of the bank in Quito, the president, Mr. Ortiz
Mena, recalled that I, as Secretary of State for External
Affairs, had signed an agreement in December 1964 establishing a Canadian fund under whose auspices Canada
subsequently made $74 million available to the bank's
loan capital.
Reflecting our broadening relations with the Caribbean
and Latin American areas, Mr. Sharp, my colleague, the
Secretary of State for External Affairs, noted ten days
ago that the acquisition of full membership in the InterAmerican Development Bank was a "significant milestone" in achieving the desired intensification of our relations with the Americas as set forth in the Foreign Policy
Review.
In becoming a member of the Inter-American Development Bank, Canada continues to evolve her now longstanding policy of seeking to increase allocations for foreign aid, and in doing so to make the best use of the
machinery provided by multilateral institutions. As a
member of the IDB, Canada also joins the United States
as the only other non-borrowing member of the bank. As
such we have agreed to make a paid-in subscription of $40
million to the capital stock of the bank, and to contribute
a further $60 million over the next three years to the fund
for special operations, which provides low interest loans
to members of the bank.

SENATE DEBATES
a

(1450)

Honourable senators, membership in the Inter-American Development Bank, membership in the Pan-American Health Organization and the Inter-American Institute
of Agricultural Sciences, acquisition recently of a permanent observer status at the ambassadorial level in the
Organization of American States, our close links with the
Commonwealth and other states in the Caribbean, and
our participation in the Caribbean Development Bank,
are all steps which foster our growing involvement with
our neighbours in the Americas.
Let no one think that this involvement will not be in
relation to very important developments in that part of
the world. It is the most rapid-growing area in the world,
where it is estimated that at the end of the century there
will be over 100 million people possessing a market
second only to that of China.
This close and growing association with our sister states
in the hemisphere serves also to open the way for closer
economic and commercial relations, although that is not
the primary purpose for our seeking to join the bank.
Although our membership in the IDB arises from our
concern to assist developing countries in the area, the
importance of the inter-American market will become
increasingly apparent in the future. My recent two visits
to Latin America-to Ecuador and to Chile and, on the
way, to Colombia and Peru-have opened my eyes to the
possible ways in which mutually beneficial exchanges
should be able to develop from rapid social and economic
progress in these countries. Vast and growing markets
exist in the area, and the more that we have to do with
assisting the development of the inter-American economy
the greater will be their capacity to import Canadian
goods and services. Indeed, immediate advantages arise
from our membership in the bank, enabling Canadian
manufacturers to participate in procurement for projects
launched by Inter-American Development Bank financng.
Our membership in this bank is complemented not only
by our financial association extending over the last eight
years, but also by our program of bilateral technical
assistance to Latin America, which was established a year
ago. In joining the bank, we join an institution whose
work has been established beyond question. Founded at
the end of 1959, the bank has disbursed to member countries some $4 billion in ordinary and soft loans. The bank
is the largest of the four regional development banks, and
has acquitted itself well in promoting inter-American
understanding. The bank has concentrated on providing
loans to finance capital spending projects in such major
sectors as agriculture, transport, communications, electrical power, heavy industry, mining, education and urban
development. The latter, I might add, is a growing problem throughout the hemisphere, as was reflected in many
of the speeches and statements during the last meeting.
I am sure that honourable senators who have been in
Latin America recently could not have avoided being
impressed by the tremendous development that is taking
place, particularly in the great cities of that continentplaces like Bogota, Santiago, Quito and Lima. The city of
Bogota, in which I had never been before, is a big modern
city, comparable to anything that we have in this country,
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

May 16,1972

and structured in modern terms that cannot help but
captivate fancy and interest. It is not too early for Canada
to be developing the interest that she has in institutions
designed to improve the social well-being and the economic well-being of the countries in the hemisphere that is
ours as well.
The bank's membership includes every Latin American
state, except Cuba, and the Caribbean is also represented
by the Barbados, Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad and
Tobago. Our membership completes the representation of
developed countries within the hemisphere of the InterAmerican Development Bank.
In his observations to the governors, Mr. Ortiz Mena
pointed out that Canada's acquisition of membership
"constitutes final recognition of the fact that that great
country is not only a geographical neighbour but also an
inseparable part of the American system." I should like to
add myself that our membership was warmly welcomed
by all of the governors of the bank and by the several
thousand people who attended the opening session, and
that we received an emotional welcome when the delegation entered the chamber of the Legislative Palace to take
the Canadian seats for the first time as a full voting
member of the bank.
As one delegate observed, this was an historic moment
in that for the first time in history all of the members of
the western hemisphere were taking part in the same
organization.
We heard a similar statement from Rodrigo Llorente,
the Governor for Columbia, a well-known central banker
of Columbia, who spoke on behalf of his fellow governors
at the opening session of the meeting. The chairman of the
board of governors of the bank, Mr. Bermudez, the Minister of Finance of Peru, spoke of the "great privilege"
enjoyed by the IDB, the Inter-American Development
Bank, in welcoming Canada to membership. He went on
to say that in expressing collectively cordial welcome to
Canada he wished to express deep gratification, and that
he felt assured that Canada's joining the Bank would
prove a positive contribution in the struggle for development. I have no doubt that it will.
In responding to these words, on behalf of Canada I told
my fellow governors that our joining the Bank was not an
accident of geography but rather an affirmation of the
fact that we regarded our membership in the bank as "a
milestone on the road to closer co-operation with the
countries of Latin America and the Caribbean." I told
them that Canada, having recognized encouraging signs
of social and economic progress, wanted to play a fuller
role in helping the countries of South America and the
Caribbean to achieve their goals of economic growth. In
joining the Bank, Canada seeks to take steps to implement that desire. That is the view of the government.
In addition, honourable senators, we shall continue to
strengthen our ties at the bilateral level and to increase
our support for non-governmental institutions, particularly the religious orders, whose record of achievement in
Latin America has been most impressive. In this practical
manner, Canada is feeling her way towards a new and
much closer relationship with all of our neighbours in the
hemisphere. For the present we can do most to help in the
economic sphere. That is why we are developing pro-

grams of technical assistance, and that is why we joined
the Caribbean Development Bank and we are now members of the Inter-American Development Bank.
* (1500)

As I told the governors in Quito, "The business of this
Bank is development and it is as a partner in development
that Canada has opted for the privilege of full membership. But when all is said and done, development is a
means and not an end. The end, as one development
economist put it more than a decade ago, is 'the adventure
of seeing what man can and will do when the pressure of
scarcity is substantially lifted from him.' "
It is to that end, honourable senators, to the full unfolding of the diverse societies represented in this InterAmerican Development Bank, that Canada will join its
efforts to those of its friends and neighbours in the western hemisphere.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I was somewhat amused that in his speech the government leader
referred on two or three occasions to his fellow governors
of the Inter-American Development Bank. Senator Stanbury will surely want to have a word with him about that.
He is not supposed to go out of his way to identify himself
with classic bank directors. That hardly goes along with
the idea of calling the Liberal Party the "People's Party,"
a label which Senator Stanbury has been trying to popularize in the last few months.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It is a different hemisphere, you see.
Hon. Mr. Walker: That is a very nice point.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would Senator Flynn not agree that a
bank like this, which is designed to help improve the
standards of living of poor countries, is perhaps the best
form and the best expression of a liberal attitude?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I shall come to the merit of the bank in
a moment, but I do not think it bears any relation to the
fact of the government leader's calling himself a governor
of the bank.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Well, that is the title.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I know, but you seemed to insist so
much on it that I was rather amused. No doubt this is one
area where the Leader of the Government would probably have liked to make some contribution, but he cannot
be everywhere at the same time.
In a more serious vein, I think it fitting that Senator
Martin should have led the Canadian delegation to Quito.
It was he who in 1964, as Secretary of State for External
Affairs, signed an agreement establishing a Canadian
fund under which Canada subsequently made $74 million
available to the bank's loan capital. And here he was
again last week agreeing to make a paid-in subscription of
$40 million to the capital stock of the bank, and to contribute a further $60 million over the next three years.
We on this side certainly approve the efforts that this
government and the government which preceded it have
made towards greater involvement with our Latin American neighbours.
Not so long ago we were hesitant about intensifying our
relations with the Americas for fear of alienating some of

our Commonwealth cousins. In retrospect it appears that
our timidity was unjustified.
Great Britain has chosen to strengthen its ties with the
countries of continental Europe. Similarly, it is entirely
appropriate and it makes no end of good sense for us to
do likewise with the people of the Americas. Our
increased aid to Central America and South America and
the Caribbean will, in the long run, prove beneficial to us.
Their economic and social progress cannot help but provide us with future markets for our goods. This is not
charity on our part; it is a wise long-term investment. We
are in a position to be able to help, and I feel that we are
right in doing so.
The one thing that especially pleases us is that the aid as
distributed through the Inter-American Development
Bank is not invariably government-to-government help.
The private entrepreneur can borrow for the development
of his enterprise. I consider this an excellent departure
from the traditional way of helping.
To summarize, we are in favour of aid to our Latin
American neighbours. We are particularly in favour of the
way in which such aid is distributed by the Inter-American Development Bank. When aid money goes directly to
those who can most efficiently help develop the countrythat is, the local entrepreneurs-that country's chances of
coping with the twentieth century are significantly
enhanced.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might direct a question to the Leader of the Government?
Is there, under the constitution of the bank or otherwise, a
formal relationship between the magnitude of the Canadian government's contribution to the funding of the bank
and the access of Canadian businessmen to the procurement of contracts financed by the bank in the area?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No, there is no relationship in that
sense. Even though Canada was not a member of the
bank, and even before 1964 when we used the bank as our
agent for allocation of assistance, Canadian businessmen
had the right to bid on contracts for work in any Latin
American country out of funds provided by the then
members of the bank.
Now that we are a member of the bank, neither the
opportunity for participating in work nor the resource
contribution to Latin American countries on the part of
Canadians will be affected in the least one way or another. For instance, just before we joined, one of our electric
companies-and I do not think I should mention the
name-put in a bid for a very large contract in one of the
major countries. I do not know what the result of its bid
will be, but there is no reason why that particular work
could not be financed out of funds supplied by other
donors. Not all the donors are members of the bank.
There are other countries which are not members of the
bank but which do supply loan capital to it.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: May I ask the Leader of the Government a question? Is there any check upon, or any rules
governing, how this bank will make loans, or why and to
whom it will make loans?
My honourable friend a minute ago spoke of the rich
and great cities he had seen in South America. Did he go
into the countryside and see the abject, awful poverty and

SENATE DEBATES
degradation in which hundreds of millions of people in
South America live?
If the Inter-American Development Bank is going to do
something for these people, I am heartily in favour of it. If
it is merely going to procure contracts for Canadian
manufacturers or help line the pockets of bankers in
South America, then I am against it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And I would certainly be against it as
well. I hope that Senator O'Leary will read the statement I
made today. He will see that the primary purpose is
development.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: What do you mean by "development"? Development of what and of whom?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Development of the country.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: That is a very loose word.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The building of an airport or a bridge
might be important contributing factors in the economy
of a particular country. The promotion of programs in
agriculture and teaching people how to improve their
technological experience in various vocations are all part
of the process of assisting in the development of a
country.
All applications for loans must be made to the Board of
Governors. The Board of Governors formally assesses an
application, and then it is carefully examined by officials
of the bank. I can assure Senator O'Leary that the most
careful process of examination is pursued before any
commitment is made.
* (1510)

The personnel of this bank, as is the case with the
Caribbean Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank, are men who have had the greatest possible
experience in the banking world, the business world, and
this particular type of endeavour. I can also say that there
is a very close liaison, although not a constitutional liaison, between this bank and the World Bank.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I accept that, but I must say that I
should like to see some accounting as to how this money is
spent. I am sorry to say it, but I have never yet met a rich
South American with the slightest glimmering of a social
conscience.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think it would be unfortunate if the
last remark of Senator O'Leary were allowed to be construed as in any way reflecting on the bank. Whatever
may be the weaknesses of a particular individual, and I
should imagine that these weaknesses are not peculiar to
individual nationalities, they do not apply to an institution
like this, and I am sure that upon reflection Senator
O'Leary will see that there is not much relevance to the
present situation in the remark which he has made.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I will allow my words to stand with
no apology and with no regret.
The Hon. the Speaker: If there are no other honourable
senators who wish to address the house on this matter I
shall declare the subject debated.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Exhausted!
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary.]

U.S.S.R. PARLIAMENTARIANS

VISIT TO CANADA-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. John J. Connolly rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to some
aspects of the recent visit to Canada of seven members of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.
He said: Honourable senators, I gave notice that I would
call the attention of the Senate to some aspects of a recent
visit to Canada of seven members of the Supreme Soviet
of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. May I hasten to
add that I do not intend to make a general tour de force of
the ten days that our guests spent in this country. My
intention is to talk about trade and trade prospects
between Canada and the U.S.S.R. Before doing so there
are one or two preliminary matters to which I should
refer.
In the first place, I should be failing in my duty if I did
not say how much the success of this Senate project was
due to the great initiative and tremendous contribution
made by His Honour the Speaker.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Senator Deschatelets, under very
difficult conditions and with very little notice, planned a
mission that in addition to being important was also somewhat delicate. The arrangements were, to say the least,
complicated, and he dealt with them in a highly successful
way. In addition, from the time our visitors arrived in
Canada in early March until they left, he followed them
personally through their visits to Montreal, Ottawa,
Toronto, Calgary, Banff and Vancouver at a time of the
year when our weather is just about at its vilest. He
deserves very great credit indeed for the success of this
useful visit.
I should also be failing in my duty if I did not refer to
the contributions made by Senator Aird in Toronto, Senator Hays and Senator Cameron in Calgary and Banff, and
Senator van Roggen in Vancouver. There were, of course,
other senators who also contributed greatly, and I fear I
may put myself in their black books by not mentioning
their names here. For example, Senator Yuzyk together
with Senator Lapointe and Senator Davey made contributions when our visitors were here in Ottawa, and it is my
hope that in due time they will have something to say
about the visit, and the various things they learned from
it, which would be of interest to all honourable senators.
None of the people who came to visit us here in March
1972 had been with us during the course of our visit to
Russia in January 1970. I think the lack of continuity on
the part of the Russian delegation made it a little more
difficult for the people who did in fact come to assess the
type of meetings, and the procedures that were adopted in
connection with those meetings. On the other hand, I
think that the Canadians who had been to Russia-and
here I am referring to Senator Flynn, Senator Aird, Senator Deschatelets and myself-had what I would describe
as a feel for the kind of discussion which could be expected to be held. This was an extremely useful factor. It is my
hope that in future joint meetings there will be some
element of continuity. I say that because I understand that

M

May

16 ,v1972

1972

SENATE DEBATES

in years to come we can expect mutual exchange to
continue.
At this stage, honourable senators, I should also like to
suggest that the two groups abandon the question and
answer form of dialogue in favour of a round table form
which could be adjourned from time to time, and which
would allow ample time to complete an agenda. I wóuld
also suggest that for practical purposes the agenda should
contain no more than three or four topics for discussion
during the entire period of the visit. There would be
ample room for serious, extended, and useful discussion if
this type of procedure were followed.
I discussed this point with many of our visitors and they
seemed to be in agreement. One of them in particular, Mr.
Chakovsky, a writer, journalist and novelist whose command of the English language was excellent, summed up
the situation by saying, "Less travel, more talk." I am
aware that we must learn to walk before we run and that
we have to recognize the difficulties involved in a situation where there is need for interpretation of the other
man's point of view because of the language difficulty.
But those words of Mr. Chakovsky adequately summed
up my own point of view.
I commend our guests for one useful innovation, and
that is that in their group they included two gentlemen of
ministerial rank, Mr. Tikhonov and Mr. Galanshin. These
are two very able gentlemen who made notable contributions to the general discussions, and were especially helpful during the interviews with the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce, Mir. Pepin, and the Secretary of
State for External Affairs, Mr. Sharp. I attended both of
these meetings and I can testify to their value to both
sides. From all of this I believe that future delegations
from the Parliament of Canada-and here I am referring,
of course, to the Senate and the House of Commonscould with advantage be led by a minister. I think that if a
minister leads a group from Canada more can be expected to be thoroughly and effectively discussed in a meeting
with representatives of the Supreme Soviet.
* (1520)

As I indicated in my opening remarks, my main preoccupation in the visit was the issue of trade between the
U.S.S.R. and Canada. I will give honourable senators a
few simple but important statistics. In 1971 Canada sold
about $126 million worth of Canadian production to the
U.S.S.R. Of this amount wheat accounted for $111 million.
The Russian crop was short that year, and they had to
purchase abroad. We were informed that the only question asked in the appropriate circles in Moscow regarded
quantity, price and date of delivery. We were informed
that there was no debate in ministerial circles regarding
the source of the supply of wheat. It would be Canada.
Obviously, this country enjoys immense good will in governmental circles in Moscow and, in my view, it is in
Canada's best interest to preserve that status.
The remainder of our sales to the U.S.S.R. in 1971
totalled around $14 million-for cotton, hides, some pulp
products and some radio-active materials. Curiously, the
sales by the U.S.S.R. to Canada during 1971 were about
the same-$14 million.
Honourable senators, it is clear that apart from wheat,
our trade with our northern neighbours is not significant.

I hope it will soon become obvious that it can go only one
way from both sources, and that is up. If it is carefully
cultivated, the potential for both countries is enormous,
and for both it is virgin territory in trade. However, the
interest of Canadians is rather special. Canada would not
wish to lose the preferred position she enjoys for wheat
sales in the U.S.S.R. as requirements arise. Russia is anxious to penetrate the open, competitive Canadian market.
Russia has recently sold some electric generators to British Columbia Hydro, but this is an isolated case.
Our systems of distribution for machinery, the importance of parts and service for any imported mechanical
device, our anti-dumping laws, our tariffs, are all factors
that make entry into the Canadian market an undertaking
of great complexity for a country which is just now looking into the matter. To preserve our preferred commercial
standing within the U.S.S.R. we must help this legitimate
Russian interest all we can.
Our Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, Mr.
Pepin, believes that a good start was made for trade
between the two countries in the agreement which was
signed early in 1971. The document provided for co-operation between Canada and the U.S.S.R. in the field of
industrial application of science and technology. Already
some six mixed commissions have been at work identifying areas in which trade can be developed-petrochemicals, pipelines, Arctic construction, pulp and paper,
mining, as well as other fields. Exporters from the public
and private sectors of Canada have had a series of meetings with their counterparts in Moscow during 1971.
Another series of meetings is to be held this month, or
perhaps they have already been held. If products, patents,
and know-how can be identified and developed, it will
then be up to exporters from both countries to explore
and develop markets and sales. This is the hard-nosed
part of the intercourse. I believe it promises fruitful
returns if energy and initiative are brought to bear upon
it.
Honourable senators, I would not presume to outline a
set of rules to help Canadian exporters penetrate the
Russian market. The techniques required to be successful
there must be developed in accordance with Russian practices. But following the discussions in which I participated
during this recent visit, I think it appropriate to make
some suggestions which Russian exporters and exporting
agencies in the U.S.S.R. might consider for adoption by
them in Canada.
As I have said, the Canadian market is open and competitive. It is essential for a new entrant to have good
market surveys. It is essential that the exporter appreciate
not only the Canadian demand, but the precise areas of
the demand, the advertising requirements, and the most
appropriate system of distribution. Since the war, various
methods have been used to penetrate our market by foreign manufacturers. The Japanese have conducted this
exercise successfully, as have the Germans, the Scandinavians, and many others. Russian exporters would
best be served if they did not attempt to do this on their
own initiative. They should consider employing the services of reputable and energetic Canadian business consultants. Others have adopted this method with great success. There are consulting firms available in Canada and

SENATE DEBATES

they can produce highly satisfactory results, if our experience with foreign goods sold within this country since the
war is any gauge of success.
This approach is open to any foreign entrepreneur
interested in the Canadian market. If this enterprise,
under the guidance of competent Canadian firms of business consultants, can be undertaken successfully the operations in Canada could be a test case. A knowledge of the
techniques required to compete in the Canadian market
could assist the Russian exporters to enter other open
markets in the Americas and elsewhere. I hope exporters
in the U.S.S.R. realize how valuable this exercise could be
for them. Of course, it will be costly. Trade promotion is
always costly, but the advantages vastly outweigh the cost
in terms of money, time, and effort.
* (1530)

Since our visitors were here I noticed and read with
interest an article in the issue of Time magazine of April
24, covering the visit to Moscow of the Honourable Earl
Butz, the United States Secretary for Agriculture. Mr.
Butz was in Russia for trade talks. According to the
magazine story, he predicted that the Soviet Union might
buy as much as $200 million worth of American wheat
and feed grains every year for the next decade. There was
also some talk of sales of Russian products in the United
States and, curiously, natural gas was included in the list.
Honourable senators, as I have said, Canada enjoys a
most favourable status in the Russian wheat trade. I
would think that American cereal sales would be mainly
of coarse grains. The annual volume predicted by Mr.
Butz of $200 million per annum is much greater than the
big Canadian sale in 1971. Canadians, therefore, must be
on their toes regarding Russian trade, not only to ensure
sales but also to encourage imports of Russian products
into this country.
As we all know, the foreign trade of the U.S.S.R. is
conducted through state trading agencies. We have one
notable counterpart in our own country, namely, the
Canadian Wheat Board. We might well ask ourselves
whether we should have more such agencies to deal not
only with Russia, but also with other countries which have
state trading agencies. We should inquire in what form
such agencies should operate, and whether they should be
entirely government-owned. Should there be participation
from the private sector of the economy, and should this
participation be by industry, by sector, or in some other
way? Should foreign trading partners be given an option
to enter such a consortium, and, if so, how much?
When our Russian guests were with us they were
asked-I myself asked them during a committee meeting-if they thought they could enter and compete successfully in the Canadian market. Their answer was that
they were already doing so in other open markets such as
the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and Japan.
I was curious about this, so I inquired. The following
figures were given for the year 1969. During that year
U.S.S.R. export sales to the United Kingdom totalled $345
million; to France, $114 million; to West Germany, $178
million; to Japan, $289 million; and to the United States,
$49 million. Obviously, Russians know how to sell in some
western countries.
[Hon. Mr. Connolly J

May 16, 1972

In the same year Russian imports from the United Kingdom totalled $194 million; from France, $261 million; from
West Germany, $268 million; from Japan, $213 million;
and from the United States, $94 million.
In 1969 the U.S.S.R. surplus on the trading account
between those five countries amounted to $1.1 billion.
Amateurs in trade do not do business and obtain this kind
of result. These figures are rising annually. Russian sales
in the United States are four times larger than those in
Canada, yet they are not significant. Russian sales to the
United Kingdom are 14 times larger than those to Canada.
To France, they are 18 times larger; to West Germany, 19
times larger; to Japan, 15 times larger.
The two-way trade between the U.S.S.R. and those four
countries in 1969 was worth anywhere between one-third
to one-half a billion dollars. With Canada it was less than
$30 million. This is active trade. There may be lessons to
be learned by Canadians from these trade patterns
between the U.S.S.R. and those four relatively open
economies.
Honourable senators, I believe that Canada has a legitimate interest in developing trade relations with the
U.S.S.R. Other western nations are doing so, and the
United States is obviously aware of this trend and is
taking advantage of it. I believe that the development of
these trade relations can be achieved without affecting
Canada's existing trade pattern. I believe it can be done
without injuring Canadian industry, which is an important consideration for this country. I believe also that to
do so would be in the interest of Canadian consumers,
and that the mutual confidence developed through
healthy, profitable trade relations could spill over into
other areas to the advantage of Canada and the U.S.S.R.,
and lead to a better climate of co-operation between the
East and West.
On motion of Hon. Miss Lapointe, debate adjourned.

NATIONAL CAPITAL
FUTURE USE OF CARTIER SQUARE

Hon. Eugene A. Forsey rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to various proposals for the future use of Cartier Square.
He said: Honourable senators, after the masterly
speeches which we have had this afternoon on these
important topics, I feel rather like one who attempts to set
off a squib after a shower of meteors. Nonetheless, I think
there may be some merit in raising a particular matter,
small in itself, but of some importance to the future of the
national capital.
Before I go into that, however, I should like to take this
opportunity of joining with others who have spoken
already on other subjects, of saying how pleased I am to
see the latest additions to the ranks of this chamber. I
have a special pleasure in welcoming here the Honourable
George McIlraith, to whom I paid a too modest tribute
shortly before his formal appointment to this chamber,
and the President of Dalhousie University, of which for
the last year I have had the honour of being an honorary
graduate.

SENATE DEBATES

(1540)

Both of these honourable senators I have known for
some little time. Senator McIlraith moderately well, I
think I may say; Senator Hicks not quite so well, but in
both cases with great profit to myself and with a feeling of
strong admiration. The other two new senators I have not
had the pleasure even of meeting. I have every reason to
believe that I shall shortly entertain for them as high a
regard and admiration as I do for these older friends. I
am especially pleased that three of the four new senators
just appointed come from the Province of Nova Scotia, a
province with which I have hereditary ties of about two
centuries. I sornetimes refer to myself as a maritimer in
partibus infidelium, having lived most of my life in this
part of the country, although my roots are nearly all in the
Atlantic provinces with some in Quebec in the bargain.
To turn to the subject which I wanted to deal with this
afternoon, the proposals for the future use of Cartier
Square. Cartier Square, down to the outbreak of the last
war, was an open space utterly unadorned, utterly unpolluted also by specimens of modern architecture or
modern soi-disant sculpture. Up to the beginning of the
last war Cartier Square was, as I say, an open space, and
then at the beginning of the last war a temporary building
was erected there for the use of the Department of
National Defence. From what I have seen in the newspapers recently I gather that that temporary building will,
within a measurable time, be taken down, and the question then arises: "What, if anything, is going to be put in
its place?" So far there appear to have been three sets of
proposals.
First of all, there is a proposal to make all or a large
part of this space into a parking lot, specifically, perhaps,
for the occupants of the new building for the Department
of National Defence on the other side of the canal. I
confess that I look upon this proposal with less than
enthusiasm. I share the views of the chairman of the
National Capital Commission on the subject of the private
motor car as a devouring flame, a scourge, to modern
cities, and I should be very sorry, indeed, to see a large
part, let alone all, of this open space offered up as a
sacrifice to this modern mechanical Moloch. I am aware
that this is a somewhat heretical, not to say blasphemous,
view because, for a great many people, the earth is the
motorists' and the fullness thereof, the world and they
that dwell therein.
As a humble pedestrian and a user of public transportation, and as an ordinary citizen of this city, I should
deplore very much adding to the utterly uneconomic use
of the private motor car and dealing a fresh blow to the
use of our public transportation system by devoting any
appreciable part of this space to a parking lot, whether
for the Department of National Defence or anybody else.
We want to move away from that sort of thing. We want to
move towards the greater use of public transportation
and a decrease in the pollution and the congestion
brought to us by the use of the private motor car in a large
modern city like this.
The second set of proposals for the use of this space
appears to be to set up a housing, shopping, office complex on a large part of the area. I cannot say that I regard
this with enthusiasm either. It seems to me that there is

very little to be said for placing this kind of thing in that
particular location. We have now no high rise development in that particular place and I cannot see why we
should have one. I have no doubt that the proposed complex would, in a sense, be, in part at least, a high rise
development. I think we have quite enough of those in the
centre of the city now; in fact, rather too many.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): We have the new Bell
Telephone complex.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: One of the deplorable aspects of the
development of modern cities is that all over the world
they are becoming to look more and more alike. No
matter where you put down, whether it is in Europe or
America-and I dare say this is becoming true of other
continents as well; I cannot speak from any experience
there-no matter where you put down you may always
believe you are in the same place that you started from.
The great monstrous skyscrapers are all around, a good
many of them leaving something to be desired on the
score of aesthetics. I do not see much future in that kind
of development there.
The third proposal is that the area should be given over
to a new National Gallery with, and I quote verbatim from
the report, "a sculpture park." Well, a new National Gallery on that area might have something to be said for it,
although I must confess that I rather fear that any building devoted to it might wear something of the aspect of
either a packing box or a penitentiary, which so many of
the modern buildings do seem to wear. I have a horrid
feeling that if something were to be put up there it would
f all into either one of those broad categories and would be
an offence to the eye. But what really terrifies me is the
prospect of a sculpture park around any such building.
We have now in the area where the Roxborough apartments used to stand, just across from the Lord Elgin
Hotel, a monstrosity, a horror, on which I have already
commented in this house and elsewhere. I have described
it as a huge representation of the human great intestine,
and this is perhaps a flattering description of it. I have
found in a great many comments I have heard and some I
have read, notably an editorial in last Friday's Journal,a
good deal of sympathy with my point of view on this. I
know I shall be decried here as hopelessly out of date-I
do not appreciate modern art. Well, I wrote to Dr. Boggs
on this subject some little time ago and I said that if this is
sculpture, then I am the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Dalai Lama all rolled into one.
I added that that monstrosity reminded me of my old
friend Arthur Meighen's comment to me on modern
poetry: "I ask myself one question: Could I have written
it? If so, it isn't poetry." Well, when I look at things like
that I ask myself one question: "Could any moderately
competent mechanic capable of wielding a saw and a
hammer and a chisel and a few simple tools like that, or in
some cases even capable of using a pair of scissors and a
pot of glue-I am thinking of a particular exhibit which I
saw in the Art Gallery last year-could any such ordinary
person have done this?" and I think the answer is, in
general, "Yes".
In the case of this fibreglass affair I suppose a slightly
higher degree of skill would be required, but nothing
really out of the ordinary. Just get some moderately

SENATE DEBATES
competent performers with fibreglass and they could do
the same sort of thing any time given enough time and, I
might add, enough public support.
At this point I want to digress just for a moment to say
it appears to be impossible to discover how much these
practical jokes which are perpetrated on the taxpayers
are costing the taxpayers of this country. We ask for the
cost of these things and we are told in a lofty and Olympian manner that it is "not policy" to disclose what they
cost. Well, I should like to know why it is "not policy."
Why under the sun should the ordinary people of this
country be compelled to pay for things of this sort which,
I venture to say, cost a pretty penny? Why under the sun
should we have to pay for them without knowing how
much we are paying?
If it turns out that the things cost a matter of $5 or $10, I
suppose it does not matter one way or the other financially, but I would venture to say that if the cost of that
concoction out there were disclosed it would be a good
round sum. I have some reason to believe that while the
gentleman who perpetrated it and, I understand, his five
assistants, were engaged upon the thing they were maintained in the style of life to which they believed themselves to be accustomed and entitled and they were maintained out of funds provided by the Treasury of Canada. I
do not know how long they took, but if you have six
people supported, as I understand they were, during the
period necessary to produce this work of art, then I suggest it must have cost the taxpayers a pretty penny.

That is parenthetical. That is not the main point. It is
not only a matter of the great intestine. It is a matter of a
number of other "masterpieces" of sculpture in that same
small park; three or four painted wooden boxes-at least,
I suppose they are wooden; they may be papier-mâché,
for all I know-stood up on end. I think there is one bright
blue, one yellow and one red; there may be a fourth, I
cannot remember. Again, if that is sculpture, then I am
Socrates and Shakespeare, with Michelangelo thrown in.
Any jackass with a saw and some pieces of wood and a
pot of paint can do it.
Are we to have a sculpture park spread around a new
art gallery on this area with these things proliferated all
over the place, and quite possibly worse? I understand
that another masterpiece perpetrated by the manufacturer-the term "manufacturer" is not my own; it comes
from a high authority in artistic matters-of the "great
intestine," another masterpiece of this gentleman, has
already been bought by the National Gallery, and probably the authorities there are just itching for the moment
when they can hurl it on to the territory now occupied by
the National Defence temporary building.
This prospect of visual pollution is a nightmare that
"thicks man's blood with cold," if I may borrow a phrase
from Coleridge. The thought of it is the thought of a fate
worse than death. If the Director of the National Gallery
and the Trustees of the National Gallery want to transform parts of the interior of that building into chambers
of horrors or fun fairs comparable to the sideshows that
are sometimes put on at circuses, then I think the public
can endure it, because after all, they don't have to go in. It
is like foul programs, insufferably boring programs, intol[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

May 16, 1972

erable programs, for one reason or another, on radio or
television. If you do not like it you can switch it off. If you
don't like what is in the National Gallery you can switch it
off. But unless you go around blindfold you can't switch
off that concoction, that monstrosity, out there in the park
opposite the Lord Elgin Hotel. If there are to be more of
these things it will not be possible to switch them off
either.
I think the public of this country have a right, not only
the citizens of this city, but the tourists who come here
from all over the world, to be protected against this kind
of visual pollution, and expensive visual pollution. Let this
kind of thing be kept within doors at least. There the arty
people, the avant-garde people, the people who dwell in
realms of empyrean splendour of abstractions, can enjoy
it, and the rest of us do not have to be outraged and
insulted by it every day of the week.
I do not mind the National Gallery so much-although I
have my doubts about that-but when it comes to the
possibility of a sculpture park, an outrage park, a monstrosity park, a nightmare park, spread over this area,
then I think it is time to register a protest on behalf of the
ordinary common people who have no pretensions to
being great art critics and no pretensions to being citizens
of the twenty-first, twenty-second or twenty-third century.
The other thing that can be done with this area is simply
to return it to its former state, or approximately its former
state, as an open space. This, it seems to me, is the proper
thing to do. Let us have God's green grass, God's flowers
and God's trees there. If we want to have lawns rather
than untouched grass and weeds, which used to flourish
there, that is fine; I have no objection to that. If we want
to have exceptionally beautiful trees-and we have exceptionally beautiful trees in this country that could be planted there-it would be a joy and a glory. If we want to have
flowers, the National Capital Commission has had infinite
experience in providing us with noble displays of flowers.
These things are splendid. But let us have an open
space, unpolluted, undesecrated. Surely this is not too
much to ask. Surely we can ask for the restoration, or the
substantial restoration, with some improvement of the
status quo ante-bellum, the kind of thing that existed
there for many years, with improvements, if you like, and
was, even in its uncultivated state, a pleasure to the citizens of this city, and in a lesser degree to those who came
here from outside.
I very much hope, honourable senators, that the powers
that be will turn thumbs down on any proposal to make
this particular area the place for so-called artistic practical jokers that some people would like to make of it.
I have expressed myself with what I suppose would
kindly be called a generous warmth, and unkindly, considerable violence, on this subject, but it is a subject on
which I feel extremely strongly. I think we are being
ridden rough-shod over by arty people and high falutin'
people in this particular regard, and I think it is time the
ordinary people put in their word of protest. I am confident that when I have put in my word of protest, even in
the strong terms that I have, I am not speaking for myself
alone, but for a good many citizens of this city and for a
good many people who might come here from outside.

May 16,1972

Mayl6 1972SENATE
DEBATES

Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, so that the
impression will flot get abroad that there is only one
viewpoint on such matters as have just been discussed by
Senator Forsey, I should like to suggest that there is
another way of looking at this problem of modern art.
which some of us do flot understand. I find myseif in
exactly the saine position as Senator Forsey in regard to
what hie has cafled the "intestinal monument" opposite the
Lord Elgin Hotel. I personally find it revolting to look at
and completely beyond my comprehiension as modern art,
if it is modemn art. I feel the samne way as Senator Forsey
does, that one can apply the standard of judgment hie has
mentioned. I feel that if I could have done it myseif it
cannot be art. But, of course, exactly the same thing has
been said about art ever since there was such a thing as
art recognized as part of a civilized culture. I am sure
Senator Forsey has read Browning's poem "Fra Lippo
Lippi." Exactly the samne problem is stated in poetic
termis, and the plea is made there for an understanding of
the artist by laymen.
Exactly the samne criticism was made of the French
impressionists, whose works are now popularly enjoyed
ail over the world. Exactly the samne criticism was made of
our own Group of Seven. There are senators here who
will recall that such words as "hot mush" were used about
the paintings of the Group of Seven when they first went
on exhibition. It is very easy, of course, for those of us
who have no appreciation of modemn art to say that it is
flot art, and that nobody else should appreciate it.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I did not say that.
0 (1600)

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I should perhaps say to Senator
Forsey that I did flot say that he said it. I said it is easy to
say that, and it is very often said.
I have had the honour of being chairman of the Board
of Trustees of a quite distinguished art gallery. I found
myseif in much the saine situation as Senator Forsey
finds himself, and I resigned. I resigned that position
because I feit I was flot competent to judge the kind of
acquisitions that gallery might make, or the kind of exhibitions that it might sponsor. As f ar as I was concernied,
there probably was not a. single picture that the director
wished to put on exhibition that I could say I liked, or
that, by my criterion of art, I would say was art.
I say this because Senator Forsey has used extreme
language-chamber of horrors, rubbish ground, artistc
practical jokers, creators of fun fairs, and so on-and I
feel that such phrases are unf air. There are those who are
experts in art; they change from generation to generation,
and no generation yet has fully accepted the judgment of
those who are regarded as the art critics of one particular
generation.
I merely make that point so that it will be clear that the
viewpoint-the extreme viewpoint, as I regard itexpressed by Senator Forsey is not necessarily the viewpoint of ail members of the Senate, and particularly not
necessarily the viewpoint of those who find it quite
beyond their powers of appreciation to accept as art such
sculptures as he referred to. I repeat that I share his
complaint personally of the horror of the intestinal monument there. My own reaction to it is that it reminds me
25312-23

rather of the contents of an intestine rather than the
intestine itself. I find it vulgar. I find it ugly.
I have spent a good deal of my life trying to understand
art, collected art, and I have spent a good deal of time in
developing a bibliography of art. I stili do not understand
art, but because I do not understand it I am not putting
myseif in the position of condemning it, or using the kind
of language about the judgment of those who approve it,
that was used by Senator Forsey.
Hon. Mr. Faruey: Would you put it outdoors or in?
Hion. Henry D. Hicks: Honourable senators, I agree generally with the views expressed by Senator Forsey and
Senator Grosart, and I share the samne attitude of repugnance towards the intestinal monstrosity to which they
have made reference. Nevertheless, I rise to correct what I
believe to be an error in the test that both have adopted in
relation to a work of art; that is, "Could I have done it
myself?" or, as Senator Forsey has said, "Could the average craftsman, with his hammer, saw, blowtorch, pot of
glue, or what have you, have created it?" I think this is an
error. This is not the test. The test surely is, "Could I
myseif, or could the average workman, have conceived of
doing it; could the average person have arranged Senator
Forsey's matchboxes in an artistic way and have chosen
the colours?"
Quite seriously, the appreciation of ail art is in large
measure subjective, and the appreciation of modemn art
probably is more subjective than that of some other
forms. I think that a large measure of tolerance must be
permitted to those whose views differ from our own.
At the samne time, the concern which Senator Forsey has
expressed, as to the proper use of the Cartier Square area
in the capital city of the nation, is a legitimate one. I
should like to join with him in recording the interest of the
Senate in the ultimate and proper disposition of this
important piece of property in the centre of our city.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I have just
one comment, a word of consolation to Senator Forsey,
that fortunately the world is not as bad as it is painted to
be.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I understand that this inquiry has now been debated.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Han. Mr. Maison: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
could ask the Leader of the Governent whether he is
prepared to let us into his secret plans for this chamber
for the balance of today, and possibly tomorrow. I am led
to believe that some change from. the norm is contemplated, but I personally know nothing about it and I would be
grateful for any information.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am glad Senator Molson asked that question. I intended saying something just before our adjournment. I have been discussing
the plan with the Leader of the Opposition. I wish I knew
more myselfHon. Mr. Flynn: You wish you knew more yourself?

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Martin: -but one is dependent on the vagaries
of the other place, over which none of us, of course, have
control.
There are two measures that the government is anxious
to see dealt with-the bill providing for increases in the
old age security payments, and the bill providing for
increases in veterans benefits. The June payment of the
old age security benefits depends upon passage by Friday,
as the house leader of the governrnent in the other place
indicated on Wednesday last.
If that objective is to be met-and that certainly is my
objective and that of most senators, if flot ali-the quicker
the bill gets here so that we can give it consideration, the
better. The bill has been reported from committee. It is
out of committee in the other place. I understand that
sorte discussion has been ensuing since that time. I do flot
know what the present status of that discussion is,' or
what has prevented the other place from passing both the
veterans bènefits and the old age security bis.
I think the best thing for us to do now is to adjourn until
six o'clock and at that time we may have somte idea of
how we shahl proceed, although I do flot know whether we
will. That suggestion was made to me by the Leader of the
Opposition, and I accept it as a constructive suggestion.
Hon. Mr. Maison: Honourable senators, may I ask
whether, if we have to adjourn to six o'clock, we might be
better off if we were to adjourn until 8 o'clock? We would
then have time to deal with sorne rneasure, if one cornes
forward. If we corne back at six o'clock, what do we do?
Do we adjourn until eight?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I would hope
that we get the bill tonight. Frankly, I did think that it

would be better to adjourn until eight o'clock. I discussed
the matter with the Leader of the Opposition, and hie

thought that we would flot know anything more at eight
than at six.
Han. Mr. Flynn: That is quite obvious.

Hon. Mr. Martin: I would prefer to return at eight, and if
we get the bill we can proceed with it. We rnay know later,
at around nine o'clock. The point is that I am ready to
introduce this bill the moment it gets here. Whether the
debate could proceed right away would depend on the
disposition of those who normnally would follow. In that
way we would certainly save a day. I think that is desirable. I would be a littie concerned that, if we got the bill
tonight and were not here to deal with it, we would lose
this additional day. I think it expedient that the debate
proceed forthwith from the time the bill is presented and
responded to.
However, 1 had acceded to the suggestion of the Leader
of the Opposition that we should adjourn until six o'cIock.
I do not want to be unfaithful to that agreemnent. My own
view was that it would be better to wait untîl eight o'clock.
Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition could give us an
indication of his position.
0 (1610)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is not a question of being faithful to
the suggestion I made. I arn just trying to be sensible.
What will we know at eight o'clock that we will flot know

at six o'clock? If we assemble at eight o'clock and they

have flot passed the bill, then when will they pass it?

Should we stay here and wait minute by minute, haîf hour
by haîf hour, until they have decided to move on the other
side? I think that is insane. It is contrary to the dignity of
this house. My honourable friend, Senator Molson, may
corne if hie wishes, but I doubt that I will be here.

Han. Mr. Maison: I do flot quite understand what the
honourable Leader of the Opposition means in that
respect. I rnerely felt that if we adjourned until eight
o'clock, and there is then legislation before us, we can
deal with it. If there is not, then we can go home. I do flot
see any logic in saying that what we do flot get at six
o'clock we will flot get at eight o'clock. That part does flot
make sense to me.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There is no legislation before us. We are
waiting for it. The House of Commons will adjourn at six
o'clock. We will know then whether they have passed this
bill. If they have not passed it at six o'clock, what more
will we know by eight o'clock than we know at six
o'clock?
Hon. Mr. Maison: Why will they adjourfi at six o'clock?
Han. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, may I ask a
question? If we meet at six o'clock and find that they have
passed the bill, are we going to go on without any opportunity of getting our supper?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No, we can adjourn then until eight
o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: In that case it seems to me that we will
find the restaurant closed. I suppose we can walk down
the hilI.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You misunderstand. I say that we will
adjourn until six o'clock. If we corne here at six o'clock
and hear that the house has passed the bill, then we wihl

adjourn until eight o'clock.

Hon. Mr. Farsey: I see. That is what I wanted to know.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If they have flot passed the bill, we will
adjourn until tornorrow. That is rny suggestion. I ar nfot
holding the government leader to any promise hie made to
me. I was just explaining a practical situation which, in
rny opinion, should be obvious to everyone.
Hon. Mr. Martin: If I understand you correctly, Senator
Flynn, you are now suggesting that we adjourn until six
o'clock. If we are not any further advanced at that time,
we will then corne back at eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If they have flot passed it, we wihl
adjourn until tornorrow. If they have passed it, we wifl

corne back at eight, o'clock.

Hon. Mr. Martin: As I understand your latter proposai,
we will corne back at eight o'clock. What I arn anxious to
avoid is losing tonight, if that bill can corne to us tonight.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I do flot want to lose it one way or the
other.

Hon. Mr. Martin: This bill provides for increases of
pensions. It has to be passed by Friday, we are told by the

President of the Privy Council. That being the case, I do
flot want to lose tonight, if we can get that bill. If the bill
cornes to us tonight, I would be prepared to go on with it,

SENATE DEBATES

but if the Leader of the Opposition, or whoever speaks on
it, is not prepared to proceed right then, we will lose a day.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What do you want me to do-agree to
passing the bill before it reaches us?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think in the circumstances, since the
Leader of the Opposition leaves it open, we should
adjourn until eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I ask if the Leader of the Government has any information as to whether the House of
Commons may sit tonight?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Oh, yes. It is Tuesday night.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It does sit at eight o'clock. But if it has
not passed the bill by six o'clock, we will come back here
at eight o'clock for nothing.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It gives us a chance to see what the
situation is.
FISHERIES
BAN ON COMMERCIAL FISHING OF SALMON-ECONOMIC
EFFECTS ON NEW BRUNSWICK-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Burchil, calling the
attention of the Senate to the serious effects on the economy of New Brunswick and especially of Northern New
Brunswick of the recently announced ban on the commercial fishing of salmon.
Hon. Cheuley W. Carter: Honourable senators, there is
no doubt that a crisis exists in the Atlantic salmon fishery.
We are indebted to Senator Burchill for introducing his
inquiry which enabled us to debate this question. Senator
Burchill demonstrated the nature and extent of the crisis
by quoting figures for the Miramichi River. He mentioned
that in 1969 the take was 353,000 pounds and that by 1971
the take had been reduced to 175,000 pounds. Statistics for
other rivers show a similar decline.
Last night Senator Molson, in an excellent and welldocumented speech, confirmed Senator Burchill's statistics by quoting figures for the whole Atlantic area. For
example, drift-netters alone were down from over one
million pounds in 1967 to less than half a million pounds
in 1970, and down to only 186,000 pounds in 1971. Senator
Molson also quoted similar figures for rod fishermen.
It does not seem reasonable to attribute these drastic
reductions to natural causes. It is extremely unlikely that
natural predators are responsible for this serious decline.
Seals and eels and other predatory types of fish have
always existed. They could not possibly account for such
a dramatic decline over such a short period of time-two
to five years.
As Senator Molson pointed out, there has been an enormous increase in the catch by the Danes, the Faroese, and
the Greenlanders over the same period of time. Their
catch has gone up from 3.5 million pounds in 1967 to 4.7
million pounds in 1970, and again to 5.8 million pounds in
1971. This definitely points to them as the real cause.
Certainly, those extra salmon did not come from Danish
rivers. Therefore, they are harvesting wealth that is produced in other countries along the Atlantic seaboard, and
25312-23J

they are reaping the benefit of expenditures made in these
countries, and of the measures taken by these countries to
conserve and develop the salmon supply. In this respect
they are acting as international outlaws. But since the
extra catch can be worth only a few million dollars it is
difficult to understand the attitude of the Danes and their
reluctance to do anything to remedy this situation. Actually, it is a case of being penny wise and pound foolish. The
salmon they are taking are not fully grown. If they would
permit them to return to their rivers and grow larger,
then, even though they caught fewer in number, the actual
weight and value of the catch would not be very much
less.
Last night Senator Molson made a very strong case for
restricting the catch of anglers rather than banning it
altogether. However, I was rather surprised at his suggestion that banning the catch altogether would result in a
layoff of river guardians. River guardians are not on the
rivers just to keep watch on anglers. They are there to
keep watch on poachers and on those who employ nets,
gaffs, jiggers, and assorted other illegal methods of fishing. I should have thought that a ban would require more
guardians rather than less, because I do not think aerial
surveillance can be effective, especially at night.
0 (1620)

Having said that, honourable senators, I want to direct
my remarks to two specific points, the first of which is
compensation. So far the basis of compensation has been
described in only the vaguest of terms. Is it intended to be
a once-only affair? Or is it intended that it shall be paid
annually over the period the restrictions are in force?
I suppose the starting point should be to find a suitable
definition of what constitutes a commercial salmon fisherman. This will not be easy. The salmon is a seasonal fish,
one that provides lucrative returns. An all-round fisherman will take many kinds of fish depending upon which
will bring him the greatest return at a particular time.
A cod fisherman, for example, who spends most of his
time catching cod, will nevertheless take time out to catch
lobster in season and then go on to catch salmon in
season, or halibut, and later return to cod fishing when
the other species are not available. There are many types
of salmon fishermen. In my province there are many
old-age pensioners who supplement their pensions by putting out their nets and catching salmon during the salmon
season. The same is true of war veterans receiving war
veterans allowances who are entitled to have casual earnings to supplement their income, and they do this by
catching salmon in season.
Students in my province, where employment opportunities are few and f ar between, can often earn money
during the salmon season by going home and using their
nets. By so doing they frequently earn more than they
could in any other way. The crews of the CNR ships who
work for two weeks and then have two weeks off use their
time off to catch salmon.
So, honourable senators, these are all different types of
salmon fishermen. But the one I am most concerned with
is the small inshore fisherman, the fisherman who fishes
alone in a small boat, or with one other person-a son, a
brother, or a relative-in a boat that is big enough only for
two people.

SENATE DEBATES
I know many of these fishermen personally. They can
be found in almost every fishing community in Newfoundland, and particularly along that part of the southwest coast affected by the present government ban. Most
of these fishermen earn the major part of their income
from salmon fishing, and this usually amounts to between
$1,000 and $1,500 a year. During the rest of the year they
may earn in addition between $500 and $1,000 from lobster, cod, herring, and other species combined. There is no
way that these fishermen can be converted to some other
means of livelihood, and this ban is going to be a very
severe blow to them and their families. Their already
meagre income is going to be eut in half, and in some
cases to less than half, with all the attendant hardships
that will follow. On top of that, since unemployment
insurance contributions are based on earnings, their
unemployment insurance benefits will be drastically
reduced which will make this hardship even more severe.
To take care of these fishermen and to prevent them
from suffering undue hardship as a result of government
policy I suggest that first of all the commercial salmon
fisherman be defined as a fisherman who during the past
three years has derived at least one-third of his income
from salmon fishing. Since all salmon caught are marketed fresh there should be no difficulty in securing the
figures from the buyers who collect and market the
salmon produced.
Next, I suggest that compensation should be based on
actual earnings and should be paid annually, in monthly
or quarterly payments, for a period of ten years, or for as
long as the ban remains in effect, whichever period shall
be the shorter. In addition I suggest that the government
should find some means to ensure that the fisherman's
seasonal unemployment benefits are maintained at the
level attained before the ban went into effect.
So much for the human factor, honourable senatorsthe fishermen who will be so vitally affected. But what
about the industry itself? What can be done to alleviate
the present situation and minimize its effects? Last night
Senator Rowe posed the question as to whether we should
not be doing more scientific research. Certainly there is
room for more research and, in particular, research
aimed at solving specific problems and improving returns
to the fishermen. But, in my opinion, it is even more
important to apply the technology which we already have,
or which is available from other countries. This is something we have not done, and are not doing now to any
appreciable degree.
This morning I talked with Mr. Hans Petersen of Astra
Chemicals in Toronto, who is an expert on salmon and
whose speciality is the production of food for salmon
hatcheries. He told me what was being done in Sweden.
Sweden is a country that has a great many rivers which
are harnessed to produce hydro-electric power. Since the
damming of these rivers was bound to interfere with the
production of salmon, the government imposed upon the
hydro-electric companies the obligation of taking steps to
ensure that the salmon production of these rivers would
not be impaired. As a result the hydro-electric companies
have developed hatcheries in which they gather the
salmon eggs from the spawning grounds in the rivers,
hatch them, feed them for two years, and then send them
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

May 16, 1972

out to sea. They have now reached the point where the
success of this experiment is evident in that the number of
salmon that come back to the river is the same as it was
before the dams were constructed.
But, honourable senators, the Swedes have not stopped
there. They have a fish which is called the wild brown
trout. This fish is very similar to the salmon, and is
exported as salmon to many countries in Europe. It is
very difficult to tell the difference between this fish and
salmon. They grow to approximately 20 pounds, some
even to as great a weight as 30 pounds. However, the
special characteristic of this fish is that it remains close to
shore, or close to the mouth of a river. It does not wander
very far out to sea where the Danes and Greenlanders are
depleting our present stock. Certainly we should be taking
similar steps to import that type of fish here in an
endeavour to replenish the stocks in our rivers. We can
also follow the Swedes' example with respect to our grilse
because, like the brown trout in Sweden, they do not
wander very far from land and they do not reach the high
seas where they are caught in international waters.
* (1630)

These are matters upon which we should concentrate to
offset the probable disaster which will overtake the Atlantic salmon fishery unless steps are taken at a very early
date.
Last evening Senator Molson referred to Senator Tom
Reid. I remember Senator Reid quite well, although I was
a member of the other place at that time. I was a member
of the fisheries committee, and he took a great interest in
the proceedings of that committee. I think we need another Senator Reid to do for the Atlantic salmon fishery what
he did for the Pacific salmon fishery.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McElman, debate adjourned.
NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION MEETING IN
WASHINGTON-MOTION CALLING ON NATIONS TO
ENSURE SURVIVAL OF ATLANTIC SALMON

Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions:
Hon. G. Percival Burchill moved:
That the Senate do join with the House of Commons
in calling on all nations participating in the International Commission for Northwest Atlantic Fisheries
Meeting to be held in Washington, D.C., in May, 1972,
to agree that the survival of the Atlantic salmon as a
species is of paramount concern and to take whatever
steps are necessary to ensure such survival.
He said: Honourable senators, in connection with this
motion, I would like to remind the house that the House of
Commons unanimously adopted a similar resolution. You
are aware that it is difficult, in these times, to obtain
unanimous approval for anything, and I hope it will be
unanimously passed by the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Hicks: This is a technical matter, but should
not the motion refer to International Commission for the
North Atlantic Fisheries? Is the honourable senator not
referring to the ICNAF meeting in Washington?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: You may be right about that.

DEBATES
May 16 1972SENATE

May 16,1972

The. Hon. the Speaker: The motion mentions "ail nations
participating in the International Commission for Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Meeting".
Hon. Mr. Maison: Honourable senators, I fully support
this motion. I suspect that the members of this chamber
do not wish me to say very much at this time about the
salmon fishing industry, because they heard me speak on
the matter yesterday. However, I think it was one year ago
at a meeting of TONAF where only three countries voted
against this resolution. I cannot remember the precise
number of countries involved, but I think it was 14. The
vote was something like eleven for the resolution, to three
against. I may be wrong because I am speaking from.
memory.
I am almost certain that the three in opposition were
Denmark, West Germany, and Sweden. The Danes were
opposed because they were the greatest beneficiary of the
high seas fisheries. The West Germans were opposed for
reasons which no one understood. The Swedes were
opposed perhaps because of their close relationship with
the Danes. Other nations, which constituted quite a mixed
group, such as Russia, the United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom and others, voted in favour of the
resolution.
I share Senator Burchiil's hope that the Canadian delegation may feel it has the unanimous support of both
Houses of Parliament when they meet in Washington. I
arn very happy indeed to second the motion.
Motion agreed to.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Han. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I propose that
the other items stand until later this day.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I should like to make a correction
regarding the item on which I arn set down to speak. It
will not stand until later this day; it wili stand until
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I move the adjournment.
The. Hon. the. Speaker: Is it agreed that the Senate do
now adjourn during pleasure to reassembie at the cail of
the bell at approximately 8 p.m.?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No.
The Han. the. Speaker: I should like to have a formai
motion by the Leader of the Government.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I want the leader first to tell us what we
are going to do at eight o'ciock. There is nothing on the
Order Paper that must proceed at eight o'clock. I tbink he
will agree with me on that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Langlois moved the adjournment of Order No. 2.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He moved it for the sake of moving it,
on the order of the government leader. He does not intend
to speak. So there is nothing to do at eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not understand Senator Flynn's
attitude. I have suggested that we meet at eight o'clock.
We wiil then know what progress has been made in the

other place. If the Old Age Security bill has been passed
and it can come to us this evening, I propose to introduce
it at that time. However, we are not yet in a position to say
whether the bill will come to us tonight. For that reason I
am acting on the earlier suggestion of Senator Molson,
that we adjourn until eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: on division.
The. Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed that the Senate do
now adjourn during pleasure to reassembie at the caîl of
the bell at approximately eight o'ciock this evening?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On division. We are coming here for
nothing.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 8 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
The. Hon. the Speaker: Orders of the Day.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: A point of order, Mr. Speaker. Ail of the
Orders of the Day were called and they were ail stood. I
do not see how we can proceed this way.
The. Hon. the. Speaker: If I recali correctly when the
Orders of the Day were called it was requested that they
stand until later this day. This is why I arn proceeding this
way.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
could ask at this point for leave to have Orders 2 to 9
inclusive stand.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, Senator McDonald
has asked that Order No. 5 stand. There have been some
very fine contributions to this debate. I should like to hear
Senator Goldenberg speak on this subject, but from what
I understand now he is not going to. I move that this
debate be adjourned.
The. Hon. the Speaker: Is Order No. 5 to stand?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I move the adjournment of the
debate to Thursday next.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, Order No. 5
stands adjourned in my name. If I understood my conversation with Senator Haig a few moments before we were
called to order, he expressed a desire to close this debate
on Thursday next. He informed me that Senator Goldenberg does not intend to speak on the subject, but there is a
possibility that other senators may wish to speak between
now and Thursday. For that reason I would request that
Order No. 5 be left standing adjourned in my name. If no
other honourable senator wishes to speak then, of course,
Senator Haig wiil have the opportunity of closing the
debate on Thursday next.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I regret that I do not agree with Senator
McDonald, so I will move the adjournment of the debate
until Thursday, May 18.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, with ail due
respect, I suggest that the item is already adjourned in my
name, and I wish to leave it that way.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then I will move the adjourninent of the
debate.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Jacques Flynn: I rise on a point of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: I must confess that I would like
to hear from some honourable senators on the matter.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I suggest that we should not be here at
all. That is my point of order.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: We are here to work.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I acknowledge with pleasure that assistance of my good friend, Senator Prowse. I am convinced,
Mr. Speaker, that we should not have been called at this
time at all unless, of course, it is to help the government
leader to get out of the deadend into which he brought us
this afternoon, because Rule 45 of the Rules of the Senate
provides:
One day's notice shall be given ... for an adjournment of the Senate, other than the ordinary daily
adjournment under 46(r) or that under rules 13, 36(1),
46(f), 46(g).
I do not intend to deal with these matters at length,
because I think we have lost enough time today dealing
with them. It is obvious that when we adjourned this
afternoon it was because we had exhausted the Orders of
the Day. All the items were stood; nobody was willing to
do anything. I therefore suggest to Your Honour that
under our rules we were supposed to adjourn until tomorrow. I did not give my consent.
At that time, of course, I could not remember the exact
wording of the rule, but I had an instinct that the government leader was wrong, as usual, and I registered my
opposition to his motion to adjourn until later this day.
When all the Orders of the Day have been called no other
motion is in order than one to adjourn until the next day.
Therefore, the motion of the government leader to
adjourn until later this day could not be moved unless
there was unanimous consent, and you will remember,
Mr. Speaker, that I objected quite clearly. I think nobody
will deny that.
The Hon. the Speaker: Might I intervene at this point to
say that if I remember correctly the motion was carried
on division. I remember the Leader of the Opposition
saying, "On division."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I agree with Your Honour that it was
carried on division, but that does not mean it changes the
rule. If under the rule such a motion could not be carried,
except unanimously, then the motion could not be carried.
My point of order is that under the circumstances in
which the motion was made by the Leader of the Government-who never knew anything about the rules in the
other place and does not know anything about the rules in
this place-the Senate should have adjourned until tomorrow. I suggest we should now adjourn until tomorrow
because of our rules, unless the government leader will
say that we are not going to follow them. He often suggests that we should not, but I do not think he has any
interest in doing so tonight.
The Hon. the Speaker: I think the honourable Senator
McDonald made what is, in my view, tantamount to a
motion when he asked that Orders 2 to 9 stand. Now this
is the situationHon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I object to that.
[Hon. Mr. Haig.]

May 16, 1972

Hon. Mr. Smith: Give His Honour a chance to finish his
sentence.
The Hon. the Speaker: This is the situation. I said that in
my view this is tantamount to a motion that the remaining
items on the Order Paper should stand. It might well be
that some honourable senators may object to this. If there
is objection then the usual procedure would follow, and I
would have to call each item. I think that what we have
before us now is a motion that Order No. 2 and the
remaining items on the Order Paper stand.
* (2010)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is the practice, too.
Hon. Mr. McElman: Honourable senators, I believe the
record will show that Senator Flynn's point would have
some validity except for one thing that occurred this
afternoon. I believe the record will show that, when it was
requested that items 2 to 9 stand, it was clearly stated
"until later this day."
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That is right.
Hon. Mr. McElman: The record will show that clearly. I
heard it clearly.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You are right.
Hon. Mr. McElman: The request was that they stand
until later this day; they were not stood until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I agree.
Hon. Mr. McElman: On that basis, these items are still
before this house-that is, on the basis of the motion
which was later moved, and carried on division.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McElman: I do not see where the question
arises.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: My point-if I may agree with my honourable friend, because he is right in fact-is that such a
motion would have required one day's notice.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Oh.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable Senator McDonald rose when the Orders of the Day were called, and we
are faced now with what is tantamount to a motion that
the Order No. 2 and the remaining items on the Order
Paper stand. Is it agreed?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Agreed.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I wonder
if I may ask leave to revert to Inquiries?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No. I am sorry, but no. If my friend does
not understand what it means, I will send him a drawing.
Hon. Mr. Martin: My friend has been drawing all day.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No. The government leader has no right
to speak.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes, he has.
The Hon. the Speaker: I asked if there was unanimous
consent, and the Leader of the Opposition said no.
I am wondering now if the Leader of the Government is
rising on a point of order, or on a question of privilege.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: He does not know what the rule is.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, Senator Cameron has risen, and he has not even stated what he wishes to

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is all right.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And before he opens his mouth, Mr.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Surely in a free assembly like thisHon. Mr. Flynn: Yes?
Hon. Mr. Martin: -any honourable senator has a rightHon. Mr. Flynn: To say no.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -at least to put his proposition before
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I said no.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I would suggest to you, honourable
senators, that it is not only implicit in the rules, but surely
obligatory on all of us to give Senator Cameron the opportunityHon. Mr. Flynn: -to say no.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -to make his request to this SenateHon. Mr. Flynn: No.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -and there is nothing in this rule that
prevents that being done. There is nothing in this rule that
justifies the constant observation by the Leader of the
Opposition of "no, no, no." I say that Senator Cameron
has a right to ask this house-

Hon. Mr. Flynn: He has a right to ask, but I have a right
to say no.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would you mind? I ask, for the dignity
of the Senate, that my honourable friend take his seat.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I ask for the dignity of the Senate, too.
The honourable member asked for leave, and I said no.
There is no debate on whether I am right or wrong in
saying no.
The Hon. the Speaker: I must remind honourable senators that the agenda has been exhausted. The honourable
Senator Cameron has asked for unanimous consent.
Unanimous consent has been refused. There is no explanation required under the rules. That is the situation, and
this is the end of the sitting.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am going to ask
the Leader of the Opposition, who has a great regard for
this houseHon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, I have.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -if he will permit Senator CameronHon. Mr. Flynn: No, I will not.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -at least to state what he wishes to ask
this house to do.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That being the case, the record will

THE ECONOMY
EFFECT OF HIGH RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND
INFLATION-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Frank C. Welch rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
high rate of unemployment and inflation and the way
in which they presently affect the economy of
Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I wish to congratulate the
Senate on its three new appointments made from Nova
Scotia of good solid citizens who will make themselves
heard in this chamber. I am also happy to see our friend
from the other house join us here.
I would like to take some minutes of your time to speak
on unemployment and inflation as it affects the economy
of Canada. An old sage once said, "Whom the gods
destroy, they first make mad". Honourable senators, I
submit to you the proposition that the gods are conspiring
to destroy the present government. To be sure, it has been
afflicted with madness, a sort of madness which is
extremely damaging to the Canadian taxpayer.
Never have normal peacetime expenditures been at
such a high level, and never has the taxpayers' money
been frittered away so uselessly. Never have such large
sums of money been spent to generate so little productivity. Never have government spending efforts been so fragmented, so scatterbrained, so ill-conceived, so uncoordinated and lacking in planned purpose.
Surely one has only to point to the millions of dollars$150 million-spent on the notorious Local Initiatives Program and the Opportunities for Youth Program, to prove

being doled out by Canada Council in a wholesale way to
phoney students of the bizarre. This program is almost an
exact parallel of the LIP program.
The government has adopted a Robin Hood policy in

reverse at the expense of the ordinary wage earner.
Let us take a closer look at this $150 million expenditure
referred to as the Local Initiatives Program. It was introduced too late. It did not become fully effective until the
winter was almost over. The federal government failed to
consult the provinces before launching the program. As a
result LIP conflicted with and duplicated programs
already in existence and sponsored by provincial governments. The program dealt directly with municipalities,
when it is generally accepted that provincial governments
are best equipped to do this effectively. LIP was a civil
servant's delight-a mediocre idea wrapped up in miles
and miles of red tape.
Finally, and most unfortunately, this program has not
been of any significant help to those most in need of help,
the hard-core unemployed. The reason for this is simple.
Applying for a LIP grant was so complicated that poorly
educated people did not have a snowball's chance in hell
of being successful.
Those whom this program did benefit were the young,
middle-class, well-educated dropouts from the Establishment who could draft their applications for grants in that
brand of officialese upon which civil servants thrive. In
other words, much of the money went and is still going to
young and well-educated middle-class parasites who
prefer to live off the taxpayer rather than compete for
jobs on the open market. This is disgraceful.
The Trudeau government since it came to power has
relied primarily on short-term, stop-gap measures for the
creation of jobs. This is simply not satisfactory. A sound,
effective, long-term growth strategy must be instituted.
We must get out of the situation where all we can do is

react to adverse conditions when they confront us. We

must plan ahead imaginatively to ensure that such conditions no longer arise.
Finance Minister Turner was saying just recently that
the private sector will have to be relied upon to create
more "hard, not temporary jobs, that last and satisfy". It
is encouraging to see that someone in the cabinet has
rediscovered the private sector.
If this government had not looked upon business as an
inexhaustible source of funds to finance all its harebrained welfare schemes; if this government had not sub-

jected business to excessive taxation leaving so little for
reinvestment and expansion; if this government had not
deliberately slowed down the economy in its unimaginative quest to control inflation, we would not have had to
learn to live with the twins of economic havoc, high inflation and higher unemployment.

I hope that the same man who realized that our economic ills will ultimately be solved by the private sector,
possesses wisdom enough to realize that this cannot be
achieved unless the private sector is freed, unless the
burden of taxation is lessened. If more jobs are to be
created, it means businesses will have to expand. To do
this money will be required. Would it not be simpler and
less expensive if, instead of taking it from them in taxes
and giving it back in the form of grants, we simply
allowed them to keep a larger share of their profits? That
is, would we not encourage growth by diminishing corporate taxation?
According to the Prime Minister, people should not
have to work if they do not want to. He should have asked
the rest of us how we felt about supporting those who can
work but will not. I agree with the Prime Minister that the
aim of man in society should not simply be to work but to
realize his own potential to the maximum.
There are two ways to do this without making of yourself a drain on society. You either work to acquire the
wherewithal that will permit you, after work, to realize
your potential to the full or you so choose your occupation
in life that it becomes the vehicle for the realization of
your potential. These are the only honourable courses that
I can think of. I am surprised that the Prime Minister did
not mention them when he was touring the Province of
Quebec last month. Sure, it will make him popular with
the young, fairly well-educated, middle-class dropouts to
say that there is nothing wrong with a deliberate decision
to collect unemployment insurance rather than to work.
What he is saying is that they are entitled to a free ride in
life. Well, I for one disagree. I am vehemently opposed to
the Prime Minister of this country going around
encouraging the development of social parasites. We can't
afford free-trippers.

This country has too much left to achieve for us to sit
back and waste time and mental effort contemplating
how we will cope with the "leisure society". That is the
sort of time and effort which would be better spent on
trying to solve the problems of unemployment and
inflation.
Governments, federal and provincial and municipal, are
now expropriating nearly half the average earnings of the
average taxpayer. Governments are creating far more
problems than they solve.
The road this government is travelling is not calculated
to diminish unemployment but to foster it by creating
inflation; by promoting uncertainty and lack of confidence on the part of possible employers; by driving small
business into bankruptcy; by its lack of perspective and
evaluation of priorities; by permitting and encouraging
bureaucracy to multiply; and by throttling the business
growth of the nation with a plethora of legislation and
regulations; paper forms, the paternalestic equipment of a
welfare state, which destroy the very initiative and enterprise that alone can increase employment and enable us
to compete in world markets.
This is a well-meaning but an incompetent, and perhaps
even a disastrous, government. I believe that many of my
honourable friends opposite agree, although their lips are
sealed.

25312-24

This brings to mind when the tax bill was before the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee. The senators
opposite were led to believe by the then Minister of
Finance, Mr. Benson, that the amendments as recommended by the committee would have his attention later.
My Liberal friends were surely as aware as the rest of us
that Mr. Benson was seeking a lighter load and that there
would probably be a change in portfolio. I wonder if they
now think that the work and expense of the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee will have any effect.
I recall the words of the late J. L. Ilsley, long-time
Minister of Finance in the MacKenzie King government,
who represented my own constituency. No word of censure against the Prime Minister escaped him when he held
office. But in time he retired from government, as all men
must do eventually, and thereafter wrote an introduction
to a book of collected speeches by Angus L. Macdonald,
former Premier of Nova Scotia and wartime Minister of
National Defence for Naval Services in the King
government.
In this introduction Ilsley wrote, referring to Macdonald's departure from the federal scene:
In April 1945, when Germany was in collapse, Macdonald resigned from the government. It is not
betraying any secret to say that he lost confidence in
the Prime Minister, a feeling, it may be said, in
which we all shared.
This was an admission that the then Prime Minister was
far from adequate. Yet most of his faithful supporters
went on supporting him for some years. I trust, honourable senators, that we do not make the same mistakes in
1972.
To return to my assertion that the government today is
not only failing to do a good job but having an adverse
effect on the economy, let me expand my thesis and
accusation of incompetence.
I shall start with the problem of inflation, and I have
three good reasons for doing so: Louis Rasminsky, Governor of the Bank of Canada; André Raynauld, Chairman
of the Economic Council of Canada, and John Young,
Chairman of the Prices and Incomes Commission. All
three men have warned, recently, that our country is
threatened by serious inflation.
The traditional explanation of the existence of a state of
inflation was that it was due to "too much money chasing
too few goods". This just does not account for the present
surge of inflation. There is no lack of goods. There are
surpluses of goods in every sector of the economy, particularly in agriculture, mineral production, paper and
forestry products, goods of all kinds and description.
Farm and factory curtail production but inflation goes
merrily on.
Unquestionably then, inflation is due to too much paper
money, and too much credit. Our whole financial structure is backed only by public confidence in the belief that
our paper dollars will continue to buy what is considered
to be a dollar's worth of goods and services. But in most
parts of our economy that dollar now buys less and less,
the worst feature of our peculiar type of inflation. We are
suffering from an imbalance and distortion which creates
undue hardships on some sections of the economy as

362

SENATE DEBATES

compared with other sections. The signs and portents
indicate disaster unless the electorate can be made to
realize what inflation is likely to do to us.
Inflation has and will continue to distort the structure of
Canadian production. It has led to the artificial overexpansion of some industries at the expense of others.
Capital has, as a result, been misapplied and wasted. We
have reason to be mightily concerned about inflation. You
cannot bring this problem to a smooth and gentle stop.
Inflation almost inevitably leads to depression.
It is naïve to think that we can set goals, as some have
suggested, whereby we would allow the economy to
inflate to a certain level over a given period. The political
pressure groups which have benefited from a given round
of inflation will insist that it continue, and those who have
not benefited will insist the next round be extended to
include them.
Many politicians refuse to accept that the real causes of
inflation are, most often, maladjustments in the wagecost-price structure caused by the intervention of governments in the free market. It would be folly to suggest that
such imbalances as exist among wages, costs, and prices
can be set right by government-enforced price and wage
controls. The cause of a problem cannot at the same time
provide the solution. The most worth-while thing this government could do to help solve the problem of inflation
would be to desist from its ham-handed interference in
the economy. Because wages and prices are now chasing
each other in a dizzy spiral which is already out of control
in some sections of the economy, in many ways we are
living in an Alice-in-Wonderland economy. We are living
in a more affluent society year by year, but what sort of
foundation has it?
Consider the fact, proclaimed in official circles, that
minimum wage rates have to be raised, otherwise recipients of welfare will be getting more money than those who
are working. The question we hear so often is, "Why work
when welfare and unemployment insurance pays so
well? "
* (1420)

Recently the daily press reported complaints from the
executive secretary of the Saskatchewan Federation of
Labour. Apparently the executive secretary is worried
that the Opportunities for Youth Program might violate
federal labour legislation because in some cases hourly
rates may be below the minimum wage level, and the
same may be true of the LIP Program.
Who will assure us, for instance-and here I mention
one project out of many-that the 10 persons supposed to
be employed in Hare Bay Non-Profit Improvement Association in northern Newfoundland, which received a grant
of $19,721, averaged not less than the $1.75 per hour which
federal labour legislation says they should get?
The same could be asked on behalf of the 28 young
Christian Workers of Reserve in Nova Scotia who will
share $58,000, and those engaged in the hundreds of similar projects across Canada.
Here is another one. It is called "Bullfrog Productions,"
$10,141, publishing five issues of a paper in comic book
style, and directed towards youth and their problems. I
[Hon. Mr. Welch.]

May 17, 1972

question whether that will do an awful lot to help unemployment in Canada.
Here is another one: $13,190 for operation of a medical
aid referral centre for persons in the Halifax-Dartmouth
area who suspect they may have contracted venereal disease. Here is a whole book of them. There are thousands
of them, involving millions of dollars spent all over
Canada.
Much supervision is necessary to see that the law is
adhered to. Since all costs relate back to wages and salaries, every single bit of cost, whether it relates to transportation, taxes, raw materials, sales and distribution, advertising, offices and factories-in short, all human effort
connected with goods and services-has to be paid for. It
eventually adds up to the selling price, and the selling
price adds up to wages and salaries.
In spite of high food costs, high transportation costs,
higher and higher taxes, primary agricultural products
bring the farmers little if any more than they did 30 years
ago. Potatoes are a staple agricultural crop in the Maritimes, but in spite of fantastically rising costs to the
farmer, including taxes, machinery, gas and oil, machinery parts, as well as all other farm supplies, potatoes sell
for about the same price as they did 30 years ago. The
minimum wage control has added greatly to the farmers'
cost. So, he is caught in the inflationary spiral and hurt
far more than the pensioner on fixed income or the regular wage earner.
The farmer survives only because of his ability to
borrow on his real estate which leads him deeper and
deeper into debt. But many farmers are leaving the farms
and joining the hordes of unemployed in towns and cities
where welfare pays more than the farm income.
Many other forms of enterprise are in the same position;
many aspects of forestry, fisheries, small business, that
cannot pass on the added costs to the consumer are fast
going to the wall financially. But these are basic, bedrock
supporters of the economy, and malaise here must inevitably undermine the artificial expansion which has been
built on an insecure foundation.
The truth is that the economy cannot adjust to the fast
moving pace set by government. The government can
spend $150 million on will-o'-the-wisp programs like LIP
which are not geared to any possible constructive growth
or development, and hundreds of millions of dollars on
Opportunities for Youth Programs which make no lasting
contribution to the economy with projects like, to give an
example, the "Crazy Daze Summer Program," to cost
$9,925 to give eleven jobs in Guelph, Ontario. What will
they do next?
These make-work programs to counter unemployment
are a drain on the economy, not a shot in the arm. The
government has recourse to these handouts so that the
national statistics will not reveal how bad the unemployment problem really is. And what will happen when these
jobs have run out? At $100 a week, the 90,000 jobs created
by the $150 million of federal funds through the Local
Initiatives Program will last only about four months each.
What happens when the $150 million, all of it non-productive, is spent? Back to the people for more money so
that those who make a career of living off such grants can

Mav 17. 1972

develop their potential to the maximum, as the Prime
Minister would say, without having to support themselves
through real honest-to-God work. There must be something wrong with a nation which spends 25 cents of the
federal tax dollar on health and welf are, an expenditure
that is supposed to be matched by the provinces. So we
spend about $7,000 million or $7 billion, not counting the
money spent for dentistry, drugs, hearing aids, and other
special services. Are we an unusually unhealthy people or
are we wasting money? No wonder it takes 15 cents of
each tax dollar to pay the interest on the rapidly growing
public debt.
This year the government announced its intention to
borrow another $2 billion "to cover an anticipated $600
million deficit in 1971-72, and $1.3 billion net cash requirements for non-budgetary investments". This is from the
federal publication, "How Your Tax Dollar is Spent".
Nothing could be more inflationary. I clalm it is the government which bears the greatest responsibility for the
growing inflation which besets us.
Honourable senators, this is flot just my opinion. I refer
you to the much publicized pronouncements of Mr. Hellyer and Mr. Kierans, both people with inside information
and stîongly critical of government policies. I refer you
also to the growing chorus of criticism, from outstanding
businessmen and tax experts across Canada. But I should
like to refer particularly to statements made by the President of the Royal Bank of Canada at the recent annual
general meeting of that company. In his opening address
to the shareholders of the bank, Mr. W. Earle McLaughlin
said:
As we approached the close of 1971, Canada could
best be likened to a sailing ship caught in the cross
currents and buffeted by the shifting winds of two
major storms converging on her position ...
We were in unchartered waters and unable to assess
the relative strength and duration of the storm. ...
One of the storms, born in oui country and growing
in intensity to gale force, was made up of many
squalls of uncertain velocity and duration. I refer to
the plethora of legislation; pending legislation, and
threatened legislation, with its confusing and uncertain effects on the course of Canadian business.
*(1430)

Towards the end of Mi. McLaughlin's speech he asks:
What do we want? Certainly the first thing we want
is a consistent policy. My own view is that we should
be wary about restrictions on foreign investments,
because laws in other countries may unfortunately do
the job for us, and in a rather rough sort of way. This
year we are faced with the problem also of a number
of bills being re-introduced into Parliament in an
amended f orm. I refer in particular to the Competition Bill and the Labour Bill. Both of these bis in
their original form had some clauses with serious
implications for the future of Canadian business.
Mr. MeLaugblin goes on to deplore the increasing tendency of governiment to tuin problems over to boards. He
said, referring to the Gray Report:
Unfortunately, boards and screening boards make
decisions more by their own ad hoc judgments than

25312-244

by the rule of law. This is flot conducive to good
planning in business.
Under all these circumstances it is difficuit to predict at this time how 1972 will turn out, as I indicated
earlier most of the indices, with the exception of
unemployment, seem to be pointing in a favourable
direction, which encourages the business economists
to be just optimistic about the outlook for the year.
But I find many businessmen, the ones who make the
plans that resuit in future growth and employment, do
not share this optimism. They are unwilling to believe
the indicators-and this disbelief often does not; seem.
to be affected even when their own companies' operating resuits are satisf actory.
The devil here is uncertainty-uncertainty concerning the new tax laws and regulations; uncertainty
concerning the new legislation affecting business, and
uncertainty concerning the discount proposais in the
United States and any other steps that country might
take to improve its balance of payments position.
Uncertainty in general is not new to business. But
what is new, and what business cannot absorb readlly,
is the addition of arbitrary government decisions to
the ordinary forces of the market place.
Honourable senators, I suggest that there will neyer be
full employment again as long as welf are policies offer
more attractive alternatives. Not that I am opposing welfare policies. Obviously oui economy can well afford to
see that every person is fed and clothed and housed. But
there must be a better way of ensuring this than the
present bureaucratic, inefficient and wasteful method
which has developed, like Topsy. from the old system of
municipal poor relief.
Since the malady we seem to be suffering from has been
brought on, at least partly, by over-production, perhaps
the time has come to implement a universal cost-of-living
subsidy to replace welf are in ail its forms. The Old Age
Pension legislation, which many people forget was imtîated by the Bennett government, has proven to be so successful that perhaps the principle can be made universal.
The cost of administration could certainly be minimized.
The more welf are programs we have, the more bureaucrats we need and the more our tax moneys will have to
be spent on nonproductive labour. If we were to simplify
the system. used to help those in need, we could do more
for thema and make our help really worth while.
I would hasten to point out that while I favour replacing
the present hodgepodge of federal government relief programs of one sort or another by a universal cost-of-living
subsidy, I would certainly have no sympathy for any
guaranteed annual income if it were to be provided in
addition to rather than instead of present federal welf are
measures.
To recapitulate, honourable senators, I think this government has not dealt properly with our two major problems of unemployment and inflation. Unemployment is
stili at much too high a rate. The money governnient
spends on stop-gap measures to cover up its inability to
make any headway against unemployment is wasted, and
this waste, along with government waste in countless
other areas, is productive of inflation. It is ail a vicious

SENATE DEBATES
circle. Government uses the wrong tools to fight inflation
and so creates unemployment. Government cannot seem
to find a lasting solution to unemployment, s0 it spends
fantastic sums on nonsolutions and creates further inflation. The circle could be broken if this government were
to learn to leave well enough alone. Stop trying to direct
and control every aspect of the economy. Free the market.
Put an end to the taxes that strangulate and the regulations that frustrate.
This government has delegated to itself far too much
power over the economy. Not until such time as it divests
itself of much of this power of interference in the economy will we again witness the kind of enthusiasm and
initiative in the private sector which is required to ensure
a healthy productive economy.
Hon. Sydney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, 1 do flot
think that a blatant politically biased attack such as we
have just heard on the government of the country can go
unanswered, if even by only a few remarks on my part.
When I first got into the Senate I was told that it would
flot necessarlly be too political, but I must say that in
many years I have not heard as serious an indictmnent
made in such an irresponsible way as that just made by
the honourable Senator Welch.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You watch the election vote. You
will see how the party lines are drawn.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Ail I can say is that I hope the
speech delivered today will be the platform of the Conservative Party of Canada. If that happens, I can assure you
it would make it one of the easiest elections for the government that is presently in power.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: You are going to need a lot of help.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: It is impossible to go back to the
kînd of naïve thinking that we have heard expressed, the
misstatement of fact, the distortion of prograrns, the absolute denigration of the young people of this country. I was
amazed at the kind of thinking-I would use the adjective
"fuzzy" thinking-that we had presented to us today by
the honourable senator on a so-called discussion of the
problems of inflation and unemployment.
Hon. Mr. Walker: You will make a good hatchetman
before you are here long.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I do not really intend to do that,
senator. I just think that anybody here would not lightly
sit back and listen to what bas been said.
Hon. Mr. Walker: That is just your opinion.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: We will start with our young people.
We heard an indictmnent of the Local Initiatives Program;
we heard that it was absolutely useless. I do not think the
party opposite really believes that. Certainly there are
some weaknesses, but it was a great start. I can speak
with some experience, as mayor of a community that was
involved in the Local Initiatives Program. I think the
distinguished senator who bas just spoken must realize
that they did not benefit only the so-called parasites to
whom he referred. There were many very worthy people,
young and old, employed because the Local Initiatives
Program involved a whole series of building programs; it
was not just concerned with the kind of program in which
[Hon. Mr. Welch.l

May 17, 1972
My1,17

surveys were made, as the honourable senator seerned to

think, where people knocked on doors or helped those
who suffer from social diseases. The fact is that in my
community and going right across the country there were
many projects, employing thousands of people, old and
young, experienced and inexperienced, which made a significant contribution to the employment picture during
this very difficult winter.
a (1440)

When we get into the Opportunities for Youth programs, again I would like to have the remarks of the
senator used as a platforrn for the Conservative Party in
trying to attract the votes of these wonderful young
people we have in Canada. I know that even the rabid
Tory partisans across the country would agree that this
has generally been a beneficial program.
The surveys made independently-granted as usual that
there are always some aspects of the program that have
been abused on occasion-show that, generally speaking,
by far the great majority were satisfactory projects. I
personally hope it will continue for many years to corne as
a means of providing employment in a useful way while
giving us social advantages for the young people of the
country.

So I have to say that I refuse to accept the proposition
that these projects were for the "parasites of society".
These same "parasites" the senator referred to are going
to be the leaders of this country bef ore too many years.
Hon. Mr. Welch: And they will be voters in the next
election.

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Yes, that is right, they will be voters.
And the kind of stuff we heard today is not the kind of
thing that is likely to attract the voters of this country.
Hon. Mr. Welch: Is not that the reason why you are
courting them? Answer that one.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: We are courting the young people of
Canada because we feel that there is a future for them in
this country. We want to provide employment and every
opportunity for them. The LIF and the Opportunities for
Youth programs have all been very sîgnificant factors.
If I could just move along to the general tenor of the
speech, that the government bas not done anything except
create unernployment and create inflation, I would say
this. When the present Government of Canada attempted
to control inflation, the first to criticize were those on the
opposite benches. They said that because the government
recognized the dangers of inflation and tried to do sornething about it, this terrible situation we have now was
created. You hear this shouted from the rooftops.
No one gives the government credit for doing exactly
what the senator mentioned in reading from what the
Governor of the Bank of Canada stated, namely, that
inflation was a significant problem. Certainly it is, and it
is continuing to be, and the governrnent is concerned
about it. The question, of course, always is: How do you
cool off the economy and stili not create unemploymnent?
This whole concept of what the government can do to
provide jobs-and I arn sure it will be debated here for

some months-has to be looked at in perspective. Why
does the honourable senator not quote labour statistics on

Mav 17. 1972

SENATE DEBATES
EAE
SNT

employment as at April 30? Why does he flot say that
Canada, with ail its young people cornîng into the labour
force, has had the largest labour force increase of any
western nation? Why does he not indicate that as at the
end of April our labour force increased by 281,000 over
the previous year at the sarne date? Why does he flot
indicate that the Government of Canada, through its econornic and fiscal programs, has provided an mncrease of
348,000 new jobs this year as against last year at April 30?
In other words, approxirnately 350,000 new jobs have been
created in the labour force as a resuit of the enlightened
policies of the Trudeau government. That is a record we
are proud of. Why does not the honourable senator look at
the facts and give the governiment credit for the statistics
that we have just heard? More new jobs were created in
Canada in the last five years than in any of the cornbined
rnost prosperous non-comrnunist countries of Europe.
Hon. Mr. W.lch: There is more unemployment too. Go
the rest of the way. 'You want me to go the rest of the way;
you go the rest of the way.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: There is flot more unemploymentHon. Mr. Welch: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: -in relation to the number of
people coming on to the labour force. This is where that
fuzzy thinking hits. In relation to the number of people
coming into the labour force, I think the record of the
governiment is very good indeed.
Ail I say is that we can point to an increase in one year
of 348,000 in the number of people employed, and there is
no nation in the western world which has been able to do
this.
The distinguîshed Senator Walker will remember the
time of the old National Productivity Council when we
were told-I was a member of that body-that the objective in Canada was to create one million new jobs over
five years. One million new jobs! And whoever looked at
that said, "Isn't that a fantastic objective? Do you think
Canada could ever do it?"
These are what the economîc Caesars, as they have
been referred to by the distinguished senator, have succeeded in doing-creating that rnany jobs. In one year
350,000 jobs were created as a resuit of the buoyancy in
the economny brought about by governrnent action.
It is granted that unemployment is a major problem, but
let us be reasonable and f air. If we have this upsurge in
the number of people looking for jobs, then certainly I arn
thankful that we have been able to provide the number of
new jobs we have. Think what kind of a mess we would
have been in had we not had the policy of the present
governrnent which created this kind of employrnent. So
when I look at the whole presentation of the senator, I
find he spoke against every form. of welf are program.
except that of old age pensions. That is the one he says a
Conservative government was responsible for. Weil, ail
the more power to him.
The fact is that we are looking at a whole new world,
and we rnight as well learn to live with it and learn to live
in it. I arn sure the young people of Canada today, those
who in the flot too distant future will be taking our places,
would not; agree with views that have been expressed by
the senator. He says he would like to see cost-of-living

payments provided and yet he is dead set against a guaranteed annual wage. He says he is worried that people wil
become parasites because they are being put on welfare.
The surveys show that people still want to work, even
though they may be on welf are now. I arn quite sure that
Senator Croîl and all the members of the Committee on
Poverty wiil agree that relatively few want to live on
welfare, that if they can find the jobs they are usually
willing to work.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is pretty exaggerated.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I should like to say a few more
words in conclusion and then senators can try to tear rny
remarks to pieces. I arn very proud of the fact that the
goverfiment in power today has been able to, create
employment opportunities, has been able to say to these
young people, including university students, that there are
programs which will keep themn socially occupied in a
beneficial way.
I would hope to see an expansion of these programs and
I think it is going to becorne, whatever the political makeup of the federal government, more and more a way of
occupying young people who are joining the labour force.
I hope it will be expanded into other areas for those
people who otherwise cannot find gainful ernployrnent.
I apologize if I have been too critical, but I must admit
that it was impossible to sit back and listen to the kind of
statements that were made and not respond to them.
Hon. Mr. Welch: Honourable senators, the truth always
hurts. When I speak I like to bring people to their feet
because they cannot stand the truth. Senator Buckwold
said he would like to see everyone have jobs and everyone
busy. But the Prime Minister goes to Quebec and tells
them that they do not; have to work, that if they are paying
unemployment insurance they do flot have to work. He
made that staternent. Do you know what it costs under
these programs to provide jobs? It costs $1,600 per job.
What kind of governrnent is that? How long do the taxpayers have to suffer if such things as these keep happening?
O(1450)

An Han. Senatar: Order.
Hon. Mr. Welch: I can give you nurnerous examples of
this that would put you to shame.
The. Hon. the Speaker: I understood Senator Welch was
asking a question. Does Senator Phillips now wish to ask
a question?
Hon. Orville H. Phillipa: Honourable senators, I arn not
sure whether Senator Welch was askîng questions or replying to some very unf air, distorted accusations made by
Senator Buckwold.
Senator Buckwold rose with great gusto, wanting to say
that this house was proud of Prime Minister Trudeau. I
want to assure you that this house joins most of Canada in
rejecting this government.
Hon. Mr. Benidlckson: This house?
Han. Mr. Phillipa: This chamber, yes-if you were
honest and admitted it.
Hon. Mr. Benidkaon: Are you suggesting I arn not?

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Phillips: You can keep him, if you want him. I
don't want him.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Are you making the imputation
that I am not honest in my conduct here?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Just Liberal.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Just Liberal.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: I would certainly reject any such
imputation.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Well, accusations that are hurled
across the chamber to this side can hardly go unanswered. The idea that all programs mentioned by Senator
Welch were opposed by this side is completely erroneous.
He was criticizing the inefficiency of the various programs. Certainly, any one of you knows that there have
been inefficiencies. Why have you had the resignations
from the Opportunities for Youth program? There was
too much political interference. That is why. The right
projects were not selected.
Now, is it wrong to say that? Are you against the young
people of Canada because you criticize the officials in
charge of the program? Even Senator Buckwold can
make that distinction.
I know, for example, of one rejected application that
was made by a very sincere group of students from the
faculty of dentistry of the University of Toronto. They
had been assured in February that there was a 70 per cent
chance that their program would be approved. On the
basis of that they spent a great deal of time in planning it.
They even presented the original program at the Ontario
Dental Convention.
There were 14 students involved. They planned to move
out, working in teams of two, to reach 36,000 people.
Moreover, those 14 students had gone to various dental
supply companies and collected over $25,000 worth of
supplies as donations towards this program. The program
was not accepted. The application was rejected. The
department said there were "more worthy projects."
There may have been, but when you look at the list of
programs it must cause you to wonder, just as we wonder.
I am sure that a great many people, not only elderly
people but young people, Senator Buckwold, are beginning to question the wisdom of some of these programs
that have been approved.
Mention was made of the LIP program. Well, to a small
village in the province which I represent I suggested that
they make an effort to establish and build a medical
centre or a medical clinic for that area. They have had
difficulty in keeping a doctor in that village. That was one
reason for suggesting a medical clinic. But that was not
one of the buildings that were built, about which you
boasted so much. They rejected that building, but they
gave a sum of money to clean up the cemetery which at
that time was covered by five feet of snow.
If you can, tell me which is the more beneficial-cleaning up a cemetery covered by five feet of snow or building
a medical centre. If you tell me that a clean-up is more
beneficial, then I must ask you where your reasoning is.
I hate to be direct; I hate to be personal, but when you
speak of fuzzy thinking, you must remember, honourable
Senator Buckwold, that the fuzzy thinking is not all on

this side. There is a tremendous amount of it over there,
and you are a classic example.
Hon. Mr. Cook: That is complimentary.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Unless other honourable senators
wish to address the house on this subject at this time, I
would move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You are going to put the finishing
touch on the whole thing.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Langlois, debate adjourned.
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
TRADE AND GOODWILL MISSION OF CANADIAN
SENATORS AND BUSINESSMEN-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Donald Cameron rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
recent trade and goodwill mission of a group of
Canadian Senators and businessmen to the People's
Republic of China.
He said: Honourable senators, as this is the first opportunity I have had since the new members were appointed
to this house, I should like to join with those who have
preceded me in extending to them a very cordial welcome.
It is a pleasure to welcome the Honourable George McIlraith, who has had a distinguished career in the other
house lasting, I believe, some 32 years. It would be our
hope that he could be a member of this house for the same
period of time, and, except for the age ruling, I am sure he
would be. It is also a pleasure to welcome Dr. Henry
Hicks, who has been a colleague of mine in education for
a long time. He has made a distinguished contribution to
his country.
We are happy to see that another lady has been appointed to the Senate. I refer to Mrs. Norrie, whom I have not
yet had the pleasure of meeting. I am sure she will enjoy
her stay in this chamber. I should also like to extend a
cordial welcome to Mr. Graham.
While extending congratulations I should also mention
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West). I wonder how many
members of the Senate have read the last issue of the
Commonwealth ParliamentaryJournal in which there is
one of the most complete and effective articles on the
Canadian Senate that I have ever seen. That article was
written by our friend Senator Connolly.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: There have been some very good
books and other articles written on the Senate, but this
one is up-to-date and complete and I would certainly
recommend it to those who have not yet read it.
I have just one word for my friend Senator Welch. I
think all that is the matter is that he left his rose-coloured
glasses at home, and put on a pair of dark glasses by
mistake.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Blue ones.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Yes, they may be coloured blue, but
I do not think the economy is really all that bad.
The purpose of this inquiry is to speak on the Seventh
Annual Trade and Goodwill Mission to the People's

Republic of China. By way of introduction may I give the
origin of this series of trade and goodwill missions? It
goes back to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meeting in 1963 to which I had the privilege of leading
the Canadian delegation. In the course of that visit I had
the opportunity of travelling over Malaysia, Thailand, and
part of Southeast Asia.
On the one hand I was impressed by the tremendous
need for managerial skills, and on the other hand I was
impressed by the tremendous gap in our knowledge of the
conditions in those countries. As a result, I extended at
that time an invitation to the Government of Malaysia to
send students to the Banff School of Advanced Management, at which I had some responsibility.
* (1500)

Since 1965 we have held 10 per cent of our places for
foreign students and offshore students from all over the
world, but mainly from the developing countries of southeast Asia. Those students have created such an interest on
the part of Canadians in seeing those countries that in
1966 a group of the alumni of the Banff School of
Advanced Management chartered a jet plane and visited
Japan and China. I had the privilege of leading that
delegation on what was my first visit to the People's
Republic of China. In 1967 a similar group went to
Poland, Russia and Czechoslovakia, in 1968 to the Caribbean, and in 1969 to Greece, Turkey and Israel. In 1970 we
intended to visit northern Europe, but because of the
economic conditions in general and the slowdown we
decided to postpone that trip for a year.
A year ago last July, I made application to the Embassy
of the People's Republic of China, and through the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the
China Travel Service, to make a tour of China in 1972. In
October permission was granted for 25 people to go. The
reason that the number was not larger was that they were
so swamped with applications for visas from 500,000
people that they simply could not accommodate them. At
any rate, the invitation was extended to us, and 24 Canadians spent three weeks in China.
Prior to going I drafted what I considered to be a useful
program outlining what we might see, based upon my
own visit there in 1966. I submitted it to the embassy and I
must say that the new ambassador, Mr. Yao Kuang, a
youthful and bright man, was most enthusiastic about it,
as were the chargé d'affaires, Mr. Hsu Chung-fu and Mr.
Tsung, the first secretary. They felt that we might find it
difficult to carry out the itinerary that I had prepared, but
they did not think they could improve upon it. At this time
I should mention that Mr. John Fraser, a son of the
distinguished Canadian writer, Blair Fraser, and who is
attached to our embassy in Peking, was most helpful in
setting up the program.
Eventually, honourable senators, we started on our
journey and arrived first of all in Japan where we spent a
short time. Here I must pay tribute to our foreign service
officers because on many occasions they get a lot of
brickbats and not as many bouquets as they deserve. Our
ambassador and his staff made arrangements for us to
meet with the Director General of Foreign Trade in the
Japanese Foreign Ministry, who agreed to meet us despite
the fact that there was a crisis in the Diet at that time.

They provided us with not only a great deal of background information on Japanese-Canadian imports and
exports, but they gave us an assessment of what we might
look to in the future. In this regard I should say there is an
interesting change in emphasis taking place in southeast
Asia today, a change of emphasis that is vitally important
to every Canadian. I mention that because many of us are
inclined to forget that Canada is a Pacific power just as
much as she is an Atlantic power.
The role of Japan in Asia during the next 15 years will
be very different from the role she has played during the
last 15 years. That country is now beginning to come out
from under the American umbrella, and is very likely to
plough a more independent furrow in the years to come.
Our ambassador Mr. Moran, said to us, "When your
delegation meets Mr. Hirahara, the Director General of
Foreign Trade, be sure to ask him questions of substance." As it happened Mr. Hirahara had to leave to
attend a cabinet meeting, but he left his two assistants,
Mr. Ikeda and Mir. Ogura, to carry on the discussion with
us. After the discussion was over they went to Mr. Burney
of our embassy staff and said, "I thought you told us the
Canadians would not be asking any tough questions. In
fact they asked nothing else". So Mr. Moran must have
been satisfied that our questions were in fact questions of
substance.
From Tokyo we went on to Hong Kong where Mr. R. L.
Wales, the High Commissioner, and the staff of our office
there provided us with a useful background briefing as to
the trade situation between Canada and Hong Kong. It
happens that last year they imported from Canada goods
to the value of $56.2 million while we bought from them
goods to the value of $69.5 million which, as can be readily
seen, means there was a trade deficit.
Hong Kong is an interesting place, and it provides a
vital connection between the People's Republic of China
and the rest of the world. Knowledgeable foreign service
officers are predicting that there will be a great change in
the role of Hong Kong in the next 10 to 15 years. Until
recently Hong Kong has been our sole means of contact
with the People's Republic of China and it has been the
Chinese window on the western world and, indeed, a very
useful one. However, the expectation now is that within 10
years the emphasis will change and Shanghai will become
the major point of entry for China, and Hong Kong will
gradually decrease in importance because much of the
activity now going on there will be diverted to Shanghai.
Let me point out, incidentally, that Canada has a great
stake in the situation. I say this because of our leadership
in the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, which I consider to have been a
very wise move. As a result, Canada stands today at a
very high point among the Chinese, and everywhere the
welcome mat is out for Canadians. I can assure any honourable senator who may have the opportunity of going to
China that it would be well worth-while to go there
because it is one of the most fascinating countries in the
world. It is also a country which is going to play an
increasingly important role in world affairs because it is
on the verge of becoming one of the superpowers.
At any event, after a thorough background briefing
from our foreign service officers we went into China. The

SENATE DEBATES
only way of doing that, of course, is to go by train from
Hong Kong to the border, a distance of about 30 miles,
and then to walk across the border, which is about 150
yards across a little stream of the size of the Gatineau
River in the dry season.
We noticed some interesting psychological changes as
soon as we crossed the border. When we went there in
1966, just prior to the cultural revolution, there was a
great deal of tension and stiffness on the part of the
Chinese. This time we found the stiffness on the British
side of the border. It was the British soldiers and officers
who said, "No, you cannot take pictures here," and, "You
cannot do this," and, "You cannot do that". They were
quite curt and rather gruff. But once across the border we
found that the Chinese were smiling and friendly. They
said to us, "I suppose you could not take pictures there.
Well, here you can take pictures anywhere you like." This
was the attitude we found everywhere in China. There
was a tremendous warmth in their welcome to Canadians.
I might say that while the Chinese appreciate what has
been done by Canada at the diplomatic and official levels,
a great deal of this warmth and welcome resulted from
the work of one single Canadian, a man who is unique in
the place he occupies in the hearts of the Chinese. I refer,
of course, to Dr. Norman Bethune who has become a real
folk-hero, honoured in song and story by the Chinese
people. As you are aware, he was with Chairman Mao and
the Red Army on the long march. He was a good surgeon,
and he performed a tremendous service for China in his
selfless, highly efficient way. Chinese people from little
children up know of and admire Dr. Bethune for his
outstanding public service. While many Chinese may not
know where Toronto is, they certainly know where Gravenhurst is.
a (1510)

In that connection, I suggest to the Leader of the Government that it would serve a useful purpose if the
National and Historic Sites Branch recognized this outstanding Canadian who has made such a great contribution to China and, consequently, to Canada.
I understand that when Chinese people come to
Canada, including the ping-pong players, they go to
Gravenhurst.
Honourable senators, I will not give you a travelogue on
China. But I do wish to say a word or two about the
physical aspects of that country. Geographically, China is
the number three country in the world in terms of size.
Canada is larger by approximately 200,000 square miles.
Canada's actual size is 3,851,000 square miles while China's is 3,691,000 square miles. Of course, we are all small
compared with Russia's 8 million square miles. China's
population is between 700 million and 800 million. There is
a tremendous population discrepancy between our two
countries. There was also a great discrepancy between the
population figures which were quoted for China, for
which we endeavoured to find an answer. During a session with Mr. Chou Mo-jo, the chairman of the National
Congress, we endeavoured to establish the population of
China, and we found the discrepancy was rather confusing. Some people said the population was 700 million
while others insisted it was 750 million, and some even
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

May 17, 1972

said 800 million. Even in a country as populous as China,
it is hard to lose 50 million people.
China's number three man, a very distinguished scholar, Mr. Chou Mo-jo, who is a very young 78 and who
would pass for one of Canada's younger senators, indicated that the last census was in 1964 and he did not feel it
was a very good census. They did not know what the
population was. So if you can lose 50 million people, two
and a half times the population of Canada, it shows that
you can get along even if the statistics are not accurate.
After we crossed the border on our way to Canton we
transferred from the Hong Kong train to the Chinese
train. The distance from the border at Shumchun is about
125 miles. The train from Hong Kong to the border point
was not clean, was not fast, and was crowded. You could
hardly move in it. When we crossed the border our train
was spotlessly clean. There were girls whisking the seats
every half hour or so, and serving pots of delightful Chinese tea. This was a more efficient train, a better riding
train, than either the Canadianor the Super-Continental.
They are very proud of their railroads, and they have
reason to be.
When we arrived in Canton we immediately began our
program of sightseeing. First on the agenda was a visit to
the famous Sun Yat Sen Hospital and Medical School.
This medical school is in a city of 4,500,000 people. The
man who spoke to us on behalf of the university was not a
medical person. He was a civilian, the chairman of the
People's Revolutionary Committee. If you should ever go
to China, whether you visit a high school, university,
factory, or whatever it may be, the person with whom you
will speak first will be the chairman of the People's Revolutionary Committee. This man appeared to be around 45
years of age. For over an hour he reviewed the medical
teaching program, and a history of their medical training
program. He spoke through an interpreter without a note,
and it was a logical, precise, masterly presentation. I
asked him what his background was and he indicated that
three years previously he had been in the People's Liberation Army, which they refer to as P.L.A. In the army he
worked in an administrative capacity, and he was a natural born administrator. He indicated that the training
period for doctors had been reduced from six to three
years. With him were three doctors-Dr. Hoa, a thoracic
surgeon trained in Boston, Dr. Wang, who trained in
Moscow and who spoke both English and Russian, and
Dr. Wu. These men interjected comments occasionally.
There was a lively question and answer period. I thought
our questions were answered very responsively.
While in the medical school we were fortunate to witness two operations using the acupuncture technique of
anesthesia. I do not know how much you may have read
about this technique. I am sure you will hear more about
it in the future. We were taken out of the briefing room
and served tea with a young lady, Miss Wong Kwang-lee,
27 years of age, an office worker. She was sitting in her
pyjamas. She had a large goiter on her throat. We talked
with her for a time and then, while we were taken upstairs
to the operating theatre, she went to another room and
was placed on the operating table, and we witnessed the
nearest thing to magic that I have ever seen. They placed
two acupuncture needles into her, one between the thumb

and the forefinger and the other on the left side of her
calf. The doctors placed a sheet over her chin, bared her
chest and swabbed it. All the while she was waving and
smiling at us. They made a slit in her throat, and in about
20 minutes removed a goiter the size of a large mandarin
orange. They sutured her up, swabbed her throat, put a
gown on her, and she sat up and talked to the doctors. The
doctor tapped her on the back, and she walked into the
room where we had met her half an hour before, and we
talked to her again.
This was a relatively simple operation. While it was
proceeding there was a second operation next door, and
we went to the second operating theatre. This operation
had been in process for about two hours. They were
removing a brain tumour. It seemed almost uncanny to be
able to watch the man's face. This man, 35 years of age,
had paralysis of his extremities and was subject to
extreme convulsions. We could see his face and the whole
side of his head. We saw the brain move, and the doctors
pushing it around in a most irreverent fashion. I am not
aware if Mr. Ma Chi got up and walked around afterwards-I would doubt it-but nevertheless he was conscious and eating a slice of orange. It was incredible to
watch the normal reactions of this man as his face was
reflected in a mirror, while on the other side of the sheet
we could see half his skull removed leaving the brain
exposed, while at the same time the patient was conscious,
eating slices of orange. It was incredible to see the two
things-the normal reaction of a man obviously not in
pain and, at the same time, his whole brain exposed as the
doctors probed and cut.
e (1520)

As a member of our group we had Dr. Tanner, a wellknown surgeon from Whitehorse. The Chinese doctors
invited him to go into the operating theatres, not only in
Canton but also in Peking.
The Chinese are the first to admit that they are not quite
sure what happens, but they know it works. The acupuncture technique is thousands of years old. At one time they
used stones instead of needles as a means of deadening
pain. They were not used for operations, but to deaden
pain. In recent years the acupuncture technique has been
developed for operations. Over 200,000 operations using
this technique have been performed in the last few years.
We saw on film-and I am hoping that we may get some
of these films in Canada-an operation to remove a
tumour on the lung. This operation was incredible to see.
It seemed as though they were slicing a piece of meat. It
was incredible to see the thoracic region exposed, to see
the doctors pushing the heart and lungs around, yet with
the patient fully conscious. It was also incredible to see
the patient get up from the table and walk away. We also
saw on film the birth of a baby by caesarean section.
As a result of this experience, we are suggesting that an
exchange of medical personnel between Canada and
China at an early date might be one of the useful things
that could be promoted at the official level.
Honourable senators will recall that last fall a team of
surgeons from China visited McGill, Ottawa, Western
Ontario and Toronto university medical schools. More of
such exchange visits are needed. I will come back to this
matter later.

Once this part of the program was completed, we were
concerned about seeing more of the country. I do not
propose to deal with the topic of factory work in Canton.
Canton is a large industrial city of 4,500,000 people. It is a
very busy place, and is the site of the Canton Export
Commodities Fair.
We flew from Canton to Shanghai, a flight of two hours,
in a Russian-made Illushyn plane. It is a very good aircraft, something like our Vanguard only a little bigger and
much more powerful.
The approaches to Shanghai resemble the delta of the
Mississippi, with thousands of canals, rivers and flat land
surrounding this city of 10 million people. There are six
million people in the city proper and four million in the
suburbs. Because of the western concessions of years ago,
Shanghai is the most westernized city in China.
We were met at the airport as usual by the Chairman of
the People's Revolutionary Committee and the China
International Travel Service. We were accommodated in
what is known as the Peace Hotel on the famous Shanghai
Bund. The hotel was built in 1911 by Sir Phillip Sassoon,
the Jewish banker. Although the hotel is comfortable, the
plumbing and heating is of 1911 vintage. There is nothing
wrong with the hotel, but it is dated. I can assure anyone
who wishes to visit China that the hotels are comfortable,
transportation is very good, and the service is excellent.
No one need have any qualms about that.
While in Shanghai we were taken to see some of the
factories. Prior to that we were taken to see the permanent industrial exhibition, a huge exhibition area having
10,000 permanent exhibits, ranging from small scalpels
for the medical profession, huge generators, large enough
to light the City of Shanghai, to tremendous 6,000-ton
hydraulic presses, and similar heavy equipment. The most
significant thing about the exhibition was the fact that the
electric generators, hydraulic presses, radio broadcasting
and other equipment, had all been designed and built by
the people in the individual factories.
The Chinese will tell you, "We know that we could make
faster progress if we brought in western technology. But
after our experience with the Russians in 1962, when they
withdrew all their technicians and left us on our own, we
decided that never again would we be dependent on any
outside power. It may take us longer, but we will develop
our own resources for our own people."
That is very significant, because the rate of progress,
particularly in technology, from the time when I was first
there in 1966 until my second visit this year, is quite
fantastic. This fact has wide ranging implications for the
whole western world.
One factory visited was a plastic factory making fountain pens. The factory had been in existence since 1931. At
that time it was very small, but it now employs 1,300
people and makes 24 million fountain pens a year. The
kind of fountain pen being produced is an ink pen, similar
to types seen in Canada. I said to one of their representatives, "Why should you be making an obsolete pen? Ninety-five per cent of the market in Canada and the United
States is for ballpoint pens." He replied, "Well, this is the
market in China. We are making for the Chinese market,
and we have other factories that make ballpoint pens."

370

SENATE DEBATES

I do not wish to bore honourable senators with details,
but the factory which we visited contained a mixture of
processes. Some were obsolete hand processes, others
were semi-automated processes, and others were automatic processes. The semi-automatic and automatic processes made use of the type of equipment that might have
been used in Canada in 1945 or 1946. It was outdated. The
quality of the pen being produced was not as good as one
might expect, and the price was fairly high. The retail
price was about $5, and one could buy a much better pen
in Canada for less.
We then visited an electronics factory which made
meter equipment, everything from water meters to electric meters which record changes in materials, and measure such things as the stresses in the Nanking Bridge.
There was sophisticated equipment of every kind and
description, and again there was a mixture of old and
modern equipment. However, everywhere could be seen
highly sophisticated new equipment made and designed
by a team in that particular factory. This was true of
every factory we visited in China. The significant point
here is that these people are building up a cadre of highly
skilled designers and technicians who can do anything.
No doubt that is why they confounded our American
expert friends by developing their own nuclear devices
when the Americans said they could not do it. They are
doing a great deal more than we have been given to
understand. It is important to recognize that the Chinese
people are making progress.
Our group also visited a workers' village. Housing in
China is something that might depress Canadians.
Despite improvements they still have a long way to go, but
the measure of improvement in the period between 1966
and 1972 has been simply fantastic.
For the benefit of honourable senators, I will describe
one of the workers' villages that we saw in Nanking. It is
called the Yangtse River Road Workers' Village, having a
population of 68,000. It is divided into eight sub-villages,
having a total of 15,000 households. Those households are,
in the main, three-storey flats. Some are two-storey and
some one-storey, but most are three-storey. A family
might have two rooms. Seldom does a family have its own
bathroom, but there will be one down the corridor. Rents
range from three yuan, which is about 50 or 55 cents, to 10
yuan per month-a variation of from about $1.50 to $5 per
month.
* (1530)

The average factory worker's salary was 71 yuan per
month, and ranged from 45 yuan for an apprentice to 115
or 120 yuan for a skilled worker. Women retired at the age
of 50 and men at the age of 55. The men could stay on if
they wished to the age of 60, and they then retired on a 70
per cent pension.
The thing that intrigued me most of all was to go into a
retired pensioner's home. We had tea in one pensioner's
home. This home, by Canadian standards, is very limited.
It is one room, 10 by 12 feet with a tiled floor. It is simply
furnished with no overly padded furniture, a few hard
chairs, four or five chests, a clock, a radio, a table, and
spotlessly clean. We asked this couple who had retired at
the same time what they did before. The wife who was
about 60, and two or three years older than her husband,
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

May 17, 1972

told us she had been a silk worker, taking the silk from
the cocoon and preparing it to go into the spinning
apparatus. The husband had been a factory worker. We
asked them what type of living conditions they had before
the revolution in 1949. The woman was the more talkative
of the two, and she told us that they had lived in a
mud-floored hut with a thatched roof about 8 feet by 10
feet. The roof was so low that they could not stand up in
it, and every time it rained the roof leaked. They moved
into this flat, as they called it, three years ago. There were
three flats in a wing, which was three storeys high. Most
of the retired people were couples, although there were
two or three younger couples in a wing in some cases, but
it was not a crowded situation.
In addition to their flat they had a kitchen which served
three families. Each flat had its own stove and its own
toilet, and there was a common bathroom. That seems, as
I say, quite primitive according to our standards, but
when you consider these people had come from a mudfloored hut with a roof that leaked every time it rained
you can see why they were enthusiastic about where they
were living and, of course, they retired on 70 per cent of
their former wages.
In addition to this, each of these sub-villages had a
well-stocked department store with well-displayed materials and goods which were quite cheap. There was also a
cinema and a park complete with swimming pool and
places for the kiddies to play, and lots of recreational
facilities and benches. It is a most attractive park. In fact,
I do not think you will find any park in Ottawa that is any
better. These things explain the enthusiasm that we found
everywhere we visited.
Before leaving Nanking we visited the place where Dr.
Sun Yat Sen is buried. I have visited the memorial to
Mahatma Gandhi in New Delhi, the Invalides in Paris, the
Washington Monument, as well as other great monuments
throughout the world, but they are all dwarfed by the
tremendous monument to Dr. Sun Yat Sen. This monument is built on the side of a high mountain overlooking
the valley of the Yangtse River. While looking at this
monument we wondered what type of monument they will
build to Chairman Mao. We are going to see the father of
all national monuments when Chairman Mao dies,
because if they build such a monument for Dr. Sun Yat
Sen what will they do for Chairman Mao?
We left Nanking by train and made the 17-hour journey
to Peking. It was a very comfortable journey. Two couples
shared a compartment, and we had our own sitting room
and a dining room. It was a very fine and comfortable
17-hour journey. On arrival in Peking we were met by our
ambassador and by the chairman of the People's Revolutionary Committee. We went first for a briefing session
with Mr. Collins at the chancery, and immediately following that we visited a factory.
I am not going to go into all that again except to say this
factory had over 7,000 employees. It was a machine tool
factory, one of those combining the new and the old. The
last unit had been built in 1971 and was not yet fully
occupied. It was bright, airy, and clean, and the type of
machinery was very sophisticated and modern with some
old machines, particularly lathes. A lathe lasts a long
time, so they kept their old lathes. There were modern

May 17,1972

1972SENATE

DEBATES

hydraulic presses and sophisticated radio equipment in
abundance. Around this factory were workers' homes of
the three, four and five-storey fiat variety.
There has been a tremendous change in Peking as f ar as
housing and a general upgrading of the whole city is
concerned. It is a city of 7,500,000 people. We expressed a
wish to visit the University of Peking. When I was in
Peking in 1966 there were 50 universities and colleges, and
I was anxious to know what happened to them during the
cultural revolution. We got to the University of Peking
and were received by the Chairman of the Peoples' Revolutionary Committee, Professor Chou Pei-Yuan who is a
graduate of the University of Chicago where he spent four
years. In addition hie spent two years doing graduate work
at Cal Tech, and another two years employed at Cal Tech.
He spoke excellent English. We asked him how many
universities and colleges there were in Peking today and
the effect on themn of the cultural revolution. He told us
there were 12 universities and colleges in Peking in 1972.
In 1966 the registration in the University of Peking was
10,000 students. Today it is 3,000. You must remember that
the university was closed for three years, and in the
rationalization that has taken place since the cultural
revolution and Chairman Mao's emphasis on combining
theory and practice many colleges and institutes have
been relocated.
Professor Chou told us that there was an institute of
petroleumi geology in Peking, but since the oul fields are a
long way from Peking that institute was moved out to the
oil fields in order to combine theory and practice for the
students. He also told us there was an institute of agriculture and an institute of forestry in Peking and again, in
order to combine theory and practice for the students,
both of these institutes were moved out to the agricultural
and forestry areas respectively. In other words, there was
a process of decentralizing most of these institutes of
higher education.
If I size up the situation correctly, while there have been
many benefits from the cultural revolution I feel that the
universîties probably wiil take a longer time to recover
from the excesses of the cultural revolution than any
other aspect of Chinese life. For example, today, through
the leadership of Chou En-lai the Chinese are expanding
their embassy and consular services ail over the world. It
is dîfficuit enough to find English-speaking embassy and
consular personnel, but the Chinese must find such personnel who speak Russian, Japanese, German, and a host
of other languages. It is a tremendous gap to f111, and they
have three and a half to four years to maire up. As it is, it
takes about four years to train a person for that work, s0
it will be some time before they catch up. We visited one
of the language-training schools, and they do a good job
but, if my judgment is correct in this area, the effects of
the cultural revolution at the university level will take
longer to overcome than in almost any other phase of life.
In the f ield of medicine they have cut the program from
six years to three years. We asked them. how they did it,
and we were told that in examining their programn in
medicine they found that the students were getting pharmacology in four different courses. In other words, there
was duplication and repetition. They told us they had cut
ail that out and, in addition, they start them in the hospi-

tais at a younger age as interns. Now, what about a
specialist? Well, you do not get a specialist degree in three
years. To become a specialist in any area you must go
back for another four years, so to be a specialist you must
put in seven or eight years. One of the things wrong with
universities in our country, and with the education
system, is that we too have duplication and repetition here
and there. We could cut out a lot of our material as the
Chinese have done.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I wonder if the honourable senator would permit a question at this point? When he mentions the university term, does hie mean a terni of six
months, eight months, a year, or what?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: It is a termi of eleven months, so they
have compacted the time as well. Of course, our programns
are about ten months now.
They have combined the idea of theory and practice
throughout their whole schedule. For example, in Peking
we were in a middle school. The students spent two afternoons a week in the labs, during which they started with
the raw materials from which they made fountamn pen
cases on a jig. One girl poured in the metal powder or
plastic into a heated jig, and the material came out as a
case. The next girl put on a band to hold it where the cap
is threaded on. The next girl put in a rubber ink tube, and
another put a nib on, and so it went on, even to the testing.
For testîng, there were ten students at one table writing
and testing the pens. They tested not one but six or seven
pens at a time. The idea behind ail this was that the
students going into a factory lab like that would know
what the industrial process was all about, which seemed
to me to make a lot of sense.
( 1540)

Some very interesting things happened in Peking. I had
met Chou En-lai in New Delhi in 1956. Recognmzing how
busy the man is, I asked if there was a chance that I might
be able to cail and pay my respects, but I was told that
there was not; much chance. I was also told that we could
not see the University of Peking. I am sure that Senator
Haig and Senator Walker wiil be interested to learn that in
the library at the University of Peking there are 2.7 million books. Honourable senators wiil be horrified when I
tell them. that the stacks for them are ail wooden-wooden
stacks for 2.7 million books! I would have a nightmare
every night in case it burned. In the library you will find
the classics in English, French, German, Hindi, Japanese,
and so on. Senator Walker will be interested to know that
in that library I found a copy of Peter Newman's Renegade in Power. I have not seen Mr. Diefenbaker since my
return but I will tell him about it.
Hou. Mr. Imnor: How did their production compare?
Von. Mr. Cameran: Do you mean factory production?
Hon. Mr. Imnor: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Camneron: I would say that factory production
is not; as high as ours on a per capita basis, because they
are using in some cases hand labour, and in some cases
automatic and semi-automatic equipment, even sophisticated modern equapment. However, production is high.
In each of the factories we asked about absenteeismn and
they said they did not know the word; they said there was

SENATE DEBATES
no absenteeism. They were shocked when we told them
that on a Monday morning in the Ford factory in Detroit it
is not uncommon to find that 25 per cent of the workers
do not turn up. They said they do not have that problem;
that the people believe in what they are doing, and think
they are working for themselves. This is the motivation
they have.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: Do they have coffee breaks?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: They have tea breaks, but they do
not take the time for it to which we are accustomed. Tea is
served at the bench, and they take it there.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): What is the percentage of women employed?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: In some factories 50 per cent of the
workers are women. It is interesting to note that in one
large factory in Peking women were operating 100-ton
cranes. Cranes were operated by 17- and 18-year old girls.
A hydraulic press was being operated by a 17-year old
girl, who was operating a console almost as one would
play a piano. We were told that the girls were better than
men at operating this huge equipment, that they are a
little more sensitive in the way they can manipulate the
cranes to move the steel ingots, and so on. Women are on
an equal basis in the army, in the factories, in the homeeverywhere. In fact, I think the women run the place. The
Chinese grandmother always did, but they do it in a
different way now.
Two significant things happened while we were in
Peking. I have said that we hoped we could see the University of Peking and meet the Chancellor. I had hoped to
see Chou En-lai, but they said they did not think we could.
I was told, incidentally, that he gets from about two to
four hours sleep at night. He is an amazing man.
One of the weaknesses of the present system in China is
that the leadership is old. Chairman Mao is in his 79th
year. Chou Mo-Jo is 78, although he does not look anything like that. Chou En-lai is 73. The whole line of people
we know of are all in the senior age bracket. However,
they told us again and again that they have lots of competent young people coming along.
In talking to our ambassador about seeing the Vice
Foreign Minister I was told there was no chance of doing
so. To my surprise, at 10 o'clock one night I received a
telephone call saying that Comrade Chou Mo-Jo, the Vice
Chairman of the National People's Congress and also
Chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, would
see the Canadian parliamentarians at 10 o'clock the following morning. We had made some other arrangements,
but obviously we cancelled them.
That morning we were taken into the Pinetree Room,
which is a beautiful room in the People's Congress Hall. I
am sure Senator Benidickson and Senator Fergusson will
agree with me when I say, without any fear of contradiction, that the interior of the People's Congress Hall is
amongst the finest parliamentary buildings in the worldand I have seen most of them. It is a magnificent place.
We were there received by this courtly Chinese gentleman, Chou Mo-Jo, who served the inevitable pots of green
tea. He had his staff with him, and we spent two hours in
a question and answer session. One interesting thing he
said was, "If some of you have brought your tape record[Hon. Mr. Cameron.1

May 17, 1972

ers you may leave them on." Even in some Canadian
embassies you cannot do that.
What was significant was the warmth of the welcome to
Canadians. We spent an hour with Mr. Li Chang, the Vice
Minister of Foreign Trade, who is a much younger man
than Mr. Chou, and again the discussion was on potential
trade between Canada and China. We asked about the
wheat contract, and he said, "Don't worry. The wheat
contract will be continued. We are concerned that Canadians should buy more from us." We replied that we were
there to buy things. We had with us representatives of the
forest industries, retail industries, medicine, and manufacturers of such items as trailers, leather goods, and so
on.
One of the members of our delegation, Sandy Nicholson, who used to be in the other place, is sitting in the
gallery now. He had met Urban Guichon of Calgary, who
has a chain of leather goods stores, and who had a $600
hearing aid that went on the blink in Shanghai. In that
city he was able to get another hearing aid for $29, which
he wore all the time he was there. He said it worked as
well as his $600 one. Sandy Nicholson, who was representing the Co-operative Organization of Saskatchewan, said
he would like to make a contract to buy hearing aids for
the medical service in Saskatchewan. These are the kinds
of negotiations that can develop out of these private trade
and goodwill missions.
Another big wholesaler from Vancouver was looking
for textiles-cloths, tablecloths, linen, and so on-and
found he could get them for about one-third of what he
had to pay over here. He was trying to make a contract.
He may run into trouble with quotas; I do not know.
Another man bought 300 dozen leather belts made from
the hide of water buffalo. I cite these merely as examples.
We were trying to sell them sulphur. We told them that
we have got sulphur coming out of our ears in Calgary,
and would like to sell them some. However, they said they
did not need it; they did not need the kind of fertilizer for
which this sulphur is used at the present time. That is the
kind of exchange that went on.
In Canton we visited the Canton Commodities Fair,
which I had visited in 1966. It is a nine-storey building,
and at that time about 44 floors of it were filled with
exhibits of very high quality, but there was plenty of room
for more. This time every nook and cranny of the nine
floors of that building were filled. In addition, another
building nearby of about the same size was filled with arts
and crafts. When I got into that building I made it my
business to go through every floor and see every exhibit
that they had. At first I thought there were 20 exhibits for
every one they had in 1966, but my original estimate was
far too low.
* (1550)

Honourable senators, I am reminded that on the night
before we left Canton, the chairman of the fair gave a
banquet for the Canadians. I said to Mr. Peng Chin-Po,
the chairman, "You probably have 100 entries for every
one you had in 1956." He said, "We have more." They were
selling like mad. The Japanese were there in swarms. I
asked how many Americans there were, and he said there
were less than eight. I know that the Americans were

Mav 17. 1972

SENATE DEBATES

trying to get in there, but they were not particularly
welcome.
Incidentally, I will tell you of an incident that took place
in the conversation with Chou Mo-Jo. You must remember that he is the number three man in China. While
talking about China-American relations, he said, "Our
government gave a lot of consideration as to whether we
would extend an invitation to President Nixon to visit
China, and we came to the conclusion that, in the kind of
world we are living in, great powers must talk to each
other, regardless of whether they agree or not. So we
extended the invitation to President Nixon. He came here
and we had very full discussions, and we think this was a
good initiative on both sides-good policy." He also said,
and this is a direct quote, "We can only judge President
Nixon by his actions, and his actions are in direct contradiction to his words."
I have another quote related to that one. One of our
members who comes from Whitehorse has a big department store and also an agency for sporting rifles in the
whole of western British Columbia and Alberta. He was
trying to buy sporting rifles. I did not know that the
Chinese make one of the best sporting rifles in the world.
When we were talking to Chou Mo-Jo, I brought up the
matter of Canadians purchasing sporting rifles, and I
jokingly said, "How would you like to throw in some of
those A-27s the North Vietnamese are using?" He smiled
in a very gentle way, and said, "We do not sell rifles; we
give them to our friends." I never met a man who could
make significant statements more succinctly than Mr.
Chou Mo-Jo.
As I say, at the Canton Trade Fair, which is a tremendous exhibition, Canadians were there in substantial
numbers. The quality and sophistication of the goods was
a real eye opener to us. It was remarkable to see the
progress in six years. I do not intend to go into this any
more, but I want to say that, having had the opportunity
to visit China six years ago, I deliberately went back to
some of the same places that I had visited at that time. I
paid a visit to a rural commune that I had visited in 1966.
Again I saw the same raising of standards in housing and
in every aspect of life all over China.
Honourable senators, in conclusion, let me emphasize
the following points. First, I would say that Canada's
status among the Chinese is about the highest, certainly
among the western nations. There is a tremendous reservoir of good will, friendliness, and warmth there. None of
us will ever forget the warmth among the children as we
experienced it in the schools, and Senator Fergusson will
be speaking to you about that.
Secondly, we could certainly benefit by an exchange of
medical personnel, particularly in the fields of acupuncture anaesthesia and in herbal medicine. Most Canadian
universities today are doing some teaching about this kind
of medicine. They are sending people away to study it.
But there is a tremendous amount of exploration to be
done yet on herbal medicine and the acupuncture technique of anaesthesia which is almost a revolution in medical thinking and medical training.
The Chinese are the first to admit that they do not
understand it all, but it is leading to a whole new field in
the study of the brain, one of the neglected areas in our

medical schools. That is not because we have not wanted
to study the brain, but because it is so sensitive and so
delicate that we have been afraid to go into it in depth.
They are now exploring it. I suggest we should encourage
this exploration and exchange medical personnel. We
should encourage also the exchange of teachers. We could
learn some things from them and they, I think, could learn
some things from us.
I am sure it will be very beneficial if we can arrange an
exchange of oil field personnel, and I think that here we
can give them more than they can give us. We can easily
arrange it because I know that all the oil people in the
west would welcome a delegation of Chinese oil men.
We could go through the whole spectrum of technology,
and we might be able to offer the Chinese skilled technical people and consultants, but we must never forget what
these people replied when we asked them, "How would
you like to have some Canadian technologists in some of
these areas?" They said, "We do not want your technologists. Send us your blueprints. We will not accept outside
help. We may progress more slowly by doing everything
ourselves, but we will be more self-reliant by depending
on our own resources."
Honourable senators, I would welcome the opportunity
to tell you a little bit more about this mission, but time will
not permit. I intend to prepare a more detailed report on
it. I have about fifty pages written, and I will have another
twenty-five. I do not know who will publish it, if anyone
will, but it will tell the story of a remarkable regeneration
of a very great country.
It seems to me that it is important to Canada that more
Canadians go and see for themselves. That was the purpose of this educational adventure-because that is what
it was. I have seen these things for myself, but I think it is
important that more people should go and see for themselves. I know that some people may say, "Senator Cameron has been brainwashed," but if a group of Canadian
businessmen, of free enterprise types, were to go over and
see for themselves what has happened, they could not
help but be impressed.
We have a lot to learn from the Asian peoples, and not
just from the Chinese, because the same thing is going to
happen in India, though it will take a longer time; and the
same thing will happen in Indonesia, and in the whole of
southeast Asia.
Today, three out of four people are living in that part of
the world. We have to understand that. The markets are
there. We have got to explore them. But in terms of
common sense, in terms of international understanding,
we must expand our contacts with these people, and
Canadians will find the hand of friendship everywhere.
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Fergusson, debate adjourned.

FISHERIES
BAN ON COMMERCIAL FISHING OF SALMON-ECONOMIC
EFFECTS ON NEW BRUNSWICK-DEBATE CONCLUDED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Burchill, calling the
attention of the Senate to the serious effects on the econo-

my of New Brunswick and especially of Northern New
Brunswick of the recently announced ban on the commercial fishing of salmon.
Hon. Charles McElman: Honourable senators, I believe
that Senator Burchill has done a service in bringing this
question before the house.
0 (1600)

It is not my intention to delay you too long, but I do wish
to commend Senator Burchill and Senator Molson for the
excellent speeches they have made and for the information they have placed before this house and the public. It
is a veritable fund of information concerning the Atlantic
salmon and the fact that this magnificent fish is currently
in danger of becoming extinct.
I believe this house acted wisely yesterday in giving
unanimous approval to the resolution proposed by Senator Burchill and supported by Senator Molson. The representatives of Canada who will very shortly be attending
the meetings of ICNAF in Washington on the northwest
Atlantic fishery will be strengthened in their proposals to
that body by the resolution that was unanimously
approved by our two Houses of Parliament.
One can hope that Canada will be able on this occasion
to convince all members of ICNAF of the immediate
danger of extinction to the species, a danger that has been
caused primarily by the exploitation of the salmon feeding waters of Greenland.
Other honourable senators have dealt chapter and verse
with the details of that exploitation. Repetition would
serve little purpose at this time. It is sufficient to state that
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

,_

DEBATF.S

e.,

.f,1'109naSA,

this high seas fishery was exploited to a total of 5.8 million
pounds of salmon in 1971 where only five years ago there
was no commercial catch of salmon.
The effect upon the migratory runs of mature salmon to
North America, the Atlantic coast and the spawning
rivers and streams has been drastic indeed. If it is continued, extinction of the species would seem to be assured.
Surely men and nations of reason-which certainly
include the Danes, the Faroese, the Norwegians and the
West Germans-wll accept an immediate and total ban of
this high seas fishery in order that the superb fish may
return to its spawning waters and propagate the species to
its former teeming millions in the streams of Atlantic
North America, the British Isles and western Europe.
This is but one aspect of the problem. If we are to be
totally honest and practical, honourable senators, we
must realize that discontinuance of the Greenland fishery
is but one of the steps to be taken if we are to protect the
Atlantic salmon. That essential step requires international
agreement and co-operation, factors which are not totally
within our control and not always easily come by.
There are, however, other essential remedial steps and
measures for the preservation of this magnificent fish
that are totally within our own jurisdiction and control.
We must recognize them and we must take action without
further delay.
I believe we are fortunate at this particular time to have
as Minister of the Environment responsible for Fisheries a
man of the calibre of the Honourable Jack Davis. He has a
brilliant mind. He is capable of assessing the facts of the
situation, if he is given all the facts. He has the foresight
and determination to reach policy decisions that are
beneficial to the environment and to Canadians generally,
whether or not they are received in a popular fashion by
the public. He also has the intestinal fortitude to withstand bad publicity and emotional pressures, if he knows
that his decisions are right for the environment and for
the public. I repeat that we are fortunate that he is the
minister at this time.
Canada is trying very hard to overcome the effects of
decades of carelessness in the use of its land, water, air
and natural resources. Let me tell you what has taken
place in the past 20 to 25 years to some of the most
beautiful rivers in the world. We all know that some of
those rivers were along the Atlantic seaboard of the New
England states. These rivers have been turned into open
sewers by industry, with the tacit approval of government. They were once teeming with salmon and trout and
were the boyhood swimming holes of thousands of Americans now living, whose sons and daughters and grandsons
and granddaughters have no access to them because of
the extreme pollution.
It seems that we have not learned much by their experience. New Brunswick has been known as the home of
salmon and trout for its thousands of pure water streams
and scores of fast-moving rivers, but it is becoming a
diminishing retreat for those species. Except for five war
years, I have lived my lifetime in Fredericton on the
banks of the Saint John River. The Saint John River has
often been referred to as the Rhine of America, a reference that was made because of its great beauty and its
resemblance to the Rhine. In more recent years, however,

Mav 17 1972
1972

May17

SENATE DEBATES

its resemblance to the Rhine has been more associated
with pollution by industry and municipal waste. The Saint
John River, where I learned to swim and spent many
happy hours of my youth and which was the principal
domestic water supply for the capital city of Fredericton
such a very few years ago, is now unfit even for
swimming.
As I drove to the airport this week I traversed the
highway along this river for a distance of about eight
miles. The river is now in spring flood. As I drove along I
saw that it was literally covered with great patches of
white foam to a depth of a foot or so. This was the result
of up-river industrial wastes which had been fluffed up by
their passage through the Mactacquac hydro-electric dam
about 16 miles above the city.
Honourable senators, in my own time the Saint John
River was, if not the best, one of the best salmon rivers in
the whole world. I can recall, of a weekend, a series of
four pools just five miles above the city of Fredericton
which would produce 100 to 125 salmon. There was the
odd grilse, but for the most part these were the spawning
type of salmon. That situation has changed dramatically.
Salmon runs on this river have been declining for the past
20 years. Three power dams have been built along the
river. One was built at the Tobique Narrows. Tobique is
one of the river's principal tributaries and is probably one
of the best spawning streams to be found anywhere in
North America. A second dam was built at Beechwood
and a third at Mactacquac. Industrial and municipal pollution have increased year by year, adding to the summer
stench of the head ponds above these dams.
Although we have had our problems with the Danes on
the high seas, we must admit that the Danes have had
nothing to do with what has been going on in the Saint
John River. I think we must not let ourselves focus entirely on this admittedly very serious situation with the Danes
to the extent that we will forget about what is happening
within our own country and within our own control.
* (1610)

During the past several years both commercial and
sport salmon fishing have been curtailed by federal regulations on the Saint John River system. This year a total
federal ban on both commercial and sport salmon fishing
has been enunciated by the federal authority. It is a necessity due to man's wasteful lack of foresight. Where once
the annual run of salmon on that river was calculated in
the millions it is now down to the hundreds. Several years
ago when the Mactacquac hydro-electric project was
about to get under way, the federal authority, realizing the
effect that this would have upon the diminishing salmon
runs, demanded that a fish hatchery should be built just
below the dam for the purpose of trying to save and
rehabilitate the run of fish on that river.
The government of the province, the federal authority
and the crown corporation, the New Brunswick Electric
Power Commission, agreed upon this. The power commission paid the shot and they got from Japan, from our own
west coast and east coast, from Scandinavia and from
Europe generally all the technological information available. As a result they have built what is said to be the
most up-to-date salmon hatchery in the world. I believe it
exceeds even those in Sweden, referred to by Senator

Carter yesterday, in its expectations. It is just coming to
the point of return of the fish that have been grown there
for the last several years and that have been released to
sea. Biologists believe that they can bring the Saint John
River back to the state where it will become once again
one of the major salmon rivers in Atlantic Canada.
The mature fish are caught at the dam, the roe is taken
from the female fish and the milt from the male fish.
After fertilization has taken place they are raised through
to the smolt stage before they are released from the hatchery. The fish not required for this purpose are taken by
special tank truck some 60 miles upriver above the three
dams, to the watershed where they are released for natural spawning. It has now been determined that the smolt
coming from this natural spawning on the Tobique are
navigating the three head ponds and are actually getting
back to the Atlantic in great numbers, and the mortality
rate going through the hydro dams is now estimated to be
of the order of 20 per cent whereas initially it was suggested that it might be as high as 80 per cent. So something is
now being done to reclaim this river.
The industrial wastes of the forest industries and food
processing plants are being cleaned up and cleaned up
rapidly. But this has only been happening in very recent
years as well. The same thing applies to municipal sewage
treatment plants. The municipalities along the river, with
one or two exceptions, have in the last few years installed
treatment facilities. Perhaps my grandchildren wil have
the opportunity to enjoy the river as much as I did, an
opportunity which my own children have not had. The
steps taken thus far are very important, but continued
vigilance by both federal and provincial authorities will
certainly be required on a stream such as this to guard
against further pollution.
The St. Croix River in New Brunswick, at the international border with the State of Maine, was once a famous
salmon stream but it has been practically wiped out by
pollution. Currently the federal government together with
the Province of New Brunswick and the State of Maine
are attempting to clean up the decades of residue of
pollution in the river and to reclaim it.
The Northwest Miramichi, probably the most famous
grilse river in the whole world, was literally wiped out for
a period of years-it is coming back now-by the development of mineral resources and because the forest industry, with no attention to conservation, cut to the shores,
bulldozed pools and generally made a mess of the river.
As I say, it is being brought back, but at tremendous cost
in terms of time as well as finances.
The South Renous River, a branch of the Miramichi, is
also a beautiful salmon river. I am sure that those of you
who have fished the east will recognize the names of these
rivers. The South Renous currently stands in danger of
serious damage to the fisheries by prospective development of mineral resources.
The main Southwest Miramichi River, which is without
question the finest salmon river left in the world today
both for the size of its runs and for its sporting capability,
has been seriously hurt in recent years by the effluent of
pulp and paper mills and also by mineral development.
Here again corrective measures are being taken, but that
is not enough. In the case of some of these rivers such as

376
the Nepisiguit, where the salmon run has been almost
totally wiped out because of mineral development, it may
be growing too late.
The point I wish to stress is that anyone who has
enjoyed a Saint John harbour salmon with fiddleheads,
and knows what a delicious dish it is or any person who
has enjoyed angling for Atlantic salmon-and here I
would mention that it is not a battle for supremacy but
rather is it something beautiful to participate in-should
support all government measures now being taken and
those which many of us must continue to demand year by
year until this resource can be returned to its former
state.
* (1620)

During the last week of April at Chatham, New Brunswick, the Honourable Jack Davis and a number of his
officials met with the commercial salmon fishermen to
discuss the total ban on commercial salmon fishing which
had just been announced. They also discussed methods of
compensation which would be utilized to help those who
desired to get out of the industry because it was declining.
They discussed the matter of buying their gear, equipment, boats, and so on, at their cost and not at the
depreciated value. They talked with those who wished to
retain their licence even though they could not fish for a
period of time. This was an endeavour to compensate
them for their three best years out of the last six years.
There was an audience of some 800 people in the hall,
many of whom were commercial fishermen. They showed
a surprising degree of restraint. These were men who had
families and they faced the possibility of being wiped out
in an industry which they and their forbears had been
involved for many generations. There was great emotion
in the hall. With one or two exceptions, this was a very
good hearing. The minister was calm and cool and he
handled himself in an excellent manner. This is the type
of situation we hear so much about on radio and television in these troubled times. There could have been violence at this meeting. Fortunately, there was not.
The minister committed the Government of Canada to
generous payments of compensation. I would urge that he
now ensure that his officials carry out that commitment to
the letter. At meetings which have since taken place
between the officials and the commercial fishermen, the
fishermen have not been at all happy with the progress
which has been made. I would hope that the minister
would personally remain involved in this situation. I think
it is awfully important that he get involved. If he does, I
am confident his commitments will be carried out and the
fishermen will receive fair treatment.
I hesitate to go very far afield in this area, but those of
us from the Maritimes who have followed the problems of
the Atlantic fisheries are convinced that policy decisions
of recent years have not been good policy decisions. The
ministers have made decisions on the basis of some
extremely bad advice from senior officials who apparently did not understand the problems, particularly the problems of salmon fishermen.
Let me give you an example. A regulation was promulgated by the regional office in Halifax that angling for
salmon must stop at 6 p.m. on Sundays. This regulation
has been in effect for the last two years. Any person who
[Hon. Mr. McElman.]

has fly-fished for salmon will quickly realize the idiocy of
such a regulation. There are three hours of daylight
remaining and, as I am sure Senator Molson will agree,
the prime time for salmon angling is relatively early in the
morning and very late in the afternoon or early evening.
An angler who had hooked a fish at ten minutes to six had
either to land his fish by six o'clock-it is very difficult to
land a fish in ten minutes when fishing from a canoe-or
to cut the fish loose and discontinue the fight. If you
continue the fight it might take anywhere from one to two
hours, depending on the size of the fish. Despite the fact
that representations were made to Halifax, the regulation
remained in effect.
As if that was not bad enough, a new regulation was
promulgated covering all waters in New Brunswick, and
this regulation reaches the height of silliness and stupidity. Although this regulation came out of Halifax, the minister must take responsibility for it. The bag limit per day
was two fish. One could be a grilse which would be under
six pounds, and the other a salmon. How in the world an
angler would know what he had on the end of his line or
how big it was I do not know. However, the officials
maintained it was a sensible regulation. Numerous
representations have been made to the minister and he
has recently overruled the decision of the officials and the
regulation now reads "two fish of any size." So you will
not need scuba diving gear in order to go under water to
determine what you have on the end of your line.
Commercial salmon fishermen are facing a total ban. I
am sure most of them realize it is a serious situation and
are prepared to accept it so long as they receive fair
compensation. If the minister personally gets involved in
the situation to ensure that the bureaucracy and red tape
does not interfere and slow or stop the process, I am sure
the fishermen will receive fair compensation. The commercial fishermen have indicated that if they have to
make a sacrifice the angler should have to make some
sacrifice as well. I can appreciate their feelings. In practical terms, if would be more reasonable to reduce the daily
bag limit, which has already been reduced from four to
two fish per day, to one fish per day. In relation to the
total Atlantic salmon fishery catch, the angling take is
only about 2 per cent. In relation to the total Canadian
Atlantic salmon fishery, the angling take is approximately
5 per cent or slightly less.
* (1630)

I agree with commercial salmon fishermen that in the
current serious situation the angler should be called upon
to make a sacrifice. Our main purpose is to get as many
fish as possible to the upper regions of the spawning
streams. That could be accomplished without a total ban
on angling. In my opinion, it would be economic folly to
attempt a total ban, which would affect the income of
camping outfitters and suppliers, guides and others, to the
tune of several million dollars, and throw several hundred
people in New Brunswick into the ranks of the
unemployed.
Furthermore, I do not believe that the provincial government would agree to a total ban, and provincial government approval would be necessary before such a ban
could be effective. I therefore urge the minister responsible for Fisheries to reduce the bag limit to a daily catch

of it to Senator Burchill. They told me that what we call
Gaspé salmon, particularly salmon caught around Carleton, is more expensive on both the export and domestic
markets. Well, would you not think that the more expensive something is the better it is? I was told in the parliamentary restaurant just today, "This is not B.C. salmon; it
is Gaspé salmon."
Hon. Mr. McElman: I have no reservations in trying to
answer the honourable senator's question. The price of
Saint John Harbour salmon at the moment was the question asked. Well, there is no price unless it is a black
market price because there is a total ban on fishing in the
whole Saint John River system. This ban applies both to
commercial fishing and angling this year. It is a total ban.
If there is a price on Saint John Harbour salmon, then it is
a black market price which, of course, would be very
high. There probably is the odd fish floating about. In a
normal year Saint John Harbour salmon is the first fresh
Atlantic salmon on the market. It is known world-wide as
a fish delicacy with a special flavour.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: Since you once swam in that river I
have no doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. McElman: I have not swum in it since I was a
teenager. Unfortunately, it is not fit to swim in now.
Without question, the Saint John Harbour salmon is
touted by even the Canadian Tourist Bureau-not just the
New Brunswick Tourist Bureau-as one of the great fish
delicacies of the world. If you add to that just a wee bit of
fiddleheads, a touch of lemon, and a little egg sauceHon. Mrs. Quart: I am going to send you one of the
books from the tourist bureau so that you can see how
many wonderful recipes we have for our salmon. I am not
trying to start a controversy but I do believe that when
people buy salmon, especially smoked salmon, they try to
purchase salmon from Quebec around Carleton.
Hon. Mr. McElman: Just one further point. The Saint
John Harbour salmon are taken, as I said, early in the
year. There is no other salmon on the market at the same
time and, consequently, the price is the highest anywhere.
It is higher than the price paid later for Gaspésian
salmon. Gaspé salmon is on the market at a later time, so
the Saint John Harbour salmon is, without question, the
highest priced salmon on the market and has been down
through the years, but Gaspé salmon is delightful as well.
I have eaten it many times.
Hon. Mr. Molson: I wonder if the honourable senator
would permit one more question. I think we are all completely agreed that any ban or even any reduction of the
commercial take should be accompanied by full compensation for those affected. I am wondering if Senator McElman is suggesting that that principle be applied to anglers
if their take is further and substantially reduced? For
example, there are those who very recently bought, at
auction, stands in New Brunswick for fishing rights at a
cost of some millions of dollars. Do you think the Government of New Brunswick should refund any of that money,
or do you think that that might cause complications?
Hon. Mr. McElman: No, I do not see that it would,
Senator Molson. As you will recall, three years ago the
daily bag limit was reduced from four to two. On that
occasion there was no question by the outfitters in your
[Hon. Mrs. Quart.]

May 17.1972

province or in my province or, to my knowledge, in any
Atlantic province, that there be recompense to the leaseholders or the outfitters or any other person involved in
any sense. It is for that reason that I proposed the further
reduction of the daily bag limit from two to one. I do not
believe it would raise any more of a legal or other complication than did the reduction from four to two, but I do
believe that it would be a very serious matter if a total ban
were put on angling. I know in my own province that on
May 15 angling begins on the Miramichi and I need not
tell you of the numbers of fishermen involved both resident and non-resident, and I mean non-resident Canadians. It has often been said that on the average they pay
about $20 a pound for each fish caught. I do not believe
that estimate is at all high. I think it would be a mistake to
wipe out the angling altogether. The effect upon the
economy would be far greater than the wiping out of
commercial fishing. The provinces, I think I can say quite
directly, would not agree to it, and the federal government, because of split jurisdiction, would be making a
dreadful mistake if it tried to force the provincial government to wipe out angling.
Hon. Guy Williams: Honourable senators, I should like
to direct a question to the honourable senator. Before
doing so let me say that the Maritimes should take advantage of British Columbia's experiences in the matter of
conserving salmon. The Americans, who destroyed the
spawning areas of the great Columbia River, have
brought back the Cohoe salmon in tremendous numbers,
to the extent that we are now having problems with them,
though the Canadian fishermen are outfishing the Americans on the high seas.
* (1650)

I think one thing has been overlooked in this debate.
Canada has the best biologists and scientists in the field of
fish, particularly salmon. This statement is not hard to
bear out. I have for many years sat in with our own
fisheries department in negotiations with Japan, the
United States and Russia. The Russians go in for the
artificial rearing of salmon, and they are very successful
at it. In America the answer is in spawning areas. The
Americans even have portable spawning boxes, as they
refer to them, and our fisheries department is now experimenting with them, although they quote the tremendous
price of $2,000, whereas the Americans quoted me $15.
This method is working.
It appears to me that man himself has overburdened the
spawning areas with a technology that is not of the best
kind for the survival of salmon in the Maritimes. We have
experienced this in British Columbia. At times, the herring seine fisheries on our coast have taken young salmon
along with the herring. Knowing that some of our own
fishermen in the Maritimes are now using seine herring
fisheries, I am wondering if the smolts, or the young
Atlantic salmon, are being taken by this type of fishery at
certain times of the year.
Hon. Mr. McElman: To the best of my knowledge, no.
The feeding ground is quite different from that of the
herring. It moves to the deeper water much farther than
the herring fishery.

Hon. Mr. William.: I should have said on their migration routes to the ocean.
Hon. Mr. McElman: It is possible, but I have neyer heard
of it, and I think I would have because of My close interest
in this subject and my liaison with people in fisheries.
The. Hon. th. Speaker: This item is considered debated.

CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL, 1972
FIRST READING
Hon. the. Speaker informed the Senate that a mesThe.
sage had been received from the House of Commons with
Bil C-2, to amend the Criminal Code and to make related
amendments to the Criminal Code 1967 Amendment Act,
the Criminal Records Act, the National Defence Act, the
Parole Act and the Visiting Forces Act.
Bil read first time.
Hon. Mr. Martin moved, with leave of the Senate, that
the bil be placed on the Orders of the Day for second
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, may I propose that this may be an opportune moment for us to
adjourn until approximately eight o'clock this evening.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What for?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I will explain when Mix. Speaker
has put the motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed that the Senate
should now adj ourn during pleasure?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would like to hear why? It is an
unusual procedure.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, I think a
word of explanation is in order at this moment. The very
best information I can get from the other place is that the
Old Age Security bill will be available to this house at
about 5.15 this afternoon. It has been delayed 15 minutes
in the last haîf-hour, but I am certain that we will receive
the bil before six o'clock today. This would not give us
time to deal with it before dinner, and that is why I have
asked that we come back at eight o'clock tonight to proceed with it. I am sure that ail of us want to see this bill
and the other one for which we have been waiting, that
concerning veterans' pensions, dealt with as quickly as
possible by this chamber. We hope to proceed with the
Old Age Security bull this evenîng.
Hou. Mr. Flynn: Does the deputy leader understand that
to proceed tonight requires unanimous consent?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Not to give first reading to the bill,
but to introduce it to the house.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: First reading agreed, but to proceed
with second reading would require unanimous consent.
Hon. Mr. McDonaid: I understand that.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I suggest that we are flot gaining
anything by coming back at eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Lcand: We would have first reading.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We can have first reading tnmorrow.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I realize that we require leave of
the Senate in order to proceed after first readmng. Whether
or flot we get leave is, of course, up to individual senators.
However, I believe we should use every opportumty to
proceed as rapidly as possible. We can have first reading
this evening, and it would be my hope that we could get
leave to proceed further. We will use whatever methods
are available to us and proceed as rapidly as possible.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I simply want to add to what was said
by the Leader of the Opposition. If leave, under the rules,
were to be accorded to proceed with second reading
tonight, I would be prepared to explain the bill. I can well
understand the desire ta examine some features of the
bil. That could be done perhaps tomorrow. 1 think it will
be the desire of ail of us, regardless of where we sit, that
there be no delay in giving the old age pensioners
increases, and likewise the war veterans, whose pensions
will be increased. by the other bill. That is the purpose. I
know that the Leader of the Opposition shares my view
that it is desirable to have these increases provided to the
pensioners and the war veterans as quickly as possible.
Hon. Mr. Flynn. We might as well have a little debate
about that to clarify the situation. As far as first reading is
concerned, as has been pointed out, no leave is required. I
told the Leader of the Government I would agree that first
reading and second reading be given tomorrow, so we are
not gaining anything, except we would listen to the
Leader of the Government tonight instead of tomorrow
afternoon. I therefore suggest that the Senate is not more
advanced in this way.
The second thing is that the Leader of the Government
has been putting pressure on me-and I am not revealing
any secrets, because it is obvious-to give leave, because
of the urgency of mailing the cheques to the old age
pensioners. He referred yesterday to the statement made
by Mr. MacEachen in the other place, and said at page 354
of Hansard:
There are two measures that the government is anxious to see deait with-the bull providing for increases
in the old age security payments, and the bill providing for increases in veterans benefits. The June payment of the old age security benefits depends upon
passage by Friday, as the house Leader of the Government in the other place indicated on Wednesday last.
I refer honourable senators to the answer given in the
other place last Wednesday. The Leader of the Government there said that the bill had to receive royal assent by
last Friday.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Oh, no.
( 1700)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Oh well, I will quote, then, if my honourable friend does not believe me. I will quote from
Hansard of the House of Commons of May 10.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, May 10, page 2128.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Martin: It is at the bottom of the page.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is May 10. It says:
I am advised that if these increases are to be in their
June cheques and in the hands of the pensioners by
the end of June, it would be necessary to have the bill
passed by the end of next week.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is this week. This Friday.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He said, by the end of this week.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Next week.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I do not know if it was changed, but I
read "... by the end of next week." I do not agree with
this, for the very good reason that if we pass the bill on
Friday night, Saturday, Sunday and Monday being holidays, nothing can be done on those three days. If we were
to proceed with this bill and have it given royal assent on
Tuesday, there would be only one day lost. The Leader of
the Government cannot convince me that one day will
make a difference in the expedition of these cheques. So,
before I give consent, I want to hear from somebody from
the Treasury Board about the procedure on these
cheques. If the honourable Leader of the Government
wishes to call the committee tomorrow and have someone
from Treasury Board come and explain the procedure to
us, we will see what we can do. But again I think we are
not gaining anything by sitting tonight.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am grateful to
Senator Flynn for saying that he would agree that tomorrow we could have first reading and second reading. I
take it that this commitment would apply to all of us, that
there would be no one who would take exception to that.
I say I would take it that the commitment that Senator
Flynn has just made now would apply to the Senate as a
whole, that there would be no one who would take advantage of the situation, that all senators would agree to
second reading tomorrow. We could send the bill to the
committee and we would call the officials and let the
officials deal with this very point that Senator Flynn has
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would like the Leader of the Government to move tonight that this question of urgency be
referred immediately to a committee tomorrow morning,
so that we would know why we are asked to give leave to
proceed so quickly with this and whether the contention
that royal assent has to be given by Friday is really
correct.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not think that is a fair thing. I
think we will deal with the bill. We will have first reading,
second reading, and send the bill to committee. If the
committee is not satisfied, it can examine the officials on
that point as part of the whole consideration of the bill. I
think that is the way to do it. If that were agreeable, I
would be willing to entertain the suggestion.
My honourable friend and I have had talks. I am sure he
shares the view that it is desirable that we have these
increases and that we take no chances in making sure that
we pass this bill by the end of the week.
I have looked at the time that was spent in the other
place on this bill. It was not much more than two days.
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

They had all sorts of interventions in the other chamber.
They took only three-quarters of an hour in their committee. All parties in the House of Commons were anxious to
see the matter disposed of there as quickly as possible. I
am sure that none of us in this place would want to do
anything that would in any way jeopardize the passage of
this measure by this Friday.
The bill is a simple one. It simply provides for increases
in the escalation clause, greater application of the escalation clause. It provides for an increase in the guaranteed
income supplement, in the basic pension. That is what it
does. The Senate will not want to be an obstacle to a
measure that will benefit millions of our senior people
and one which has been passed by the other chamber.
If it can be understood that we would give it first and
second readings tomorrow and send it to committee, I
would undertake that one of the very first witnesses
would be the person who would deal with the question
raised by Mr. MacEachen when he said:
It is understood that all members want to have these
pension increases in the hands of the pensioners as
early as possible. I am advised that if these increases
are to be in their June cheques and in the hands of the
pensioners by the end of June, it would be necessary
to have the bill passed by the end of next week.
The "end of next week" is Friday, when we would get
royal assent, assuming passage of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Royal assent on Friday night.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The thought was to have it at 5.45 p.m.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If I am correct, the other house sits only
until five o'clock on Friday.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think they can always agree to have a
quorum.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Anyway, with this undertaking of the
Leader of the Government that in committee on FridayHon. Mr. Martin: Or on Saturday morning.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: -a departmental official will explain
why it is necessary to deal with the bill quickly, but I do
not like the Senate to be a rubber stamp. We have only
been given this intimation that if the cheques are late it is
because the Senate is proceeding in its normal way.
Hon. Mr. Martin: No. Of course, they cannot blame us.
Honourable senators, depending on the discussion
tomorrow, perhaps we could get the bill to committee
sometime late tomorrow. I will undertake that the first
item will be to have the officials deal with this problem.
On that understanding, would that be agreeable to the
Leader of the Opposition?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I have stated my position clearly. I will
not object to first reading being given and to proceeding
with second reading. I do not say that we are going to
discuss it all day tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But I will not object to second reading
being proposed and the debate started tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think that is fair enough. I am not
suggesting that my honourable friend shçuld curtail the
debate.

Copies of a Report of the Commission of Inquiry

COUNCIL OF EUROPE
THIRD PARLIAMENTARY AND SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE
AT LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND

Hon. Allister Grosart rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Third Parliamentary and Scientific Conference of the
Council of Europe held at Lausanne, Switzerland, in
April, 1972.
He said: Honourable senators, I have the privilege at
this time, to report to you on the Third Parliamentary and
Scientific Conference of the Council of Europe, which
was held last month in Lausanne, Switzerland.
I attended in the company of Mr. Ian Watson, the
member for Laprairie, Québec, who was representing the
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Council. It was my privilege to represent the Special Senate Committee on
Science Policy. The majority of those in attendance were
distinguished European parliamentarians, scientists,
science managers and administrators, and industrialists.
Among the outsiders, if I may use that term, including
Mr. Watson and myself, were the Honourable James Symington, known to many honourable senators as a very
important member of the United States House of
Representatives' Committee on Science and Aeronautics,
and Mr. Takao Fujimoto of the House of Representatives
of Japan. As I said, the majority of those who were in
attendance, some 150 of them, were Europeans.
I have prepared a written report for the Senate. Rather
than read it, I will ask permission to have it printed as an
appendix to our proceedings.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators,
that this report be printed as an appendix to Hansard?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(Fortext of report see appendix, pp. 413-15.)
Hon. Mr. Grosart: If I may, honourable senators, I will
take a few moments of your time to run over some of the
highlights of the conference.
The conference lasted five days and was held at Lausanne. If any honourable senator has the responsibility
for arranging a conference at any time in April, I would
strongly recommend Lausanne. In April, Lausanne is a
place where the flowers and shrubs are in blossom and
the vineyards are beginning to green, and the young ladies

are putting on their fashionable, if at times somewhat
abbreviated, spring apparel.
The President of the Council, Mr. Olivier Reverdin, has
particularly asked me to convey his respects to His
Honour the Speaker, Senator Deschatelets, of whom he
has fond memories and for whom he has a high regard.
You will recall that the executive committee of the Consultative Assembly, in an unprecedented move, held one
of its meetings here in Ottawa some time ago. Speaker
Deschatelets played a significantly important role in that
successful conference.
My general report to you, honourable senators, would
be to say that the papers, oral presentations, discussions,
and conclusions of the conference reflected, in general,
the same kinds of problems that we have been having in
science policy in Canada. It is true that in Canada we
came to a serious consideration of national science policy
somewhat later than the majority of the older European
countries and Japan, but we seem to have made up in
intensity what we have lacked so far in maturity in the
problem of developing a national science policy.
One of the highlights of the conference, which I found
rather unusual, was that those of us who were outsiders, if
I may again use that term, were specifically asked to
present any amendments or addenda to the draft conclusions that we thought might be worth consideration by the
conference.
Mr. Watson reflected very much the overall theme of the
conference, which was the responsibility of parliamentarians to inform themselves about science policy and to take
control over technology because, as was said over and
over again, if parliamentarians do not take control of
technology then technology will take control of the world
in a way that will lead to a catastrophe in the lifetime of
many who are still here. In the light of that Mr. Watson
presented an addendum to the draft conclusions suggesting that the Council take the initiative in organizing a
sophisticated data bank of science policy information,
and to arrange for an outflow from that data bank to
parliamentarians in all countries.
Congressman Symington added the suggestion, which
again was favourably accepted, that there be organized in
Europe a European Science Foundation. It is rather
remarkable that in the many efforts, some of them successful, made by the European countries to integrate their
policies in science, they have not, up to this time, established a European Scientific Foundation. This again
reflects something of our own problem in Canada,
because I well remember that when we began our considerations in the Special Senate Committee on Science
Policy we were amazed to find that Canada was one of the
few comparable countries in the world that had nothing
like a national association for the advancement of science
or a national academy. While an effort is now being made
to establish an organization that might satisfy some of the
criteria, we are still a long way from having in Canada a
national science academy.

(1410)

On behalf of the Special Senate Committee on Science
Policy I took the liberty of introducing two addenda. The
first called for early visibility of the science budget in all
countries. The purpose was to form a basis for consideration by Parliament of national science policy. At present
Canada does not have this. This resolution was accepted,
and it urged that the total science spending of the federal
government or any government be collated and made
visible before any commitments are made.
About a year ago, our science secretariat collected this
information from the Estimates so we now have an ex
post facto visible science budget, but only long after commitments have been made. The purpose of this resolution
was to suggest that the point of visibility be moved up so
parliamentarians would be in a position to examine
national science policy in any one year before it became
effective. The most heavily stressed theme of the entire
conference was this responsibility of parliamentarians to
examine their national science policy.
My second addenda suggested the formation of an
International Science and Technology Union of parliamentarians, and was accepted as a Council initiative.
I am happy to report that there is considerable interest
and awareness in Europe of Canadian science achievements. There was a favourable comment regarding Canada's breakthrough in laser technology, the TEA generation of lasers. The credit goes to the Defence Research
Establishment at Valcartier and later, during the second
generation, to the National Research Council. A very high
tribute was paid to what was described as the Canadian
initiative in instituting the National Development
Research Centre in Montreal. The conference moved that
the Assembly of the Council of Europe examine this carefully with a view to setting up an analogous institute in
Europe. The purpose of that institute would be to develop
an international base for scientific capacity and capability, particularly to deal with the problems of science and
technology which concern developing nations.
I indicated earlier that the main topic discussed, largely
in the European context, reflected our own problems in
Canada. The most important question confronting human
beings which was posed throughout the conference was
whether technology can develop answers to its own problems, problems which it creates. It was repeated several
times by students of the problem that technology is progressing at a faster rate than scientific, industrial, and
other institutions can cope with it.
The conference was held in the climate of the recent
sensational document issued under the auspices of the
Club of Rome and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Honourable senators will be aware of the farreaching conclusions contained in that report, which are,
in effect, that we on this planet face catastrophe in the
year 2000.
There are two schools of thought on this. There is a
controversy now raging all over the world among those
who are informed on the whole problem of science policy.
On the one hand, there are those who say it is hopeless,
that man has dug his own grave, that there is no way we
can cope with problems of population explosion, urbani-

zation, pollution, and destruction of the ecology. On the
other hand, there are those who say that technology can
and will cope with these problems, as it has in the past.
In that connection, it is interesting to recall that about
the year 1830 a paper was presented to a learned society
in England pointing out that it was impossible for the City
of London ever to reach a population of one million,
because there would be no place to put all the horses and,
even if they did find a place for the horses, London would
be smothered in horse manure.
Similarly, about 1865, when the rifle first came into
general use, a paper was presented to a French learned
society pointing out that it was a great achievement
because it automatically meant the end of wars on this
planet; that with the high rate of fire, the tremendous
killing power, and the range of the rifle as compared with
the musket, there was no way that a battle could last for
more than 10 minutes, that if the rifle were used everyone
would be killed.
We have a reflection of that in the comment by Sir
Winston Churchill that nuclear weapons had brought
about that kind of situation in the world. There is perhaps
some evidence that this might be so. One can only hope
that this is the result at last of technological developments
in weaponry.
We were meeting also in the climate of the new concept
of "zero growth." I am sure honourable senators are
aware that there are prominent economists, particularly
social economists, in the world today who have reached
the conclusion that we have to stop growth. It is sometimes called the anti-GNP cult.
At first look, it would seem easy to liken it to what
Congressman Symington referred to as a product of the
"echo freaks." There is no question that there are echo
freaks, crackpots, talking catastrophe.
On the other hand, there are many serious-minded, wellequipped, and well-informed scientists of various disciplines who seriously advocate a low-growth policy for the
world. At first look, it is hard to see how this could be
made to work, in view of the fact that on the national level
in Canada and elsewhere the whole thrust of our policies
is towards economic growth, if for no other reason than,
as far as most of us can see at present, there is no way of
providing for the social requirements of any community
in the world today except through the resources produced
by economic growth.
* (1420)

I leave any further consideration of that to honourable
senators to reflect upon. I mention it only because it was a
theme recurring throughout the discussions. I should also
say, perhaps, that in some conclusions reached there
seemed to be a rather high level of endorsement of many
of the positions that have been taken by our own committee in its reports. There was reference to the fact that we
have an extraordinary track record in that committee of
acceptance and implementation by the government of
suggestions coming out of our proceedings, and recommendations that are found in our report. I refer to the
principle of contracting out research and development to
industry, the development of an industrial strategy for
Canada which we seem to be on the verge of, and the

emphasis we have placed in our committee reports and in
this chamber on technical assessment and technical forecasting regarding the kinds of problems that we may be
facing in the near future.
I was able to report that this Senate has taken the lead
among parliaments of the world in authorizing one of its
committees to call a conference, the object of which
would be to establish in Canada a National Commission
on the Future. From the evidence I heard there I think it
is quite safe to say that more than one important parliament in the world will be following the lead taken by the
Senate of Canada in that respect.
I also feel that my report would not be adequate if I did
not report to honourable senators that one of our members, Senator Lamontagne, has established himself
around the world as one of the international wise men of
science.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I noted with the greatest pleasure,
whenever I spoke with scientists, science administrators,
and science policy-makers, that invariably the name of
Senator Lamontagne came up, not always directly in connection with what are now universally referred to as the
Lamontagne Reports, but also in relation to the other
work he has done and the distinction he has brought to
this chamber and to Canada in establishing his place in
this very select company. It is my own view that only one
other Canadian has been generally accepted into that
select company, and that is Dr. O. M. Solandt, the recently
retired President of the Science Council.
It is perhaps interesting that these two distinguished
Canadians in this field are not always in agreement on the
future direction of our science policy. I, for one, am not
greatly alarmed or concerned about this. I feel it is a good
thing that we have two eminent students of the problem
disagreeing at times, but who very often find themselves
in general agreement as to what the future course of
Canadian science policy should be.
Honourable senators, I conclude my remarks by saying
that the evidence at the conference and the evidence I
have seen elsewhere seems to me to indicate that we can
look forward with considerable optimism to the future,
believing that technology can cope with its own problems.
We know from the evidence around us, in Canada and
elsewhere, of pollution, to mention one aspect, of urbanization, to mention another, that technology in our day, by
our decision, will be either the monster or the miracle of
human intelligence on this planet.
The Hon. the Speaker: This inquiry is now considered as
having been debated.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
NOTICE OF COMMITTEE MEETING-QUESTION
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, may I ask the
government leader what would happen with respect to the
meeting of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign
Affairs next Tuesday if in the meantime Parliament was
dissolved?
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

Hon. Mr. Martin: I think under the rules it could not
meet. I do not suppose the committee could meet if that
happened. I am not saying it will happen. I am not saying
it will not happen either.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I was not expecting you to tell me.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It was a good try.
THE ECONOMY
EFFECT OF HIGH RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND
INFLATION-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Welch, calling the attention of the Senate to the high rate of unemployment and
inflation and the way in which they presently affect the
economy of Canada.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable Senator Langlois.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I yield to the honourable Senator
Smith.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, I thank Senator Langlois for yielding to me, although I hope honourable senators do not expect me to be bilingual.
I was interested in the remarks of Senator Welch, when
he introduced this subject yesterday. I was equally interested in the off-the-cuff and spontaneous reply of Senator
Buckwold. After thinking it over last evening, and after
having an opportunity to examine the text of what Senator Welch said yesterday, I became convinced that it
would be appropriate to make additional comments on
this occasion. Therefore, I asked Senator Langlois if he
would yield to me.
This is a very interesting and vital subject, and I am
sure we welcome its introduction. I only wish I had the
great skill of my colleague, Senator Buckwold, and was
able to make one of those spontaneous replies of which he
is capable, and to coin phrases on the spot that bite a little
harder than perhaps I intend to bite. Senator Welch, I
suppose, had some time in which to compose what he
said. His speech contained some exaggerations, which I
suppose can be called hyperbole-a word which I thought
I caught at one time. Politics is full of hyperbole, but it
does not disturb those of us who have been associated
with politics in one way or another for many years.
I have been a member of the Senate for nearly 17 years.
Perhaps some of my oldest friends here will have noticed
whether I have lost some of the partisanship I had when I
came to Ottawa to spend some years in the other place. I
had difficulty restraining myself when my good friend
touched on several subjects-and I want to interpolate
here that he is really a good friend. I have become well
acquainted with both Senator Welch and his wife over the
years, and we have a natural friendship for each other
because we are "all Nova Scotians together." I think that
was a phrase used by the owner and publisher of the
Halifax Chronicle-Heraldat one time, when he said he
would not criticize anyone, not even the Premier of the
province, because "we are all Nova Scotians together."
* (1430)

Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Welch is looking at you very
affectionately.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Smith: He has had his say, and I may irritate
him because he has no right of reply in this kind of
debate, although I noticed yesterday that he did rise with
leave. Surely he does flot have a right of reply, and surely
we are flot going to give him the right to do so "later this
day."
Honourable senators, I should like to become a littie
more serious on this, and say that there are several areas
which I think were flot covered fairly, and I would like to
speak for a few minutes on them.
I would say that our sound system does flot work too
well in certain areas of this chamber, and some of us in
this section had difficulty in hearing ail that Senator
Welch said, but as I read his speech this morning it
seerned to me that there are some parts that cali for reply.
Senator Welch is an old-fashioned Progressive Conservative. He thinks ail governrnents are horrible, and that
the goverinent should keep its nose out of the people's
business. That used to be a fashionable thing to say, and it
had a lot of merit, but 1 think it no longer has the same
quahity of menit that it used to have. If people from any
part of this country have any reason to approve of it, they
are the people of the region from which we corne, and
specifically the Province of Nova Scotia. When you protest the government's sticking in its nose and instituting
programs which they do flot know how to run, then you
are talking about DREE-the Departîùent of Regionai
Economic Expansion-and ail the things that DREE has
done to upgrade the economy of the Maritimes and Newfoundland over the last five years. DREE is a new
approach rather than a condensation or a bringing together of the various programs which were used to assist in
regional problema just a few years ago.
Let us get down to basics. For example, I wonder
whether the magnificent new addition to the Michelin tire
plant would be in existence today without that $8 million
grant given by DREE just a few weeks ago, and which
enables them to have an economnic operation in the town
of Bridgewater. Michelin has some problems today resuiting from the present policy of the United States. The
goverfiment of that country are rnaking noises which mndicate they may attempt to jump over the inhibitions presented by their membership in the Generai Agreernent on
Tariffs and Trade, and make it embarrassing or difficuit
for Michelin to export their produet into the United
States. I do not think they are going to, do it. I do flot think
they can take their place and live in a world where
expanded and liberalized trade is the one thing which will
Iead to worldwide prosperity more than any other factor.
I do not believe for a moment they are going to do it, and I
do not think Michelin is too worried about that.
Michelin built its factory at Bridgewater. I speak now of
an area where the people have excellent reputations for
being good workers. Quite a number of workers ini that
Lunenburg-Queens County area have been sent to Paris.
They were sent there a year ago, when the Michelin plant
was first conceived and was under construction, in order
to get training in the Michelin factory there. It is a secret
process, and they were carefully selected. I amn given to
understand they are more than satisfied-indeed, more
than happy-with the young labour force encountered in
25312-25

that part of Nova Scotia. I suppose the same can be said
of those in Pictou County.
I wonder how many fish plants we would have had
constructed in Nova Scotia in the last few years if it were
flot for DREE, and the organization that preceded DREE.
There have been enlargernents, one after the other, of
already established fish plants. Today, in rny area of Nova
Scotia, we have two of the largest self-contained fish
packing plants in the world. And I do not think the end
has yet corne. These fish plants have only one problem.
They are quite concerned about being able to keep up an
adequate supply of the basic product which they manufacture into various forms. They have been a great
success.
I have known people in the fishing business aIl my life,
and I have taiked to those who have now retired frorn
active participation in the fish business. AIl agree that the
time is long gone when that kind of business can exist
without the goverfiment "sticking its nose in." I do flot
think those are the exact words of Senator Welch, but that
is the meaning of what he said. There was a time when the
grandfathers of those people would be a little asharned, if
they had to seek goverirnent help to make the operation
of a fish plant in Nova Scotia successful. But that day is
gone. This is one of the finest investments the Canadian
taxpayers can make. Ail this money cornes back to the
federal treasury in due course.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Do you think you are right in saying ail
of this money cornes back? I think you would be more
accurate if you said part of this money cornes back.
Hon. Mr. Smith: I arn talking about the fish industry
right now and I repeatHon. Mr. Flynn: You used the word %ail.
Han. Mr. Smith: I arn talking about the very successful
plants, and there are quite a number of thern on the
south shore of Nova Scotia, where I live. Ail of this
money will eventually corne back to the national treasury.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is exaggeration.
Hon. Mr. Smith: It will corne back by way of taxation.
Some people think that taxation is so high.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not frorn the bankrupt organizations.
Hon. Mr. Smith: Perhaps I could just continue my chain
of thought. If there are any questions, I shail be glad to
deal with themn later. If you interrupt me now I shahl speak
for too long, and we may want to have royal assent tomorrow night.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Are you sure that is what you want?
Hon. Mr. Welch: I want to ask one question. Are you
replying to the remarks I made yesterday?
Hon. Mr. Smith: I amn replying to certain things that
were said.
Hon. Mr. Welch: If you are, why do you taik about
DREE? I did flot say anything about DREE. I taiked about
other things-monstrous things.
Hon. Mr. Smith: Just let me continue. I do flot think that
is a valid interruption. I will just quotà" one sentence from
the text I saw this morning:

SENATE DEBATES
Governments are creating far more problems than
they solve.
There is another passage, which I cannot find at this
moment but which in strong language said that the government should keep its nose out of the peoples' business.
Those are not the exact words, but that is my version of
them. There are many things in that speech that I do not
intend to reply to, but I am concerned about the kind of
thinking that is at the back of what my friend said.
Turning now from the fishing industry, I would urge
that we have more of these support programs and more
equalization grants. About 34 per cent of the income of
my own province comes from equalization grants. Let us
have more of them. Many millions of dollars have been
pumped into Nova Scotia to upgrade the highways, which
make it possible for Senator Welch to get home in half the
time he took just a few years ago; to build some bridges
up in his part of the country which were beyond the
capacity of the Province of Nova Scotia, with its tax base,
to construct. If that were not so, surely they would have
been constructed long ago during the great days of the
Stanfield administration.
It is this kind of thing I am talking about, and this is
because this government is sticking its nose in people's
business. I am all for it, and I wish there were more of it.
I am concerned about the general tone of Senator
Welch's remarks about this government having been such
a horrible government that the whole economy-this is
one phrase that I have underlined-was almost an "economic havoc." Well, I do not know who is creating all the
"economic havoc," but if there is economic havoc then I
should like to see more of it created in Nova Scotia.
The part of Nova Scotia from which I come is a beautiful place. Those of my friends and colleagues who have
visited there will agree with me on that score, I am sure. I
would point out that we have some healthy industries
there, industries that are very pleased to have the kind of
treatment they are getting frorn this government. I need
refer to only one, a company in my own home town which
employs a thousand men at a minimum wage of about $4
an hour. Last year that company operated at 92 per cent
capacity. That may not be the exact figure, but it is about
right. In the process of so doing they made less money
than they did the year before, but even so their after-tax
profit as declared just a very few days ago was over $1
million.
a (1440)

I have the definite understanding that the accelerated
depreciation available to manufacturing and processing
companies is a godsend to them. It will do several things
for them. For instance, when they need to replace old
machinery--machinery that is redundant-or revitalize
old machinery, they are able to do so because of the
accelerated depreciation, and that will help put them back
on a sound economic basis.
These measures will also enable them to make the
rather substantial expenditures for anti-pollution equipment necessary to clean up the beautiful harbour on
which the mill is situated. If they did not get that kind of
encouragement, it might be embarrassing.
[Hon. Mr. Smith.]

May 18, 1972

Above all, the advance notice to manufacturing and
processing companies that as of January 1, 1973, the corporation tax is going to be reduced to 40 per cent is one of
the greatest incentives there could be for increasing the
numbers of jobs, and maintaining the jobs that now exist,
in manufacturing plants all over this country, including
those in the province in which I live.
Honourable senators, I did not intend to get heated.
Perhaps if I had not been interrupted several times I
would not have spoken with what might be considered too
warm tones. I want you to know that I do not intend to be
too warm in this matter.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why not? Be yourself.
Hon. Mr. Smith: I have the quite worrisome feeling that
there could be someone in this chamber who would, not
just haphazardly but deliberately, choose from a large list
of local initiative programs that have been instituted in
this country frorn coast to coast, the relatively few with
kooky names and apparently kooky ideals. That someone
would do that without indicating exactly what use was
being made of the grants for those particular programs is
something I find hard to understand.
Hon. Mr. Welch: "Kooky names" and "kooky ideals"
pretty well describe them, don't they?
Hon. Mr. Smith: I wonder if I might continue without
being interrupted.
The Hon. the Speaker: I remind the bouse that any
honourable senator is permitted to ask a question of the
senator who bas the floor. That senator might decline to
answer, or might ask that the question be put at the end of
his speech. I believe it is better that we proceed in that
way. At least, it would make it much easier for the chair.
Hon. Mr. Smith: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Certainly, I
can answer questions at the conclusion of my speech, but
of course the more interruptions there are the longer I
shall be.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That suits the government leader
perfectly.
Hon. Mr. Smith: Recently, one of our colleagues inquired
as to the Opportunities for Youth Program in Nova
Scotia. From the list which was tabled, and from additional information I received, I prepared a memorandum
which I passed on to people I knew would be interested. It
was a list of those programs which have operated in the
south shore area of Nova Scotia.
Those of us who have anything to do with such matters
know that they are divided into two classes. First, there
are those projects which are applied for and operated by
municipalities. To cite some examples, the town of Lunenburg had two such projects. It received a total of $72,000
for doing work in the town, which resulted in 39 men
being employed during the winter and early spring
season. I would not want to tell them that that was a
kooky project. The town of Shelburne had two projects
that employed a total of 43 people, at a total cost of
$43,000. I would not want to tell them that that was not
money well spent.
The town of Lockeport had a $10,820 grant and
employed seven people. The municipality of Queens-that
is the rural area in which I live-employed 51 people for a

Mav 18.1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

total expenditure of $5 1,000. The town of Bridgewater had
$18,000, and there are other examples I could give.
I amn sure we cannot make a blanket criticism of LIP,
and not consider ail those very worthwhile projects.
Several years ago this side of the house was criticized
severely because of the cancellation of the old program of
winter works, but this present program is a f ar better
winter works program than we ever had before in our
history. It was initiated by the people who wanted
projects, and it was arranged by them. The money was
spent by them and the men were hired by the people
concerned. It was ail very productive. Jobs were created,
and people were taken off the welf are roils. Sorne of those
people would have been on welfare, and the others would
have been on unemployment insurance.
You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say, on the
one hand, that you are sick and tired of ail this welfare
and that people should be made to work for their living,
that the unemployment insurance is being squandered
and that the people who take it should be made to work,
and then, on the other hand, criticize imaginative programs which involve the people on welf are and unemployment insurance, and give themn a chance to work. Those
people accept that chance. They work, they pay taxes,
they put their money into circulation, and they keep businessmen going. In fact, they even keep the barbers going.
Even the barbers' cats have a chance to drink milk once in
a while because of those projects. The total economic
effect of this vast prograrn ail over the country has been
of terrific significance. The total spent in those south
shore municipal projects was almost a quarter of a million dollars.
I have another list which I might put on record on
another occasion; it is not necessary at this time. Could
anyone object because the town of Bridgewater, which
has been straining itself trying to gather together enough
money to build a decent swimming pool for its youngsters,
has now taken advantage of LIP? The town applied for a
grant, received it, and put 15 people to work during the
off-season. Those 15 people would otherwise have been
out of work. The town spent $28,000. Is that not a good
cause?
Hou. Mr. Welch: That is $28,000 out of taxes people
cannot afford.
Hon. Mr. Smith: I would not want to go back to my own
home town and teil the young people of the Kinsmen Club
and the Lion's Club, who have been engaged in a project
to build a new rink in the town, that what they were doing
was not worth-while. That is the first rink bult in that
town since I was a boy of twelve. We could neyer get
enough money together to undertake a project of that
kind. Construction of the rink was commenced but not
completed. Those young people got a grant of over
$15,000, and they put 18 men to work. So far as I arn
concerned that serves the public interest. I do not mind
paying my share of taxes for a thing like that.
Moreover, I certainly do not object because the Clark's
Harbour Baptist Church requested a grant to paint the
church. I do not object at ail because the Bridgewater
Memorial Arena had a building project, and spent $52,000
which made available 40 jobs this winter. I do not object
because the Lunenburg County Association for the Men25312-251

tally Retarded created 10 jobs in work with mentally
retarded aduits in the community, and spent $6,786.
0 (1450)
There are others on the list. Senator Welch has neyer
totailed these figures of federal contributions to projects
in the Province of Nova Scotia, but they amount to $10,500,000. That money created 6,863 jobs, and the average
pay per job was $1,395. 1 think LIP is pretty good.
1 wish to illustrate why I feel LIP and the Opportunities
for Youth Prograrns are not ail bad. I was asked some
time ago if I would use rny influence to obtain two grants
under the Opportunities for Youth Program. These two
projects had been approved by the town coundil of Liverpool, but apparently they are not going to be accepted. I
soon discovered-and it was a great revelation to methat local politicians have nothing to do with such matters. I was told very politely, "We are happy to have your
recommendation," and that was the last I heard of it.
However, what did we obtain in Liverpool? In my opinion
we got sornething more worth-while than those two smaller projects which I was endorsing. We received a summer
school for exceptional children. I will tell those of you
who are not familiar with the phrase "exceptional children" that it means mentally retarded children. This is an
educational program for mentally retarded children aged
from 4 to 18 years in an endeavour to supplement the
public school program. This also provides them with
swimming classes, field trips, and social outings. I do not
know of anything more deserving of a grant of money
which will provide employment for 10 university students
who are endeavouring to gain experience. I arn sure they
will derive a great deal of joy from their attempt to assist
a class of people who deserve aIl the help they can get.
Mahone Bay Community Service for the Mentally
Retarded received $14,630. This is a community which in
the last few years has been endeavouring to obtain voluntary help for the mentally retarded. If this project can be
furthered in any way, I arn all for it. The grant provides 20
jobs, and I think this is money well spent.
Shelburne received $6,000 for a study on poilution
around the Shelburne harbour, and to create public
awareness of this problem in an endeavour to obtain
better sewage treatment. I arn happy to see young people
involved in these issues. Another project is a summer
recreation program for rural children aged from 4 to 12
years. There are many other examples, and I cite these
merely for the record. I did not select any of themn in
particular. I arn merely illustrating the programs
involved. I hope I have not irritated my friend.
There was one point in Senator Welch's speech which
made me wonder about his political philosophy. He
indicated he was in favour of a guaranteed annual income
as long as it did flot involve paying welfare plus a guaranteed annual income. Senator Croil wiil be interested to
know he has converted my friend to this attitude. I arn not
so sure I arn ready to accept that at thîs point. I amn
leaning toward that view, but not quite so far as My
friend, Senator Welch, is.
I arn not prepared to speak at great length on this
matter. Since I arn not prepared, it is difficuit to time my
speech. But I was interested in the terms of the inquiry
which reads:

388

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
high rate of unemployment and inflation and the way
in which they presently affect the economy of
Canada.
Of course, unemployment affects the economy of Canada.
High unemployment would affect the economy a whole lot
more if we did not have in effect a rather generous and
greatly improved system of paying unemployment insurance to those who have no chance of obtaining work. The
unemployment figures would swell if people did not
obtain what has been referred to as make-work jobs. They
did not create the work; it was there to be done. They are
being paid from federal funds for this work, which I think
is better than receiving welfare.
I will be careful in phrasing my next point. I have been
associated with the Liberal Party all my life. I assume my
friend, Senator Welch, has been associated with the Conservative Party for even a longer period of time. During
this period of high unemployment, which I acknowledge
presents a very serious problem, if the tables were turned,
I would be rather embarrassed to put an inquiry of this
kind on the Order Paper, drawing attention to the high
unemployment. I think we should give attention to developing programs that will lessen the effect of this difficult
situation.
I looked up some information contained in a report of
the Special Committee on Manpower and Employment. I
was acting chairman of that committee for a period of
time while my friend, Senator Méthot, was absent from
Ottawa. It dealt at great length with this problem, and I
feel it was a worth-while study. These tables indicate that
as of May 20, 1961, the unadjusted unemployment rate, or
the raw unemployment rate, was 9.3 per cent. The latest
unadjusted unemployment rate in this country is 5.8 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What does the term "unadjusted"
mean?
Hon. Mr. Smith: I will not go into that.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I was in the other place when Senator
Martin was discussing unemployment in 1961, and there
were unadjusted figures from "Martin's Bureau of Statistics." I was wondering if you were referring to them.
0

(1500)

Hon. Mr. Smith: I always enjoyed Senator Martin's personal book from which he quoted those statistics. These
are the raw, actual percentages without any adjustment
for the seasonal factors involved. You are on safe ground
when you compare apples with apples. The unadjusted
unemployment rate in 1961 was 9.3 per cent, whereas the
latest figure is 5.8 per cent. In the Atlantic region at that
time the unadjusted unemployment rate was 18.1 per cent.
As of April 1972 the unadjusted unemployment rate for
the Atlantic region was 10.9 per cent.
The other item that I turned up demonstrates how horrible unemployment was in the winter of 1961.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: You are talking about the other Liberal recession.
Hon. Mr. Smith: I am talking about 1961.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: That is what it was-a Liberal
recession.
[Hon. Mr. Smith.]

May 18. 1972
Mav 18. 1972

Hon. Mr. Smith: I turned to another column on winter
unemployment in a special study carried out by a Professor Judek, who was on the staff of Carleton University. It
indicated how high winter unemployment was in those
days. We think that Bathurst is in trouble these days. The
percentage of the work force registered as unemployed in
Bathurst was 44; in Saint John, 24 per cent; in Moncton, 23
per cent; in Cornerbrook, 23 per cent; in New Glasgow,
21.3 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Welch: You are talking about 11 years ago.
Hon. Mr. Smith: We have a long way to go before we get
back to the 1961 figures.
Hon. Mr. Welch: If this government keeps on the way it
is going, we will soon be there.
Hon. Mr. Smith: These are facts. I am not selecting them
carefully, but they are from information in my hands. I
am putting them on record to show the other side of the
coin, which was pretty grimy, that we had a look at
yesterday. Let me come now to my final paragraph, if
there is such a thing.
Before we talk ourselves into a state of mental depression, as some honourable senators on the other side of the
house seem to be doing, may I say that such talk encourages low expectations and is harmful. It represents a low
expectation of Canadian economic prospects. In my view,
it is time to pull the plug, to find out how many of us
really do support Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: On the assumption that this is not a
pre-election private fight between two Nova Scotia partisans, and that anyone can get into it, I move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators, I wish to speak
on this inquiry, if I am permitted.
The Hon. the Speaker: There is a motion for the
adjournment of the debate. The practice I usually follow,
when an honourable senator moves the adjournment of a
debate and another honourable senator indicates his
desire to speak, is to give the floor to that honourable
senator. Perhaps Senator O'Leary might adjourn the
debate after Senator Carter has spoken.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On a point of order, if one honourable
senator moves the adjournment of the debate and another
honourable senator indicates his desire to speak, if the
one who has moved the adjournment wishes his motion to
be put, then it has to be put. It depends on whether the
honourable senator is prepared to yield. We are not
obliged to yield all the time, even though we are only a
few in number.
The Hon. the Speaker: That was my purpose in making
my commentHon. Senators: Yield.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Once again we will yield.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order. We have had a motion.
Before I put the motion, I should like to inquire if Senator
O'Leary insists that I put his motion.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I am glad to yield the floor to Senator
Carter, provided that he does not wish me to remain and
listen to him.

May 18, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Chesley W. Carter: I thank my honourable friend,
Senator O'Leary, for permitting me to proceed. When he
rose in his place, I was uncertain whether he was going to
ask a question or whether he was going to participate in
the debate. Perhaps I did not stand up as fast as I should.
I am quite happy not to inflict upon the honourable senator any more punishment than he can bear, so he may feel
free to leave the chamber at any time.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Thank you for small mercies.
Hon. Mr. Carter: However, in the course of my remarks
I shall refer to some of the honourable senator's speeches.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Did you prepare that speech last night?
Hon. Mr. Carter: No; since I have been sitting here.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not on the suggestion of your leader?
Hon. Mr. Carter: Senator Welch, in his speech yesterday,
raised some very interesting points, and it is proper that
we should debate them now while the issues are hot. I can
assure Senator Welch and Senator O'Leary that I will not
be very partisan. I have nothing against partisanship,
although Senator Buckwold was a little surprised yesterday to find that kind of note in this sedate and august
chamber. Partisanship can be a lot of fun.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, with Senator Smith especially.
Hon. Mr. Carter: However, I doubt if it is a luxury that
we should indulge in at this particular time in the history
of our nation, because of the tremendous problems faced
by the country and the tremendous wave of unrest which
seems to prevail in different parts of our society and our
country. I hope that for the sake of democracy we will do
whatever we can to throw as much light as possible upon
the issues involved, because democracy is no stronger
than the individual who has to exercise his vote. To do
that he must have some basis on which to make up his
mind. Any remark or speech which creates suspicion or
which distorts facts serves only to confuse the electorate,
and when that happens both democracy and Canada
suffer. I will not be partisan, because I do not think I
would be doing a service to our country to take that kind
of stand at this time. I am a government supporter; I am a
member of the Liberal Party, but I have not always
agreed with what the government has done.
* (1510)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You have never always said so.
Hon. Mr. Carter: I have said so, too. Many times I have
voted against the government in this chamber and I arn
prepared to do so again when a principle is involved.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is a threat that your leader will not
forgive.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: He is asking permission.
Hon. Mr. Carter: I think the starting point, if we are
going to enlighten the people of Canada about the issues
facing us at this time, is to point out to everyone what a
difficult country Canada is to govern. There is no country
in the world as difficult to govern as Canada.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: What about Ireland?
Hon. Mr. Carter: Well, they do not have a government
over there.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Carter: No other country has such a vast
expanse of territory or such vast differences in climate
and natural resources or in distribution of population.
Whatever measure is good for one part of Canada is
almost bound to be bad for some other part. So the
government has to keep looking at the national scene and
must endeavour, as best it can, to draw a medium line that
will not be completely satisfactory to everyone but will at
least be acceptable to the majority. That is a fact of life,
both economically and politically in this country, and I
think it is time that the people understood that. In my
opinion, we as parliamentarians have a duty to emphasize
that whenever we can.
Senator Welch referred yesterday to the tremendous
peacetime expenditures by this government. His remarks
brought to mind a brief which came to my desk a few
days ago from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. It
was their pre-budget submissions to the government and,
particularly, to the Honourable John Turner, Minister of
Finance, and the Honourable Herb Gray, Minister of
National Revenue. In their brief they raised this very
point. The brief suggested that the government should
curtail expenditures on the grounds that those expenditures contributed to inflation. Well, I made it my business
to attempt to get some information on government expenditures, and for that purpose I went to Statistics Canada.
The latest figures they could give me were for 1969-70, so
they are almost three years old. That in itself, honourable
senators, is one of our problems. It is a fact of life in
Canada, unlike most modern countries, that we do not
have available up-to-date statistics on which to develop
coherent up-to-date policies. In any event, I found that in
1969-70 the total expenditure by the federal government
was in the order of $14.5 billion; by the provincial governments, over $12 billion; and by municipal governments,
another $6 billion. In other words, spending by municipal
and provincial governments totalled close to $19 billion as
against $14 billion by the federal government.
I should point out here that of the $14.5 billion expenditure by the federal government, over $1 billion went to the
provinces in the form of unconditional grants and another
$2 billion plus in the form of conditional grants. That
meant, of course, that of the $14 billion chalked up as an
expenditure by the federal government over $3 billion was
not spent by the federal government at all but was, in fact,
spent by the provincial governments. Therefore, the total
expenditure by the federal government was down to
around $11 billion as compared to almost $19 billion by
the provinces and the municipalities.
I wrote to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce telling
them that I appreciated that it is always good to curtail
expenditures whenever possible, but why are they always
admonishing the federal government, the smallest spender, without pointing out to the provincial and municipal
governments that they are contributing to inflation and to
overspending much more than is the federal government.
There is another factor to be considered in the federal
government's expenditures. A large percentage-I have
not been able to get this figure, although I did inquire and
was promised it-a large percentage of the federal government's expenditures is statutory. They are required by

SENATE DEBATES
law. Perhaps Senator Martin can give us that figure. I
believe it is over 70 per cent, which means that the federal
government has very little room to manœuvre when it
comes to curtailing spending. It only has about 25 per cent
or 30 per cent of the budget in which to manœuvre in
order to curtail any spending at all. While it is good to
emphasize overspending and to emphasize the need for
curtailment, we must realize that it is not at all easy to put
into actual practice. It is one of the most difficult things, I
suppose, that any government can do, particularly when
everyone-members of the government, senators, municipal and provincial officials-is urging the government to
spend more.
Senator Smith today, and Senator Buckwold yesterday,
dealt extensively with the Local Initiatives Program and
the Opportunities for Youth Program. I do not intend to
repeat anything they have said, but I want to make this
particular point: I do not look upon these programs as
makeshift prograns or short stopgap programs to create
temporary employment. I feel that these programs represent the shape of things to come. I appreciate that Senator
O'Leary is a strong free enterpriser and an enemy of the
welfare state. I am thinking particularly of his contribution to the debate in this chamber on the Report of the
Special Senate Committee on Poverty in Canada. I can
assure Senator O'Leary and other senators that I too am
concerned about the welfare state, but when I look at the
problerns we are faced with I cannot find any other solution. Senator O'Leary will remember he told us that when
he was a boy he was fortunate enough to have as a friend
a priest who gave him books, from which he learned to
read; he went out into the world and worked here and
there and gradually worked himself up. A lot of us did
that. Many of us went through that process.
* (1520)

The point I am trying to make is that that day has gone,
and gone forever. We are in a different world, we are in a
different kind of society, and the opportunities we had 50
years ago will never return.
When Senator McGrand made his speech on poverty he
gave a description of what had been done in Iceland,
Greenland and other Scandinavian countries. No doubt
what had been done was good, but he told us it took them
30 years to do it. We do not have 30 years to go back and
start from scratch to build up to where those countries are
now, because we are living in the now and we have to deal
with the problems as they are today.
We are living in an age of technology when jobs are
disappearing almost as fast as, if not faster than, new jobs
can be created. Our work force is expanding at the rate of
two to three per cent a year, so we must expand our
economy at the rate of two to three per cent a year merely
to keep up with the additions to the work force. If we
want to improve our standard of living we must increase
our GNP by another one or two per cent.
As Senator Buckwold pointed out yesterday, Canada is
passing through a period of abnormal increases in its
labour force. It is increasing faster than that of Britain,
France, Germany and some other European countries
combined. Yet, in the face of that abnormal situation, the
government policies have succeeded in creating nearly
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

May 18,1972

350,000 jobs. I do not think anyone can say that is a bad
record.
What I am leading up to is that I think there is a limit on
what the private sector, upon which all free enterprises
rely, can produce in the way of jobs in Canada. When we
have reached that point in Canada, what do we do? My
suggestion is that we do what we are doing today. The LIP
program and the OFY program are experiments. They
are based on a different concept in the work ethic. I may
be pessimistic in this regard but I am afraid the day has
gone when there will be a job for everyone who is willing
and able to work. I do not think the private sector can
provide that. I believe we must revise our ideas about
what is full employment. Ten years ago it was regarded as
full employment if there was four per cent unemployment. I do not think that is full employment today. Today
that figure probably has to be revised to five per cent,
which is the best we can now do.
If we contemplate the history of industrial development
and go back to the Industrial Revolution, it will be remembered that at first the machines put a lot of people out of
work. Eventually, however, people were needed to run the
machines, so that those who had been put out of work got
employment running the machines. But we do not need
people to run machines any more. Today we have
machines that can run machines. I believe that will create
a situation in which some people will not be able to work
in the kind of job that we ordinarily call employment, and
they must be given some other way to make their contribution to society so that the nation will still have the
benefit of their brains and creativity. If they cannot contribute to the production of wealth, if their efforts are not
needed for the production of wealth, then we must utilize
their contribution for the quality of life.
That is my interpretation of what these programs are
intended to do. Initially they are only in the experimental
stage, and no doubt a lot of mistakes have been made, but
we will learn by those mistakes and hopefully improve on
the programs. I believe they will become a permanent
feature of our society, because I think they are filling a
need that the private sector will not be able to fill.
There has been a lot of talk about inflation and it has
been said that government spending contributes to inflation. Probably it does. But here in Canada we must never
overlook the fact that a lot of our inflation is imported. If
we did not spend anything we could not control that type
of inflation because it is created outside the country. As
long as we are a trading country-and we must trade to
survive-then we must import and consequently import
that inflation. Inflation is not a simple thing; it is not just
too much money chasing too few goods or the cost-pushpull of prices and wages. Taking the record of inflation, I
cannot fault the government on its record. It has held
inflation in check better than any other industrialized
country in the world, so much so that the government is
being blamed for putting too much emphasis on the need
to curtail inflation and not enough on unemployment.
It must be realized that there are no instant solutions to
these problems, that it is not simply a matter of curtailing

SENATE DEBATES

expenditures or even of controlling prices. It will be
recalled that last year the federal government asked for
voluntary restraints; they asked both the business community and the labour organizations. The business community went along with it and did what they could. I am
not judging them, but some cynics say the business community knew it could not increase prices anyway, so it
was very easy for it to go along with the government's
request. That is the argument on the labour side. The
labour unions themselves rejected the plea out of hand;
they did not even offer to consider it or to try it to see
whether or not it would work, and now they are blaming
the government. I remember quite well what happened
six years ago. It was shortly after I came to this chamber.
I was appointed in July and my first session was when the
Senate reconvened in the fall of 1966. I was fortunate
enough to become a member of the Special Joint Committee on Consumer Credit and Cost of Living. If honourable
senators would cast their minds back to those days, they
will remember that in the fall of 1966 prices were rising
very rapidly, everyone was crying out about inflation and
about the cost of living. In the House of Commons nearly
every day in November questions were put to the Minister
of Finance as to what he intended to do about the
increases in the cost of living, as to when he would bring
in a mini-budget to curtail them, or bring in a deflationary
budget to cool off the economy.
* (1530)

It so happened that at that time there was a filibuster
going on in the other place. I forget what it was about, but
I think it was about the death penalty. There was also a
long debate on interim supply, and very little time was
devoted to legislation. This question kept popping up. The
Ottawa papers were running editorials asking when the
government intended to do something. Fortunately, nothing happened and eventually we saw that the economy
was cooling down on its own.
I will never forget this, because this has imprinted itself
into my mind. The following February, around February
2, we had a meeting of this joint committee I referred to,
and there appeared before us a Mr. W. A. Beckett of
Beckett Associates, a small firm in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Small or not, Mr. Beckett is frequently quoted.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Mr. Beckett came before us and he
brought his own monthly charts which he had kept from
the beginning of 1966. He showed us then-this was in
February 1967-that in 1966 the economy had started off
well and strong and had kept expanding until June, but
when September came the economy had turned down. If
the Honourable Mr. Sharp, who was Minister of Finance
at that time, had heeded the pressure, given in to the
pressure put on him by the official opposition, and the
exhortations by the press and consumer societies and so
on, and if he had brought in a deflationary budget at that
time, he would have accelerated the deflation that had
already set in in September and plunged the country into
one of the worst recessions we have ever had. This raises

the question as to why a firm in Toronto could have got
more accurate figures than Statistics Canada, but that

was so, and they were right.

We have to be very careful when we are dealing with
very serious issues that we do not misinform the public,
that we do not undermine their faith in the system or in
the government. I do not think undermining faith in the
government or institutions accomplishes anything. Our
democratic institutions are under such severe attack these
days that it is too serious even to contemplate that sort of
action.
We must be reponsible and we must to the best of our
ability state the facts as they are, so that the people in turn
will be able to make up their own minds in due course, on
fairly authentic facts, free from suspicion, free from
rumour, and free from distortion.
Honourable senators, that is what urged me to intervene
in this debate today. I could go on but I do not wish to
take up any more time or inflict any more punishment on
Senator O'Leary, who has been so very kind to sit through
all I have had to say.
On motion of Hon. Mr. O'Leary, debate adjourned.
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
TRADE AND GOODWILL MISSION OF CANADIAN
SENATORS AND BUSINESSMEN-DEBATE CONCLUDED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Cameron, calling the
attention of the Senate to the recent trade and goodwill
mission of a group of Canadian Senators and businessmen to the People's Republic of China.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable senators, my
first words must be a warm welcome to the four senators
who have so recently joined us. Three of them are longtime friends. Many of us have watched with admiration
the great contribution Senator McIlraith has made over
the last 32 years in the other place, and we all look
forward to his partaking similarly in the work of this
house. Senator Norrie and Senator Hicks I meet often at
our alma mater-Mount Allison University in Sackville.
From our association on the Board of Regents of that
university, I know they have great ability and have much
to contribute to the work here. Senator Graham is a new
friend from whom we all expect great things.
I welcome this opportunity to say a few words about my
recent visit to the Republic of China as a member of the
Banff School of Advanced Management tour under the
leadership of Senator Cameron.
This is the third Banff School of Advanced Management tour in which I have been privileged to participate,
the others being to Russia, Czechoslovakia and Poland,
and to the Middle East. All of them have demonstrated
Senator Cameron's great ability as an organizer and his
unusual capacity to make friends with people whether or
not he can speak their language. These goodwill and study
tours are completely at the expense of the participants
and are not subsidized in any way by the government or
anyone else. They are arranged by Senator Cameron. He
has almost unbelievable connections with people throughout the world-many through students who have attended
the Banff School of Advanced Management. You will
remember he told us that that school sets aside 10 per cent
of its places for what he calls offshore students-that is,
students from other countries. These annual tours of the

392

SENATE DEBATES

Banff School of Advanced Management are doing a great
deal to promote friendship, good will and understanding
toward Canada and Canadians amongst the people of
many foreign countries. They also promote amongst the
Canadian members of the tour parties similar friendship,
good will and understanding toward the people of the
countries visited.
Honourable senators, friendship was certainly what our
group found in the Republic of China. The four guides
who were with us throughout the 15 days we spent in
China were so thoughtful, kind and helpful that we felt
sincere regret when the time came for us to part. We felt
that they had become real friends. They made enormous
efforts to make it possible for us to see the things that our
members asked to see, and in every instance our requests
were met. This was not easy, for we were a mixed group
with a variety of interests.
* (1540)

Other guides joined us in each of the cities we visited,
and on our second visit to Canton, when we attended the
Canton Trade Fair, about which Senator Cameron told us
yesterday, a number of students attending the Foreign
Language Institute joined us. We were surprised to have
so many people with us, although it was indeed a pleasure, but we learned that it was considered excellent
experience for the students at the institute to have an
opportunity to speak and listen to the languages they are
studying. That opportunity would come to them, naturally, because of their presence at the Canton Fair. Not only
students studying English were at the Fair, but also those
studying Italian, Spanish and several other languages.
Like Senator Cameron, I was greatly impressed by the
cleanliness throughout the country. On seeing the white
slip covers over the seats in the station lounges and in the
trains, I thought of the tremendous amount of laundry
involved, for they were all so sparkling white and
unmussed. They must be freshly laundered every day.
There is no litter anywhere, and after leaving the untidiness and smells of the station on the Hong Kong side it
was a joy to cross the bridge into the Republic of China
and to enter the massive, cool and very clean Shumchun
station. The trains were good and also very clean, with
white slip covers over all upholstery and lace antimacassars for further protection. The trains were mopped down
before we left any station and at intervals throughout the
train trips we made.
Senator Cameron has told you about the operations
performed with acupuncture as an anaesthetic, so I will
not go into that now. But next to those operations the
highlight of interest for me was to learn about the methods of education which we saw in use in all schools, from
those for the smallest children to the universities. Right
from primary schools the Chinese combine theory and
practice in their education, and I wish Canadian teachers
could have an opportunity to study what the Chinese are
doing because it seems very sensible to me.
As Senator Cameron told you, we saw small factories
attached to schools. The children in those schools learn
about the necessary parts for machinery made in the
factories and about the theory of making fountain pens,
for example. Then they are taught in the factories to make
parts for machines and to make pens and other things
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.]

May 18, 1972

about which they have learned. We actually saw them
making the fountain pens, as Senator Cameron has told
you. The products they make are produced for actual use.
Another point that interested me in this was that the
children work long hours in order that they might learn
what it is like to work in a factory.
The children are also taught about plants and plant life.
Not only do they learn about these things in school, but
the same children spend time in the fields or rice paddies,
accompanied by their teachers, and both teachers and
pupils do the actual work of planting and harvesting the
crop which the students have learned about in theory in
the classroom. That is merely an example of the sort of
thing that is done, but practically everything the students
learn in theory they learn to do in practice, if at all
possible.
Articles, even recent articles, I have read about the
Republic of China have mentioned that the people look
glum or straight-faced. My personal experience does not
support that. Many people greeted us with smiles. You
may know that as a welcome Chinese people clap their
hands, and it is the custom for those who have been
clapped to clap back. As our group went through machine
shops, factories, a commune where people were farming
and into schools, it seemed as though one wave of clapping succeeded another. Certainly, this was very pleasant.
This may have been because they knew we were Canadians. We certainly did not hide the fact. We all wore Maple
Leaf pins. And it may have been because, as Canadians,
we were fellow countrymen of Dr. Norman Bethune, who
went to China to help the Chinese troops during the
Japanese invasion and who died in China of an infection
contracted while treating the Chinese and training them
to care for their wounded. Although scarcely known in
Canada, Dr. Norman Bethune is almost idolized in China
where they regard him as an example of the kind of
person they want to hold up to public esteem, as a human
being with weaknesses as well as great virtues who sacrificed himself for others.
At the Cultural Palace we visited in Peking a large
section is dedicated to him and the walls are covered with
pictures of Dr. Bethune at work. We had asked to visit a
class studying English. Incidentally, we were told that all
the students have to take a second language and that the
most popular second language is English. At any rate, it
was arranged for us to attend a class, and when we did we
found the lesson was about Dr. Bethune. It might have
been more than just coincidence that that day's lesson
was on Dr. Bethune, but possibly it was just sheer coincidence. In any event, it was obvious that such a lesson was
part of the regular curriculum, and it was equally obvious
that the students were very knowledgeable about the
subject.
You will not be surprised to hear that I heartily support
the suggestion made by Senator Cameron that the National Historic Sites and Monuments Board recognize as an
historic site Gravenhurst in Ontario where Dr. Norman
Bethune was born in 1890.
Because of statements I have made in this house, honourable senators will not be surprised to learn that I made
many inquiries about the status of women in China. When
the People's Republic of China was proclaimed at the

May 18,1972

DEBATES
May 18 1972SENATE

beginning of the present regime in 1949, it was specifically
written into the constitution that women "enjoy equal
rights with men in ail spheres of political, economnic, cultural, social and family life."
At the very beginning of the present regime the Minister
of Justice and the Minister of Public Health were both
women. Many other women entered government service
in Peking as well as in the provinces. Since the Cultural
Revolution in 1966 the number of women doctors has
increased greatly. You may be interested to know, however, that there are no wornen lawyers-because there are
no lawyers at ail in China.
Same Hou. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Shame!
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: That is one bad mark.
Hon. Mrs. Fergueson: Women have voluntarily entered
the army, navy and air force, after having passed a physical examination. We were told and we saw that they work
as men do in agricultural field work, pasturage, mining,
foundries, irrigation, communications, transportation, al
kinds of factories, commerce and public services. They
believe that whatever men can do in these services women
can do equally wefl. We saw themn doing these things and
were especially impressed by the girls operating cranes
and other heavy machinery, as was mentioned by Senator
Cameron yesterday.
a (1550)

By giving this equality to wornen the Republic of China
has tapped a tremendous source of labour which is being
utilized to the fullest. However, I have to differ from
Senator Cameron when he says women run the country.
Women make up only 30 per cent of the students at
Peking University and, although we saw some women
professors, 1 doubt if one-third of the professors were
women.
Men predominate in the Communist Party at both local
and national levels, although the women told us proudly
that they were represented on the revolutionary committees, but certainly not equally with men.
Some women were arnong the groups that welcomed us
on our various visits to important places, but certainly flot
a third and certainly not a half of such welcoming groups
were wornen. We were also told that the old feudal-patriarchal ideology still prevails arnong the peasants or, as
they are called now, the farmers, which results in lack of
equality in some rural places and small towns, unequal
pay being an example.
Chinese wornen have gone further toward equality with
men than we have in Canada, as is evidenced by the
statement regarding this matter which is written into their
Constitution, which I read earlier. We do not; have such a
statement in our Constitution, and from my experience as
a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitution, I
have corne to the conclusion that even if we should have a
new Constitution it is doubtful that such a statement
would be included.
1 have rnentioned my interest in the combination of
theory and practice in the Chinese methods of education.
I would like to speak briefly about the education of the
very young children. I was impressed by witnesses who

25312-26

appeared before the Special Senate Committee on Poverty and who stressed that if children are to have equal
opportunities, ail children, and not only those whose families are in the middle and higher salary brackets, must
begin their education at a very early age. I realized in
China they are doing rnuch better than we are in providing such education. Children enter the kindergartens very
young, I think at about 18 months. We visited such kindergartens and found the children delightful, friendly, outgoing and much loved. Certainly they are not; cowed or
oppressed in any way.
When we visited the kindergartens and primary schools
we were each met by two small guides who confidently
took our hands and escorted us to where we were to sit.
They sat near us and if we were to move to another part
of the building we were visiting, they again took our
hands and led us very carefully so that we would not miss
a step or stumble. It was amusing to see some of the tail
men of our party being led in this way by children who
scarcely reached above their knees. We were touched
when they would say to us in fareweil, "Goodbye, Canadian aunties and uncles." In China children address al
adults who are not their parents as "auntie" or "uncle"~which seemed to us a charming custorn.
I think ail of our group felt that the apportunities for the
education and care of ail young children are much more
advanced in China than they are in Canada. I would be
happy if our day care programs could be developed along
the lines we saw there.
In China there is tremendous interest in opera and
ballet. We saw two popular operas, one on the stage and
one that had been taped. In every school we were surprised to find the children singing the songs and performing the dances frorn these operas, and doing so surprisingly well.
Hou. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Senator Fergusson,
was the music beîng performed western or Chinese?
Hon. Mis. Ferguason: They were performing both.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): What were the concert halls like? Were these performances being held in
large theatres?
Hon. Mia. Fergueson: The opera was staged in a large
theatre, and the pictures were shown in a large theatre.
However, I arn referring to school children performing in
the schools. Every child was learning this music and as
they got older they naturally got better, but even the
srnaller children performed surprisingly weil. We were
surprised to see thern being taught in this manner. We saw
little children conducting orchestras and choirs. I arn sure
other members of our group would agree with me that
they did this very weil also. This certainly gives a wonderful opportunity for the development of any such talents
that children may have.
What I would like to convey to you is that if you ail
made a visit to China just as we did, I feel sure you would
have a much greater understanding of the people and
greater sympathy for their unceasing efforts to increase
their production so that they can compete with other
countries.
The Chinese believe they will do this if they foilow the
sayings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Certainly, by apply-

SENATE DEBATES
ing his precepts of working hard and always continuing to
try they feel they will succeed.
I do not know how many of these sayings and teachings
you have read, but I find them interesting. I would like to
read the three main Rules of Discipline and what are
called the eight points of attention which Chairman Mao
laid down for the army. Many of Chairman Mao's sayings,
like these, are rules we could well adopt in our country,
and if we did so it might mean that we, like the Chinese,
would find we have less crime to deal with; and also like
them, we might find an almost total absence of need for
penal institutions which occupies so much of our time and
money.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: The doors in China were never
locked either.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Senator and Mrs. Benidickson
were on this trip as well, and they contributed a great deal
to our visit.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I did not hear Senator Benidickson's remark.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: He reminded me that the doors in
China were never locked. No doors were locked. One
could not throw anything away. If one threw anything
into the waste paper basket, one would be followed to the
next town and the item returned.

Hon. Mr. Martin: The Leader of the Opposition could
not have been in the country.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I found this to be very interesting.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The Leader of the Government will not
provoke me, for the time being. I am keeping my
ammunition.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: If honourable senators will permit
me, I will cite an example of Chairman Mao's precepts. I
assure you that they are not always like this. There are
some that we would not agree with, particularly those that
are critical of imperialism. The following rules or precepts apply to the army. There are three main rules. The
first is, "Obey orders in all your actions." The second is,
"Don't take a single needle or piece of thread from the
masses." The third is, "Turn in everything captured."
There are eight points which must be observed. The
eight points for attention are: speak politely; pay fairly for
what you buy; return everything you borrow; pay for
anything you damage. The last one makes me think of our
motor vehicles which are sometimes damaged by those
who will not admit that they have done so. The other
points are: do not hit or swear at people; do not damage
crops; do not take liberties with women; do not ill-treat
captives.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): They go rather far,
do they not?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: It is too bad that all armies do not
have similar rules. Honourable senators may say that I
have been brainwashed, but I think I am a little too old to
be influenced just because people are kind and friendly to
me. Like Senator Cameron, I would like to see many more
such visits exchanged between Canadians and Chinese,
because we have much to learn from each other.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): What kind of food

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Chop suey.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Did you eat with

Fergusson is too humble to mention the lovely ensemble
she has on. It is fitting that she should wear it for the
speech she has given. Having heard those two wonderful
speeches, I felt that I was right there in China with them.
In view of the fact that men are becoming more fashion

taken off her coat to show off her gorgeous dress.

They keep their interest in that sport all their lives.
Hon. Mr. Williams: I should like to direct a question to
the honourable senator. During your stay in the Republic
of China did you learn of any welfare payments being
made to those who are needy, as we understand welfare
here in Canada?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: No, we did not. They do not need
it.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: I am a little intrigued by the honourable senator's reference to eating Chinese and western
food. Did you use western cutlery to eat your meals, or did
you use chopsticks? How does one handle a western
breakfast of fried eggs, for example, with chopsticks?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: When we had a western breakfast,
they provided knives and forks; everything was western.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Apparently they did
not serve any jello.
The Hon. the Speaker: Unless any other honourable
senator wishes to participate in the debate, this inquiry is
now regarded as having been concluded.

The Hon. the Speaker: Do I understand leave is being
granted to proceed with second reading now?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I beg leave to
introduce Bill C-207, an Act to amend the Old Age Security Act. Before dealing with the details of the bill I should
like to mention the important contribution which the
Senate has made to the development of legislation affecting pension entitlements of senior citizens.
On July 23, 1963, this house ordered the appointment of
a special committee of the Senate:
... to examine the problem involved in the promotion
of the welfare of the aged and aging persons, in order
to ensure that in addition to the provision of a sufficient income, there are also developed adequate services and facilities of a positive and preventive kind so
that older persons may continue to live healthy and
useful lives as members of the Canadian community
and the need for the maximum co-operation of all
levels of governments in the promotion thereof ...
During the next three years this committee, under the
chairmanship of the Honourable David Croll and with the
dedicated assistance of its members, many of whom are in
the house today, conducted one of the most comprehensive investigations of the circumstances and needs of
older Canadians that has ever been carried out in this
country. The report of the committee, which was laid
before this house on February 2, 1966, was exhaustive in
its analysis and definitive in its conclusions. As Senator
Croll said in his introduction to the 1966 report:
-Senior citizens are not some indefinable group,
separate and apart. They are our mothers and our
fathers. They are ourselves in a few years. They are
those who have made contributions to society and to
our country. They are those who have given their
energies, their skills and their children for the good of
society. What the senior citizen needs is to retain his
earned right in his own world.
Before summarizing the essential elements of the bill, I
should like to remind honourable senators of the level of
income security for retired Canadians which had been
achieved by 1966 and the recommendations which were
made in this regard by the Special Committee on Aging.
In 1963 the old age pension, available at age 70, was
increased from $65 to $75, a level at which it remained
[Hon. Mr. Phillips.]

May 18. 1972
May

until the provisions for escalation were implemented in
1968.
* (1620)

In its report the special committee recommended that
an income guarantee program be established which
would be available to all persons aged 65 and over who
had 10 years residence in Canada, and whose net cash
income from all sources was less than $1,260 in the case of
single persons and $2,220 in the case of couples, including
income from old age security and the Canada Pension
Plan. They also recommended that income protection
should be provided by establishing a guaranteed income,
which would be adjusted automatically to reflect changes
in consumer spending. The committee recommended as
well that the procedure for administering the program
should be based on a single declaration of income.
In February 1965, a short time before the committee
reported, the government of the day introduced legislation which reduced the age of eligibility for pension on a
five-year stage basis from 70 to 65. The legislation also
provided for automatic escalation up to a limit of two per
cent in any year.
In December 1966 the government responded to the
committee's recommendations with proposals for a guaranteed income supplement program, which in the first
instance provided pensioners with a guaranteed income
of $1,260 per year for a single person and $2,520 a year for
couples. The maximum supplementary benefit of $30 per
month for each pensioner was reduced when other
income raised the total level above these levels.
In December 1970, the maximum supplementary benefits were increased to $55 a month for single persons and
$95 a month for couples. The basic old age security pension, which at that point was $79.58 a month, was set at
$80.
In this bill the following provisions are made. The
changes in pension entitlements and conditions provided
in the bill may be summarized as follows. First of all, the
present benefits for those entitled to old age security only
are $80 per month for a single person and $160 a month
for a married couple. In this bill these benefits are revised
to $82.88 for a single person and $165.76 for a couple. The
present benefits for those entitled to old age security and
the maximum supplement is $137.70 for a single person
and $260.10 for a married couple. These benefits are
revised to $150 for a single person and $285 for a married
couple. These are, it will be seen, very substantial amendments, very substantial revisions indeed, and warrant the
view, which possibly could be illustrated when the committee meets, that no other country has old age security
income benefits at this level.
The effective date for these improvements is January 1
this year. The qualifying age for pension benefits remains
unchanged at 65. Residence requirements for pension
entitlement remain unchanged. However, at the present
time pensioners may not continue to draw benefits if they
live outside Canada for more than six months a year
unless they resided in Canada for 25 years after reaching
the age of 21. In future, under this bill, this residence
requirement for paying pensions outside the country will
be reduced to 20 years after reaching the age of 18.

May 18,1972

DEBATES
May 18 1972SENATE

At the present time the basic old age security pension is
flot subject to escalation. In future it will be escalated
each year on the basis of increases in the consumer price
index, and this change is effective fromn January 1, 1972.
The improvement this year is 3.6 per cent, based on the
increase in the consumer price index for the fiscal year
1971-72 over 1970-71. At present the pension benefit for
those entitled to old age security and GIS, the guaranteed
income supplement, is escalated up to a limit of two per
cent each year. In future the entire pension benefit of
those receiving the supplement will be escalated each year
on the basis of the increase in the consumer price index.
Those are the basic provisions of the bill. I should like to
point out-although this is not provided for in the bill, but
it does enable us to understand the attention that Parliament and the government wishes to pay to this matterthe special income tax allowance for pensioners aged 65
and over, which now stands at $650 per person, will be
increased to $1,000 effective January 1, 1972. This increase
is not provided, as I said, in this bill. 1 refer to it, however,
because for those pensioners who are subject to incofte
tax this increase which was proposed in the recent budget
wiIl have a very real impact on their income situation.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): You mean the
exemption.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Is that not what I said? That is what I
meant to say.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): You talked about an
increase.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: We want to make it doubly clear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is an additional increase in deduetions for people over 65.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right, but it has a great value to
them. I think it important that I should say what the cost
of this will be. The additional cost of these improvements
will be in the order of $253 million in the fiscal year
1972-73. The proposais contained in this bil will resuit in
some 1.8 million Canadians over 65 years of age receiving
the basic escalated old age security pension of $82.88 a
month. Over 60 per cent of those, or 1.1 million, will
receive the combined old age security and guaranteed
income supplement payments of up to, $150 a month for a
single person or combined payments of up to $285 for
marrîed couples. Calculated on an annual basis, the minimum income which this bill guarantees to our senior
citîzens is $1,800 for single people and $3,420 for couples.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: If husband and wife both receive
an old age pension,-I mean if they are both over 65 years
of age?
Hou. Mr. Martin: That is right. It should also be noted
that under the proposed changes, partial supplements will
be payable as long as incomes are below $2,625 for single
persons and $4,870 for married couples. This is a very
substantial improvement in the situation that prevailed in
1966 when the total allowable income for recipients of old
age assistance, încluding old age assistance, was $1,260 for
single persons and $2,220 for couples.
It is interesting to observe that the principle of selectivity which was enunciated in the report of the Special

Senate Committee in 1966 has shifted the main thrust of
our old age security program away from universal payments towards increased expenditures on those whose
needs are greatest. It bas done this, as the committee
recommended in 1966, without the use of means tests.
I refer to the universal system, and to, the consequences
of this recommendation among other influences of the
Senate committee, with some nostalgia, because I had the
responsibility, as Minister of Health and Welf are, to
introduce the old age security universal system, which at
that time eliminated the means tests. I still think that was
a very responsible measure, one that certainly met with
wide approval both in Parliament; and in the country.
Expenditures on the OAS and GIS programs have risen
fromn $1,388 million in the fiscal year 1967-68 to an estimated $2,453 million in 1972-73.
The benefit improvement measures which have been
introduced since 1967 have increased the proportion of
total expenditures directed to the supplement from 17 per
cent in 1967-68 to almost 29 per cent in 1972-73.
Honourable senators, I have given the main features of
this bill. There would have been a great temptation to
review ail that has been doneHon. Mr. Flynn: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -during the past 25 yearsHon. Mr. Flynn: Please, no.
Hou. Mr. Martin: -in this debate. I say there would have
been a great temptation on my part.
Han. Mr. Flynn: In other circumnstances.
Han. Mr. Martin: I spent 11 years in that particular
department; quite the best part of my ministerial life was
in it. I say it would have been a great temptation, but I
have resisted that today.
Han. Mr. Flynn: Why?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am very anxious that we give as
quick consideration to tis matter as is possible, so that
the benefits of this bill can go to those needy senior
citizens of our country who, I am sure, will follow and are
following our deliberations with great interest.
I commend these amendments to the Senate.
Han. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, the last
remarks made by the Leader of the Government are very
clear. It is not the first time that we have heard an invitation as clear as tis one to the Senate to dispense with its
normal responsibility in dealing with legislation.
If we were to accept the reasoning of the Leader of the
Government, every time we get a bill which would provide
a payment to some people who are in need we should not;
debate the bull, we should not amend it, we should not
study it, we should not try to understand it, we should not
try to improve it; we should simply say, "Fine, send the
cheques right away, and let us forget what the Senate is
about and what its role is or should be."
Normally, a bull like this one should not be considered
by the Senate before next Tuesday. It was passed just a
few minutes ago by *the other place. The other place has
had the bill for over a week now. I know it did not deal
oniy with this bill during that time, but it was aware of the

T)ERATER

SENATF. DEBATES
RENATE

admonition of the house leader of the government that it
had to pass by Friday, by tomorrow, if beneficiaries were
to receive their June cheques with the increases provided
in the bill. Yet the other place thought that it was its duty
to take the time it did take and to delay the passage of this
legislation until four o'clock today, Thursday, May 18,
which is one day before the proposed deadline set by the
house leader of the government in the other place.
As I said, we normally should be dealing with this bill
on second reading next week, because under our rules a
bill receives first reading and then two days' notice is
required before second reading. Therefore, today being
Thursday and Monday being a holiday, we would not
have been able to proceed with this bill before Tuesday
next. That would have given us time, in the three- or
four-day interval, to look at the bill.
We did look at the bill; we had to, because we were
warned two or three days ago, by the Leader of the
Government here, that we would be pushed, and that if
we were not prepared to give leave he would see to it that
the responsibility would be placed on us, if by accident
the cheques going to the senior citizens of this country
were not to include in June the increases provided for in
this bill.
If we had proceeded in a normal way, we would have
started the debate on Tuesday; we probably would have
had at least two days of debate in this house; we would
have sent it to committee and we would have had a good
examination of the legislation there. Then the bill would
have received passage by this house probably only in ten
days, and royal assent about two weeks from now. This is
the normal course that we should follow in the Senate, as
a rule.
There may be exceptions. In the present case the only
reason why we are invited to make an exception is a
statement of the government leader, repeating what was
said in the other place, that the bill has to be passed by
tomorrow night if the cheques for June are to go out with
the increases provided for in this bill.
I have had the promise of the Leader of the Government
that we would have before the committee the people who
know about the machinery of the printing and expedition
of the cheques, who would be prepared to tell us if such is
the fact. I do not want a mere general statement like the
only one I was able to get from the Leader of the Government. I want something precise because I wish to be
assured that if royal assent is given tomorrow evening,
Friday, instead of next Tuesday, it will make a real difference. I do not believe any sensible person can make that
assertion, but I am eager to see who from the department
will try. I have no doubt that there will be an attempt of
some kind, but they will have to convince me as to its
making any real difference.
* (1640)

Another thing I will want to know is whether the
cheques have already been printed. We know very well,
for example, that in dealing with the so-called income tax
reform bill, when we were pushed to pass it before the
supposed deadline of December 31, the Department of
National Revenue had already sent out forms based on
the new law before the bill had received royal assent or
had even gone through the Senate. I think it is fair to say
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

Man

in

1079

Max,18 1079

that when it is obvious that both Houses of Parliament
will approve a bill, then there is no difficulty for any
department in getting ready to do whatever is necessary
to meet any supposed deadline required for the benefit of
the public at large or for the benefit of a special class of
citizens, such as, in the present case, our senior citizens.
It is obvious that the government leader would like us to
deal with the three stages of this bill, including the committee stage, in one day or less, because tomorrow, if my
understanding is correct, the other place adjourns at five
o'clock. Since it does not sit on Saturday it would be
necessary, therefore, to have royal assent by 4.45 p.m.
tomorrow. We would have about nine members from the
other place and about an equal number from the Senate
present to salute the Deputy of His Excellency under
these circumstances on a Friday afternoon. At any rate,
that would give us about 24 or 25 hours in which to decide
that this bill is all right, that there should be no improvement and that we understand all of its implications.
Of course, being members of the Senate, we are absolutely brilliant-or probably that is the assumption on
which the Leader of the Government bases his invitation
for us to deal so celeritously with this legislation. But I say
that it is obvious that we are pushed once again, just as we
were last December when we dealt with the income tax
reform bill and as we were pushed in December 1970
when the old age pension was adjusted.
If honourable senators recall, when we dealt with the
old age pension legislation in 1970, on December 18 we
were contemplating for the next day an adjournment of
over a month; that is, we would have adjourned on
December 19. Thus we had about one day in which to deal
with the legislation. The same argument was made at that
time as to whether we were really to consider this legislation, really to study it, really to debate it, then since the
other place was going to adjourn for the Christmas recess
we would be delaying the payments to the beginning of
February; and again we were in the position where we
had to neglect our responsibilities because of the
circumstances.
Well, I say that if we continue in this way we might as
well consider that the Senate's role so far as the review of
legislation is concerned is diminishing every day and that
sooner or later it will become obvious that we are not
serving any useful purpose. Despite all the merits that the
present Leader of the Government may have in trying to
enhance the reputation of the Senate in some other areas,
I must say that so far as legislation is concerned, so far as
the manner in which he has handled the legislation is
concerned and the way in which he has handled the huge
majority of supporters of the government in this house, he
has hurt the reputation of the Senate. If that continues we
may never recover from the blow that has been dealt the
Senate by the manner in which he has proceeded in these
special circumstances.
As much as the government leader may consider the bill
simple and straightforward and deserving of only a cursory glance on our part, I do not agree that it is unimportant. The government leader refuses to take the legislative
task of the Senate seriously, as I said. He refuses to let us
act as something other than a sorry lot of obsequious
toads lying around waiting for the other place to toss over

18

SENATE DEBATES

legislation at the last minute, expecting us to deal with it
in a matter of hours. Surely, nobody would assert that this
is not what we have been doing since last Monday night?
We have been waiting for nothing other than that very
moment when the bill would reach us. The Leader of the
Government has been asking for leave to consider it right
away, with not a minute of reflection. And that is what
has happened today.
He was so anxious and so nervous about it yesterday
that I had to give him the assurance that as soon as the
bill would reach us today, after first reading we would
give leave to proceed with second reading. But if I had not
resisted the Leader of the Government we would have
looked even more foolish than we did because we would
have come back at eight o'clock for nothing. There would
have been another blunder made yesterday if I had given
leave to revert to Notices of Motions. I will not say anything else about that, except to say that I did it for the
sake of the reputation of the Senate. I thought I was using
better judgment than the Leader of the Government in
refusing to let him try to do what he intended to do at that
time. I hope in future he will thank me.
The Hon. the Speaker: Does the honourable Senator
Lamontagne wish to ask a question?
[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: In all honesty with the Leader of
the Opposition, I must say that I agree entirely with him,
but I would like to know if he recalled events which took
place here in the past. I would ask him whether, in this
instance, he has specific objections to express concerning
the bills now before us?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If my good friend will be patient with
me, I intend to speak to the bill, but for the time being I
am trying to explain how difficult it will be for us to
discuss this bill efficiently because of the circumstances
under which it reached us and we are obliged to study it.
That is the point I want to make and if my friend has
something more specific in mind, if he feels I have been
unfair in my remarks, and there is something else I should
refer to or recall, whatever that may be, I am quite agreeable, but all I gathered is the fact that he would like me to
come to the legislation as soon as possible. That I mean to
do, and I will do so, but I certainly feel it is important to
put on the record, since we are proceeding at such speed,
why the Senate is placed in such a difficult position and
why we are being forced to pass an act without following
ordinary rules or the rules of procedure. These rules do
not exist only to gratify a whim. Their purpose is to
provide for orderly debate, allowing al members of our
assembly to examine bills, to consider them from one day
to the next and see whether it would not be advisable,
after hearing the comments of several speakers, that
amendments be provided, or recommendations involving
amendments be brought forward.
For instance, I might refer to the case-I mean the
legislation rushed through in December 1970-when, if my
honourable friend will remember, we arnended the bill in
order that the universal pension should not be linked to
the cost of living index, an amendment which was much
criticized in the other place and here. It is perhaps precisely that debate, a short one here and longer over there,
which resulted in bringing about a change in the govern-

ment's position. Whatever I may think, there were perhaps other reasons, but, as a matter of fact, it seems to me
that in a deliberative assembly, debate is essential and
account must be taken of all circumstances-and that is
what I am trying to do.
[English]
* (1650)

I will return to my notes, and I hope I will not be too
repetitious. Some of the items which I intended to mention I have referred to in French. I feel we have until six
o'clock to deal with this legislation. The government
leader was warned last December that we did not wish to
put up with this sort of subtle blackmail in order to meet a
deadline-in this case for the payment of cheques to our
senior citizens, while on December 31 it was for fiscal
reform. I would remind honourable senators, and especially the Leader of the Government, that many of his
own followers expressed their displeasure with the
manner in which the Senate was being treated. I am
quoting from the speech of Senator Desruisseaux, as
reported in the Debates of the Senate of March 1, at page
59:
My reaction to what occurred last December in connection with the tax reform bill is that the Senate
should never again forfeit its right of action granted
by the Constitution; it should exercise that liberty for
as long as the Constitution exists. The Senate should
never again act against its better judgment, as I
believe it did in rushing the passage of the tax reform
bill on request and under pressure, even though it had
studied the bill for many months while the legislation
was being debated in the other place.
Those in authority responsible for the tax reform
bill ill-timed its presentation to the house, incorrectly
estimated the time necessary for full discussion of the
legislation, and did not take into account the role
played by the Senate in constitutional affairs. It is to
our sharne, as members of this chamber, that we
surrendered the most elementary basic principles
necessary if the Senate is to function within the terms
and spirit of the Constitution. I am sure that honourable senators share my view that the incident will
serve as a warning that nothing similar must be
allowed to occur again.
Yet here we are again at another dead end. We do not
have sufficient time to delve into all the ramifications of
this bill. It may appear very simple, but is not. There is
more to it than the amount of $2.88 which we are going to
pay to our senior citizens in a few weeks, or the other
increase in supplementary income payments.
I remember that in 1970 when we were discussing a
similar bill, Senator Benidickson, Senator Forsey and
others discussed questions relating to universality, selectivity, and so on. These are very important matters. These
are not questions we can merely raise in passing and then
forget about.
I am afraid that once again we wil be the laughing
stock of Canada. The Leader of the Government has
failed to impress upon his colleagues that this Senate is
here to do more than blindly approve legislation which is
sent to us frorn the other place. We are supposed to
examine it. As a matter of fact, as Senator Buckwold

400

SENATE DEBATES
--

would say, we are supposed to roll up our sleeves and get
to work. It will take more than a few hours to deal with
this bill adequately. I need not describe what this chamber looks like at this time. It is sad and depressing, but I
feel that the majority of the members of this chamber
enjoy seeing the dignity of the Senate regularly violated
by this government. There are some exceptions. Senator
Benidickson has on several occasions expressed his opposition to the government's high-handed treatment of the
Senate. On December 18, 1970, Senator Forsey spoke
regarding an amendment to the Old Age Security Act,
and prefaced his remarks by saying:
a (1700)

I regret very much that we should be asked to
consider this legislation at this very late stage, and
with the added handicap pointed out by honourable
Senator Benidickson that if we delay the passage of
this legislation for any length of time a great many
people who are in very severe need will suffer. I need
hardly say, honourable senators, that I am most anxious to see that they should not suffer, but that they
should benefit as soon as possible. Nevertheless, I feel
obliged to make this protest.
I spoke in the same vein on that occasion. I mentioned
that we were not in a position to deal adequately with that
legislation in 1970; and the circumstances were similar to
those in which we find ourselves today.
A number of other senators who are members of the
majority party have also voiced their opposition to the
way in which the Senate is treated by this government. It
appears that they too do not have the ear of the government leader. He was not frightened when he was threatened this afternoon by Senator Carter that he, Senator
Carter, might vote against the government. He was certain that this would not happen today.
I have already said this once this week, and I will repeat
it: Unless the Senate is permitted to operate the way it
should without the interference of the government, it may
just as well be abolished. The way we are acting today,
which is the way we acted in December last, is to follow a
suicidal course. Of course, I will accept, as imperative to
the quick passage of this bill, the dissolution of the other
place and the calling of an election. But the government
leader says he does not know. If he does not know, how
can I assume that this possibility exists? If I were to
assume that the possibility exists under the Constitution, I
would have to assume it all the time, and I would never be
able adequately to discharge my responsibilities, because
there always exists the possibility of legislation being
interrupted by dissolution while it is being considered.
The other place, in dealing with this bill, was not worried about the possibility of dissolution. It waited until 4
o'clock, 24 hours before the deadline set by the house
leader in the other place, before sending it to us. So why
should we not take the same attitude? Why should we not
display the same fortitude, when facing a possible election, as that displayed in the other place, especially as the
danger of losing our seats does not exist and we are all
certain of being here again, God preserving us, after the
next election.
Honourable senators may have heard enough of my
introductory remarks to the bill; but I had to place on
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

record the fact that the circumstances in which we are
dealing with this legislation are impossible, that we are
being forced to do something which does violence to the
image of the Senate, and which is contrary to the responsibility placed on it by the Constitution.
Turning now to the legislation, the first thing I should
like to point out is the way in which the federal government has conveniently backed away from some of the
more laudable goals set down in the Victoria Charter.
The attitude of the federal government at that time was
that more autonomy should be given the provinces in
matters social and cultural. In addition, provision had to
be made for greater consultation between the federal
government and the various provincial governments.
But the attitude of the federal government seems to
have changed despite the recent recommendations for
increased provincial autonomy made by the Joint Committee on the Constitution. After having made all those
very palatable noises about increased autonomy for the
provinces and increased consultation with them, the federal government, without consultation with Quebec, unilaterally and arrogantly proceeded to raise old age pensions on a universal basis.
Premier Bourassa explained that this was "totally inadmissible and unacceptable," because it placed a crushing
burden on the social welfare program of his province.
What became of all the autonomy and consultation, the
spirit of fraternity and understanding that animated the
Victoria discussions? Mr. Trudeau, with the usual contempt he shows for anyone disagreeing with him, said to
Mr. Bourassa, "Well, you had only to accept the Victoria
Charter and we would have consulted you."
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: He was converted by Mr.
Stanfield.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not on that point. As far as consultation
with the provinces is concerned, I have no doubt that Mr.
Stanfield, who is a much more humble man than Mr.
Trudeau, would be more inclined to consult the provinces
than is the present Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: And in a much more sincere manner.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes; that is quite obvious. It is all very
well to say that Mr. Bourassa had only to accept the
Victoria Charter. But may I remind honourable senators
of the amendment made in 1951 to the British North
America Act, adding to it section 94A which says:
the Parliament of Canada may from time to time
make laws in relation to old age pensions in Canada,
but no law made by the Parliament of Canada in
relation to old age pensions shall affect the operation
of any law present or future of a provincial legislature
in relation to old age pensions.
That makes it clear that the federal Parliament has jurisdiction in the matter of old age pensions; but I think it
suggests also that there should be co-operation between
the two levels of government, since it creates a double
jurisdiction. Since both levels of government may legislate in this field, the least that could be expected is that
there should be some consultation between the two governments. Mr. Trudeau cannot pretend to ignore the
objections of Mr. Castonguay, the Minister of Social

May 18,1972

SENATE DEBATES

Affairs in the Province of Quebec. I suggest that the
statement made by Mr. Trudeau was hardly a responsible
attitude for the Prime Minister of Canada to adopt in
dealing with a Premier of a province. It could only serve
to generate more ill will. There could have been consultation. In fact, there should have been consultation. It would
not have been necessary for the Minister of Finance, the
Honourable John Turner, to reveal his budget to the Government of the Province of Quebec before revealing it to
the federal government. He had only to meet with the
Government of the Province of Quebec prior to the drafting of his budget.
* (1710)

By the way, this decision to increase the old age pensions and the income supplement is not really a budgetary
matter. It does not belong in a budget. It is a problem
which falls within the area of social payments. It was
included in the budget, of course, for an obvious reason,
that being that there is an election coming up. It is not a
matter that belongs in a budget at all; otherwise, everything would belong in a budget. It is a question of social
security and, as such, should have emanated from the
proper ministry.
As I said, he had only to meet with the Government of
the Province of Quebec and test their reaction to certain
pertinent ideas. Rightly or wrongly, the Quebec government would have preferred to see Ottawa increase its
contribution in other social areas, such as family allowances and welfare aid, rather than in the area of old age
pensions. Apparently, and again rightly or wrongly, the
aim of Quebec is to be much more selective in the handing
out of social welfare benefits. In that regard, Quebec felt
it had the support of the Honourable John Munro, but he
does not seem to have great influence in cabinet these
days. Perhaps it is because he was the one who proposed
some years ago to do away with the adjustment of pensions on a universal basis according to the rise in the
consumer price index.
There is no question here of a federal government not
feeling that the elderly are entitled to more money. It is a
case of a provincial government having other priorities in
the field of social welfare; a provincial government jealous of its rights in inatters cultural and social, ever desirous of extending its autonomy in these areas, wanting to
be consulted. It was not consu lted. Instead of consultation
before, we ended up with confrontation afterwards. No
federal government seriously interested in improving
relations with Quebec would have acted in this way. The
federal government, under Prime Minister Trudeau, has
gone out of its way to show Quebec who is boss, with
dismal results. Every time the federal government blunders into the Province of QuebecHon. Mr. Lamontagne: Be objective.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: -and obtusely flexes its political
muscle merely for the sake of bolstering its ego, then you
can be sure that another nail has just been hammered into
the coffin of Confederation.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Be objective.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I do not think I am exaggerating when I
say that thinking Quebecers of all political persuasions
are annoyed, are fed up with this continuous gauche fed-

401

eral intervention in areas that are properly provincialand when I say "gauche" I mean awkward.
Mr. Castonguay, Quebec's Minister of Social Affairs,
informs us that Ottawa promised him a year ago that it
would not increase its universal old age pension payments. The federal government went back on its word.
That is shameful behaviour.
The Trudeau Government has shown itself to be simply
incapable of dealing properly with the Province of
Quebec. One would have thought that with the provincial
premier being of the same political affiliation, the situation might have improved. It has not. If anything, it has
frighteningly deteriorated and, judging from recent
public statements by Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Marchand, will
continue to do so.
It appears Prime Minister Trudeau opened his mouth
and inserted his foot again recently on the subject of
Quebec. He said that to have a federal election in Quebec
now, in these times of labour unrest, would probably
favour his party because, and I quote:
the people of Quebec want to be reassured that there
is at least one strong government somewhere.
Mr. Marchand was probably speaking in the same vein
when he said that he would never have proposed a bill
like Bill 19.
This sort of affront to the Government of Quebec, this
obvious reference to what Messrs. Trudeau and Marchand see as weakness or incompetence on the part of the
Government of Quebec, cannot help but do violence to an
already strained relationship.
The federal government's ham-handed authoritarianism, its obsession with centralization and power, and its
obstinate wrong-headedness is making it ever more difficult for many responsible Quebecers to defend
Confederation.
To the large majority of the members of this house who,
like Senator Buckwold, feel that this administration is
doing such a praiseworthy job, I must say this: I hate to
disturb your equanimity, I detest having to put the boot to
your complacency, but the fact of the matter is that unless
the federal government which you support changes its
attitude towards Quebec, especially when there is, at least
politically speaking, a friendly government there, we all
may well wake up to find our beloved Canada badly
shaken.
This government's total failure to understand the spirit
which presently animates Quebec, its childish fear of
giving up authority, has resulted in Quebec's persistent
and legitimate requests for more autonomy and consultation to be insensitively disregarded.
In the case of the bill at hand, common sense was
ignored, promises were broken, and wishes were contemptuously disregarded.
Quebec is not happy, and if this government cannot
understand why, it should be replaced by a government
that will.
Honourable senators, I leave this matter concerning the
way this legislation affects the situation of the Government of Quebec and come now to its technical aspects.

402

SENATE DEBATES

An increase in old age pension, even if it does work out
to but a few measly dollars, is indeed welcome. However, I
shall point out that, because the government was so slow
in recognizing the plight of our old age pensioners, the
measures proposed in this bill are woefully inadequate
and fail completely to make up for ground lost over the
past few years.
Increases in old age pensions should have continued to
vary directly with increases in the cost of living, not
necessarily on the basis of the consumer price index,
which in many ways was inadequate, but with the real
increase in the cost of living. Between 1965 and 1970 the
government provided an annual increase of no more than
2 per cent in the pensions paid to senior citizens. The cost
of living, however, has never recognized such artificial
boundaries as 2 per cent, especially not under Liberal
governments.
As of December 1970 the 2 per cent escalator was made
to apply only to those receiving the guaranteed income
supplement. Pensions were frozen at $80 a month. That
meant an increase of 42 cents a month for the old age
pensioner at that time, or $5.04 a year, a great amount, as
was mentioned on that occasion. This was considered at
the time and was defended as an attempt on the part of
the government to exercise more selectivity, although it is
difficult to understand exactly what course the government was really trying to follow. The adjustment of the
pension in accordance with the price index has nothing to
do, in my opinion, with selectivity or universality.
a (1720)

It has to be remembered that the taxpayers have paid
for that universal pension. They have paid with dollars
that were worth much more than the dollars with which
the pensions are paid to them today. If selectivity was
deemed to be the proper course to follow in 1970, if Mr.
Munro's white paper on income security defended the
principle of selectivity, why is the same government now
making an about-face? It is totally inconsistent, but I
suppose that should not surprise me, since this government specializes in confusion.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Shame!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If you have something to say, say it.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: No.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I was trying to proceed a little more
quickly. It probably would be restful for me if my honourable friend were to put a question. I should like to speak
in French for a little while, if he wants me to.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Or you can put a question in English, Senator "Mountain."
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Perhaps I too would be embarrassed at doing that.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Probably it is my accent.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is all right; we are in good company as far as accent is concerned.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: He has not got a speech writer to
prepare a speech in English for him tonight; he can only
make interruptions. You will have to pardon him.
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.j

May 18, 1972

Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am probably worth a laugh
occasionally.
The change in the guaranteed income supplement provided for in this bill will not even bring Canada's povertystricken up to the 1971 poverty line. It is, I am sure
Senator Croll will agree, totally inadequate and unconscionably cynical. This government continues to guarantee
a certain number of older citizens abiding poverty; it
continues to ensure that they will suffer malnutrition in
substandard living conditions; it persists in making certain that countless thousands will not be relieved of the
burden of having to struggle to make ends meet.
I am sorry that Senator Croll is not here today. I hope
we will hear from him before this debate is over because,
after all, the comments he made when he presented the
report of his committee were in a way very critical of Mr.
Munro's white paper. I should like to hear what his reactions are to this bill. I hope it is only by accident that he is
away, because I think he could make a worth-while contribution to this debate. I am quite sure Senator Benidickson
also will be speaking, because I cannot assume that his
leader has given orders to the supporters of the government not to participate in this debate.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Have you?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Never, never!
Hon. Mr. Phillips: No, he would never think of such a
thing!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The attitude of this government seems
to be, "Let them worry about how they are going to
survive on the pittance we give them. Worrying will give
them something to do." According to this government,
you callously toss them a crumb, a few dollars a month,
and expect that they will demonstrate their unending
gratitude. In fact, the government only wants them to
remember the payments on election day; if the gratitude
is only demonstrated on that day the government will be
amply satisfied with the result. But our senior citizens will
not be taken in by a cheap ploy, I can assure you.
I was going to ask some questions about the effect of the
increases on the veterans' pensions, but I will keep them
for the committee stage. I suppose they are too technical
for this stage of the debate.
I turn now to the guaranteed income supplement. Most
Canadians are under the impression that this supplement
is to rise by $15 a month from its April 1972 level. That is
simply not so. It is the combined old age security pension
and the guaranteed income supplement that will rise by
$15, and it is rising by $15 over its April 1971 level, not the
April 1972 level. This means that the single pensioner who
receives the supplement will find that his April supplement of $57.70 will rise to $67.12, an increase of $9.42 a
month, not the $15 a month he was deliberately led to
believe he would receive. I am not saying the Leader of
the Government said that it would, but others in the
government made no effort to correct the misconception.
On the contrary, Senator Martin's figures were correct. I
checked them.
In conclusion, honourable senators, let me say that we
cannot but accept this bill in principle. We are in favour of
increasing pensions to our senior citizens. However, we
entirely disapprove of the fact that they were so slow in

Mauv 18 1972

May

coming, and that they are nowhere near that which could
be called adequate. It is quite obvious that the political
hucksters had a hand in all of this. I said before, and I
repeat, these increases should not have been announced
by Mr. Turner, the Minister of Finance, in his budget
speech. They should have been a decision by the government and announced by the Minister of National Health
and Welfare, whose responsibility it was.
This government must really fear the upcoming election
if it is willing to go to such extremes in its attempts to buy
votes. But this government, like most people when they
get desperate, has grossly miscalculated. The senior citizens of this country will not be taken in. They will recognize this manoeuvre for what it is-a despicable, cynical
trick by a morally bankrupt administration.
Besides the few dollars it is handing out on the eve of an
election in a way the government rejected a little more
than a year ago, there are many things that should be
considered about this bill. Again, I mention the discussion
of where the government is going in its choice of selectivity or universality, in its agreement with the suggestion in
the Victoria Charter that provincial governments should
have more to say in the field of social matters, and many
problems that were raised, as I mentioned, in the debate
in December 1971, in the last days before the Christmas
adjournment, by Senators Croll, Benidickson, Forsey and
many others. All these items should be discussed at this
time with regard to this bill.
Normally we should discuss this bill at length, but we
will see what we can get by way of information in committee. Again I say we should have had adequate time to deal
with this bill. I will see in committee if the problem of
sending the cheques is such an important one, or whether
in fact the government is simply trying to clear the way
for calling an election and to be able to send out these
cheques at the electorally appropriate time. If that is so, it
would be very simple to tell us, and we would certainly
not resist the opportunity of an election, because I think
the Canadian people are ready to make a change. For the
sake of just passing this bill and having it improved by
another government after the election, I would be willing
to give it third reading in a few minutes, and then royal
assent. I would want first to know, however, about the
statement of the Leader of the Government, repeating
what was said by the house leader of the government in
the other place. Is it really true that this bill cannot wait
until Tuesday? I will be very difficult to convince in this
regard, and in due course we will see what we should do.

The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable Senator Grosart.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Unless someone on the other side
wishes to speak, unless Senator Benidickson intends to
speakHon. Mr. Benidickson: You quoted me adequately and
showed that I was right in 1967.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You do not intend to speak now? It
would be more courteous, after I have spoken, to give a
chance to someone on that side to reply to me. That is why
I was suggesting that Senator Grosart yield to you, if you
intended to speak.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: You made no positive suggestion.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You do not call it a positive suggestion?
Apparently no one wants to speak on the government
side. That is the way they debate.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, my first
words in speaking to this bill must be to say personally
that I am sure honourable senators have been impressed
with the courage shown by the Leader of the Opposition
in the very difficult situation which was not of his making.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: It was lack of memory.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is evident you never want to engage in
a debate with me. Then, when I resume my seat, you
attack me.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: The situation has been clearly
outlined, but I think we should not lose sight of the fact,
made so clear by the Leader of the Opposition, that we
are faced once more with an affront to this chamber. It is
in many ways a more overt affront than any we have had
in my time here, because we have been faced with a
timetable by those who are completely cynical in any
consideration that might be given for the relationships
between the two houses of this Parliament and particularly between the government and this chamber.
I say that because, as far as I can remember, this is the
first time that this affront has been tied to the clock. This
is the first time the Leader of the Government in the other
place, speaking for the government, has set the deadline
for the passage of a bill, knowing that it was impossible,
under the rules of this house, for us to meet it-unless
those rules were suspended. I cite this clock aspect to
bring to the attention of honourable senators the very
serious nature of this affront and of the problem that
faces us so often under situations like this.
I say that the Leader of the Opposition has given us an
exhibition of courage in putting the interests of this chamber, of this Senate, ahead of purely partisan
considerations.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: He has taken a stand for the Senate,
and if some honourable senator wishes to rise and point
out to me where there was anything partisan of any kind
in the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, I
will sit down now and hear from him, by question or by
any other procedure he wishes to use to put forth that
accusation that seems to have been made by the usual
grumble that we get from time to time by those who are
not prepared to make their objections or their points clear
in the normal way of debate.
My intention was not to raise a partisan issue at this
time, it was to pay that tribute to the Leader of the
Opposition who has acted, in my view, in the very greatest
traditions of leaders of government and of opposition in
this chamber.
I repeat that in my view he set aside partisan considerations, because he was taking the risk that in standing for
the rights of the Senate he was putting himself and the
party which he represents in the possible danger of being
accused of holding up a bill which, we all know, is one
which has raised great expectations amongst a very large
proportion of our citizens. The figures given are that

404

SENATE DEBATES

probably 1,800,000 old age pensioners stand to benefit by
this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: We are all on that basis.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I repeat that it takes great courage to
take that stand. I repeat that in my view, in the light of
what has happened in this chamber as recently as last
December, and on other occasions, the time is long overdue for the Leader of the Opposition to take a stand such
as has been taken here today. I am personally happy that
he has taken it in a situation where we can honestly say
that it is not a partisan position, it is one which has been
taken in the interest of the future of this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Additionally, the Leader of the Opposition has made a plea for a greater understanding on the
part of the Government of Canada, the House of Commons and this chamber for those special viewpoints held
by so many of our fellow citizens in the Province of
Quebec.
I must say, as one who makes no pretense to be an
expert on the situation in Quebec, that I was surprised, I
was amazed, when I picked up the morning paper and
found the reaction of Premier Bourassa and some of his
ministers to this legislation. I could not believe that there
had not been a degree of consultation reaching some level
of consensus of agreement with the government of that
province in the present situation that confronts us all. It
seems incredible.
We have been presented here in this Senate with legislation which on the surface and in depth is good legislation.
It could be improved, of course, but it is basically good
legislation. It seems to me that there must be something
very wrong somewhere in the planning of the policies of
the government when legislation of this kind can result in
increasing the problems that face Confederation in the
Province of Quebec. As I said, I am not an expert, I could
not tell anyone why this legislation has been found to be
so objectionable in Quebec. Ail I know is that it is-the
evidence is there-and that it has created a cabinet crisis.
* (1740)

Surely there is something wrong with it when a bill to
increase the benefits to our old age pensioners can cause a
crisis in Quebec at a time when the last thing any of us
wants is another crisis in the Province of Quebec in
respect of its relationship to the Government of Canada. I
say it is beyond me to understand how this can have come
about. It is beyond me to understand how it can have
come about when we have as Prime Minister a man who
himself is a distinguished citizen of Quebec. Although I
was not in any way a supporter of the Prime Minister and
his party at the last election, I thought I could find some
satisfaction in the result of that election in the hope,
which I believe was shared by many Canadians, that a
French Canadian Prime Minister in Ottawa could very
well be the answer to that very great problem that concerns and worries us all as Canadians. It seems to me that
over the years that hope, that great expectation, has not
been realized. Again I am not going to be critical in detail,
because these matters by and large are beyond the scope
of my experience or expertise, but the crowning proof of
the dashing of the great expectations of many Canadians
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

May 18, 1972

surely is this bill. But in spite of the fact that it needs the
sober second thought of this chamber, and in many of its
provisions the second opinion which this chamber is so
fully qualified to give, we are faced with this time affront.
Honourable senators are, I am sure, well aware that a
good deal of the competence of this Senate in dealing with
legislative measures has been found to be in committee.
Our committee system has provided the opportunity on
many occasions for citizens to come before a legislative
body in Ottawa and state their objections. A classic example of that, of course, was the tax reform bill. Honourable
senators will recall that in the other place it was not
referred to a standing committee but was dealt with in
Committee of the Whole. As a result the Senate was able
on that occasion to provide a forum for hundreds of briefs
and certainly scores of citizens to come to state their
objections.
I am sure we are all proud, even those of us who
objected to some aspects of the handling of the tax reform
bill, that one of the results was that there were actual
amendments to the original intention of the framers of
that bill. Senator Hayden in this chamber the other day
told us that in the new bill which will come before us in
due course a number of the amendments that had been
suggested by the committee were incorporated but that
the majority were not. I very well remember the statement
of the minister in our committee that the bill had been
greatly improved by the work of the Senate and that
many of the amendments proposed in our Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce
were incorporated in that bill.
I mention this to suggest that there has to be something
wrong in the relationship between the two houses or
between the government and this house when with
respect to an important bill such as this-a bill which is
clearly subject to improvement by amendments, amendments which could be accepted if we were able to deal
with them in the ordinary process of our committees-we
are not able to deal with it properly. I believe that if we
were able to call the minister, to call experts not only from
within the government but from the social sciences, particularly those interested in this type of legislation, we
would make those amendments. I have some confidence
that they would be accepted. But we are faced with a
situation in which this Senate is being denied completely
its basic right to use its committee procedure to improve a
bill.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I hope Senator Grosart will not mind
my pointing out to him, before his statement goes out, that
that is not a fact. If Senator Grosart or anyone else wishes
to take that course, that is his right. I do not think it is fair
to keep repeating that the situation is otherwise. If Senator Grosart wishes to amend this bill, he has that right.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am sorry that the Leader of the
Government feels that what I said was unfair. My own
view is that it is not unfair. My own view is that it is a
statement of the facts as they face us. I do not want to
repeat what I have said, but perhaps it is necessary. We
have been told that there is a deadline and that if this
Senate fails to meet that deadline 1,800,000 citizens will
not receive cheques in June in the amounts that they are
looking for. The other place was told that by the Leader of

referred to the committee of which I happen to be chairman, and as long as I am chairman all members of that
committee will be free to fully discuss this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What is your question of privilege?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Senator Grosart has indicated he
would not feel free to discuss it.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He did not say that. I would request that
my honourable friend make his speech following Senator
Grosart's if he has something to say. It would be a change
if someone on the government side spoke. There seems to
be dead silence on the other side of this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Honourable senators, on this question
of privilege I would like to ask the chairman of that
committee whether he has sent out notices to any groups
which might be affected, so that they might appear before
his committee?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Unfortunately I have not,
because this bill has not been referred to committee yet.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Will it be referred to committee?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think in fairness to Senator Grosart
he should be allowed to continue his speech.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is not fair to suggest that Senator
Lamontagne is not able to get out of his own dilemma.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I might say I
have no objection whatever to these interruptions because
as it has often been said a change is as good as a rest. I
respect the point of privilege which Senator Lamontagne
has raised. May I assure him by saying that I was not in
any way reflecting on the manner in which he would
conduct the hearing. I was reflecting upon the position he
as well as all honourable senators are being put in by this
particular timetable. I am happy he rose to protest
because if I were in his position I would protest also,
having been put in the impossible position where whatever the rights of honourable senators might be, he as
chairman of this committee would be in a difficult position to enforce or acknowledge those rights. I am not
saying he would not acknowledge them. I am saying he
would be in a very difficult position. I am aware of his
sensitivity in this area and I sympathize entirely with the
position in which he finds himself.
Honourable senators, we are entitled to address ourselves to the question regarding what causes these problems. Why does this happen? We are not dealing with this
for the first time. This situation has arisen several times in
my short history in this chamber. The Leader of the
Opposition quoted Senator Desruisseaux who said this
must never happen again. I remember on one occasion my
seat-mate said that if this happens again he would not
give leave. Yet it continues to happen.
My plea is that this chamber, the Leader of the Government, the Leader of the Government in the other place,
the Prime Minister or whoever else may be involved,
should take a hard look at this problem to determine
whether there is not a solution. There is a solution, and
part of that solution is in our hands. We should make it
0 (1750)
clear that we have rules and they are good rules. One of
the purposes of these rules is to prevent exactly what is
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I rise on a
happening now, and also to protect the prestige and integprivilege. I understand this legislation will be
point of

the Government there. We have been told so by the
Leader of the Government here.
It is now a quarter to six on Thursday night. The kind of
committee procedure that I am speaking of, the kind that
has done credit to this Senate over the years, has been the
kind of procedure where we made it clear that the Senate
committee would sit and where there was sufficient publicity so that anybody from anywhere in Canada who
wished to come before a Senate committee could do so.
For the Leader of the Government to say to me now that
it is not a fact that we have been denied that right is, I
think, completely unfair and completely wrong.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I point out again, just in fairnesssince my honourable friend talks about fairness to the
Senate-that some of us are also concerned about the
interests of the people, a large number of people. But if
Senator Grosart wishes to call witnesses, he can take any
initiative in that regard. That is his responsibility or the
responsibility of any other senator. He is a completely free
agent as is every other senator. But some of us may be
concerned, as all parties seemed to be, that the proposed
increased benefits to the old age pensioners in this case
are such that we ought not to stand in the way of their
getting these benefits. That is my view. That may not be
Senator Grosart's view. If it is not, he has the right to take
steps to further his view.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Oh, corne on! That is blackmail and
you know it!
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I will answer that myself. It is my
view that we should not stand in the way of old age
pensioners receiving the benefits of this legislation as
soon as possible. That is my view. It is also my view that if
I exercise the rights suggested by the Leader of the Government I will stand in the way. Why? Because of the
timetable he has set. There is no other reason.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The timetable I have set?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes, you have set it. Excuse me, but
the Leader of the Government has set the timetable here
and has made it very clear that if this timetable is not met
the expectations of these old age pensioners will not be
met either. I say to him that it is absurd, then, to say to me
that I have the right to hold up this bill. I do not have the
right.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Of course you have the right.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: The reason I do not have the rightHon. Mr. Martin: You have the power, too.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: The reason I do not have the right-at
least the right in conscience-is that this Senate has again
been squeezed into a corner by an intolerable decision to
force us to pass legislation under threat-under threat of
denying the expectation of these 1,800,000 Canadians.
Under that threat we are being denied that right. The
Leader of the Government is well aware that while some
are free all are not equally free. This most certainly
applies to the situation we find ourselves in at this particular moment.

SENATE DEBATES

rity of this chamber. We continually put our rules aside. I
do not know whether it is a precedent, but in the last few
years we have had this extraordinary device where the
Leader of the Government, the deputy leader, or the deputy-deputy leader of the government rises and suggests we
suspend our rules requiring a certain time interlude. Over
and over again we have seen this device used, not specifically requesting a suspension of the rules but requesting a
general suspension. I hope we will begin to reaffirm our
role in the Constitution by denying ourselves the luxury of
this disgraceful motion.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: This is nonsense.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: The deputy leader of the government
suggests this is nonsense.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It is, too.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Now he says "It is, too." I can understand this because he is one who has moved this motion,
and I would not expect him to come forth as a contrite,
repentant sinner. However, I hope he will reflect upon
this. I feel we should address ourselves to the problem of
avoiding the occurrence of this situation in the future and
tidying up our own house. We need to notify those who
may be concerned, those in the other place, that there are
certain rules and procedures we follow for the protection
of our rights and that they will not be set aside. If we did
this I feel we would be on the road to eradicating this
problem.
I am dealing with this at some length because I believe
there is not a member in this house who would not like to
see a solution to this problem. I believe there is a solution
and like most solutions, the place to begin is at home.
Honourable senators, it is six o'clock and under Rule 12
I move that we adjourn.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am not suggesting that there should
not be any more speeches, but I was hoping that the
committee could meet at eight o'clock. However, if honourable senators do not wish that to happen they can so
decide. The house is the master of its own rules. I simply
point out that whether we like it or not, there is the fact.
The officials will be present to tell us the consequences
with regard to increases in pensions of old age pensioners
if the bill does not become law tomorrow. If any of us
wish to prevent that happening, then that is our right. But
I make this plea to the house: could we not sit for a while
and see whether we can get this bill to committee this
evening?
* (1800)

I might point out that there is another bill providing for
increases in veterans' pensions. While I am not aware that
the same mechanical problem with regard to cheques
applies to this other bill, honourable senators will have to
determine whether there are other circumstances which
make it desirable for that bill to go to committee. What I
am trying to sayHon. Mr. Flynn: The committee cannot sit while the
Senate is sitting. We cannot deal with veterans' pensions.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Not without leave. We would have to
ask for leave.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am willing to discuss the matter with
those on our side who intended to speak. If you wanted to
adjourn the Senate until tomorrow and have the committee meet tonight, that is all right. We may discuss that.
You could wait until 8.15 p.m. and discuss it at that time.
If you want to adjourn the Senate until tomorrow and call
the committee, we might go into committee. But the
Senate would have to be adjourned until tomorrow.
The Hon. the Speaker: Senator Grosart pointed out,
under Rule 12, that if at six o'clock the business is not
concluded, the Speaker leaves the chair until eight
o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The Senate is master of its own rules.
Hon. Mr. White: With regard to veterans' pensions, does
the Leader of the Government expect to have the veterans' bill passed and royal assent tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I had hoped it would be possible to
pass these two bills providing increases to old age pensions and veterans' pensions by tomorrow, but it is up to
senators to decide.

Hon. Mr. White: Would the Senate sit tomorrow
morning?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think we should sit as long as is
necessary to deal with the two measures. I had hoped that
we could have sent the present bill to committee for
immediate study. The argument that is being put forward
could be put forward before the committee and, more
particularly, evidence could be brought forward on the
question of the mechanical arrangements for the issuing
of cheques for the old age security payments. No honourable senator is in a special position. We have to make up
our minds whether or not we want these bills to go
throughHon. Mr. Grosart: On a point of order.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Or whetherHon. Mr. Grosart: On a point of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order. There is a point of order
by Senator Grosart.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: My point of order, Mr. Speaker, is that
you have given a ruling. The Leader of the Government is
now making a speech. For a while I thought it might make
sense to put aside the strict interpretation of our rules
while the two leaders discussed the timetable. That is
understandable. But I suggest that it is quite improper
and totally out of order for the Leader of the Government
now to make a speech dealing with matters that I have
raised for debate.
While I am on my feet may I make it very clear that in
calling attention to the clock, under Rule 12, it was not,
and is not, my intention unnecessarily to prolong the
debate in any way. I believe I have things to say. I believe
they should be said. I have already indicated that there
are some amendments that could be made to this bill.
That is the only reason why I adjourned the debate. I
called attention to the clock, having in mind Rule 12, and
that we meet at eight o'clock. If I am not out of order, I see
no reason why, if we meet at eight o'clock, the committee
cannot sit tonight.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 8 p.m. the sittîng was resumed.
The Hon. the Speaker: I understand that the honourable
Senator Grosart had the floor.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourabie senators, at six o'clock I
was discussing the latest timetabie confrontation and suggesting that sureiy it is possible in some way to prevent
the recurrence of this. I merely add now that I amn qulte
sure it is possible for men of good will, intelligence, and
experience in politlcs both here and in the other place, to
sit down and seriousiy look at this probiem. I just simply
cannot believe that this has to go on occasion after occasion the way it does.
I end my comments on that by making a plea to the
Leader of the Government, who I know is as anxious as
any of us to avoid this type of situation, to bring this to the
attention of those who can properly deal with it. We have
various mechanisms for and conferences between the
bouses on much iess important things, and perhaps he can
initiate the kind of talks that wouid bring sorne sense into,
this situation. I amn sure that could be done.
Your Honour, before you mile me out of order for not
speaking from my own place, I wiil move over.
The Hon. the Speaker: I had not noticed.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I shail not detain the Senate very long
in concludîng my remarks. As I emphasized at 6 o'ciock, I
have no intention at this time of delayîng passage of this
legisiation in any way. In my view, if this bill went to
committee in the normai way, with sufficient time for it to
be given thorough examination, some amendments would
be forthcoming from the Senate which would improve it.
The Leader of the Opposition has mndicated that he has
some very definite views on this, and has suggested that
because they concerfi in sorne detail the clauses of the bill,
they shouid perhaps more properly be discussed in committee. However, with your indulgence, I should like to
indicate some of the areas in this bill which I think the
Senate wouid, under the proper circurnstances, have
improved. I say this because it is unfortunate that the
Senate, with its excellent record in this whole probiemn of
aging, should find itself in this difficuit position.
As the Leader of the Government indicated, it was our
own committee that originaily suggested the income suppiement. I well recail that at that time, aithough we had
carefuily examined the income situation of senior citizens,
it did not occur to us that the number of senior citizens
who might require the income supplement would be as
high as it is. The current figures seem to indicate that
something like 60 per cent of recipients of oid age pensions require sorne part of the incorne supplement. In my
view, the very considerable increase in the income supplement is one of the very best features of this bil.
On the other hand, it has been said that in spite of the
quite generous increases we are stiil legislating a level of
income for a substantiai number of our people that
appears to be below the official poverty line. I do not

think I arn breaking any confidence when I say that I
believe the Leader of the Governmnent has some interesting figures, which he has flot put before us, to give substance to the statement he made earlier that at the present
time the level of old age pension benefits in Canada is the
highest in the world.
I, personally, perhaps in committee or through a statement by the Leader of the Government, wouid like to see
those figures. I arn not questîoning them. I believe them to
be accurate. We so often hear that Sweden has such
tremendously high levels of welfare payments in various
fields, and we are just beginning to discover that the
Swedish legisiation is not ail that good when compared
with Canadian social security legisiation. However, if we
are stiil below the officiai poverty line I think we should
know that we are, and why.
Another matter that rnight weli be discussed is the statement of the Leader of the Governrnent that there is no
means test attached to the income supplement. In one way
that is true, as long as you are thinking of a means test
only in terms of assets. Let us face it, there is a means test
in respect of incorne. We can argue indefiniteiy what
"means" means, but it can mean incorne just as weil as
assets. We stiil have a means test in the income suppiement, and I suggest that if the committee had sufficient
time it might well go into this in considerable detail, and
find out what the justification is for the continuance of an
income means test in the oid age pension, when one of the
great principles of our oid age security legisiation has
been the fact that it is a universal old age pension, and
therefore without a means test.
I think the committee could also, perhaps by amendment, persuade the government that they may have made
a mistake in not carrying the retroactive features of the
base ail the way back to the time when the last adjustment
was made. My information is that if the year-to-year
increases had been carried ail the way back the present
basic figure of $82.88 for the universai oid age pension
would be $90, which I arn toid wouid mean-although I
have not checked the figures-an additionai expenditure
this year of only perhaps $18 million. In view of some of
the other expenditures, it might have been reasonable to
say to the old age pensioners, "Yes, we wiil carry it ail the
way back to the increase in the cost of living since the last
adjustment."
* (2010)

This was the request, and I hope I wiil not; be thought to
be partisan in this, because mistakes occur in these fields
over the years.
It does recail to me the fact that in the 1956 budget there
was an increase of some $6 in the oid age pension, which
proved to be unacceptable to the old age pensioners. I arn
rnerely suggesting-in view of the fact that there is some
taik that some time this year or the next there is going to
be an election-that perhaps the government might reconsider that, as to whether they might not be making what is
vulgarly referred to at times as the "Six Buck Harris"'
mistake.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: You want an election now?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And you do not?

408

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Grosart: A final problem, of course, would be
that of the old age pensioner who still has his spouse
younger. I have not looked at the arithmetic, but I am sure
that if we had time we would like to explore this, because
obviously there may be very great hardship here. An old
age pensioner reaching the age of 65, with no other means
of support than the pension, might well say he still has to
support a wife or, if it is a lady, that she still has to
support a husband-and it seems to happen in these
modern days. So it could be said that there might be a
degree of hardship, if not unfairness, here. The situation
in regard to two married old age pensioners who reach
the pensionable age at about the same time is obviously
fair, because they are both getting the pension, but in
these days men sometimes marry much younger women.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Why not, as the Leader of the Opposition asked. Should they then be saddled with long-term
penalties for choosing a younger person.
I am obviously contracting my remarks, because I do
want to expedite the passage of the bill. Thank you for
your forbearance.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: May I ask again, through Your
Honour, if there is not someone on the other side interested in this bill, or who would like to speak on it? I remember when we used to have one person from each side.
Have you no one over there interested in it? If you have, I
will be perfectly willing to give you fair play. Is there
anyone over there who wishes to speak now?
Honourable senators, I find this rather bizarre and odd,
after all the publicity and all the speeches we had from
the other side in the Special Committee on Poverty, and
so on. What a silent committee; what a silent group you
are!
Hon. Mr. McDonald: They are in favour of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: They are in favour of the bill, says
Senator McDonald. You could not even think of an
improvement? I have too much respect for you to imagine
that you would take that bill as it is right now, and accept
it without making an improvement. You are an intelligent
man, Senator McDonald, and I am sure that you could
come up with many improvements. At any rate, are there
any further interruptions, sir?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: No.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: None? Fine. Now that we have settled
that, I will continue. In my present mood I think of the
Mother's Day card my children gave my wife. It was a
card depicting the cross and there were certain beatitudes
inscribed on it. As I think of that I say to myself, "Now I
know why this bill is coming through. It contains the
Liberal beatitude: Blessed are the aged for they shall
inherit increased benefits retroactive, especially at election time, and they shall inherit the earth."
But, honourable senators, I find that that really does not
fit in with this afternoon's discussion, because seven
weeks ago the party to which I am proud to belong, the
Conservative Party, moved an amendment in the other
place suggesting this very thing. It was interesting to note
the reaction of various people. At that time the Minister of
National Health and Welfare was against the amendment,
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

May 18, 1972

saying that we had to have selectivity. But within a short
space of six or seven weeks he did an about-face. I suppose for a Liberal that is an exceedingly short time, but it
is reasonable to expect that a cabinet minister would be a
little more stable than that. He did a complete about-face
at that time. He said we had to have selectivity. Those who
needed the money most had to receive it and, therefore,
there would be no change in the present legislation.
Perhaps it is unnecessary that I should remind honourable senators that it was the Liberal Party, which is now
attempting to impose closure in this Senate, which voted
down that very motion. Yet tonight we find that we must
have this bill passed by a certain hour, by a certain time,
or no one gets benefits.
What happened in the intervening seven weeks? What
Gallup Poll or what census did you take that made you
change your minds? Seven weeks ago, honourable Senator Martin, you did not think as you do tonight. Why? Not
an answer. Not a flicker of interest. I know why, and so do
you. This is being done deliberately to mislead the electorate on a certain date in July. If I am wrong, I offer the
honourable gentleman, for whom I have so much respect,
the opportunity to stand up and deny the fact that I am
right. Will you stand up and deny that this whole thing
was designed for a certain date in July?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Can we stand up?
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Senator Lamontagne, it would not
matter whether you were standing up or lying down. You
are useless in either position.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: That is very kind.
a (2020)

Hon. Mr. Phillips: I am very happy to welcome Senator
McIlraith to this chamber. I have not looked up his vote
on the motion. Perhaps he would indicate how he voted on
that occasion. Did Senator McIlraith vote for the increase
at that time, or did he vote against it? When I am through
speaking I would like him to explain his attitude at that
time. Naturally, he voted against it. His regime told him to
vote against it, and when a Liberal is told to do something
he does it-there is no question. There is no tomfoolery
about it. He either does it, or he is excommunicated.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He goes home.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Yes, he goes home. In some cases this
is even worse than being excommunicated. I am sure my
friend, Senator Martin, was not listening when I directed
my question to him. I asked, "When you voted this motion
down in the other place seven weeks ago did you have a
date in July in mind? Is this your ultimatum? Did you
have a July date in mind?"
Hon. Mr. Langlois: He was not there.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I happen to be in the Senate now. I
used to be in the House of Commons many years ago.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: You no longer attend the cabinet
meetings, obviously, or you would have known what attitude the government was taking at that time. Are you
excluded from those meetings also?
The recommendations from the Conservative Party
were much more generous than those recommended in
this bill. If anyone wishes to take the time to debate this

f
May 18, 1 7" 1)

~ENATF~ nEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

matter, I am quite prepared to do so. Otherwise I will skip
that portion of my speech, and leave it for committee. Is
anyone prepared to say that the Conservative proposals
were not more generous and fair than the Keith Davey
advertising you are giving us this evening?
Well, honourable senators, since no one has replied to
my question, I presume that we have consent that the
Conservative proposals are much more reasonable than
those proposed in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: You don't have to find the money. It is
much easier to be generous if you are not charged with
the responsibility of the government and do not have to
find the money.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: When Senator Forsey rises in this
debateHon. Mr. Flynn: And from the wrong side of the house
too.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Yes. When Senator Forsey rises like
that, I have difficulty in not associating him with Stanley
Knowles. They have so much in common, except that the
member for Winnipeg in the other place does not have a
moustache. I am sure honourable senators will agree with
me that our proposals are better than those which either
the Liberal Party or the NDP have offered.
I am a little confused. I received from someone a note to
the effect that there was an agreement between the
Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition that a committee meeting would be held at 8.30 p.m.
Well, ultimatums be damned, I still intend to take a few
more minutes to say what I wish to say, whether honourable senators like it or not. I will restrict my time, but I
still intend to have a few more licks at the government
and I will have more on third reading.
Over the past couple of years we have listened to the
honourable senator who sits on the left of the government
leader-it is an unfortunate position for him, but apparently it is one that he has inherited-make recommendations on poverty and guaranteed income supplements. We
have heard this from him almost ad nauseum, but he has
never offered a solution to the problem.
At one time a committee ventured to recommend a
minimum figure, but even with all your Keith Davey
advertising, the honourable senator on the other side of
the house is still wrong and is deliberately misleading the
electors.
Those who are to get the increase under the guaranteed
income supplement will not receive $15 per month, but are
likely to receive about $9.
At the time I first became a candidate, the Leader of the
Government in the Senate was then a distinguished Liberal. He had such a bright future ahead of him, yet he came
out with an increase in old age pensions of $6 per month.
That represented a cup of coffee a day. Now he has come
out with the same thing, the difference being that he is
making it retroactive to January 1.
*

(2030)

By the way, I dislike this idea of saying old age pensioners; I am going to call them our senior citizens. Our senior
citizens at that time got a cup of coffee a day from the
government. That was the generosity of the then Minister

of National Health and Welfare. Today we have changed
that. Now you get, retroactive to January 1, a whole gallon
in one day, and I am sure that if a good many Liberal
organizers had their way they would have that coffee
rather well spiked on that day. After that, allowing $9 a
month and allowing for inflation, they can have another
cup of coffee every second day.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Irish coffee at that price.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: Spiked coffee.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: It would be spiked, yes. Knowing the
situation in Ireland I rather hesitate to tread where angels
fear to follow, and neither Senator Langlois nor myself
are angels, so I do not think we should tread into the Irish
situation. They have enough problems without you and I
getting involved.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: If you pay that much you should at
least ask for Irish coffee.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Well you can give them one drink of
Irish coffee; that will do them for a year. Never mind their
other problems as long as they have one coffee.
Thank you very much, Senator Martin. I heard you turn
around and tell him to shut up.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: He did not say that. That is your own
idea.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: He should have.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I had a long list of notes here. There
are a good many things I should like to go into, but I will
leave them for committee and for third reading, whenever
third reading comes up. I presume it will be Tuesday next.
That is our normal pattern.
The thing that really disturbs me and annoys me is the
fact that you are using the Keith Davey advertising technique. You are misleading the public. You are giving these
people, the people that you talked about, Senator Martinthose who had contributed so much to Canada, who had
given their sons and daughters to Canada-and you do
not have one qualm, one quirk of conscience in using the
Keith Davey technique in leading them into believing that
they are going to get $15 per month. They are not, in fact.
Look at your figures. They will be lucky if they get $9 per
month. The Minister of Finance, the Honourable John
Turner, says, "We have an expansionary budget. We are
giving confidence." But at the same time he says that
there are more Canadians going on guaranteed income
supplement. If we are going to be so successful, why are
more Canadians going on guaranteed income supplement? The Canada Pension Plan is coming into effect, of
course, and that should have a certain effect. Why, if the
predictions in the budget are so good, are more Canadians
going on guaranteed income supplement?
I hesitate again, and it really pains me, honourable
senators, to ask one of you of the Liberal Party to get up
and explain some of these things. I might as well be
perfectly honest. There are moments when I have the
feeling that you do not understand the situation. You have
been told to take this as an election gimmick. Is that not
right, Senator Lamontagne? You have been told to take it
as an election gimmick and you have so taken it. It will be
passed and blessed, and so forth, and passed on in great
advertisements throughout the newspapers.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: No one tells me anything any
more.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: No one tells you anything any more.
Well, I can understand that. I will not say anything more
than that, Senator Lamontagne.
I have great respect for Senator Benidickson. I am
thinking now of what I consider to be one of his best
speeches that I have ever heard him make in either the
House of Commons or the Senate. He is a very able and
distinguished Canadian. The speech I refer to was made
when we were discussing the removal of the escalation
clause. I have Senate Hansard here of December 18, 1970.
Senator Benidickson pointed out a good many facts to the
present government.
Honourable senators, we often become frustrated when
we make speeches which we feel are not listened to, but I
feel that there is one person who could, perhaps, contribute a good deal to this debate if he were free-if he were
not "Martinized"-and that is the honourable Senator
Benidickson. At that time he mentionedHon. Mr. Benidickson: I am waiting to get to committee.
Will you not help us?
Hon. Mr. Phillips: You did not go to committee at that
time, Senator Benidickson. If you care to check Hansard
you will find you did not go to committee. You were very
eloquent in saying that the government had broken
faithHon. Mr. Benidickson: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Hansard conveys that impression.
You may deny the Hansardrecord, if you wish, but your
remarks are there. You initialled them, I presume, as is
your right and the right of all honourable senators. You
said the government had broken faith with those senior
citizens when they fixed the rate at $80 per month and
removed the escalator clause. Do you remember, sir,
referring to the fact that there was still a one per cent
surcharge to pay for that? I should very much like to hear
an explanation of all the tax reforms we have had. We
suffered through the tax reform bill. At that time it was
going to cost about $15 million. I understand now the
figures are up to $18 million. That is controlled inflation
under the Liberal government. You could not provide $15
million at that time; the money just was not available; it
was needed for those underprivileged people.

Then "Gentle Ben" came along with his tax reform bill.
Everybody was getting a tax reduction. I do not think it
unfair if I ask honourable senators opposite to tell me
which of "Gentle Ben's" tax reductions provided the
moneys now needed to give $2.88 per month, six cents a
* day, a postage stamp per day, to the old age pensioners.
Which of your tax reductions provided the money to give
this postage stamp increase to our senior citizens?
I do not want to appear to be picking on my friend
Senator Benidickson this evening, but at that time he was
calling on an awful lot of names. I would never accuse the
honourable senator of being a name-dropper, but he went
through a fairly extensive list of names. Probably one of
the most respected being that of your good wife. Can I ask
Senator Benidickson to get up and explain to us where
[Hon. Mr. Phillips.]

May 18, 1972

this money came from and how there was this change of
heart? Was it through your good influence, or was it
through the effect of a Gallup Poll?
In committee I will have a lot of questions to ask, and if
Senator Lamontagne develops that smirk again I will
have even more.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: The answer is obvious. It was
through Senator Benidickson's own good influence, not
through the Gallup Poll.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: That is very good. I will not delay the
passage of the bill. I am in favour of it, as are all Conservatives. However, I am confused. I do not understand why
seven weeks ago you could not pass this measure and now
tonight we have closure and a deadline of June 30. Cannot
you tell us before we finish second reading? Cannot you
tell us that before we go to committee?
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I move that this
bill be now sent to the Standing Senate Committee on
Health, Welfare and Science. I understand arrangements
have been made for us to meet shortly.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I just want clarification of this. Are we
meeting as soon as the house adjourns?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We are?
Hon. Mr. Martin: We have all been sent notices.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The notices could not be sent before the
passing of this motion.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The meeting will be held in Room 356.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is like the cheques. The notices
could not have been prepared in advance.
Hon. Mr. Martin: They are being sent now.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: May I direct a question to the chairman of the committee? It is my understanding that our
rules provide me the opportunity of directing a question
to the chairman of the committee. Has he sent out any
invitations to any interested groups to appear?
Hon. Mr. Martin: They are going to senators now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On a point of order. I suggest the pages
wait until the motion is adopted before distributing the
notices.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: You can't win!
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I am glad the Leader of the
Opposition points out that one of his supporters is out of
order.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I have not done that at all. I will explain
to Senator Lamontagne what I meant.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: On a point of order. I was quite within
my rights to address that question, and I repeat it and ask
for a reply. Have you sent out any invitations?

Hon. Mr. Flynn: A question has been directed to the
chairman of the committee, whether he has invited some
interested people to appear before the committee tonight.
Han. Mr. Lamontagne: We have not, of course, been in a
position to invite anyone before us.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is a frank answer. The answer is
no. The second question is: wil you do that?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: We will see about that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The committee has to decide.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If to the second question you had given
the sarne frank answer as you did to the first, you would
have said no.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Might I ask a question of the
Leader of the Government? There is another bill dealing
with war veterans' pensions. There is a further bill known
as C-2, the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 1972. What will
happen to those two bis if we go into committee now and
there is no quorum? There is only a handful of senators
here. What happens then?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Obviously if there is no quorum there
cannot be a meeting, but I arn sure there will be a quorum.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: There will be a quorum here and in
the committee?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No, in the committee. With regard to
the Senate itself, we have had discussions, and it is proposed that we would meet now in committee and the
Senate would adjourn unti tomorrow morning at 10.30.
At that time, depending on the progress made by the
commîttee, we would deal with this bill, if it is reported,
and would proceed with the legisiation proposing other
increases for veterans.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: At what time?
Hon. Mr. Martin: At 10.30 in the morning. If possible, we
would have an opening speech on the Criminal Law
Amendment Bill, 1972, but I do not; think we would get
any further than that.

The. Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, there is a
motion that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Science.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the

Hon. Mr. Phillipa: I have one question, Mr. Speaker.
Considering the fact that the committee is dealing with
this bill tonight, and considering the assurances given by
the honourable Senator Lamontagne that the witnesses
wiil be asked to appear, is it proposed that the Senate and
the committee will meet at the same time tomorrow morning; or will we foilow our normai rule, and if the Senate is
sitting there will be no committee meeting?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: As f ar as I understand the rules

APPENDIX
(See p. 382)
COUNCIL OF EUROPE
REPORT ON THE THIRD PARLIAMENTARY AND SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE
HELD AT LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, APRIL 1972.
1. REPRESENTATION

The 5-day Conference was attended by some 150 European scientists, parliamentarians, science managers and
administrators (national and international), and a few
invited participants from other countries.
I attended by special invitation directed to our Senate
Committee on National Science Policy. Mr. Ian Watson,
M.P., of our House of Commons attended as a representative of the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association.
Among other non-European representatives were Honourable James Symington, member of the U.S. House of
Representatives' Committee on Science and Aeronautics
and Chairman of the sub-Committee on International Cooperation in Science and Space; and Mr. Takao Fujimoto,
Director of the Special Committee of the House of
Representatives (Japan) for the Promotion of Science and
Technology.
All important European science organizations were
represented by delegations or individuals including: Ministers responsible for scientific affairs in member states;
permanent representatives to the Council of Europe; the
European Parliament (EEC); the Assembly of the Western
European Union; committees responsible for scientific
affairs in national parliaments; "Science and Parliament
Associations"; national scientific research councils; The
U.K. Institute of Aviation Medicine; European Organizations concerned with Nuclear Research (CERN); launcher
development, space research, molecular biology, nuclear
energy; and international organizations including the
International Telecommunications Union, World Metereological Organization, UNESCO and OECD.
The Chairman of the Conference was M. Olivier Reverdin, the distinguished President of the Consultative
Assembly of the Council of Europe, attended by Mr. John
Priestman, the Clerk of the Assembly and the Chief of the
Secretariat, Mr. Hans-Christian Christiansen.
PARTICIPATION

The conference extended a special request to the
Canadian and American representatives to suggest
amendments to the Draft Resolutions. The following
Amendment by Mr. Watson reflected one of the major
concerns of both Parliamentarians and Scientists and had
immediate acceptance:
"that the Council of Europe, in collaboration with the
OECD, consider the establishment of a data bank
designed to identify and desçribe current research in
member States of the OECD and the Council of
Europe, as well as of a data bank designed to provide
details of all legislation in high interest areas in these
countries, and that the Council of Europe should
undertake, in collaboration with the OECD, a feasibility study of such a data bank or banks".

I put forward two "addenda". The first was accepted
without change as follows:
"that visible national science budgets comprising the
totality of proposed public sector expenditures on
research and development and other scientific activities, should be made available to Parliaments at as
early a time in the budgetary process as possible and
in any event prior to the commitment of public funds
to the component expenditures."
In the second Addenda I asked only for an affirmative
response by European Governments to "any initiative that
might be forthcoming" for the formation of an international scientific and Technological Union of Parliamentarians. The Conference, however, decided that the
Assembly of the Council of Europe should take the initiative itself, and proposed that the resolution appear in the
"Conclusions of the Conference" as follows:
"The Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe
take the initiative to constitute, on an international
basis, a Scientific and Technological Union of Parliamentarians in order
(a) to provide an institutional mechanism for regular
personal contacts and interchanges among members
of parliament interested in assuring their responsibilities in respect to national and international science
policies;
(b) to promote an effective international flow of
science policy information at the parliamentary
level."
PROGRAM

This year's Conference program stressed the increasing
necessity for members of Parliaments in all countries to
become much more involved in national Science Policy
decisions than they have been in the past or appear to be
at present. The discussion centred around 3 main themes:
1. Parliamentary democracy in the scientific-technological age.
2. European Science policy.
3. Management of technology and parliamentary control. An information paper prepared by the Secretariat
indicated that about a third of the Council-member parliaments now have standing science policy committees; 6
have active "Science and Parliament" associations
(Sweden 494 members, the U.K. 356 members); and 5
parliaments have regular "hearings" on national science
policy.
The Conference found the present general level of
competence of Parliamentarians to be totally inadequate
to their responsibility for the control of technology. It
concluded that "the way in which parliamentarians make
use of modern methods provided by science and technology to ensure that they fully comprehend the decisions they

414

SENATE DEBATES

have to take will be decisive for parliamentary democracy." It noted a "shift in power between administration and
parliament to the detriment of the latter. This process has
been speeded up by the rapid development of technology
in recent years ... Science policy today should not be the
monopoly of either the scientist, the administrator or the
bureaucrat. The main reason for this is that the laying
down of science policies implies a weighting between military, economic, prestige, welfare, and science for science's
sake considerations, which is the function of the political
institutions. In general the formulation of society's aims
and the determination of priorities between various objec-

tives must be a political decision .

..

in the democratic

process members of parliament have a twofold responsibility; to keep themselves informed of scientific and technological developments and to provide support to well
founded scientific and technological projects."
It was with understandable interest that I noted in many
of the learned papers strong echoes of recommendations
in the Reports of our own Senate Committee on Canadian
Science policy. Mr. Jacques Defay, Head of Science Policy
Planning in the Belgian Prime Minister's Office, emphasized that any approach to a national industrial strategy
must necessarily be within a framework of science policy
and aim at "creating (a) growth points for advanced technology by public financing of research and development
together with (b) a re-structuring of industry and (c) the
organization of public orders for supplies and equipment
with a view to promoting the industrial use of research
results". Pointing the way for Europe to cope with some
of its own technology problems he added the wise observation (equally applicable I think to our Canadian situation): "In fact as our growth brings us closer to American
wage levels, as has already happened in Sweden, we shall
have scarcely any other alternative than that qf becoming
competitive in advanced technology, for, like the USA, we
shall cease to be competitive in other forms of production".
ORGANIZATION OF THE COUNCIL
The Council of Europe is, of course, one of the great
modern organizations working toward European integration. It traces its beginnings to Sir Winston's proposal at
Zurich in 1946 for the formation of a United States of
Europe which resulted in the United Europe Movement,
the 1948 European Congress at the Hague in 1948 and the
passing of the Statute of the Council of Europe in 1949 in
St. James' Palace, London by the Brussels Treaty countries (the U.K., France, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg) and Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy and Ireland.
It now comprises 17 Countries in Western Europe. Its
admission standards require adherence to democratic
parliamentary institutions, and more than one country
has been denied admission or has withdrawn because it
did not meet those standards. It consists of a Council of
Ministers who meet twice yearly in its fine buildings in
Strasbourg with deputy ministers meeting monthly; a
Parliament called the Consultative Assembly of 140 parliamentarians which meets 3 times a year; and an international Secretariat. It holds joint meetings annually with
the Parliament of the European Economic Community
(EEC). A representative of the Canadian Parliament
attended the Assembly for the first time in 1967 followed

May 18, 1972

by a wide-ranging exchange in 1969 between representatives of this Chamber and the House of Commons in
which our own Speaker Deschatelets had so important a
role. The Committee on Science and Technology was
established in 1966.
INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS

Discussion naturally centred around European aspects
of national science policies, but an outside observer could
hardly fail to note how very similar the paramaters are in
all developed-and to some extent undeveloped-countries. It is true that public discussion of science policy has
come rather later in Canada than in some of the older
countries but it seems to have made up for its late start by
its current level of intensity. It may well be that the
activities of our own Senate Committee have had something to do with that. Indeed, I heard considerable comment on the degree to which suggestions and recommendations arising out of the proceedings and reports of the
Committee have been implemented by the Canadian government including, of course, the appointment of a Minister of State for Science and Technology, the acceptance of
the important principle of contracting out research and
development projects to industry, the recent announcement of a structured industrial development policy, the
increased funding of science in industry, and discernable
evidence of awareness at political decision levels of the
necessity of co-relating decisions at all departmental and
agency levels with a visible and articulated science policy.
Canadian comparisons were obvious in many of the
agenda topics. Foremost perhaps was the emphasis on the
directioning of national science activities to clearly stated
and carefully selected social, economic and humanistic
objectives. Dr. Hugo Thiemann, the director of the Batelle
Institute at Geneva, put part at least of this concept in
these words:
"We therefore observe a gap between education,
science and technology on one side, and society and
its institutions on the other. Research and development are often no longer considered essential; it has
even been stated in public that there is no correlation
between economic growth and the effort put into
science and technology. Universities are under pressure in order to do research not for the sake of
science, but for the purpose of improving the conditions of life. The large government missions which
have been the main sources of research and development during the past twenty years are fading out, and
the generation now responsible for planning the
future of science has not been able to conceive new
projects in such a way as to attract and inspire a large
number of young people. The latter need orientating
towards the problems essential to the survival of
humanity, whereas at present, owing to the organization of the scientific world, their efforts are split up
into innumerable individual theses."
BASIC SCIENCE

I should hasten to add, before I once again incur the
wrath of our basic scientists, that their case for individual
freedom of initiative was kept constantly before the conference by a distinguished group of international scientists inspired by Sir Brian Flowers of the U.K. Science
Research Council. He is remembered in Canada as one of

M- IL 18 1 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

the pioneering group of yaung British nuclear scientista in
the early days af Chalk River. I taok the oppartunity ta
congratulate him on a successful innings "for the basic
scientists had inserted in the Conference conclusions a
statement that "there will often be occasions when the
scientist's view that, in order ta achieve a social objective,
a long-term program of basic research is required rather
than a program of immediate applicability, will have ta be
accepted by politicians. There wiil always be a place for
pure scientific research not subordinate ta social objectives." That may appear ta be only statig the obviaus or
conversely as merely a necessary caveat ta existing castbenefit analysis pressures, but I think aur Canadian
experience would indicate that the truth of the matter
must be found in wise definitions and delineations of "the
place".
THÉ TWO FACES 0F TECHNOLOGY
The usual emphasis on the urgency of the transfer of
research inta innovation and invention was made over
and over again during the Conference. The "twa faces of
technology" emphasized in aur own Committee's Second
Report was reflected in the widely shared concern that
existing parliamentary and other institutions rnay not be
adequate ta cape with the problems posed by rapid
advances i technology in science and technology. In its
Conclusions the Conference warned of "the limitations of
existing vertical structures of government and science in
solving the wide-ranging horizontal prablems with which
saciety is now faced."
cRITICAL SIZE
There was another clear reflection of a Canadian problem in the concern of delegates about the problem of
critical size of entrepreneurial and public agencies ta
meet in finance and performance current technalogical
requirements of size unique in human experience. We
were told that the S & T resources of Europe "can be
estimated ta represent roughly 60% of the world R & D
manpower and possibly 40% of the world R & D expenditure" and that "200,000 Europeans are nowadays engaged
in nuclear science and development alone and yet, the fact
that after many years of European effort, European countries have ta buy American lightwater reactors shows
very clearly the inefficierf'cy of European research and
development measured in ternis of innovation". (Professor A. Buzzati-Traverson of UNESCO)
Again, perhaps an echo of Canadian interest.
cANADIAN AcCOMPLISHMENTS
I amn able ta report that Canadian progress in science
and science policy is being foilowed with great interest in
Europe. A flattering reference as made ta the "Canadian
break-through" in the field of transversely-excited atmospheric laser (TEA) technology and Defence Research
Centre at Valcartier and the National Research Council.

Special attention was drawn to the "Canadian initiative"
i setting up the International Development Research
Centre (IDRC). The Conference recommended that the
Consultative Assembly of the Council analyse this "Iwith a
view to the establishment of analagous European institutions ta promote scientific research designed to aid in the
solution of some of the acute problems of developmng
countries." Honourable senators will have seen the excellent annual report of the Centre just published and the
encouraging interim reports naw being distributed under
title of "Co-operation Canada".
More humbly, perhaps, I can also report that a warm
tribute was paid ta aur Senate Committee's activities by
no less an authority than Dr. Alexander King, the science
sage of OECD and one of the OECD examiners of Canadian science policy.
TEcHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING
Technological assessment and forecasting, the newest
point of heavy emphasis in science policy discussions, was
a major subject of discussion at the Conference. Action
was urged "in order that those respansible for selecting
research and develapment objectives at European, national, regional, company or laboratary level, and i particular Parliamentarians, may be supplied with a full and
caherent range of detailed studies of the situation". In this
connection, I was able ta pass on the news that the
Canadian Senate had recently authorized its Science
Palicy Committee ta convene a Conference ta establish a
Canadian Commtssion of the Future. This was generally
regarded as a unique forward step taken ini Canada which
will certainly be fallawed in due course in one form or
another in many cauntries.
APPRECIATION
In conclusion, I record my personal appreciatian, as
weil as those of aur Special Cornmittee, for the Coundil's
invitation and for the warmth af the welcame and generaus apportunities ta participate which were extended ta
M.r. Watson and myself as representatives of the two
Hauses of the Canadian Parliament. In summing up, I
would say that the organizatian of the Conference, the
papers, discussions and many distinguished 'Iwise men of
science" that were attracted were ail weil up ta the levels
af usefulness and efficiency of ather great canferences
such as the International Panel discussions of the U.S.
Committee of Science and Astronautics which I have alsa
had the privilege of attending. I return determmned ta do
whatever I can ta help make aur own Conference on the
Future an equally important contribution ta national and
international science policy.

OLD AGE SECURITY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-REPORT OF COMMITTEE LATER THIS
DAY
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, on
behalf of Senator Lamontagne, I request permission to

Health, Welfare and Science later this day.
PENSION ACT
WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE ACT
CIVILIAN WAR PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES ACT
CHILDREN OF WAR DEAD (EDUCATION ASSISTANCE)
ACT
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the second reading of Bill
C-208, to amend the Pension Act, the War Veterans Allowance Act, the Civilian War Pensions and Allowances Act,
the Children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act and
the Department of Veterans Affairs Act to provide for the
annual adjustment of pensions and allowances payable
thereunder.
He said: Honourable senators, to my mind there is no
better way to summarize the complex contents of this bill
than to draw your attention to the recommendation
appearing in the bill before the explanatory notes on page
1. It reads in part as follows:
-to amend the Pension Act, the War Veterans Allowance Act, the Civilian War Pensions and Allowances
Act and the Children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act to provide that pensions and allowances
payable thereunder will be escalated annually to
reflect the full amount of any increase in the Consumer Price Index with the initial escalation to be effective from January 1, 1972, with no decreaseAnd I stress the words "no decrease".
-where in a year there is a reduction in the Index; to
amend the Department of Veterans Affairs Act to
provide that regulations made under paragraph 6(1)(e)
of that Act may be amended at any time during the
first six months of 1972 with effect from January 1,
1972; and to provide further for other related and
consequential matters.
0 (1100)

Honourable senators, my remarks today will be relatively brief, because although this bill is an important one it is
nevertheless quite simple and straightforward. In his
budget speech on May 8 the Minister of Finance stated
that legislation was to be introduced to provide for the
annual adjustment of veterans' pensions and allowances
to reflect the changes in the cost of living, and the present

bill will give effect to that commitment. In the past there
never has been any clear-cut principle governing basic
changes from time to time in the amounts payable as
pensions and allowances to veterans, and in recent years
the rates have been reviewed every two years, or so,
without any basis or timing being spelled out and made
public. Consequently, veterans and their dependents have
not so far had any certitude as to the amounts they might
be entitled to receive from year to year. This bill will for
the first time remove that uncertainty and spell out clearly that the pensions and allowances will from now on be
adjusted on an annual basis and that when changes based
on an increase in the cost of living are warranted, they
will take effect as of January 1, starting with January 1,
1972, as I have already stated.
Finally, the amount of these changes will be arithmetically and automatically determined by the upward
moving of the consumer price index. These adjustments
will be made as of right. Furthermore, it will no longer be
necessary for veterans' organizations to come to Ottawa
and plead for a review to recognize the shrinkage in the
real value of veterans' benefits because of price increases.
The review will be statutory and annual and will be governed by the principle of escalation recited in the legislation itself. The bill, therefore, is to my mind a new landmark in the veterans' charter.
Honourable senators will have no doubt noted that this
is an omnibus bill to amend five different statutes, but the
principle in all cases is the same. The first statute involved
is the Canada Pension Act under which disability pensions and various allowances are paid to veterans and
also pensions are paid in specified circumstances to
widows or orphans of veterans. I should like to emphasize
that the new principle of automatic escalation will apply
not only to the pensions themselves but also to the various
periodic allowances arising from this act. This includes
attendance allowance, clothing allowance, dependent parents allowance and also the new exceptional incapacity
allowance that was first enacted about a year ago.
Another point which I should like to stress is that the
present bill relates only to the question of changes related
to the cost of living; in other words, to the principle of
escalation. Veterans' organizations have also been making
numerous representations to the government with regard
to the basic rates of pensions. In other words, apart from
the periodic changes in rates there is also an important
question as to whether or not the pensions stand on the
right base. The Minister of Veterans Affairs clearly stated
in the other place that this question of basic rates is under
careful and constant study, and he added that at this time
it is impossible to predict the outcome of that study. He
pointed out that the present measure should not be
regarded-and I emphasize this-as being prejudicial in
any way to the review of this question of basic rates. They
are indeed two different questions.
The second statute affected by this bill is the War Veterans Allowance Act, and here too the method of escalation

NMay 19,.1972

Mav 19. 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

will be the same. As in the case of other recent increases
in this allowance, the statutory ceilings will be increased
by the same amounts and not by the same percentages as
the maximum allowance; in other words, the margin
between the maximum allowances and the total income
ceilings will remain unchanged.
Another matter of considerable interest in this connection is the question of how the current increase under the
Old Age Security Act, also announced in the same budget
of May 8, will be treated for purposes of war veterans
allowance. In the other place the minister was pleased to
announce that the government intends to seek authority
from the Governor in Council for a regulation exempting
these increases under the Old Age Security Act so that
they are not treated as income when computing entitlement under the War Veterans Allowance Act. These veterans, therefore, will quite properly qualify for the
increases both as veterans and as citizens.
The third statute involved is the Civilian War Pensions
and Allowances Act, which relates, as honourable senators will recall, to various groups of quasi-military personnel such as merchant seamen, auxiliary services personnel, firefighters and the like. These groups will enjoy
exactly the same kind of escalation, both with regard to
disability pensions and civilian war allowances.

e

(1110)

The fourth statute is the children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act, which provides for tuition fees and
living costs of qualified young persons. Here again the
escalation will be automatic and will conform with
changes in the consumer price index. The fifth statute
affected is the Department of Veterans Affairs Act. The
purpose of this amendment is to provide that exactly the
same kind of escalation may apply, as of January 1, 1972,
to those who may be in receipt of treatment allowance.
Honourable senators will recall that the purpose of the
treatment allowance is to raise the payment made to a
disability pensioner up to the equivalent of 100 per cent
pension when he is under treatment in hospital for his
pensionable disability.
At the beginning of my remarks I said I would be brief.
I have described the substance of the bill. It is simple, but
it establishes an important new right. Honourable senators will certainly agree with me that Canada's veterans
should not be expected to make supplication in matters of
this kind. Cost of living changes are measurable, and it is
self-evident that they should be met by a standardized
procedure such as that defined in the bill.
I should like to make one additional point. In the other
place, the minister stated that officials of the department
are already making provisonal arrangements for the issuance of cheques to cover the retroactive aspect of all these
adjustments, and also to amend the amounts of subsequent cheques in accordance with the provisions of this
bill. While it cannot be said at this time exactly when the
amended cheques can be distributed, the minister gave
the assurance to members of the other place that the
revision will be completed at the earliest possible moment.
Finally, for the additional information of honourable
senators, I would point out that in his budget speech the
Minister of Finance estimated the cost of this new measure for a full year to be $25 million. I commend this
25312-27

417
417

beneficial piece of legislation to the consideration of the
house.
Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators, I should
like to commend Senator Langlois for his very able and
clear presentation of this most important bill.
The honourable senator is a veteran with a very distinguished record. He knows, as do other honourable senators who were formerly in the other place, that the Veterans Affairs Committee was never partisan or political in
any way. The aim of that committee has always been to do
the best possible job for Canada's veterans. As the honourable senator pointed out, the bill we are considering
covers various acts, but the escalation applies to all of
them. This bill will receive royal assent today. The Leader
of the Government has indicated that the bill must be
passed today, or indicated that it should be passed today,
if the benefits are to be received by the veterans in June.
* (1120)

The honourable senator who introduced this bill read
from page 2233 of the House of Commons Hansard of
Friday, May 12, where the Minister of Veterans Affairs
pointed out that the officials of his department-this was
a week ago today-were already making the necessary
adjustments and all the things required to be done to
calculate the increases and prepare the necessary
cheques. In view of that statement by the minister it is
rather difficult for one to understand why it is absolutely
necessary that this bill receive speedy passage today. In
years gone by any time there was a change in any of the
benefits affecting veterans the veterans had to travel a
long, long hard road over a period of years before the bill
got into and through the House of Commons. It has
always been the custom and the practice in the other
place that when there were amendments made to any
statutes affecting veterans, and especially pensioners,
individuals of all recognized veterans associations would
be invited to appear before their committee to present
briefs and arguments in support of their recommendations. For instance, let us take a brief look at the action
this government took in regard to the manner in which
the Woods Report was handled. Ail veterans have freely
admitted and paid tribute to this very fine report which
was made by a number of distinguished Canadians. This
report was referred to the Veterans Affairs Committee of
the other place in 1968, but no legislation was introduced
until Bill C-203 in December 1970. That bill was passed by
the House of Commons on February 18,.1971, and was
passed by this chamber in March, 1971. One of the interesting things about Bill C-203, which was passed pursuant
to certain recommendations made by the Woods Report,
is that the increase granted to veterans was not made
retroactive; it did not come into effect until April 1, 1971,
some months after the bill was made law. I say very
plainly to the Leader of the Government that in this case
where you are granting veterans a very, very small
amount-a matter of cents-if the government is of the
opinion that this small increase made retroactive is going
to influence the veterans' vote in any way, you have misjudged the veterans of Canada.
This house has been in session since February 17, and I
can see no reason why the government could not have
introduced this bill several months ago. It did not have to

SENATE DEBATES

wait for a budget. I am sure all veterans' organizations
would have been only too glad and pleased to have had
the opportunity to appear before the Veterans Affairs
Committee of the other place to present their arguments
as to why the basic rate of pension is too low. The minister
made two important announcements, both of which have
been referred to by the honourable senator who introduced the bill. At page 2233 of Hansard of the other place
he made the following significant remark, "The adjustment will be made as of right." I underline the word
"right," and point out, in case anyone has any question or
doubt, that payments to veterans are not charity, because
any Canadian veteran who has qualified for a pension
under our act has more than earned that pension.

Senator Langlois also referred, in introducing the bill,
to the remarks made by the minister that:
No longer will it be necessary for veterans' organizations to come and plead for a review to recognize
the shrinkage and the real value of veterans benefits
and so on.
The minister also put out a release dated May 15 in
which many of the things he said in the other place were
repeated. I hope the fact that he stated very plainly that it
would not be necessary in future for veterans' organizations to appear before them does not mean that they
wanted to get rid of them or did not want to listen to their
very reasonable arguments. The minister also made a
statement about the basic rate of pension and indicated
that there is a study going on in his department at the
present time.
Under this bill the escalation clause for pensions provides for an increase of 3.6 per cent. I point out that this
increase of 3.6 per cent applies only to the amount of
pension the veteran receives. If a veteran receives a pension of $25 or $50 a month, the increase under this bill is
only a matter of cents. What should have been done was to
put the basic rate at its proper level, when the escalation
under a bill such as this would, in my opinion, be excellent. Under the Old Age Security bill, which we were
considering yesterday, the combined old age security pension and the guaranteed income supplement was
increased from $15 to $30, but there bas been no such
similar increase for veterans.
At present the basic pension for veterans is about
$3,500. I have on various occasions tried to find out the
yardstick, the method of measurement, or the formula,
that has been used by these experts in the Department of
Veterans Affairs to arrive at a 100 per cent basic pension
for veterans of $3,500. From the very beginning of the
Pension Commission, as it is now called-it was called by
another name during the First World War, I believe it
started in 1918-the basic pension has always been related
to the earnings of an unskilled labourer. Certainly that
was not putting the veteran at a very high rate. The Woods
Commission, which made a most careful and detailed
study of the basic pension and what the rate should be,
made the following recommendation, to be found in
Volume II at page 493:
The amount for 100 per cent pension should continue
to be the earning power of a man in the class of the
[Hon. Mr. White.]

May 19, 1972

untrained labourer; as determined by the average
wage for this type of employment in the Public Service of Canada.
It is also interesting to note that at page 488, the Woods
Report, in going back into the beginning of the commission, made a very interesting comment which might give
you some idea of the thinking of the people at that time.
This is the quotation:
0 (1140)

The earning power of a man in the class of the
untrained labourer is considered to be sufficient to
provide decent comfort for himself and his family,
that is to say, a little more than enough for
subsistence.
We have gone quite a long way since that quotation was
made. The earning power of a man in the class of
untrained labourer as determined by the average wage
for this type of employment in the Public Service of
Canada is $4,550 at the present time. Veterans can never
understand why, after the presentation of the Woods
Report, the basic rate as recommended was not adopted.
If this had been done, then the present increases under
this bill, which will be made every year, would be quite in
line. But I suggest and submit that until the basic rate of
100 per cent pension is set at a figure in line with the
earnings of an untrained labourer in the employment in
the Public Service of Canada, the veterans will not be
receiving what they are entitled to.
Veterans throughout Canada will watch with interest
the speed with which the board or the committee in the
Department of Veterans Affairs completes its study on
the necessity for increasing the basic pension.
They will also watch with interest, after that report is
made, the speed with which the government will then
introduce amending legislation.
They will also observe, with more than casual interest, I
would say, why these increases have to be rushed through
the house, in view of the action of the government on Bill
C-203, to which I have already made reference.
If the sole purpose is to get the cheques into the hands
of veterans before an election, I cannot tell you in unprintable army language what the veterans will say, but it will
be most interesting for veterans to observe what
announcement will be made at the coming Legion convention in respect to the basic pension.
I have already pointed out that there was a long delay in
implementing the Woods Report. Those who take the
Legion magazine will notice that in each edition, under
the heading of "Last Post," there is a very long list of
deceased veterans-which is by no means complete.
The minister stated, as I read before, that the matter of
the basic rate is being considered. Judging by the past
record of the government, the matter may be considered
for years. Such consideration is not much good to veterans of World War I.
I suggest to the Leader of the Government, and to the
honourable senator who introduced this bill, that if this
session proceeds in the usual way, every effort should be
made to bring in a bill raising the basic rate of pension to
the same level as the present wage paid an untrained

labourer in the employment of the Public Service of
Canada. If that is done, then the bill we are considering
today will just be fine, as far as veterans are concerned.
0 (1150)

Althaugh the present bill gives a very small increase ta
veterans, nevertheless I approve of it. May I say that we
on this side do flot intend to ask to have the biu go ta a
committee.
Before I finish my remarks I should like again ta ask
the honourable senator who introduced the bill to tell me
in plain, simple language, that even I, a mere country
lawyer, can understand, just haw the powers that be in
the Ivory Tower arrived at the present basic rate of pension for veterans.
Hon. Orville H. Phillipe: Honourable senators, may I
ask if there is anyone on the other side wha is interested
in the veterans and would like ta follow the usual pattern
of exchanging speakers from one side of the house ta the
other? If there is, I shall be happy ta yield. If not, I am
prepared ta go on with my usual rambling remarks.
Is there any honourable senator over there interested,
and who wishes ta speak on bebaîf of veterans?
Hon. Mr. Prowee: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Order, please. According ta the
practice, I recognize the honourable Senator Phihlips.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Apparently Senator Prowse wants ta
speak.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Honourable senators, there bas been a
suggestion that every one wbo sits quietly is not interested
in the veterans. If the bonourable senator wants ta speak,
of course, he stands and speaks, but when he suggests
that everyone on this side of the bouse who sits quietly
listening ta hlm bas no interest in veterans, then he does a
disservice ta tbis bouse and a disservice ta each of us.
I do not choose ta speak because I think this bill serves
veterans. I bave a deep interest in the welf are of veterans,
and I think that that welfare will be served by the passage
of this bull.
Han. Mr. Flynn: Tbat is a good speech.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Honourable senators, that is one of
the shorter, and perhaps more intelligent, speeches the
honourable senator has made in this chamber. However, I
still feel that the veterans of Canada would have liked ta
hear bim express bis particular interest.
If you have some particular problem. and if you are
interested in veterans' affairs, Senator Prowse, yau must
bave some camplaint about the department. It is not perfect. Wby not get up and say that? Tbis is your golden
oppartunity. Please da not pass it by. You must know that
tbe veterans of Canada have many camplaints. I tbink
you will agree witb me that Parliament-and by that I
mean governments of both political faiths-has definitely
failed ta live up ta certain obligations ta veterans. I would
invite the bonourable senator ta express bis views on
particular problems wben I finish my remarks.
Here again, bonourable senators, we are facing the guillatine. Wbile yesterday I deeply resented the guillotine on
the old age pensions bill, I resent even more the fact that
the government side is talking about getting tbrough with
25312-274

this legisiation affecting veterans by five o'clock this evening. That is a most disgraceful treatment of veterans.
Even this government, wbich is so short on veterans, must
feel a littie bit guilty for baving brougbt inta this chamber
just a few moments ago a measure for which they say
they want royal assent by five o'clock. Surely there must
be some rernorse or some regret over that.
I can assure you, bonourable senators, that there is deep
resentment over the miserable benefits that are being
provided by this bull, and over the fact that veterans are
being used as an election ploy. Using old age pensioners in
an election campaign is one tbing, but using the veterans
as an election ploy is an entirely different thing. It is the
most despicable form of electioneering that anyone could
imagine. I deeply resent the fact that this was brought in
at this time for the purpose of July 17. It really annoys me.
It aggravates me.
The only thing I can do is apologize ta the veterans on
behaîf of Parliament. I cannot, and would not even
attempt ta, assume any responsibility an behaîf of the
government, but I tbink I can apologize ta the veterans on
behaîf of Parliament for the fact that they are being used
like chessmen in an election campaign.
Surely, honourable senators, you must have some
respect for the veterans. I know that there are veterans on
the other side of the bouse. I arn sure tbey share my regret
and my shame that the government bas acted in this way.
It bas ahways been the custom of variaus veterans'
organizations ta prepare brief s which they present at
meetings of the Veterans Affairs Committee of the other
place, usually in the fail.
*(1200)

Unfortunately, perhaps, they bave not met as much witb
this chamber as they sbould bave done, but then I recahl
the difficulty I had in getting permission ta appear bef are
the Health, Welfare and Science Committee which was sa
capably presided aver at that time by Senator Carter. I
amn sure tbat if they were given the opportunity, variaus
veterans' arganizations wauld like ta came back and
appear before us because they have told me that since
tbey appeared before the Senate committee they have
developed a new respect for the Senate.
The bihl provides certain benefits which bave already
been explained by Senator Langlois, so perhaps it is not
necessary for me ta go into tbem. As usual, he gave a very
clear and lucid explanation. But I want ta express a very
deep concern over the fact that in passing this piece of
legishation, this ehection ploy, we are doing permanent
damage ta aur veterans legishation. I arn afraid that future
gavernments and future finance ministers, regardless of
their political affiliation, will say that Parliament on this
day fixed and decided tbat there would be an escalation
clause, and tbat tbese benefits ta war veterans will end.
Honourable senators, we still owe a great deal ta aur
veterans, and I hope that the idea of an escalation clause
will not at any future time prevent the veterans fromn
being the beneficiaries of remedial legishation. Certainly, I
must admit that I fear this greatly.
As honourable senators will remember, wben the War
Veterans Allowance Act was hast amended I objected ta
the fact that the escalation clause in the guaranteed

SENATE DEBATES

income supplement, which was embodied in the War Veterans Allowance Act, did, illegally and unfairly in my
view, eliminate the extra benefit that the veteran has
always received. It had been the custom for those on war
veterans allowances to receive approximately $15 per
month over and above the old-age security.
I have in my hand one of those Keith Davey press
releases concerning Bill C-208 which states that the minister also said that authority would be sought to have the
old age security increases declared exempt income for the
purposes of the War Veterans Allowance Act so that the
recipients of benefits affected will, in fact, receive the
benefit of those increases.
Honourable senators will remember that in committee I
made motions in an attempt to have this changed. I do not
have to tell you the result. The Liberal majority, these
people who are so proud of saying they are Liberal, rejected that. They were so liberal that they would not allow an
extra $15 per month to veterans. That is now history, but I
am afraid that it has set a pattern for the future, a pattern
that I deeply regret and very much resent.
Senator White in his remarks referred to the basis of the
100 per cent pension but as we all know, it has been the
pattern since World War I that a 100 per cent pensioner
received the average income of an unskilled labourer.
This to my mind has been one of the most unfortunate
aspects of veterans legislation. When you consider the
university students and the high school graduates who
went off to war, and when you consider their success in
later life, is it fair to fix the pension for a 100 per cent
disabled war veteran at the average income of an
untrained and unskilled labourer? This to me has been
the real disgrace of veterans legislation. Of course-and I
like to be fair, as honourable senators know-it is not only
this government that is responsible. This situation has
existed since World War I, and I think it is about time that
some move was made to change it.

It is interesting to note that after World War 1, $37
million was paid out in veterans' pensions and allowances.
However, at that time our gross national product was
$5.728 billion or 154.8 times the amount paid in pensions
and allowances. In 1964 that expenditure was $181 million
while our gross national product was $52.056 billion, or
232.4 times as large. In other words, relating the pensions
to our gross national product, from World War I to the
present we have dropped around 100 per cent. Honourable senators, are you going to use that in your election
campaign? Will you use it as an attraction to veterans?
When I spoke previously on this subject I referred to the
fact that Hong Kong veterans were receiving special consideration by way of payment for the treatment they
received as prisoners of war at the hands of the Japanese.
I mentioned that I thought all our veterans who were
prisoners of war should receive special consideration, special medical examinations, and at this particular time in
their lives every other possible consideration this country
could afford. Honourable senators, today I repeat that
plea.
There are many other items I should like to mention
but, since we are facing the Martinization five o'clock
guillotine and I do not wish to deny veterans the small
[Hon. Mr. Phillips.]

May 19, 1972

increase that this bill provides, I will end my speech. I
would like to go further, and treat them more fairly, but
for the present I will go along with the miserable increase
provided under this bill in the hope that a future government will have greater wisdom than the present government, and our veterans will receive better treatment.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I want to

express my support for this legislation. I agree with Senator White, and wish this legislation went further than it
does, but I gather from a statement made by the minister-I am not sure whether it was in the house or outsidethat this legislation will not preclude subsequent reviews
of the basic pension rate. This legislation is merely one

step forward, and the basic pension rate will be reviewed
from time to time as it has been in the past. However, this
legislation will apply to whatever basic rate is determined.
My chief purpose in rising is to draw to the attention of
this house a situation which developed since the last time
this legislation was amended, particularly as it affects
those veterans and veterans' widows who are eligible for
the old age pension and guaranteed income supplement. It
will be recalled that when the legislation was amended
previously, for some reason it stipulated that any veteran
over 65 years of age must apply for the guaranteed
income supplement before applying for the war veteran's
allowance. This applies as well for widows' allowances. In

other words, a payment by the War Veterans Allowance
Board would be calculated on the basis of the veteran's
total income including the old age pension plus the guaranteed income supplement, if any.
On the face of it, this looks rather harmless. But certain

veterans, single veterans and more particularly widows of
veterans, are placed in a less advantageous position than
they were previously. I am aware of several cases where
widows are eligible for the old age pension and the guaranteed income supplement. However, some of these
widows are able to earn money in various ways, either by
babysitting, baking cakes and selling them, or from casual
jobs. They must report these earnings on their returns at
the end of the year. It is on the basis of their total income
that the guaranteed income supplement is calculated. Of
course, the more they earn from casual work the less the
guaranteed income supplement.
If that clause were not in the legislation, and if they
were not required to apply for the guaranteed income
supplement, those earnings from babysitting or selling
cakes would not be counted as income at all. It would be
pocket money, and they would still receive the full allowances and widows' pensions permitted under the act.
However, since the change in the legislation, they do not
receive the full amount. Their allowance is reduced
accordingly, and they actually receive less than they did
formerly.

I brought this situation to the attention of the government on a previous occasion in the hope that something
would be done about it, but I see nothing in the bill before
us that specifically relates to this problem. I feel therefore

I should once again bring it to the attention of this house
and the government.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators* (1220)

The Hon. the Speaker: I must remind honourable senators that if Senator Langlois speaks now, his speech will
have the effect of closing the debate on second reading.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I wish to
express my thanks to Senators White, Phillips and Carter
for their participation in the debate. Their views were
enlightening.
I wish particularly to address my personal thanks to
Senator White for his kind remarks about me. He too bas
an enviable service record, and a very impressive one as a
champion of veterans' interests in both this house and the
other place over a long period of years.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I had the privilege of sitting in the
other place with my honourable colleague for approximately 12 years, and I shall long remember his constant
and intense participation in every debate on veterans'
legislation, particularly during the years following the
Second World War while a member of the Committee on
Veterans Affairs which enacted the Veterans' Charter.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: His remarks today were timely, and I
propose briefly to comment on them.
I wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to
Senator White's opening remarks concerning the statement which the Leader of the Government was said to
have made in this house regarding the need for urgency in
passing this legislation.
I believe that my honourable colleague has misinterpreted the statement made earlier by the Leader of the
Government regarding the Old Age Security Act which is
also before the house. I do not think it is fair to say that
the Leader of the Government suggested that a timetable
had been set for the bill presently under consideration. As
the Minister of Veterans Affairs stated in the other
place-and I repeated it almost word for word this morning-at this time it is impossible to state the date on which
these revised cheques can be sent out to veterans. The
minister added that instructions had been given to the
officials of the department to try and get them out as soon
as possible. I do not think that anything further was said
in this connection.
I am sure my honourable colleague merely misinterpreted the statement made the other day by the Leader of the
Government in connection with this other piece of
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Then you will not ask for third reading
today?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am asking for third reading, but I
am leaving it to this chamber to pass it. I do not think
anyone in this house wishes to delay this most important
piece of legislation, which is based on a very simple principle of escalation based on the increase in the cost of
living index. The sooner this legislation is passed by this
house, the sooner will veterans beable to enjoy the additional benefits.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is about the same thing.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am leaving it at that. There is no
timetable and no deadline whatsoever in regard to this
piece of legislation, because we do not know when these
cheques will be sent out to veterans.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I am sorry to interrupt the honourable senator, but did I understand him correctly to say
that he does not know when these cheques are going to be
mailed out?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: The minister said that in the other
place, and I repeated it here this morning.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: With regard to the date, is there a
distinction between old age pensioners and veterans?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I think we are discussing two different matters. Old age pensioners are more numerous, but
probably the work can be carried out in a more efficient
manner in a shorter period of time than in the case of
veterans. We have here five statutes. We are dealing with
five different kinds of benefits for veterans, and the minister said it was impossible at this stage to state precisely
when these cheques could be mailed out. I do not think
that I can add anything to the statement of the minister,
which was simple and very clear.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: And the cheques are for different
amounts?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Yes. The honourable senator
referred also to the statement made by the minister,
which I repeated this morning, that it would no longer be
necessary for veterans to come to Ottawa to make further
representations to the department or government in connection with veterans' benefits. That statement of the
minister related only to representations regarding the
shrinkage of veterans' benefits resulting from changes in
the cost of living index. As the minister stated in the other
place, and which I again repeated this morning, this index
is a measurable quantity, and although it is very easy to
adopt an escalation principle such as the one provided for
in the legislation, it does not mean that the Minister of
Veterans Affairs wishes to restrict future representations
with regard to basic rates or further benefits. To attach
such a meaning to these remarks is to misinterpret the
statement of the minister.
I come now to the question of basic rates. I do not think
I can go beyond what the minister said in the other place,
when he stated that the question of basic rates was under
constant study and that it was impossible for him to state
at this stage what would be the outcome of this study.
However, he assured the house that the matter was receiving the consideration of his department.
I thank Senator Phillips also for his, timely criticism of
the legislation. I wish to assure him that his criticism did
not fall upon deaf ears. I am sure the honourable senator
will realize that even though it is not always possible to
accept recommendations such as those which he made
this morning, it does not mean that they will not receive
consideration.
Finally, I wish to thank Senator Carter for his important contribution to the debate. As suggested by Senator
White, I do not feel that it is necessary for the bill to be
sent to the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare
and Science. I do not think the bill was sent to committee

422

SENATE DEBATES

in the other place. The House of Commons disposed of
this bill in a matter of a few hours. It is a simple bill and is
one which commends itself to the consideration of the
house.

May 19, 1972

The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the honourable
Senator Langlois, seconded by the honourable Senator
McIlraith, that this bill be now read the third time. Is it
your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?

* (1230)

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. White: May I ask the honourable senator a
question? With respect to your remarks regarding the
basic pension, in which you mentioned that this is under
constant review, even at the present time, what explanation can you give as to why the government did not accept
the recommendations contained in the Woods Report?
The Woods Committee was made up of experts who made
the most extensive and far-reaching investigation in order
to make their recommendations as to the basic rate. Do
you feel that you have officials in the department superior
to the people on the Woods Committee, who can decide
what the basic rate is going to be?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, my honourable
friend surely does not expect me to discuss or comment
upon government policy. Why the government has prepared this bill as it has and presented it to us is a matter
of policy on which I am afraid I cannot comment.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: In my remarks earlier, Senator Langlois, I stated that I do not wish to hold up this bill, but I
am intrigued by the fact that you said there is no definite
date for these cheques to be mailed out. In view of that,
could we not arrange a committee meeting with veterans'
organizations for Tuesday next?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I merely repeated what the minister
said in the other place, that it was impossible at this stage
to state with precision when these cheques could be
mailed out, but that every step was being taken in order to
expedite the mailing out of these cheques. I cannot go any
further than that, except to say that the sooner this legislation is passed the sooner the cheques will reach the
veterans.

Hon. Mr. Phillips: Would you consider, Senator Langlois, convening a meeting of the committee on Tuesday
next?
The Hon. the Speaker: May I interrupt at this point? The
debate on second reading is now closed.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: With leave, now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You really want it tonight?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: There is no deadline.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But you really want it tonight?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I said, "With leave".
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, but I want you to be frank and say
you want it tonight.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You would love to have it tonight.
[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

Hon. Mr. Phillips: Honourable senators, before we have
third reading-and I will admit that this point is not
directly connected with the bill-I should like to say this:
The honourable Senator Langlois, the sponsor of this bill,
was generous in saying that our complaints did not fall on
deaf ears. I should like to make one particular complaint.
In my years on Parliament Hill I have taken a particular
interest in veterans affairs. I have received thousands of
requests-perhaps the honourable Senator Carter would
be good enough to wait to speak to Senator Langlois until
after I have asked my question; I am sure Senator Langlois is interested in my question. I have received thousands of complaints and requests over the years, and I
had always experienced a most congenial and co-operative attitude on the part of members of the Canadian
Pension Commission until last fall when, for some reason,
the members of the Canadian Pension Commission were
instructed that no one was allowed to reply to a letter
except the chairman of the Canadian Pension Commission. I have written letters to the Canadian Pension Commission since last October and have received acknowledgment but nothing else. You can write or telephone as often
as you wish-you can write a letter every day, if you
wish-but you do not receive a reply because it has to
come through the chairman.
Why did the government make that decision? Was it
deliberate? Was it done to sew up the requests that have
been so long delayed? I for one am not concerned whether my reply comes from the chairman of the commission
or any other member of the commission as long as I get a
favourable decision on behalf of the veteran. I am not
insulted if it is not the chairman who replies to me. As you
know yourselves, usually when writing to a minister you
get a reply from the executive assistant. Surely any
member of the Canadian Pension Commission can write a
letter as well as an executive assistant.
I would appreciate it if you would bring this to the
attention of the Minister of Veterans Affairs and urge him
to use his good offices to have it corrected.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I am pleased
that my honourable colleague has raised this point
because I too have experienced some difficulty since last
fall in getting replies from the commission. I intend to
lodge a complaint with the minister in that regard, and I
will be pleased to pass on the remarks of my honourable
friend, as I am in full agreement with him.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time, and passed.

OLD AGE SECURITY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-REPORT OF COMMITTEE
Hon. Chesley W. Carter, for Hon. Maurice Lamontagne,
Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science, reported that the committee had
considered Bill C-207, to amend the Old Age Security Act,

SENATE DEBATES

Mav 19 1972S

and had directed that the bill be reported without
amendment.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate, I move that the bill be read the third time now.
• (1240)
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, on the
request for leave to proceed with third reading of this bill
now, I merely want to say that last night we had a meeting
of the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science to determine if it really was necessary for this bill
to receive royal assent tonight so that the cneques with the
increases might go out in June. Of course, the officials of
the department told the same story as the Leader of the
Government here and the house leader in the other place,
that May 19 was the deadline and that it would make a big
difference if royal assent were delayed to next Tuesday,
for instance.
I have read the transcript of the testimony giveh yesterday evening, and I will say that I am not at all convinced
that it would really create a problem if royal assent were
given only next week. However, having come to that conclusion I realize that the insistence of the Leader of the
Government and the way the Liberal majority of the
Senate behaved on this bill, mainly by remaining silent, is
indicative of the fact that there must be another reason;
there must be a hidden reason for asking leave to proceed
with third reading now and have royal assent tonight.
Yesterday I said that I could not always proceed on the
assumption that the dissolution of Parliament and the
calling of an election was imminent. But since the witnesses who appeared before the committee yesterday did
not convince me that it is absolutely necessary for royal
assent to be given today for the cheques to go out in June
with the increases, I have now concluded that possibly the
Prime Minister is thinking of dissoiving Parliament
tonight or tomorrow. I for one would like an election as
soon as possible so that we can provide Canada with a
more orderly way of dealing with legislation.
I will give leave, we will proceed with third reading, and
we will have royal assent to the two bills. If the government wants to dissolve Parliament tonight or tomorrow
and if it wants to use these bills for election purposes it
can do so. I am so convinced that the people of Canada
will not be taken in and that they feel it is about time for a
change of government, that I will be happy to forget about
the Rules of the Senate, to forget about the afront of
which the government was guilty in forcing us into rushing through important legislation. I will leave the government leader and the majority here in this chamber to bear
responsibility for the way in which we have had to deal
with these two bills.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Honourable senators, I join my leader
in saying that I have no desire to delay this bill. It is
deficient in many ways, but I will have the opportunity to
refer to some of these briefly on third reading.

Before granting leave, may I ask two questions of the
Leader of the Government. Last evening in our committee
meeting, before Senator "Ho Chi Minh" objected to my
asking questions, the Leader of the Government had great
knowledge-do you want me, Senator Martin? I do not
have to be as discourteous and as ignorant as the Leader
of the Government? The honourable leader, who had certain information, referred not only to cheques but to certain advertisements, newspaper advertisements, and I
believe there is even to be an enclosure. I have here the
unrevised minutes, although I have not had an opportunity to peruse them to any great extent. Could the government leader tell us now what will be in the advertisements
and what will be the letter enclosed with the cheques?
My second question is this. Will he assure us that in
granting leave we will have dissolution, and that the
Canadian people will have the opportunity of exercising
their right of disposing of this arrogant, useless
government?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: That is a double barrelled question.
Hon. Mr. McIlraith: Can you not use another adjective
than that?
The Hon. the Speaker: I am sure all honourable senators
would join in my desire to proceed in an orderly manner.
There are two questions involved here. The first is the
question of leave. The Leader of the Opposition has
indicated that he is ready to grant leave, and if I properly
understood the earlier remarks of the honourable Senator
Phillips I thought he was also willing to grant leave but
that he intended to ask a further question. If leave is
granted, I would then put the motion for third reading,
which is a debatable motion, and any questions would
then be in order. Is that agreeable?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the honourable
Senator Carter on behalf of the honourable Senator
Lamontagne, seconded by the honourable Senator
Giguère, that this bill be now read a third time. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I thought on third reading the government leader would reply to the question put by Senator
Phillips.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I will, but I have to go out for one
moment. I have been called out of the chamber.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We will suspend the sitting for two
minutes, if you like.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, may we
now suspend the sitting for a few minutes? We are on
third reading and this is, of course, a debatable motion.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Honourable senators, if I may make a
suggestion to His Honour the Speaker, in view of the fact
that the Leader of the Government has been called out we
could suspend our sitting for fifteen minutes.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Two minutes will be enough.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: There he is coming back.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I am always trying to help him out.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: We appreciate that.

SENATE DEBATES
The Hon. the Speaker: Before the government leader
speaks, may I say that I hope we will proceed in an
orderly fashion. This bill was not introduced by the government leader, so in speaking now he is not closing the
debate.
• (1250)
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No. This is on third reading.
Hon. Paul Martin: I thank honourable senators for their
co-operation in this matter. I want to say, first of all, to the
Leader of the Opposition that, whatever he may think, the
question of dissolution has nothing to do with the proposition that I put before this house. I cannot say anything
about that. My honourable friend will just have to wait for
events; I think that he will find that the events as they will
unfold will fully confirm what I have said.
The primary reason for asking that this bill be passed
today was so that we could make June payments as provided for in the bill for which leave now is being granted
to give third reading. That was the reason, and as far as I
am concerned, the only reason. I would say, if my honourable friend will bear with me, he will see that events will
support the position I have taken.
My honourable friend said he was not satisfied last
night with the explanations given by the officials for their
statement that the cheques could not be issued earlier. I
can understand the differenceHon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I will just say this
to the leader: I did not refer to the transcript because I
think that the record will speak for itself, but if we were to
analyze all the testimony taken last night it would involve
a lot of time. I would suggest to the honourable leader that
he can disagree with me as I disagreed with him, and that
should be the end of it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I fully agree with that, but I would feel
that we were satisfied before we brought the bill here that
there was a problem of timing. We feel that was clearly
confirmed last night by the public servants.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And I am not expecting anything else
from you.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I did satisfy myself, and having made
the statements as to the reason for the cheques going out
as soon as possible, I wanted to be able to show good faith
in making them. I have now in my hands a telegram from
the people charged with that responsibility. Here is the
telegram I got this morning from L. K. Lodge, Executive
Vice-President, IBM Canada Limited. It says:
This will confirm that in order to deliver the old age
security guaranteed income supplement cheques to

the Department of Supply and Services during the

week of June 12 as requested we must have a firm
order by May 19, 1972.
That i think puts to rest any doubt on the question of how
important this date was.

I can understand the argument that has been made, that
this situation might have been avoided if the administra-

tion had acted earlier, if there had been an earlier budget.
I can understand that argument. I would also point out,
however, that there are answers to that argument. The
fact is that the budget was presented on a particular date,
and that budget indicated the increases in old age security
[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

May 19, 1972

benefits. We are all anxious to see the senior citizens get

the improved pensions, and we would not want to take

any step that would in any way preclude their getting
these benefits at the earliest possible moment.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear. Have you any other
telegrams like that one? You could have requested ten like
that. Surely you are not going to go back into the great
concern you have for the veteransHon. Mr. Martin: I was about to say, if Senator Choquette will allow meHon. Mr. Choquette: Let us pass to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I was about to say that this is what all
honourable senators now wish. Everyone in this house has
consented to give third reading to this bill today, because

everyone in this chamber, on both sides, wants to see the
benefits going to the old age pensioners.
I am not trying to act-and I am sure that Senator
Choquette does not think that I have been so acting-in a
partisan way in anything I have said on this matter. I have
tried to deal with the bill as objectively as I can. I am
satisfied that this is a measure that will commend itself to
the Senate, as it commended itself to the parties in the
other house, and I am sure that it will commend itself to

the people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
Hon. Orville Phillips: Honourable senators, I have two
points that I want to raise on third reading. Senator
Martin has been kind enough to give me a third point, that

is, the one referred to by honourable Senator Choquette.
When the honourable leader read the telegram from

IBM, I wondered did he think he was fooling the Canadian people, did he think that we on this side were naïve
enough actually to believe that telegram. What else would
an executive do, entering a non-tender, non-negotiated
contract with the federal government? What other kind of
telegram do you expect from this set? Do you expect
them, after a week's debate about this date, to turn
around and say, "We can take any date. You name it."
Surely you do not think you are fooling this chamber or
the Canadian people with that telegram? Both IBM and
yourself should be damn well ashamed to put it on the

record.
The other point I wanted to raise is the fact that in last
night's committee there was great reference to this complicity that is going to go out about this wonder raise. I
asked for those papers last night in committee. I was
refused.

Honourable senators, this is a very dangerous practice
for us to establish. Surely Parliament is entitled to see the
letters, to see the advertisements, before they go out? I am
sure that if the honourable Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) had been acting as chairman last night, I would
have seen them. Such refusal is a very dangerous practice. We are told we cannot see them, that they are not
being made up until tomorrow. Whom do you think you

are fooling? Do you think the advertising agency is working tomorrow? Do you think they are coming out on
Monday? They are prepared to put them in newspapers
very early next week. Monday is a holiday. What advertising executive, what agency, is going to be working on

Ma-v 19

SENATE DEBATES

1972

Saturday and Monday? The only one that I can think of
would possibly be the one that is operated by the honourable Senator Davey.
S(1300>

It would be interesting to hear what advertising agency
designed the ads. Who made up the letter that goes in with
the cheques? Nobody objects to the cheques. We are al
happy to see themn going out, but do you have to put a
letter in as well as a newspaper advertisement? Is this flot
using public funds to sponsor the Liberal campaign? You
are going to have to have a lot more than that, honourable
senators, to make this government appear respectable.
I will make my third point very briefly. I intend to read
from the unrevised transcript of last evening's committee
meeting. Senator Thompson asked a question. I do flot
need to point out to this honourable chamber that the
honourable Senator Thompson has had a very long connection with the Liberal Party. Everyone knows that. Perhaps flot everyone is aware of the fact that the honourable
senator is by his profession a social worker. He asked this
question:
Mr. Chairman, assuming that we, the government,
had made a contract with the old age pensioner when
he got the basic $75 and because of that contract we
are going to see that he gets the increase in the cost of
living and that is why we have this raise, we would
have to admit that we are $8 short on the amount we
should be giving the old age pensioner.
If you will read further on in that transcript of the
committee meeting last night you will find that that is
correct. If you are in such a rush, honourable senators,
that you wish to cheat or deprive the old age pensioners of
that extra $8 that they would be entitled to and should
receive, then go ahead and pass the bill and have royal
assent and caîl your election.
Again, may I make this plea, that you have dissolution
today and that we get rid of this government. I think of
tne rather bitter debate in the other house in which Honourable Alvin Hamilton described a certain individual as
having rabies. He said that when an animal has rabies it is
taken out and shot. I am not suggesting that the members
of this Parliament should go through that, but I would
suggest that they receive a rabies shot in the form of an
election.
Han. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, in connection
with the telegram that the Leader of the Government
thought he should place on Hansard, I merely wish to
remind him that last night one official of the department
explained that, of course, the department was a very
important client for IBM-and the client is always right.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time, and passed.

THE LATE DUKE OF WINDSOR
EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, it is my duty to
inform the Senate of the death on Sunday last of His
Royal Highness the Duke of Windsor.
The Prime Minister has sent the following message to
the private secretary to Her Majesty the Queen:
I should be grateful if you would convey to Her
Majesty and other members of the Royal Family this
expression of sympathy on behalf of the Government
of Canada and al Canadians on the death of His
Royal Highness the Duke of Windsor.
His Royal Highness occupied a very special place in
the hearts and imaginations of Canadians who displayed their affections openly during his visits to
Canada as Prince of Wales. On those occasions the
personal warmth and youthful spirit of the man were
communicated vividly to the people of this country.
Al Canadians and especially those who remember
him in that role now grieve at his death.
I humbly request that Her Majesty extend to the
Duchess of Windsor our heartfelt condolences on this
sad occasion.
I know all honourable senators would wish to be
associated with this message of sympathy.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, the official
Opposition wishes to be associated with the expression of
grief and condolence which the Government of Canada
has extended to Her Majesty the Queen and to the
Duchess of Windsor.

CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL, 1972
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Keith Laird moved the second reading of Bill C-2,
to amend the Criminal Code and to make related amendments to the Criminal Code 1967 Amendment Act, the
Criminal Records Act, the National Defence Act, the
Parole Act and the Visiting Forces Act.
He said: Honourable senators, at the outset I should
point out that there are 76 clauses in this bill, and unless
this house states otherwise I think it should go to a committee, which presumably would be the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
Moreover, the bill does several things. It creates some
new offences, it eliminates some older offences, and it
contains some housekeeping amendments. For this
reason, I think it would be well if it went to committee.
* (2010)

This bill is a measure in pursuance of the process of law
reform. While the original Criminal Code was passed in
1892, quite frankly there was not too much in the way of
change since that time up until the last three or four
years. It is true that in 1954 there was a revision, so-called,
of the Code, but that consisted of housekeeping amendments, changes in language, changes in the placing of
sections, and that sort of thing. This is part of the process
of bringing the Criminal Code up to date.
In that connection we must not forget that to be enforceable a criminal law must have social acceptance. We know
from long experience that if a law does not have social
acceptance it simply will not work. As a result, we must
examine every bill such as this, and make sure that its aim
is in pursuance of that objective.
This particular bill does take into account the fact that
immorality is not necessarily equated with criminality. In
other words, our inclination has been to think that anything immoral is criminal, and that it should appear in the
Code as an offence. We all know, however, that changes
have already been made in that respect. On the other
hand, we have to take into account the situation of society
today. It may be necessary to make more stringent provisions against certain conditions such as arise out of
violence.
In that connection, honourable senators will know that
there has been created the Law Reform Commission
under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Patrick Hartt and,
of courseHon. Mr. Choquette: I am sorry, but what is the name of
that commission headed by Mr. Justice Patrick Hartt?
Hon. Mr. Laird: The Law Reform Commission.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Dealing primarily with the criminal
law.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

Hon. Mr. Laird: That commission is charged with the
responsibility of constantly examining the law, and
making recommendations which will be for the betterment of the law. I am not saying that the commission had
anything to do with this bill, but I can assure the house
that under the able chairmanship of Mr. Justice Hartt we
can reasonably expect that in the future there will be
other bills based upon recommendations emanating from
the Law Reform Commission.
Honourable senators, this bill does several things and I
shall try to give you an idea of what they are. As I said,
certain changes are housekeeping amendments. Others
are of lesser importance, but at least two or three are of
considerable importance.
For the first time the Code will outlaw hijacking of
aircraft. This includes all the offences that go with it, such
as bringing explosives on board without a proper permit,
and that sort of thing.
Honourable senators may say that we have done fairly
well by those people in Canada who have attempted
hijacking. For example, there is the case of a man in
western Canada who received so many sentences for so
many offences that it seemed likely he would be incarcerated forever. Here justice seems to have been done in a
left-handed way, and it is therefore desirable to have the
hijacking of aircraft made a definite and positive offence.
It should also be borne in mind that Canada is a signatory to two conventions, one signed at The Hague and the
other at Montreal, in which we agreed to make hijacking
an offence, thereby putting us in line with other countries
which have done, or which propose to do, the same thing.
Honourable senators will no doubt agree that this is a
highly desirable move.
One reason I think the bill should go to committee is
that the maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. The Canadian Pilots Association feels, rightly or
wrongly, that the maximum penalty should be death. No
doubt that will be the subject of discussion. There is
always the problem that if we impose a penalty as severe
as death, a person who has hijacked an airplane may
become so desperate that he will do anything. The creation of this new offence is therefore a very important
change.
The next most important change embodied in the bill is
the elimination of corporal punishment. There will be
some discussion of this in the course of the debate, or
perhaps in committee. For a long time there have been
diverse opinions on whether corporal punishment serves
the purpose for which it was intended. We have the forceful argument that the imposition of corporal punishment
might invite more hate for society, and might encourage
an individual to commit a violent crime. On the other
hand, there are those who argue that it is the only way to
deal with certain people.
In any event, it seems to me that there is good argument
for the proposition that corporal punishment should be
eliminated, although I readily admit that there are different points of view which may well emerge during the
course of this debate, or in committee.
Another change is in the distinction which the law
draws between men and women. For example, the respon-

sibility for serving on juries will now apply equally to men
and women. Honourable senators will recall the important work done by Senator Fergusson in this connection,
and I am glad to report that in reading the House of
Commons Debates I find that the honourable senator has
been given full credit for her work by several members of
the other place.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Laird: On the other side of the coin, although
the crime of vagrancy has been eliminated, it is proposed
to make women responsible in certain areas in which
formerly they were not held responsible. For example, it
will now be an offence for a women to solicit on the part
of others for prostitution purposes. Therefore, it works
both ways. But, in any event, several changes have been
made in relation to the distinction which the law has
heretofore drawn as between men and women.

There have also been changes made with regard to the
sentencing of individuals. Provincial court judges, county
court judges, and so forth, are now given the power, even
though there is a plea of guilty or a finding of guilt, to not
register a conviction. I believe this is an advancement,
because I know this specific area has troubled several
judges to whom I have spoken. They felt that an individual though technically guilty and, therefore, subject to a
record which stands for the rest of his or her life, should
not be so burdened. This bill gives them the power to
avoid this. They have been most anxious to have that
power and this bill gives them that particular power.
Another matter that might give rise to some discussion
is that there is now an appeal from a conviction for
contempt of court. The lawyers among us will know what
that means. It is either contempt in the face of the court or
contempt outside the court. Heretofore there have been
appeals as regards the penalty but never an appeal as
regards the conviction itself. This change allows for an
appeal from conviction. I am sure that the thought, in
framing the legislation as such, was that the power of a
judge to charge an individual with contempt of court was
a pretty powerful weapon to put in the hands of a single
individual who may be suddenly swayed by events and
register a conviction which, frankly, under the circumstances, is not entirely warranted and should be subject to
appeal. However, this could be a matter for debate. I am
not trying to make a dogmatic statement.
The bill also proposes to allow certain more serious
offences to be tried by county court judges, offences such
as bribery, rape, attempted rape, manslaughter, causing
death by negligence. The whole object, of course, is to
speed up the administration of justice. The decision to
give county court judges jurisdiction to try divorces has
worked out very well, they tell me. It has speeded up the
disposition of those very troublesome cases which no one
really wants to try.
Another instance where discretion is given to judges is
in the power to provide for intermittent sentencing where
the penalty is less than 90 days. For example, such person
could serve his time on weekends. This would enable him
to work during the week if, say, he were supporting a
family. This is something that a good many judges feel is

desirable, because so often the real punishment is not on
the individual but on his family.
In the same vein, this bill gives the judges the power to
suspend an individual's driving licence on an intermittent
basis. But I should point out something that came up in
committee in the other place. It is all very well for us to
provide for this here, but most provinces have legislation
which provides for automatic suspension of an individual's driving licence by its Department of Transport or
other appropriate department. However, this, at least,
gives a lead and the provinces may follow along if they so
desire. The whole idea is that an individual may find it
most difficult to carry on with his job and support his
family if his licence is completely suspended. So the judge
is given the discretion to suspend it on an intermittent
basis.
Judges are given the power to discharge a juror for
illness, or if for any reason it appears that the juror has
arrived at some conclusion without hearing the evidence.
For any good reason a judge can now discharge a juror.
Up to now a judge could not do so. I believe this is an
advance. After all, this sort of thing does happen, particularly illness, and the judge should have that power.
The offence of attempted suicide is eliminated from the
Criminal Code entirely. To be quite frank, I believe this
only makes sense. What these poor people need is medical
attention, not incarceration. As a matter of fact, I have
acted in cases where people have been charged with
attempted suicide and it always seemed to me a great
miscarriage of justice that they should even be facing a
judge for such an offence. It is now eliminated entirely.
On the other side of the picture, an offence is presumed
if a person is found in possession of a car whose serial
number has been obliterated. As you know, this is an old
trick: steal a car, obliterate the serial number and carry
on from there. The onus is on anyone found in possession
of a car on which the serial number is obliterated to show
that it was done legitimately, or that the person knew
nothing about it, as the case may be.
Another change is the alleviation of the heavy onus
placed upon people charged with possessing house-breaking, vault-breaking or safe-breaking instruments. This
change is made as a result of various cases and the comments of judges. To be quite frank, I have not practised
any criminal law worth mentioning for 20 years, but I
understand that at present the onus is on a person found
in possession of anything that might be used for housebreaking, such as a screwdriver; he can be compelled to
give an answer why he had the instrument in his possession. After listening to what the courts had to say on the
matter, it was felt that this was unfair, so the bill proposes
to alleviate that onus. In this respect the committee of the
other place made an amendment which I think helped the
cause considerably. I will not go into details; it will no
doubt be gone into in committee.
The debate in the other place and in their committee
produced a high grade of argument on this bill, which has
been given a pretty thorough going over.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Do you think we can do the same here?
Hon. Mr. Laird: I am positive we can. That is why I think
it should go to committee. I would be inclined to predict

SENATE DEBATES
that some of the matters I am raising now will be the
subject of very interesting discussion in committee,
because I do not think there is uniformity of view on some
of them. That is exactly why it should go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Seriously, and not just in the routine
way, as we have done recently?
Hon. Mr. Laird: This will be no routine thing, I hope,
because it is an important bill.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Perhaps the honourable senator will
bring his screwdriver with him.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If you are there I don't need anything.
Hon. Mr. Laird: All right, bring your screwdriver.
Understandably, disturbing the peace is a rather
common offence, of which one could be convicted in
connection with a dwelling house but, oddly enough, not
in connection with an apartment building. Unfortunately
for those of us who, like myself, live in apartments, this
loophole has been plugged. Apartment dwellers cannot
now disturb the peace without incurring the wrath of the
law. In other words, apartment dwellings are in the same
category as ordinary dwellings when it comes to laying a
charge of disturbing the peace.
* (2030)

This strengthens the Code. We all know that in our
present society there is a real problem in connection with
the obstruction of police and the obstruction of justice
generally. It was felt that the existing penalties were
inadequate and they have been increased. The wording of
the section certainly makes it tougher on those persons
who try to obstruct justice in any way, by threat or by
other means. So this is an improvement.
Another thing that will interest the house is that finally
Senator John M. Macdonald is vindicated. In the case of
theft and allied offences, for the offence to be indictable it
will have to involve an amount of over $200 instead of
over $50.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Laird: Senator Macdonald worked on this, and
it seemed to make sense. As a matter of fact, it was passed
by the Senate as Bill S-21 but unfortunately it died on the
order paper of the House of Commons. I think that Senator Macdonald, along with Senator Fergusson, deserves
full marks.
Another very sensible change is in regard to people who
operate vessels while under the influence of alcohol. They
will be dealt with in the same way as impaired drivers of
motor vehicles. Honourable senators who have had boating experience will realize the need for this amendment.
Thousands of small vessels operate in the waters around
my city of Windsor, and I am amazed that more people
are not killed or drowned as a result of the mishandling of
boats by impaired drivers. In addition to putting these
people in the same category as impaired drivers of motor
vehicles, this bill also creates an offence of operating a
vessel dangerously, whether impaired or not. There is
certain provincial legislation-at least in Ontario-to help
meet a situation like that; but the idea is to get this into
the Criminal Code where there is no question about its
applying to the whole country.
[Hon. Mr. Laird.]

In connection with an offence which happens far too
often, the turning in of false fire alarms, it was felt that
the penalties were not severe enough. It will now be possible to proceed in these cases by way of indictment as well
as by way of summary conviction. For those who are not
lawyers, may I say that proceeding by way of indictment
means a more severe treatment, for it enables a heavier
penalty to be imposed. We all agree there has to be the
utmost deterrent to turning in a false fire alarm. It is a
vicious sort of crime.
Honourable senators, in case any of you happen to be in
the habit of using slugs in coin-operated machines, it is an
offence to do so. In addition, it will now be an offence to
manufacture, produce or sell slugs for this purpose.
The bill also provides that a person can be remanded
for 30 days for mental observation without a medical
practitioner's certificate. With a medical practitioner's
certificate, he can be remanded for 60 days for observation. I think this is important, because it is most difficult
as a rule to get a medical practitioner into a court room.
They are busy enough. They do a phenomenal amount of
work as it is. To get them to come into court is a difficult
proposition. So I think it is a real advance, particularly for
the remote areas, that if it appears to the judge or magistrate that the accused needs mental observation then,
without a medical practitioner saying so, the judge can
remand the accused for 30 days. In the case where the
medical practitioner does say so, the judge can remand
the accused for 60 days.
Another point along the same line, which I also consider
a real advance, is that the accused may be, or in fact will
be, removed from the court room while evidence is being
given about his mental condition. It has always seemed a
monstrous thing to me that the accused should be present
in court to hear such testimony.
I do not know whether any of you have gone through
such an experience, but I recall acting for an unfortunate
boy who had killed his own mother. Rightly or wrongly,
and I guess it turned out rightly, I chose to take the
position that he was not mentally fit to stand trial. That
poor boy was about 18 years old. By the rules of the court
he had to stay in the dock and listen to the evidence being
given by the psychiatrist about his insanity.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: The boy's insanity or the
psychiatrist's?
Hon. Mr. Laird: Well, actually, the one who was compelled to stay in court was the boy.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: And all he had done was kill his
mother?
Hon. Mr. Laird: He had to listen to some psychiatrists on
my side who said he was not mentally fit, and to some
psychiatrists on the other side who said he was. I thought
that was a monstrous thing for him to experience. I think
you will agree.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Certainly, but that is the usual evidence of psychiatrists.
Hon. Mr. Cook: What did his mother say?
Hon. Mr. Laird: Of course, you have a point there. In any
event, it was a pretty monstrous thing and I was glad to

May 30, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

see this amendment made to the Code. I am sure you will
agree it is a decided advance.
Honourable senators, I feel I have covered the bill fairly
thoroughly, except for some housekeeping amendments. I
can only repeat that it is in the continuing process of law
reform that this bill is brought before this house. It did
receive full debate in the other place and quite full treatment in committee in the other place. For example, I
might mention that, dealing with the problem of hijackers, the question arose whether or not the section as
originally worded created an offence if a hijacker got on a
plane and did something while the aircraft was still on the
ground. An amendment was made in committee to cover
that situation so that if a hijacker got on an airplane it did
not matter whether or not the airplane was in flight. If the
hijacker took the usual steps that hijackers do take in
order to gain control of an airplane, then it was clearly
included within the terms of the offence.
Altogether I do suggest to honourable senators that the
bill will no doubt be the subject matter of some discussion
on certain points in both committee and in debate here.
There are bound to be conflicting points of view on such
controversial matters as corporal punishment, contempt
of court, death penalty for hijackers and that sort of
thing, and whether these matters are being approached in
the right way.
I am not being dogmatic about this. I think a person
would make a mistake if he were to be dogmatic. Just
because the bill has passed the other place does not mean,
as the Leader of the Opposition quite rightly pointed out,
that it must of necessity be accepted by us. The Senate
has amended hundreds, perhaps thousands, of bills. This
may well be one of those bills which we feel should be
amended. Who knows? In any event it is, in my view, a
case of definite progress being made in the matter of law
reform. We are living in a different society and established values such as we have known are, in many
instances, going by the board. As a matter of fact, the
standards that we elected to keep were not necessarily
always right. I think that in many instances we have been
shown that by the younger generation, and more power to
them.
0 (2040)
I say that, honourable senators, because the simple
acceptance of standards for their own sake does not mean
they are always right. As a result, this particular type of
legislation is desirable to bring the law up to date, and to
bring it into line with social thinking and the social mores
as they exist today. We either accept progress along those
lines, or we perish.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, it is my
intention to adjourn this debate and to speak on this bill
tomorrow. However, at this stage I should like to be permitted a question. I understand that at the outset of his
remarks Senator Laird assured the house that the Law
Reform Commission was not consulted in this matter, and
it did not have anything to do with the amendments he
has just explained. Mr. Justice Hartt, as we know, is one
of the youngest and brightest judges of the Supreme
Court of Ontario, and he has chaired this commission for
a period of two years. I should like to know from the
honourable sponsor of this bill, before I speak on it tomor-

row, why this commission headed by Mr. Justice Hartt
was not consulted and why it had, in fact, nothing to do
with this bill.
Hon. Mr. Laird: That is a fair question. What I said-and
this can be read tomorrow in Hansard-wasthat as far as
I know they had nothing to do with this particular bill. I
still say that.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Do you know why?
Hon. Mr. Laird: I would say the reason is that the bill
was prepared before they were organized and com
menced their deliberations. However, I shall try to get
more definite information on this, and let you know.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I move that the debate be
adjourned.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, debate adjourned.
U.S.S.R. PARLIAMENTARIANS
VISIT TO CANADA-DEBATE CONCLUDED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, May 16, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Connolly
(Ottawa West), calling the attention of the Senate to some
aspects of the recent visit to Canada of seven members of
the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics.
[Translation]
Hon. Renaude Lapointe: Honourable senators, on the
occasion of the visit to Canada of the Soviet parliamentary delegation, on which honourable Senator John Connolly reported to us on May 16 in a very thorough and
interesting fashion, His Honour the Speaker of the Senate
had arranged for a completely informal meeting in one of
the Senate lounges, where half a dozen Canadian journalists and writers, both English and French-speaking, could
chat with Mr. Alexander Chakovsky of Moscow, writer,
critic, editor of the Gazette littéraire,and member of the
Foreign Relations Commission of the Nationalities Council, and Mr. Michael Stelmakh, a novelist from the Republic of the Ukraine.
The Honorable Keith Davey and I were the co-hosts at
this gathering which was held on Wednesday, March 22,
from 2.30 to 4 p.m. and which was attended by Mr. JeanLouis Gagnon, then Director of Information Canada, who
has since become Ambassador to UNESCO in Paris, Mr.
Roger Duhamel, special adviser to the Secretary of State,
who yesterday was appointed Ambassador to Portugal,
former Ambassador Robert Choquette, who is now the
Director of Information Canada in Montreal, Mr. Christopher Young, manager of the Ottawa Citizen and Mr. Erik
Spicer, Chief Librarian of the Library of Parliament, as
well as a representative of Tass Agency and two interpreters, one for English and the other for French.
Although our French-speaking guests for the greater
part of the meeting spoke English, in order to speed up
the process, the conversation was at first somewhat slow,
because of the requirements of interpretation. But it grew
more animated thanks especially to Mr. Chakovsky who
gave us, in English, an idea of the distribution of the great
monthly of which he is editor, namely the Gazette littéraire.This magazine, published in Russian and without

SENATE DEBATES
illustrations, has a circulation of over 1,600,000. Mr. Chakovsky added that it could be increased but for a shortage
of paper. We immediately suggested he remedy the situation by giving us an order. A literary gazette is also
published in the other republics to which the local writers
contribute in their own language. The selection criteria
for the many manuscripts submitted are set down by a
steering committee which decides on the quality of the
work including, we believe, its ideological orthodoxy.
Questioned about the possibility of publishing an English
version of his Gazette littéraire,which could be distributed throughout the world, Mr. Chakovsky replied that this
could not be done, explaining that other Soviet publications written in various languages are distributed internationally. For instance, in English, there is Culture and
Life and Soviet Literature, and, in French, ouvres et
Opinions.
However, what we found most interesting was a list of
Canadian authors whose works, translated into Russian,
have become very popular in the U.S.S.R. With a certain
smile, Mr. Chakovsky pulled out of his pocket a slip of
paper containing those names, the enumeration of which
was truly a revelation to us. Stephen Leacock ranked
first; he is a great favourite over there. Seeing how surprised we were, our visitor added that Leacock's humour
being rather of the situation type, its transposition into
Russian is relatively easy. Then there is Farley Mowat
who, as we know, has written a great deal on the Far
North and who unreservedly admires what the Soviets
have done in Siberia, and Grey Owl and Morley Callaghan. This list also includes a communist writer who is
little known here but who is considered there as one of the
most remarkable Canadian authors, Dyson Carter. A novelist from Toronto, Hugh Garner, who often describes the
slums and the life of the outcasts of fortune, is also of
interest to the Soviets. Lastly, the Russians also find the
books of Pierre Berton very fascinating. No French
Canadian writer is included on this honours list, but Mr.
Chakovsky showed a desire to obtain the titles of a few
books in French that might be translated into Russian. We
are convinced that the works of about a score of Quebec
novelists would be very much appreciated by them.
We had very few books by Soviet writers to offer in
return. Mr. Erik J. Spicer started by mentioning the great
classics, but he was interrupted at once and asked what
we know about contemporary Russian writers. The
Library of Parliament only has two collections of short
stories, articles and sketches by Mikhail Sholokkov, who
is now 67 years old. These books, which are entitled The
Don Flows Home to the Sea and And Quiet Flows the
Don in the Penguin editions, were first published in 1965
in the U.S.S.R. and later translated into English in Britain.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We must have Dr. Zhivago.
Hon. Miss Lapointe: Yes, but not here; I do not think so.
Our guests learned with some displeasure that the best
known and most admired authors here are Pasternak and
Soljenitzyne, whose works, published outside the
U.S.S.R., brought to their respective authors the Nobel
Prize. Messrs Chakovsky and Stelmakh were quite surprised and found this situation deplorable. They would
rather see Canadians read authors who express their
country better, in other words, those whose thoughts are
[Hon. Miss Lapointe.]

Mav 30. 1972

more in line with government policy. However, one
Canadian indicated that the works of these conformist
and edifying writers might not be quite so fascinating.
A concern for courteousness prevented the Canadians
who were present to open a discussion, which could have
developed into a debate, on the methods used by the
Soviet government to repress, intimidate and punish free
intellectuals. These methods, which reportedly include
confinement to psychiatrie institutions which are supposed to be worse than gas chambers, were highly condemned only recently by two great French leftist periodicals, Esprit and Le nouvel Observateur, and also by
writer Thierry Maulnier, of l'Académie française. Would
it have been better, under the circumstances, to show
courage and raise directly the question or to keep away
from it? To answer this is not easy.
Touching lightly on that ticklish subject which is surely
more thorny than that of our trade relations, Mr. Gagnon
explained to our visitors that we have a limited market for
translations due to our small population. Canada, he said,
must rely on Great Britain, the United States and France
to get its supplies and it buys what is available. Due to the
unorthodox character of their works, the Soviet writers
who are compelled to publish abroad consequently enjoy
an extensive publicity which, it must be recognized, also
serves the purposes of a certain anti-soviet propaganda.
However, in most cases, those writers are really talented,
thus giving rise to a certain interest and then a wide
distribution of their works in Western Europe and in
America. If it appears normal for the Russians to prefer
Canadian authors to others because they dwell on the
deficiencies in the capital society, it also seems normal
that following the example of the British, American and
French people, the Canadians are drawn by the Russian
works which do not disguise the deficiencies of the socialist system. We feel, however, that it would be possible for
both sides to exchange fewer political and critical works.
Someone said that it rests with the Russian embassy,
through the already existing cultural agreements, to make
known the modern writers whose works published in
Russia, in the Ukraine or elsewhere are representative of
contemporary trends and would in French or English
translations be more interesting and more instructive for
Canadians. We believe that some of these works are
already distributed in universities. It is regrettable that we
did not think of gathering such information before meeting with these writers. Senator Davey and Senator Yuzyk,
who have attended part of the seminar, may have additional details to give on the subject.
The discussion with the chief librarian, Mr. Spicer, centered on the possibility of exchanging parliamentary
documents: Debates of the House of Commons and of the
Senate, statutes, standing orders, parliamentary guides
and so on. This exchange can apparently be worked out
and the shipments made without much trouble, through
Information Canada. The question of an exchange of
writers was also discussed but it should take place
through writers' societies now in operation within the two
federations.
As for Mr. Stelmakh, he writes television novels. As he
was not as loquacious as his colleague, it was difficult to
know, through the interpreter, what television programs

Ma- 30l 1972

are most appreciated by the public. Mr. Robert Choquette,
who has written a great number of first rate novels for the
French language radio and television networks, briefly
explained the evolution of several Canadian writers
toward these modes of expression which are not only
more up ta date and powerful, but also more profitable.
Regarding the exchange of newspapers, Mr. Spicer
reminded Mr. Chakovsky that when Mr. Poliansky visited
Canada several years ago, he had asked whether the
Library of Parliament would be interested in receiving
the newspaper Izvestia, ta which Mr. Spicer had replied:
"Yes, provided it is translated into English." The impression he gathered, the other day, was that Mr. Chakovsky
did not fully agree because he believes that this newspaper is intended mostly for domestic consumption.
In concluding, I must say that a more protracted discussion and a better briefing, especially on the part of
Canadian guests, would have been necessary for an indepth approach ta various questions. In spite, however, of
the fact that our Soviet counterparts who had just
returned from their journey in Western Canada were
obviously very tired, this brief exchange of views, the first
of its kind, was very friendly and certainly contributed, at
the cultural level, ta the inception of more open and
fruitful relations in the future.

The Hon. the Speaker: If no other honourable senator
wishes ta speak, I must declare this inquiry debated.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
LABOUR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTES AFFECTING PUBLIC
SERVICES-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, April 26, the
adjourned debate on the motion of honourable Senator
Haig that the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be instructed ta examine and report
upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public services.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, this
particular motion, moved by Senator Haig and seconded
by my colleague from Saskatchewan, Senator Buckwold,
has been before us for a considerable time. I think conditions in Canada have changed somewhat since this motion
was first placed on the order paper. Certain problems
exist in parts of Canada which, in my opinion, have
changed the situation from that which prevailed when
Senator Haig brought this matter ta our attention.
* (2100)

I am one of those who believe that strikes generally, in
bath the public sector and the private sector, have
increased ta a point where they pose a serious threat ta
the total economy of the country. It seems ta me that the
heads of labour unions have misinterpreted the ability of
the Canadian economy ta meet their wage demands.
As productivity increases in those industries which
create wealth and add ta the gross national product of our
nation, labour leaders seem ta demand wage increases in

other segments of the economy to keep pace with that
growth. However, they lose sight of the fact that many
people in our country, and in all nations of the world, are
not employed in wealth-producing industry.
I can think of two examples of those employed in nonwealth-producing segments of our economy-civil servants and school teachers. If that segment of the labour
population which is employed in the wealth-producing
areas want their full share of the increased productivityand, in many instances, in my opinion they have received
it-then those not engaged in wealth-producing activities
demand, and in many instances receive, similar increases
in wages. This, of course, is inflation.
I think, therefore, that if we are to divide the increased
growth in our society among all working people, then
those who are employed in the wealth-producing industries must take a smaller share in order to leave some of
the wealth created to those employed in the non-revenueproducing enterprises of our nation.
Of course, this motion deals with federal legislation
respecting labour-management differences and disputes.
At least, in my interpretation it deals only with those who
are employed under federal jurisdiction and, of course,
those who are employed chiefly in the non-revenue-producing sectors of our economy.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: My honourable friend says no, and
I can understand his reason for saying that because I
recall his remarks in introducing this motion, to the effect
that it includes those, for instance, employed by Air
Canada. Of course, they are revenue-producing but, by
and large, they are in the minority and not the majority as
far as this motion is concerned.
I doubt the wisdom of the Senate involving itself in this
matter at this time. It is my understanding that there is
legislation before the Legislature of Ontario dealing with
this particular matter. I, for one, would like ta read those
debates and any legislation introduced by the Government of Ontario. Bill C-183, an act ta amend the Canada
Labour Code, is before the House of Commons. I would
like ta see the result of the debate on that particular bill
before we proceed with the motion of Senator Haig.
This is not ta say that I am not as much disturbed as the
honourable senator opposite by the attitude of labour in
many areas in our economy today. I repeat, however, that
because of the situation prevailing in the Province of
Quebec at the moment-I am happy ta see that it is not as
out of line today as it was ten days ago, and my hope is
that the situation there will continue ta improve-I believe
this house would be well advised ta postpone any activity
in this area until such time as the field is a little clearer
than it is at the moment, and until such time as we have
heard all the arguments in the Legislature of Ontario, and
those in the other place and this house with respect ta Bill
C-183.
I hope, therefore, that there will be unanimous consent,
or at least majority consent, ta the postponement of a
decision on this motion until a later date.
In saying that, I wish ta repeat that I am equally concerned with the problems facing this nation, and the
nations of the western world, arising from the demands of

SENATE DEBATES
labour. In my opinion, if one takes the time to produce
statistics they will show that labour has been well treated
in Canada, as it has been in the western world. I think one
can also produce statistics to show that labour today
spends less time in earning the finer things of life, including homes, than ever before.
We must in this country, as we must in the western
world, convince labour that it can take only its fair portion of the fruits of the combined activities of management, finance, and labour that produce goods and services which are available to the peoples of the world. It
seems to me that one of the problems confronting Canada
and other western nations today is the risk of pricing
ourselves out of world markets. In the long run there is
not one segment that will suffer more as a result of such
policies than labour itself.
Therefore, I hope we can agree to postpone this motion
until a later date. At another time I would be quite prepared, unless there is a change of attitude, to give full
support to Senator Haig's motion. I do not think this is the
time to proceed, and I hope that my colleagues support
me in my theories.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: May I ask the honourable senator a
question? Where does he get this distinction, which I
thought had died out with the physiocrats of the eighteenth century, between wealth-producing activities, or
revenue-producing activities, as he called them, and nonwealth-producing, or non-revenue-producing activities?
Surely he is not suggesting that only the production of
physical commodities, or their transformation from one
form to another, is wealth-producing? Surely the teachers
and the civil servants are producing wealth in the sense
that modern economists understand it, unless economics
has undergone a complete transformation since I was
studying it some years ago.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I agree entirely with my honourable friend's remarks but, after all, I do not think you can
measure in a dollars-and-cents return to the nation the
ability to pay increased wages to those segments of our
society to which he referred, in the same fashion in which
you can measure it to pay increased wages to employees
who produce goods and services which are sold for dollars and cents to the consuming public. If those segments
of the labour force producing goods and services which
are sold for dollars and cents take a full return out of the
economy there is nothing left for other segments of society, civil servants as an example. In my opinion, we have to
rationalize and see that the whole of the labour force in
our country receives its fair share of the increase in the
gross national product. In many instances in the past I do
not think that has been the case. Such a situation is not
fair.
* (2110)

In addition, there is that segment of the labour force
which is not organized. I do not think anyone will disagree
with me when I say that the unorganized segments of the
labour force have not received the regular increases in
salaries which the highly-organized segments of our society have. That is very unfair. I believe that every segment
of our society is entitled to its fair share of the increase in
the gross national product of this country.

Hon. Ernest C. Manning: Honourable senators, this
motion proposes a study directed particularly to the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about a
settlement of labour-management issues and disputes in
areas affecting public services.
Senator McDonald pointed out that this is only one area
in which the whole issue of labour-management relations
today is causing a great deal of eoncern, not only to those
connected with the labour movement but to Canadians as
a whole.
There is much to be said for the point made by Senator
McDonald. Studies are today going on in provincial jurisdictions across Canada, which also have a deep concern
because of the disruptions which have taken place, or
which are threatened, in various areas of the Public
Service.
These may be quite valid reasons for deferring for some
time the type of study proposed. My purpose in speaking
to the motion is to suggest that perhaps the Senate should
consider something that goes considerably further than
merely postponing until a later date the type of study
proposed here.
It seems to me that most Canadians will agree that the
whole problem of labour-management relations is a serious national issue, requiring serious attention not only by
governments, management, and labour, but also by the
Canadian public generally.
We are all familiar with the seriousness of disruptions in
public services which are occasioned when the present
machinery is unable to resolve disputes. We have strikes
and the tying up of essential public services, causing not
only great inconvenience but actual hardship to thousands of completely innocent people who have no direct
part in the dispute. No one would want to see continued
the situation which has occurred during the past year.
It is equally true that in the commercial and industrial
world this country is losing hundreds of thousands of
man-hours of work every year. We are seeing created a
great deal of hardship on the part of those whose income
is affected by strikes and lockouts. We are also seeing our
competitive position in the world of trade, as we know it
today, jeopardized by the impact of this type of thing on
our total national economy.
In looking back over a number of years, most of us will
agree that the working people of this country, and other
countries, have fought their way through a very difficult
period. There was a time when labour conditions certainly
were bad and statutory provisions were very limited.
There was little that regulated hours of employment, and
little in the way of minimum wages, fair labour practices,
and other things. A great deal of credit is due the working
people who acted and did something on their own behalf
to try to correct some of their concerns.
Governments became more and more responsive to the
validity of their arguments, and we have in Canada today,
at both federal and provincial levels, a considerable
amount of legislation having to do with the legitimate
protection of the rights and interests of employees. However, it seems to many of us-and it is interesting to see
that it is now being publicly stated by some labour leaders
on this continent-that the technique of strikes and lock-

outs are becoming obsolete in the complex society of
today, where the interests of so many thousands, and in
some case millions, of people can be quickly affected by
these issues.
The practices which have grown up over the years are
no longer suitable for coping with the problems of our
modern society, and new techniques must be developed.
This applies not only to the Public Service, but also to
industry and commerce, and, indeed, right across the
board.
I know that these matters are already familiar to honourable senators. My reason for drawing them to your
attention is that this Senate, in the months and years
ahead, could perhaps render a very valuable service in
this important field by going considerably beyond what
the resolution proposes, which is simply an examination
of existing federal legislation in one field.
We have in the Senate a considerable number of standing committees, but it is significant that we do not have a
standing committee dealing with labour-management
relations. I submit that this subject is a far bigger issue in
Canada today, and is more important in its relationship to
the interests of Canadian people, in its bearing on our
productivity, our standard of living, and the welfare of

DEBATES
our wage earners, than many of the subjects for which we
have standing committees.
I personally would like to see the Senate consider, when
the matter is finally examined and disposed of, the establishment of a standing committee on labour-management
relations, to inquire into labour problems in the Public
Service and into the larger national issues arising from
disruptions in the productivity and the labour force of this
country. I do not feel that the Standing Senate Committee
on Health, Welfare and Science is particularly constituted
to do the kind of investigation about which I am speaking.
I mention this now so that honourable senators might give
some consideration to it. My hope is that later on we might
seriously consider the establishment of a permanent
standing committee of this house to examine into all matters as they come up from time to time in this all important area of labour-management relations. Perhaps such a
committee, through its studies, could help develop some
new techniques more appropriate for our twentieth century and technological age than those which we now have.
I feel such a committee would render a valuable service to
the Canadian people.

success. I warn the government leader. I do not want to
take him by surprise. That is difficult to do anyway. If too
much legislation reaches us in the last week before the
summer adjournment, unless the leader uses the big stick,
which he tried to do two weeks ago, we will have to sit
after the House of Commons have adjourned. They will
just have to come back to deal with amendments or for
royal assent.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I say to the Leader of the Opposition, in the best of humour, that I never use the big stick.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You have someone else use it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The argument of sweet persuasion
always seems to be effective with my honourable friend.
Hon. Paul Dearuisseaux: Honourable senators, being
one of those who made some criticism in this regard when
the tax reform bill was before this house, I should like to
put a question to the Leader of the Government. I should
like to preface my question by commenting on what was
expressed then. At that time the hope was expressed by
some of us that in the future we would be given ample
opportunity to undertake a full study of all important bills
submitted to us. I hope that this comes about.
My question is this: Does the Leader of the Government
wish this chamber to handle some of these important bills
even before they are adopted in the other place?
Hon. Mr. Martin: As I have already told Senator Beaubien, that matter is one for the Senate as a whole to consider. It is not a matter for my consideration alone. I share
Senator Desruisseaux's view that the Senate be given the
fullest opportunity to consider every bill. That is the position that is open to every senator. No senator can justifiably say with regard to the past or the future that he is not
free to apply>his judgment to any measure that is before
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The record will speak for itself.
Hon. Mr. Deuruisseaux: The last time this happened was
in connection with the tax reform bill, and at that time the
Senate was accused ...
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: The Old Age Security bill.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: ... of being unable to do it. Well,
it is not that the Senate cannot do it; it can. I am looking
for the wish of the Leader of the Government in this
regard.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not think that anyone has been
more active in giving effect to that wish than the Leader
of the Government in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: With less result.
Hon. Mr. Martin: If the press took a contrary view it was
not because of the wish of any honourable senator not to
give the maximum amount of time to the consideration of
all problems. To repeat, it is up to each senator to determine how much time he or she wishes this chamber to
take on any measure that comes to it, either by way of
initiation in the Senate itself or by way of dealing with a
measure that has come to us from the other place.
While I am on my feet I should like to say to Senator
Desruisseaux that we are all glad to see him back in his
place at this time.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, on the
matter under discussion I wonder if I might, with respect,
say to the Leader of the Government that the continual
repetition of the platitude that senators are free to delay
legislation is not helping the problem that is before us.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: He has made this same statement on
many occasions. I am not going to say that he is aware
that it is not true, but I am quite sure that he is aware that
it is an unrealistic assessment of the situation that continuously confronts us on these last minute rushes.
I would therefore ask the Leader of the Government if
he has initiated discussions through the usual channels to
make sure that this kind of thing about which the Senate
has been objecting for many years will be ended. Can the
Leader of the Government tell us that this matter is under
discussion through the usual channels and that a solution
is imminent?
I say to him that intelligent men and women in this
chamber and in the other place as well as in the cabinet
and in the government can eliminate this problem if they
have the will and put their minds to it. We have constitutional arrangements whereby conferences between the
two houses can be held when matters of controversy arise
between them. I suggest to the leader that in a matter such
as this he might anticipate that kind of a situation and
immediately initiate discussions. I believe it can be done
and I believe it is the will of this Senate that it be done.
I ask him: Has he initiated that kind of discussion
through the usual channels? And he knows what I mean
by the "usual channels."
e (1420)
Hon. Mr. Martin: That was a long question. I will simply
say that within the last hour, with the assistance of a
number of my colleagues, I have been discussing this
matter with the head of the government himself.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is the shortest answer the government leader has put on the record this year.
CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL, 1972
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Laird for the second
reading of Bill C-2, to amend the Criminal Code and to
make related amendments to the Criminal Code 1967
Amendment Act, the Criminal Records Act, the National
Defence Act, the Parole Act and the Visiting Forces Act.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I am not
rising to oppose the second reading of this bill, which was
so eloquently explained by our colleague Senator Laird.
This bill was given careful consideration in the other
place, and received third reading there, not with a bang or
a whimper but with the gentle sound of angel's wings; it
passed without a recorded vote. Nevertheless, it is a bill of
76 clauses, and its purpose is to amend, not only the
Criminal Code, but five other acts as well. It is thus an

SENATE DEBATES

Having gone through this sad experience I can well imagine now what it would be like for people who are up in the
air when there is a hijacker trying to extort money or
something of that sort.
Not long ago on a radio program called "Livewire,"
people were asked to make comments on the subject of
hijackers. Without exception all of those who called in to
give their opinions said that capital punishment should be
meted out to such gangsters and such fools. Someone
even suggested that hijackers should be given a parachute
that would not open.
Honourable senators, I am sure this bill will be sent to
committee. I am equally sure that the pilot associations
will be called upon to give their views on the subject and
on whether, in their opinion, the proposed punishment to
be meted out is sufficient according to their past
experiences.
No doubt this bill will be given careful scrutiny in committee and perhaps we might then have the benefit of the
opinions of the pilots as to the adequacy of its provisions.
While the bill is perhaps directed mainly to skyjacking,
there are many provisions therein proposing amendments
to the Criminal Code in very important particulars. There
are 20 or 25 of these. I do not propose to go into each of
them in detail at this time. However, I should like to
introduce a caveat as to the general direction in which the
criminal law appears to be heading. While no one would
advocate the retention of corporal punishment or things
of that nature, and while no one would argue that the
criminal law should not be humane in its application,
nevertheless, we may ultimately lose sight altogether of
the fact that the criminal jurisprudence exists for the
protection of the public. We are making it easier and
easier for criminals to avoid the consequences of their
misdeeds, and more and more difficult for those in charge
of law enforcement to execute their duties. There has to
be a boundary somewhere and we must be careful that we
do not overreach it.
As one small example, this bill is removing the offence
of vagrancy, and I should like to hear more in committee
on this matter in so far as the administration of the
criminal law is concerned. As we all know, there was a
charge of vagrancy in our Criminal Code, and it had been
there for years and years. This meant that if police officers in carrying out their duties or while on the beat saw
suspicious characters, they could ask them to give an
account of their conduct; they could ask, "What are you
doing here? How much money have you? What is your
purpose in being around here?" And if the persons asked
could not give a satisfactory account of themselves and of
their conduct they could be brought in, questioned further
and could be charged with vagrancy. I am sure that some
of the authorities, and particularly some of the police
authorities, are quite concerned about the removal of this
vagrancy charge from our Criminal Code. When this bill
goes to committee I intend to ask the experts what their
intentions are exactly and what they hope to gain by the
removal of this clause. As I say, I expect to hear more
about this in committee.
I should also like a little further information in committee concerning the important changes proposed in clauses
33 and 34 of this bill. When I mention these two clauses I

have this in mind: There was a time when certain offences
could be heard only by a judge of the High Court-the
Supreme Court of Ontario-with a jury. Those offences
were enumerated in the Criminal Code. Now I understand
that as a result of some of these proposed amendments
even a humble magistrate, who is now a provincial judge,
will be able to hear any of the criminal cases with the
exception of murder. The option that did not exist at one
time by which an accused could choose the type of trial he
was going to get will exist henceforth and one will be able
to say, "I don't want a jury, I want a single judge," or, "I
want a provincial judge."
I think that with al these amendments we are getting
away from capital punishment. That is the next step, and
I think the reasoning will be quite simply this: if an
ordinary magistrate, who is now regarded as a provincial
judge, can hear the most serious criminal offences with
the exception of capital murder, then there is no need for
capital punishment. To illustrate the point I am making,
but without necessarily agreeing with everything in it, I
should like to quote briefly from a recent article by Philip
Wagner in the Monterey Peninsula Herald of California.
The article refers to the "heavy emphasis that is placed in
these days of rising violence and crime on what the
philosopher Sidney Hook calls 'the human and civil rights
of criminals and of those accused of crime.'"
a (1440)

My youngest daughter, who is residing in Monterey,
thought I would be interested in this article and sent it to
me. I received it only yesterday and it is most timely
because I feel that our authorities are losing track of the
fact that the laws are meant to protect the public and not
so much the criminal. These changes are directed at protecting the criminal. With your permission, I shall quote
this article from the Monterey PeninsulaHeraldentitled
"Do Victims Have Rights?" It is not lengthy. It reads:
Professor Hook in a recent study goes so far as to
describe this phenomenon as a "pre-occupation" with
such rights at the expense of the rights of those wretches dead or alive who are the victims.
This would not be quite so true when the victim is a
candidate for the presidency, even such a scapegoat
of liberals as Governor Wallace. Governor Wallace's
rights as a victim will presumably not be overlooked,
as those of many a lesser victim have been. But as a
general proposition it is nevertheless true, as Professor Hook says, that the rights of victims tend to be lost
in the shuffle as the rights of the accused continue to
be elaborated.
He cites a few examples that some may recall. One
is the case of a man jailed for the death of 12 persons
who was freed from jail and the case against him
dismissed "because the prosecution's only evidence
against him was a voluntary confession to the police
who had failed to inform him of his rights."
I am sure it will please Senator Sullivan to know that
there are people who criticize the present administration
of the law, especially criminal law. Another example cited
by Professor Hook was:
-of the man whose speeding car was stopped by a
policeman who, without a search warrant, forced him
to open his trunk and found that it contained the

440

SENATE DEBATES

corpses of a woman and two children, and who subsequently "walks out of court scot-free because the evidence is ruled inadmissible."
This is amazing and this is the stage that our administration of the law has reached. As a lawyer who has been
practising for 40 years, I am appalled at these technical
points which are raised all the time and which sometimes
result in letting a murderer go scot-free. This is just like a
man who is charged with killing someone while operating
a motor vehicle. After the Crown prosecutor has called all
his witnesses, the judge asks him whether he has finished
his case. The prosecutor answers yes, and the accused's
counsel jumps to his feet and asks for a dismissal. The
judge asks, "On what grounds?" and defence counsel
replies: "My learned friend has failed to prove that the
accused was the driver of the car." This is ridiculous, but
it happens every day. Surely a presiding judge could
easily say to the Crown prosecutor before he closes his
case: "I point out to you that one of the main ingredients
of the charge has not been proven. Have you any witnesses to show that this man was the driver of the car
when the victim was killed?" What would be wrong with
that? This simply is not done. I am appalled at this kind of
administration.
Mr. Wagner's article continues:
Professor Hook, reflecting on the outrages committed in the name of protecting the accused, goes out on
a limb. Considering that crime has become a mass
phenomenon and a matter of general despair, he says,
"I am prepared to weaken the guarantees and privileges to which I am entitled as a potential criminal, or
as a defendant, in order to strengthen my rights and
safeguards as a potential victim. Purely on the basis
of probabilities, I am convinced that I run a greater
danger of suffering disaster as a potential victim than
as a potential criminal or defendant."
It is a good point. Like Professor Hook, I am a firm
believer in the rule that a man is to be presumed
innocent until proved guilty.
This is another cliché we hear all the time.
Also like Professor Hook, I believe that even a good
rule can be carried to the point of absurdity. As a
Dickens character once said, "If the law says that, the
law is an ass."
When a group of thoroughly identified hijackers
seizes a plane with the whole world looking on, the
presumption of their innocence becomes severely
strained. That at least was the belief of the Israeli
recently when they shot the hijackers point blank and
without due process of law. Sometimes due process
gets in the way of justice.
And when in full view of a crowd a man reaches
over someone's shoulder and is photographed in the
act as he empties a revolver into the guts of a presidential candidate the presumption of innocence
becomes a priggish farce.
Honourable senators, I do not feel I have strayed from
my main subject. I had to explain this.
Hon. Mr. McElman: Did you give the bona fides of
Professor Hook? Who is he?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I do not know who he is.
[Hon. Mr. Choquette.]

May 31, 1972
Mav 31. 1972

Hon. Mr. Croll: He is a well-known social scientist from
New York, and he has a fine reputation as a right winger.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: You are a friend of Professor Hook?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You can take it for what it is worth.
If you wish, you can say: "I do not like Hook unless
Senator Choquette tells me he is a good man." I am
merely quoting him and saying that I agree with him,
whether he is called a "crook" or a "Hook".
Hon. Mr. McElman: I was not criticizing you. I was
merely endeavouring to determine his credentials.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I do not happen to have them. This
is a clipping which my daughter sent me from a small
newspaper called the Monterey PeninsulaHerald.
Honourable senators, having said what I have, I am
quite prepared to allow the bill to go to committee where
any required explanations can be given.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I do not
intend to engage in a general discussion of this bill. I
propose to restrict myself to clause 4, which deals with the
crime of contempt of court. However, before I do this I
would be negligent if I did not say to the sponsor of this
bill, Senator Laird, that I admire the way in which he
explained it. I am rather taken with the fact that as a very
distinguished lawyer he avoided technical jargon and
legalese which might not only confuse a layman, but lawyers as well.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: And also doctors.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, and doctors as
well.
I support Senator Choquette's point regarding the
recognition of technicalities which interfere and even
defeat the purpose of the law. This is a matter of growing
concern to judges and lawyers. The warning he has given
in this respect is very salutary because if technicalities,
procedural problems and matters of that nature really
interfere with the substance and spirit of the law and the
administration of justice, it is incumbent upon all who can
do something about it to give serious consideration to the
problem. We are indebted to Senator Choquette for bringing that to our attention.
* (1450)

As Senator Laird said last evening, clause 4 of this bill
deals with the problem of contempt of court. As he also
said, if the contempt is not committed in the face of the
court there is an appeal, not only from the sentence which
might be imposed but from the conviction. Under the
present law, however, when the contempt is committed in
the face of the court, the appeal is against the sentence
only, there being none against the conviction. Clause 4
proposes to change this law to provide that when the
contempt is committed in the face of the court the person
convicted by the presiding judge, or the judges if it is in a
court of appeal, has the right to appeal the conviction.
This is a new right which is imposed upon a person
charged.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not imposed, you mean granted.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is granted, yes; it is
a new right.
In March 1952, an article by Mr. Justice McRuer of the
Supreme Court of Ontario appeared in Volume XXX of
the Canadian Bar Review. It dealt with the problem of
criminal contempt of court procedure, which he described
as a protection to the right of the individual. At page 227
of that article he gives some examples of contempt committed in the face of the court. May I cite from his article:
Contempts committed in the face of the court
include demonstrations in the court room by shouting,
noisy behaviour, applauding a verdict of a jury or a
decision of a judge; refusing to give evidence when
properly subpoenaed as a witness or to answer relevant questions; refusing to leave the court room when
ordered to do so or to obey the orders of the court or
its officers with respect to a trial which is in progress,
whether civil or criminal, or using abusive or disrespectful language to a judge presiding at the trial.
That is a fairly good list of typical examples of contempt committed in the face of the court. The purpose of
the law of contempt, of course, may be reduced to two
items or captions. In the first instance in my view the
purpose of the law of contempt is to reinforce the authority of the court. Here again may I quote from the McRuer
article, in which he cites one of the great authorities on
contempt of court, Oswald's Contempt of Court, 3rd edition. Oswald says:
A Court of Justice without power to vindicate its
own dignity, to enforce obedience to its mandates, to
protect its officers, or to shield those who are entrusted to its care, would be an anomaly which could not
be permitted to exist in any civilized community.
Perhaps I may interject here and say that in the United
Kingdom it has been steadfastly refused, to date at least,
to allow the type of appeal proposed in this clause.
The second purpose of including the law of contempt of
court in our Criminal Code is for the protection of the
individual. In this respect Mr. Justice McRuer states at
page 227:
I say with emphasis that the law of contempt of court
does not exist for the protection of judges but for the
protection of the individual right of every citizen to an
independent administration of justice free from influence or intimidation by improper conduct of any sort.
I hasten to say that the law of contempt does not put the
courts above criticism, nor should it.
Again I refer to a citation in the McRuer article from a
dictum of a very eminent English jurist, Lord Russell of
Killowen, in the case of Regina v. Gray, the citation for
which is 1900, 2 Queen's Bench 36:
Lord Russell of Killowen emphasized that judges
and courts are alike open to criticism and, if reasonable arguments or expostulation is offered against
any judicial act as contrary to law or the public good,
no court could or would treat it as contempt of court.
Nonetheless, the power to commit for contempt in the
face of the court is a sanction which is important for the
administration of justice. It is in support of the law, in
support of order and in support of the court's authority.

At page 236 Mr. Justice McRuer quotes Lord Morris in.
McLeod v. St. Aubyn, (1899) Appeal Cases 549, at page 561
where Lord Morris stated:
The power summarily to commit for contempt of
court is considered necessary for the proper administration of justice. It is not to be used for the vindication of the judge as a person. ... Committal for contempt of Court is a weapon to be used sparingly, and
always with reference to the interests of the administration of justice.
It is true, of course, that some of the sentences which
courts or judges mete out when contempt has been committed are severe. These sentences under the existing law
can be appealed. There have also been times, and I think
the courts would say this, when judges may have been
quick to convict in our country. The American practice, I
am informed, certainly in some areas of the law is somewhat different. If the contempt is committed in the face of
the court, the judge-in the federal courts, certainly-has
the power to cite for contempt. But he has not the power
to find the person guilty of contempt at that time or to
sentence him. That must be done by another court. In
other words, the trial on a question of contempt is not for
the judge before whom the contempt was committed. This
is somewhat similar, I suppose, to the matter of laying a
charge, which is normally a police function, and the
charge has then to be justified.
* (1500)

There are some people who would say that to follow a
practice of that kind in this country would really make a
judge a litigant in the contempt proceedings.
The problem of appeals generally was also discussed by
Mr. Justice McRuer. If I may, I should like to read a brief
passage from his article which I think points up the problem, which is really one for any law enforcement authority. On page 242 Mr. Justice McRuer says:
Although the principle that there should be a right of
appealBoth on the conviction and on the sentence, I am sure he
means.
-is hard to controvert, to define a right of appeal that
would not confound the administration of justice is
difficult. It is simple to state that there should be a
right of appeal in a case where a newspaper has
published comment during a trial; it is another thing
to define a right applicable to those cases where a
contempt is committed in the face of the court, for
example, a witness refusing to answer proper questions put to him. Under our law he may be at once
committed to goal and each witness may be made to
realize that prompt action will be taken for any failure
to answer questions put to him. As a result I have
known only one case where a witness has refused to
give evidence. If a right of appeal did exist from such
an order, is the case to be stopped until the appeal is
heard? On the other hand, there is a distinct interference with the administration of justice if the case
proceeds in the absence of the evidence the witness is
ordered to give. That is only one example, but such
examples ought not to deter those interested in the
development of the administration of justice from

442

SENATE DEBATES
working out some means of appeal so as to cover at
least those cases where the contempt is not one committed in the face of the court. If such a right of
appeal existed-

He is obviously talking about a law earlier than the law
which we now have.
-I think the probable result would be a purification
of the administration of justice and a stricter enforcement of the law to preserve the rights of the parties
before the court.
He concludes this section by saying:
Good judges exercising an arbitrary authority are
more likely to go to extremes in the exercise of caution when their judgments are not subject to review
by a court of appeal than when they are.
Honourable senators, I am informed that no attorney
general has objected to the proposed amendment in
clause 4.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Was this submitted to all attorneys
general?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I do not know. Not
being a member of the government, I simply cannot
answer that question.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Your statement would be relevant only
if it had.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I understand that it
has not been objected to by the attorneys general. Perhaps the statement stands on its own feet. I understand,
however, that the Canadian Bar Association, at its last
annual meeting, passed a resolution in favour of the proposed change. I also understand that the Bar of the Province of Quebec bas taken a stand in support of the proposition contained in clause 4. Perhaps I might be permitted
to read from an article by Guy Bourdon in the MontréalMatin dated May 25, 1972:
[Translation]
Montréal-Matin, Thursday, May 25, 1972:
On July 16, 1971, the President of the Bar addressed
to the federal Minister of Justice a resolution of the
General Council of the Quebec Bar recommending
that the Criminal Code be so amended that any
person convicted of contempt of court could appeal
against both the verdict and the penalty prescribed.
[English]
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Was it after or before the sale of the
newspaper? I am sure my honourable friend understands
that the Montréal-Matinbelonged to the Union Nationale.
That makes a difference in the value of the judgment.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In any event, the
Leader of the Opposition may not have understood my
French pronunciation: The editorial continues:
[Translation]
The Quebec Bar claims that it is inacceptable for a
judge bringing forward an accusation of contempt of
court to grant the accused no time in which to plead
his case and allow himself no period of consideration
before ruling whether the accused is guilty or not.
[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West).]

May 31, 1972

[English]
Honourable senators, I do not know whether, in the face
of the resolutions from the bar associations, and perhaps
in the absence of consultation with attorneys general,
there have been any consultation with any of the judges of
the superior courts of the provinces with respect to this
amendment. Certainly one thing is clear. It is that the
onus of maintaining discipline in the courts, superior as
well as inferior-because all courts are covered-will be a
very heavy one for judges. I would venture to say that in
the light of what has happened, particularly in the neighbouring Province of Quebec in recent years, and even in
recent months and perhaps weeks, the concern of all of us
for the authority of the courts, for maintaining decorum,
and for the due administration of justice, is something
that we cannot take lightly.
There may be other ways of doing it, other than the way
proposed. I venture to say that in the light of the comment
that is available from the bar associations and others, and
in view of this being government policy, this amendment
will probably pass. Perhaps it is proper that it should
pass. However, I raise the point only because I think that
we should not be under the misapprehension that upon
passing this amendment we may have finished with the
problem. Some time in the future there may be problems
existing in the courts-not only in the courts of Quebec,
where perhaps problems have been more noticeable
lately, but also in the courts of other provinces where
organized crime might come into the picture and might
disrupt the proceedings of the courts. I think that cases
such as that might arise in which the Minister of Justice
and Parliament will have to take a serious second look at
this whole problem of the law surrounding contempt of
court.
* (1510)

We in this chamber have not had any example in recent
years of contempt of the Senate. However, there have
been examples of contempt in the face of the other place.
A few years ago they missed by a hair what would have
been mortal results from the throwing of a bomb, as
honourable senators know. This type of thing happening
in Parliament is repugnant to the sense of decency and
decorum of all Canadians, I am sure, except the lunatic
fringe. If it starts to happen in the courts, then the
administration of justice from that moment begins to go
on the skids. I feel the Senate should be alert to prevent
this type of thing.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I do not
expect to keep you very long on this bill, though it is a
very important one. It is an omnibus bill concerning
criminal matters. It is quite difficult, I feel, for any legislative body, by only one vote, to approve in principle a bill
which contains 20 or more principles. In any event, as has
been suggested by Senator Choquette, perhaps the rules
of both Houses of Parliament should be scrutinized to
determine whether, in dealing with a bill of this kindthese omnibus bills-we should not be allowed to vote
separately on each principle involved, or at least be able
to group some of the subject matters involved in this type
of bill. However, it is not too serious a problem at this
time, as far as I am concerned. I think it will be sufficient

Mnv 3,

May

1972

SENATE DEBATES

for this bill to be referred to committee, and thoroughly
examined there.
Before proceeding to the main problem with which I
want to deal-that contained in the portion of the bill
which has already been discussed by Senator Connolly
(Ottawa West)-I should like to say a few words concerning the problem of hijacking. The pilots might have a case
for asking for the death penalty for such offenders. Some
four years ago I voted in favour of the abolition of capital
punishment except in the case of the murder of a policeman. The five-year trial period comes to an end later this
year. I have not changed my mind on that question, but it
seems to me we are faced with a problem in connection
with hijackers in that it is perfectly legal to have a sharpshooter kill a hijacker who is in the process of committing
the crime, whereas it would not be proper for the state to
execute that same hijacker if he succeeds in the hijacking
but is later apprehended. In any case, this problem can be
discussed in committee along with the question of the
murder of a police officer. We still have the death penalty
for the murder of a police officer, although for all practical purposes this penalty has been abolished in Canada
for over eight years. I do not believe there have been any
executions during that period in this country.
The abolition of capital punishment started without any
legislation. I am not accusing the present government of
initiating that practice, because I believe it was the government of which I was a member for a short period that
started it. I am profoundly troubled when I start to think
about the type of penalty that should be imposed on
cold-blooded murderers.
I want to turn now to the problem of contempt of court.
I think it is quite obvious that this offence should continue
to be considered as such, otherwise the authority of the
court would be undermined. It is one of the basic principles of a society such as ours that the courts be able to
operate in an independent way. Because of the circumstances in which these amendments come to us I would
suggest that this bill is ill-timed. As it reads now I would
have to say that the bill is a rather superficial and incomplete attempt at a solution to this problem. It is deficient
and invalid.
As has been explained, the present situation is that
contempt of court not in the face of the court is subject to
appeal not only from the sentence but also from the
conviction itself. The purpose of clause 4 of this bill is to
provide for an appeal from a conviction for contempt of
court in the face of the court. That is in principle very
laudable and commendable. It is easy to quote the opinion
given by the Bar of Quebec a year ago and say, "Well,
that's just what they wanted." In fact, it may not be as
acceptable as it seems.
At first glance, it appears normal that you should have
the right of appeal from a conviction of contempt in the
face of the court, but you have to go a little further than
that. You have to examine the circumstances that presently exist in certain parts of Canada to determine whether
we should deal with this problem at this time and, if we
are to deal with this problem now, whether we are going
about it in the proper way.
I do not know if all honourable senators realize that
recently in the Province of Quebec contempt of court has

become a political tool for many people. They are using
this provision of the law for political purposes, and it is
very easy for these people to abuse the right of appeal
already provided. This bill proposes to extend that right
of appeal to cases where the contempt is committed in the
face of the court, and obviously this too could be abused
to achieve political objectives. I am not referring to any
case that is before the courts at this time, but honourable
senators know or will remember statements made outside
of the courts in which people have treated the judiciary in
a way that is totally unacceptable if we are to maintain a
society such as ours. Even in the kind of society that these
people appear to be striving to bring about, whether it is a
Marxist or a democratic socialist society, they would not
be allowed to do what they are doing, and they would not
be allowed to say what they are saying about the courts
and the judges.
O (1520)

With this amendment coming to us as it does at this time
I am almost led to conclude that Parliament is in fact
siding with those who abuse our judicial system, with
those union leaders who are presently trying to destroy
that system. It is difficult to interpret it otherwise. These
people have been using the right of appeal and the possibilities of serving a sentence for the crime of contempt
of court in order to pose as victims of the system they say
they want to destroy. Parliament is here saying, "Perhaps
we are treating you too roughly and we should give you
the right of appeal, not only from the sentence but also
from the decision that contempt has taken place in the
presence of the court."
I am quite sure that men like Michel Chartrand, Louis
Laberge, or others whom I will not name because their
affronts to the system may have been less obvious than
those of Mr. Chartrand and Mr. Laberge, must rejoice at
the decision of the other place in accepting this principle
to give a right to appeal the decision, not only the sentence, in the case of contempt of court in the face of the
court. I am not prepared to think that in these troubled
times we should worry about people like Michel Chartrand or Louis Laberge. That kind of citizen is the last I
would want to worry about, except to see to it that their
attempts at injuring our judicial system are kept under
control.
I further say that the amendment is ill-conceived. What
we are trying to do here is to prevent abuse of the power
given to a judge, or to a court, to sentence someone who is
guilty of contempt of the court in the face of the court. I
can understand that a judge may sometimes be irritated
and may act too quickly. That is the main problem. I think
that what Senator Connolly quoted from the resolution of
the Bar of Quebec is very much to the point, that a judge
should take time before he finds someone in contempt for
something he has done in the presence of the court. I
agree with this principle. But that does not mean the
problem can be solved merely by giving a right of appeal
from the decision as wel as the sentence.
I suggest, honourable senators, we could find the beginning of a solution in what was done in the Code of Civil
Procedure of the Province of Quebec-which is only ten
years old-when they redrafted the chapter dealing with
the power to punish for contempt of court. You may be

Ma

interested in the general definition of contempt of the
court, which is shorter than that given by Senator Connolly. Article 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec says:
Anyone is guilty of contempt of court who disobeys
any process or order of the court or of a judge thereof,
or who acts in such a way as to interfere with the
orderly administration of justice, or to impair the
authority or dignity of the court.
It goes on to say:
In particular, any officer of justice who fails to do
his dutyI do not think that is relevant for the purpose I have in
mind or that we have to deal with today.
Another article I should like to quote, which I think was
an innovation that should have guided us in dealing with
this problem under the Criminal Code, is Article 52 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, which reads:
Anyone who is guilty of contempt of court in the
presence of the judge in the exercise of his functions
may be condemned at once, provided that he has been
called upon to justify his behaviour.
If I remember correctly, what Senator Connolly quoted
from the recommendations of the Quebec Bar was more
in line with this idea, that in the case of contempt of court
before the court a judge should not make a decision
without giving the accused party the right to explain his
conduct. The judge would therefore have time to reflect,
at least during the period in which he heard the person
accused of contempt of court, which I think is the main
thing.
As it is now, there is an appeal only from the sentence
for contempt of court before the court. Now let us consider what kind of evidence the appeal court will be invited
to consider and decide upon if an appeal from the conviction is added. Contempt of court arising from mere refusal to answer a question, as in a recent case, is very technical. However, with contempt of court when a person
sticks his tongue out at the judge, or laughs at him, or
grumbles, or creates some kind of a disturbance-as is
presently being done in Quebec, and has been done in the
last few trials of labour leaders and professional malcontents-it is not easy to record or have a transcript of what
actually happened.
What will guide the appeal court in cases like that?
Where will they find justification for the decision of the
judge who has come to the conclusion that there was
contempt of court displayed in his presence? I do not
know. Will the judge have to go before the appeal court
and tell them, "I felt that the court was being offended by
the way I was treated"? Will the court of appeal then
listen to the other party, who will say, "I didn't mean
that," and then decide that the judge was wrong in having
felt he was being offended? This is the effect of the
amendment as drafted.
* (1530)

At least, if we had provided, before allowing an appeal
from the conviction, a rule like the one I quoted from
section 52 of the Civil Code of Procedure of Quebec, we
could have a record showing at least the contentions of
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

y

31

1

1972

both sides on the point of contempt, and how the judge
arrived at the decision that there had in fact been contempt of court shown.
Again I am not satisfied at all with the way in which this
amendment is presented to us. It is very simple, everybody is in agreement that there should or could be an
appeal in all important cases like that of being found in
contempt of the court, even in the presence of the court.
That is easy to support. Anybody will agree we should
correct the law. But one must go a little further and find
out what the consequences might be, and how it will
operate.
If the intention is only to help those who presently abuse
the existing possibility of appeal, and who would certainly
abuse this additional possibility of appeal, then I must say
that I am not at all in favour. But if we want to permit the
judiciary to operate in a normal way, if we want to insure
against a situation in which a judge might lose his temper
and be too hard, that is a different matter. Very often
when a judge loses his temper it is because someone has
provoked him to the point where that person should be
found in contempt of court. I know that I could make a
judge lose his temper very easily. I have succeeded with
some of you here-but that is not the same problem. It is
easy to be found in contempt of court for the way I would
have acted, but I defy you to be able to put that in such a
way that the court of appeal would be able to pass judgment on whether there was sufficient evidence for the
judge to find me in contempt. Therefore, we have to be
very careful.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I thought of that several times, but
gave up.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I was hoping the Leader of the Government would say at least a word, and justify my statement.
That is why I kept repeating myself-to cause him to
jump at the bait. He takes a very long time usually; today
I have been more successful than normally.
Honourable senators, as f ar as this problem of contempt
of court is concerned, I hope that in committee we will
take it very seriously. Many members of the judiciary in
Quebec are worried about this amendment. I am not too
sure that the Quebec Bar would be willing to support this
amendment as it is. The statement quoted by Senator
Connolly does not necessarily support the amendment as
it is, but something else, something along the lines of what
I have suggested.
This is a very important problem, more important than
appears on the surface. The solution may seem very
simple, but if we accept this amendment as the answer we
will find it to be unsatisfactory. Also it will not be as easy
to go back. When a right is granted, it is not easy to
diminish or decrease it. Before making this decision we
should in committee invite all people who have some
experience with this sort of problem, especially as it manifests itself in Quebec. We could ask those in other provinces eventually, but we must consider the situation in
Quebec as it is now. The same situation might some day
arise in another province. I hope that we will look at this
very seriously before we accept the amendment as
drafted.

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, we have a constitutional duty to
be careful in these circumstances. On previous occasions
we have not had that opportunity. I know that the government is flot pressed by electoral or other reasons on this
bill, so it can let the Senate assume its full responsibîlity,
and I arn sure ail of us wish to do that.
Hon. Datniel A. Lang: Honourable senators, before dealing with Bill C-2 I shouid like to take this opportunity,
which I have been unable to take advantage of before due
to my absence abroad for several weeks, to congratulate
the Prime Minister of Canada-and I am sure that in so
doing no one is going to accuse me of perpetrating a
repetitive act-on appomnting, during the time I was away,
nime new senators, whose strength we sorely needed, and
particularly for appointing two members of the fair sex to
brighten Up our deliberations and our physical
surroundings.
I know, either personally or by reputation, ail of those
summoned here. I know thema in both capacities, in one or
other, for their contribution to public life before coming
here. I know that in this chamber they wiil continue to
rnake such a contribution, and that in so doing they wil
contribute to the greater credit of the Senate. I welcome
them en masse.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lang: Honourable senators, our debate on Bill
C-2 has been most useful. It has pointed out that we are
really dealing here-although in an omnibus bill, a sort of
potpourri of amendments-with sorne very significant
changes ini the criminal law. Because this bill cornes to us
as an omnibus bill, dealing with a variety of subject matters, it is very difficuit to give it adequate treatment on
second reading, when we have to debate the acceptance or
otherwise of principle.
I find that some clauses of this bill depend on one very
fundamental prînciple; another clause depends on a cornpletely different and unrelated principle; and some
depend on no particular principle at ail but deal with
pragmatic considerations, and practical problerns concerning procedure and administration. Some of the provisions philosophically are rather ameliorating, compassionate provisions. Others, on the contrary, are more
restrictive and penal. So, no matter how we deal with this
bill, no matter what section we deal with, we will find
ourselves in an entirely different area of debate.
For that reason, I hesitate, like many others, to enter
into this debate on second reading. I have risen only on
becorning particularly convinced that, notwithstanding
the ready acceptance thîs bill had in the other place, there
are serious and signîfîcant considerations and we must
take every opportunity we can to deal with thern. For al
practical purposes we can deal with them adequately only
in cominittee.
* (1540)

I say these changes are sign.ificant. They are significant;
even though on the face of them they appear to be purely
procedural. Perhaps 1 do not; need to remind my col]eagues of a remark made by one of the English law lords
many years ago in which he said that the substance of the
law is found in the interstices of its procedure. That fact is

clearly demonstrated in the type of bill we have before us
today.
I share with Senator Choquette and others their general
concern over the use of omnibus bils. I can understand
the administrative expediency such bis afford, but at the
sarne time they do put any sort of legisiative body at a
very serious disadvantage.
At the outset of rny remarks I said that I wanted to deal
briefly with this bill. I think I can do so because of the f act
that in introducing it on second reading Senator Laird
outlined the more salient features involved. Moreover, he
did so rnost ably and cornprehensively. To reiterate those
provisions he has deait with, therefore, would serve littie
purpose. However, I should like to place the bull in a
broader framework as I see it.
Honourable senators will recail that our Criminal Code
was a codification of English common law-criminal law.
When the Code was formulated it very much reflected a
social order of the mid-l9th century in the United Kingdom. I arn sure we ail recognize that our world today is as
far different frorn that world as that world was different
frorn the age of Charlemagne in Europe.
We in fact codified an inheritance of English common
law, and in so doing we stamped upon it a rigidity of form,
the lack of which is the chief advantage in the common
law system and probably its highest commendation. In
codifying we deliberately chose exactitude over adaptability and elasticity. As a result, we have a criminal law
system that of necessity chronically lags behind the evolution of our contemporary social problems, our contemporary philosophical thinking, and our contemporary mores.
This lag is necessitated by the fact that reform. or amendment depends on legisiative action, and legisiative action
only cornes as pressures build up forcing its ernanation.
Therefore, I congratulate this government, and the previous government, on settîng out in 1968 on a very broad
program of reform in our criminal law. In fact, I think the
program. first appeared in the House of Commons at a
tirne when the present Prime Minister was Minister of
Justice. It brings to mind the words of W. S. Gilbert:

My object ail sublime

I shall achieve in timeTo let the punishment to fit the crime.
As in with the Mikado, the object is being achieved "in
tinell.
In the course of this program we have seen the Criminal
Law Arnendment Act, 1968-69-a tremendous opus in the
field of criminal law-the Bail Reform Act, and amendments to the Canada Evidence Act. We now have this bill.
Aiso in this program of reform is one bill about which I
had certain reservations and upon which I shall desist
from comment. I refer to the hate literature enactment
about which this chamber has heard my views on not; a
few occasions. With that single reservation I think I can
say that by and large this package of criminal law reform
has been one of the most necessary legîslative programs
that could possibly have been undertaken at this time in
our history.
Coming specifically to this bill as part of that program I
wish to say at once that I can assure ail senators they wil
find nothing in it of a doctrinaire nature, or carrying any

SENATE DEBATES
of the undercurrents of a doctrinaire philosophy. I make
that assurance because, having seen such phenomena in
other legislation recently, some of us have started looking
for that symptom in legislation as a matter of course. But
this bill is straightforward. Perhaps I should say it is a
lawyer's bill, as the erudite discussion which preceded my
remarks points up.
The bill deals with the legal problems of lawyers, the
problems of those accused-both of the innocent accused
and otherwise-and the problems of prosecutors. It does
these things in a realistic fashion.
In the light of those remarks I commend the bill to you.
I further commend it to you because, although it is not
punitive legislation, it does not neglect the concern for the
social law and order which is so necessary for the preservation of our society. To my way of thinking, the bill
strikes a very good balance between these two competing
forces.
As senators we are quite aware of the push towards law
and order in our society and also, on the other hand, of
the humane consideration for those who become
enmeshed in the law, both innocent and transgressor
alike. This bill strikes a good balance between those two
philosophical poles.
This afternoon we have heard two very important
aspects mentioned. We have heard an excellent speech on
the question of contempt before the court, and we have
heard of the necessity for the hijacking provisions, which
I think is self-evident. There would be no debate about
that. How adequate or inadequate the provisions may be
is the only issue we would encounter.
The right of appeal from a conviction for contempt
before the court is a most important matter to consider,
and one which I think would take up much of our time in
committee. The logic of no appeal from conviction was
almost overpowering as I listened to Senator Flynn and
Senator Connolly. Before we pass that amendment, however, we would want to make sure that we have the
correct interpretation of the views of the various bar
associations across Canada, and we should seek whatever
other expert opinion might be available to us.
* (1550)

Other matters in this bill which have been touched on
only lightly are important too, and I do not think we
should underestimate them and their consequences. Here
I have particularly in mind the procedural changes for
appeals, and sentencing and discharging, some of which
concepts are quite novel in the Code.
Finally, I should say that I find in this bill something
which tickles my fancy as much as I am sure it tickles
yours, and here I refer to the effects of the status of
women movement, and the provision which would draw
women into the net as well as men in connection with the
offence of soliciting for the purposes of prostitution. By
affinity it reminds me of a long time ago when I was told,
as I am sure many other lawyers have been told, that I
was a member of the second oldest profession in the
world, and that my profession had much in common with
the oldest. It was pointed out that any distinction between
the two was of a semantic nature, inasrnuch as one served

its clients by laying for a fee while the other served its
clients by lying for a fee.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: And you are sometimes called
solicitors.
Hon. Mr. Lang: With those remarks I commend this bill
most favourably for second reading.
Hon. Hartland de M. Molson: Honourable senators, in
making some brief remarks to this bill I would say that I
take the full meaning of Senator Lang's remarks when he
says that this is a lawyer's bill. I appreciate that. I have
never claimed, and I do not claim now, to be knowledgeable in the law. However, there is one aspect which has
been touched on only very lightly-I think it was mentioned by the sponsor, Senator Laird, and again by Senator Choquette-with which I feel I must record my
disagreement.
While this debate was proceeding I could not help but
think back about six or seven years to when I was sitting
in the lobby with a very distinguished senator who was
called to this place at about the same time as I was, in
1955. Somehow we got to discussing the subject of capital
punishment, the abolition of which was then being considered. I remember well saying to him that while I understood the reasoning put forward by the abolitionists there
was one particular aspect of the crime of murder which I
felt could not effectively be dealt with other than by
imposing capital punishment, and that was where in the
course of a murder there was an element of extreme,
horrible brutality. At that time I referred to a crime about
which we had been reading in the newspapers not long
before. An 80-year old woman had had her farmhouse
broken into by some young thugs who had proceeded to
torture this little-and she was little-old lady for some
hours until they killed her, in the course of extracting $75
or some such sum from her. To me that type of crime does
not fit the general pattern where compassion and the
trend to the more humane approach to life really fits.
The law was subsequently amended so that capital punishment was imposed only in cases where peace officers
or prison guards were murdered. I might say in passing
that it has been an absolute mystery to me how in their
good judgment the members of our last three governments, including my worthy friend, Senator Flynn, who
mentioned this matter a moment ago-after all the time
and study spent and the referenda that were held on the
question of capital punishment, and the decision having
been reached that that category of crime should be punished by death-have seen fit to take it upon themselves to
decide the law should not apply. I find this difficult to
understand because I think the message came through
terribly clearly when the opinion of the people was sought
and when Parliament acted with this resultant decision.
However, that is in passing, and not really apropos of this
bill.
What I am concerned about, so far as this bill is concerned, is that corporal punishment is being eliminated. I
am quite well aware that we have passed from the dark
ages-we have passed from hanging, drawing and quartering, from hanging for sheep stealing, and from debtors'
prisons-and are supposed to be living in an enlightened
age. But I sometimes wonder how enlightened we are
when I read of some of the violent acts occurring daily on

our streets; when I read that people fear to go on the
streets at night. Is this progress? I do not know. Is this
what the compassionate trend has done for us? I am
aware that it is a situation which exists in the world at
large.
We have demonstrated against violence in Vietnam, and
other violence of that type. Yet in many cities all across
this continent, and indeed throughout a great part of the
world, it is now dangerous for people to go out at night.
We have violence here at home. We should be able to cope
with it and we have the facilities for doing so, but I do not
think we are in fact doing so.
I wonder how many members of this chamber were
thrashed when they were young. I am not, of course,
referring to the lady members of this chamber. I do not
mean just a slapping of the hand; I mean a good whomping on the backside. I should think probably quite a high
proportion of the members of this house have had that
experience. I know I have, and I remember it very well. I
certainly remember it far better than the times I was kept
in, had privileges reduced, forced to write a thousand
lines, and suffered other punishments of that type. I
should like to ask those members of this house who
remember being beaten: can you look back and say it has
embittered you, or made you feel hostile to society? If so,
it is not apparent to me, but perhaps I cannot judge. I
really do not think it ever hurt anybody unduly to suffer
some physical punishment.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It didn't really hurt the feelings.
Hon. Mr. Molson: No, I don't think it hurt the feelings
you are thinking about.
Many of us in the course of our lives have run into the
type of person who can best be described as a bully-not
necessarily a tough person but a bully, a person who, if he
has a weapon or the advantage of being with two or three
other people, will use violence, brutality and cruelty. They
are very difficult people with whom to deal. It is said that
it does no good at all to impose any form of corporal
punishment. I either heard or read not long ago that by
inflicting corporal punishment on this type of individual
you only engender more hatred for society. When I think
of those young men who tortured and killed an 80-year old
woman, I wonder how much more hatred they could have.
I do not believe that is the result. Fortunately, this type of
person is an exception, but I feel that the only lesson the
bully understands, and the one which frightens him, is a
good old-fashioned beating.
a (1600)

We have all known cases where people have not been
influenced by correctional efforts-efforts to straighten
them out and put them on the right path. There comes a
time when there is only one lesson which seems to get
across. I do not mean brutality, but a good old-fashioned
beating. They will remember their beating, as I remember
mine. I feel this is the best weapon we can use against this
sort of person who is becoming more common every day.
Motorcycle gangs who use chains are not gentle people. It
is all very well to slap them on the wrist and send them to
prison for three months because they have caused a disturbance. However, they understand one thing-what they
like to give out they do not like to receive.

As far as this portion of the bill is concerned, I must
oppose it.
Hon. Ernest C. Manning: Honourable senators, I do not
wish to prolong this debate or detract by repetition from
the constructive arguments which have been advanced.
However, there are a couple of clauses in the bill on which
I should like to comment briefly in the hope that they will
receive further consideration by those honourable senators who are members of the committee that will examine
the bill in detail.
One is the provision relating to offences involving motor
vehicles. In Canada, a person can be charged under
municipal traffic by-laws, under provincial statutes, or
under the provisions in the Criminal Code. Admittedly,
this is not one of the major parts of the bill. However, it
does affect many people because many people are
involved in motor vehicle offences. Surely it is desirable
that there be some uniformity and co-ordination between
the various levels of government. Perhaps the committee
could determine whether any effort has been made by
federal, provincial and municipal authorities to arrive at
uniformity and co-ordination of the provisions of statutes
relating to traffic offences.
I would also like to comment on the clauses relating to
hijacking. I have had an opportunity in the last few years
to be associated with a commercial airline and I am aware
of the concern that management of airline companies
have because of the increasing frequency of this offence. I
have talked to pilots and aircrews, as well as to passengers who have had the misfortune of being involved in a
hijacking. It is a shattering experience. I can well understand the feeling of the Pilots' Association. Captains who
are responsible for perhaps 150 lives and whose natural
inclination is to thwart a hijacking if possible, on the other
hand are fearful lest an error of judgment should result in
the death of a hundred or more people. I fully support the
conclusions of the Pilots' Association that this offence is
one in which the death penalty should properly be
applied.
It may be that in today's society this would not be
acceptable, but I hope the committee will consider the
imposition of the death penalty at least in cases where
actual death or serious injury results to the crew or passengers. If we went that far it would meet the point raised
last evening that perhaps the death penalty for hijacking
itself would cause a hijacker to be even more reckless
than he otherwise might be. There could be a distinction
drawn between a person who hijacks an airplane for a
free trip to Cuba and a person who, in the process of
hijacking, causes death to a crew member or a passenger.
I feel the latter case should call for the death penalty. This
would be a significant deterrent. I would like to see the
committee recommend such a provision.
Another point which has been brought to my attention
is that the news media describe in detail the steps taken
by a hijacker and point out where he went wrong, and
why he did not succeed. When you are dealing with people
who are mentally unbalanced in the first place, and the
news media indicate that a hijacker would have succeeded if he had done this instead of that, such people may
decide they can succeed because they will not make the
same mistake. Perhaps there should be a statutory provi-

SENATE DEBATES
sion to restrain the publication of the details of hijacking
procedures. It certainly serves no public interest to have
all these details published, and it could in some cases
invite repetition of the offence by others who are so
inclined.
a (1610)

Honourable senators, for a moment or two more I
would like to comment in a broader sense on a matter that
is relevant to amendments to the criminal law, which have
been rather numerous in recent years. In some respects
this touches on the points referred to a few moments ago
by Senator Molson. In criminal law amendments in recent
years two trends have become evident. These trends,
while understandable, can have a very serious long-range
adverse effect on society as a whole unless kept within
proper dimensions. They both involve significant shifts in
emphasis, which are said to be reflections of changes in
public attitudes and thinking.
First, there has been a significant shift from emphasis
on the personal responsibility of those who commit criminal acts to the extenuating circumstances that may be
found to excuse or at least explain those criminal acts.
We are all well aware today that in almost every criminal case, during the trial and in the newspaper comments,
the focus of attention centres on the extenuating circumstances: What did society do wrong that made this man
commit this act; did he have some mental or physical
disability; were his genes mixed up; is there some situation on which we can put our finger that explains away
the criminal act which the man committed? This sometimes is carried to such extremes that the wrong done by
the man and the suffering, hardship or even death inflicted by him on an innocent person is relegated to a secondary position. Our attention becomes focused on a search
to discover some extenuating circumstances to explain
away the criminal act committed.
I am not suggesting for a moment that an enlightened
society should not give every recognition to extenuating
circumstances. My submission is that if we put the entire
emphasis on that aspect, and move completely away from
the concept that an individual does have a personal
responsibility for his criminal acts, we are on a road
which ultimately will exact a fearful price from society. In
much of the widespread violence which is rampant today,
we see evidence of this departure from personal responsibility by placing the blame on society, the offender's parents, his home life, education, or any one of a hundred
factors which are dragged out as explanations of the
offence committed.
The second current trend in criminal law amendment
stems, perhaps, from the first. We are seeing a shift of
emphasis from the penalty aspect of wrongdoing to the
aspect of rehabilitation of those who have done wrong.
Here again an enlightened society must recognize the role
and importance of rehabilitation. I hope my remarks will
not be misinterpreted as suggesting that we should not be
deeply concerned with rehabilitation, and should not do
everything within reason to see that criminals are
rehabilitated. I say we should do all of those things, but
we should not in the process get away from the fundamental concept that criminal actions should carry with
them a penalty. I think this is the point Senator Molson
[Hon. Mr. Manning.]

SMay 31 1972
May

31

1972

was making a few moments ago respecting the abolition
of corporal punishment.
More and more the position is taken that the criminal is
not a person who should be punished, but rather the
whole focus of public attention and society's responsibility should be directed to doing what needs to be done to
rehabilitate him. Criminal acts are becoming primarily a
passport to a sophisticated process of care and rehabilitation at public expense. There are hundreds of cases today
in which men receive better care and more extensive
services in rehabilitation because they have been found
guilty of criminal acts than are provided for those who
endeavour to be law-abiding citizens. Once again, I am not
speaking against rehabilitation. I am all for it, but I say
that if in our criminal law we are going to eliminate the
penalty aspect of criminal offences, we are setting our
feet on a path which will lead to even more serious difficulties in the days ahead.
I always remind myself that the most realistic canon of
law, including criminal law, that humanity ever had was
not formulated in parliaments or legislatures. It was given
to Moses on Mount Sinai a long, long time ago. It was
realistic law and it involved penalties. It was precise and
specific. It is a significant fact that the farther society has
moved away from those fundamental premises of true
justice embodied in the Ten Commandments the greater
have become our social problems.
I mention these points, honourable senators, because I
am sure a great many Canadians are deeply concerned
with the trends evident in amendments to criminal law in
Canada in recent years, as we have moved farther and
farther away from an individual's responsibility for his
criminal acts, and from the penalty aspects for doing that
which is wrong.
Hon. Keith Laird: Honourable SenatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I must remind honourable senators that if the honourable Senator Laird speaks now his
speech will have the effect of closing the debate on second
reading.
Hon. Mr. Laird: Honourable senators, the addresses
given today have made a real contribution to the debate.
Perhaps I will be forgiven for reminding the house that I
did indicate in my speech last night that there were matters which would provoke discussion along these lines.
a (1620)

I detected a common theme throughout all the speeches
made this afternoon, namely, that the matter has been
pursued in debate as far as possible, and that the proper
place to go into the matter in detail, and to consider the
merits of the various changes, is the committee. Therefore, I do not propose to say anything further. I simply
recommend that the bill be now read a second time.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?

Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would like the chairman of the committee, Senator Prowse, to tell us if he has a list of witnesses he intends to cail. I might suggest that the Quebec
Bar and the Canadian Bar Association be asked to send
representatives. I do flot know if it is possible to have
representatives of the judiciary appear, but I think it
would be a good idea in view of the contempt of court
problem.
Hon. Mr. Prowne: Honourable senators, tentative
arrangements have been made, and they will be confirmed immediately. As soon as I can get to the telephone
I will arrange for Mr. Christie, Assistant Deputy Attorney
General, to appear before the committee at 9.30 tomorrow
morning mn Roomn 356-S. At that time I think it will be for
the committee to decide what other witnesses should be
called. I arn quite sure that there is sufficient technical
material available for discussion which will recuire Mr.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: My question is: Will the chairman invite
the Canadian Bar Association, the Quebec Bar, and the
association of members of the Canadian judiciary, if there
is such an association. I think there is, at least at the level
of the provincial judges in Quebec.
May I clarify the record by saying that in Quebec under
the Code of Civil Procedure there is an appeal from the
decision and the sentence in ail cases of contempt of court
in the Superior Court, but in the lower courts there is an
appeal only with leave of the Appeal Court.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Notice of Motion for Adjournment:
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, with leave of
the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(g), I move that
when the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned
until Tuesday, June 13, 1972, at eight o'clock in the
evening.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Explain.
The Hon. the Speaker: This is a debatable motion, of
course.

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I cannot see
that we in this chamber would have before us any bills
until at the earliest some time next Thursday, and perhaps not even then. This does not mean that we do not
have things to do. I understand that the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has further work which it wishes to do on the bill that we were
discussing yesterday. The committee could resume its sessions the following week if this motion is passed.
Perhaps this would be a convenient time to indicate the
legislation that is on the government's books, not all of
which, I am sure, will be dealt with before adjournment,
whenever that takes place. Senator Molson yesterday
asked for an indication. I would think that we could
expect the Wheat Board Bill. We might have the Foreign
Takeovers Review Bill for the following week, but I doubt
that very much because the second reading debate has
only just commenced in the other place. We might well
have the Wheat Board Bill, and we could have the CNR
Financing Bill. We might also have the Exhibitions Assistance bill, and it is conceivable that we could have the
Family Income Security Plan bill. Other bills that are of
some importance on the government's agenda are: The
amendments to the Canada Labour Code, the National
Housing Bill, the Residential Mortgage Financing bill, the
wiretapping bill, and the Adult Occupational Training
Bill. Some of these are now in committee and may be
reported shortly.
• (1410)

I apologize for not being able to speak with greater
precision, but no one can; certainly no one in this house
can because we are not in control of the proceedings in
the other place. I would hope upon resuming the following
week we would be able to continue with the constitutional
committee bill, the Wheat Board Bill, which is quite
important, and whatever other bills might come to us at
the end of the week.
Hon. Hartland de M. Molson: Honourable senators, I am
grateful to the Leader of the Government for trying to let
us in on the mysteries of the parliamentary program as he
sees it. I realize that there is very little for us to deal with
in this chamber, but I should like to say that as far as I am
aware there are four standing committees that would like
to hold meetings. I believe the Legal and Constitutional
Affairs Committee has more work to do; Senator Hayden
told me this morning that he proposes to call a meeting of
the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee next week;
the Rules Committee, as I said yesterday, has a backlog of
business suggested to it by members of this chamber, and
I understand from my honourable friend, the Chairman
of the Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts Conmittee (Hon. Mr. Smith), that his committee has to hold a
meeting at some stage.
If we are going to adjourn until June 13, and if the
Prime Minister is to be believed when he says we are
going to adjourn at the end of June, perhaps we will be
fairly busy in this chamber towards the end of June. I

June 1, 1972

DEBATES
_.__SENATE

would like to see our committee work, which I have
always considered at least as important as the work in the
chamber, continued and cleaned up. I should think that
next week would be an admirable period for our committees to sit, at least those I have mentioned, to deal with
their problems and get through the rather time-consuming function of examining relevant matters.
To that extent I should like to suggest to the Leader of
the Government that when we adjourn today we adjourn
to Tuesday night next and then use Wednesday and
Thursday for committee work.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I would be very interested to hear what
honourable senators have to say in that respect. Such
proposals previously put forward have not been readily
accepted. It has not been the experience that that is the
wish of honourable senators. However, the Senate itself
decides these matters.
I should say that in the list I recited I failed to mention
that after the budget debate in the other house, which is
not likely to be until the following week, we might have
the Customs Tariff bill and the Excise Tax bill, but I do
not expect we will receive the budget bills for some time,
perhaps not before the end of June.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I do not
want to engage in a discussion with regard to Senator
Molson's suggestion because I am really not qualified to
talk about that. However, there are two bills that were
mentioned in the list given to us by the Leader of the
Government which I feel are of considerable significance
and of great interest to this chamber. One bill deals with
foreign takeovers and the other with the Labour Code. I
know it is difficult for the Leader of the Government in
the Senate to have much influence on the program of
work in the other place, but perhaps it would strengthen
his hand if it were made known by him to some of his
colleagues who have that kind of influence in the other
place that the Senate would be glad to have these two bills
in preference to most of the others that were mentioned in
his list, because they are likely to take more time here.
It is par for the course that just at the last minute before
a recess a second chamber should have a great deal of
work thrown at it, and sometimes important work, when
real consideration cannot be given to it. The only way to
overcome this is to make those who control the progress
of legislation in the other place understand the reasonable
views of the Senate. We cannot blame the Leader of the
Government in the Senate if our legislative program does
not always work out. Frankly, after a good many years I
have come to the conclusion that it seldom does. However,
the sooner we get bills of this kind the better it is for this
chamber, and indeed for the legislation itself.
Hon. J. Harper Prowue: Honourable senators, the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Affairs would have been able to report today on Bill C-2,
the Criminal Law Amendment Act, except for the fact
that it was decided the committee would hear representations from people who may wish to appear before us. One
of the groups suggested has already been contacted and
indicated that it does not want to appear. The second
group can be heard the following week just as well as next
week. To bring the bouse back merely for that purpose
would, to use a simple term, be a little stupid.
25312-29,

451

The committee has arranged hearings for the following
week, and so it would seem unnecessary to bring the
committee back next week for perhaps 15 or 20 minutes of
work. To call the house back merely so that honourable
senators can deal with committee work, when there is not
much of it to be done, is a waste of everyone's time.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I am not
opposing the motion moved by the Leader of the Government, but I suggest that what Senator Molson bas said has
great value too. We in the Senate should try to adopt rules
pertaining to the responsibility we have as a legislative
body which is not a mere tool of the government in office.
If we could accomplish that, situations such as the one
with which we are faced today would not occur.
Honourable senators will remember that we were to
come back on Tuesday, May 16. Then we received a telegram calling us back on May 15 just in case the Old Age
Security bill were passed by the other place. We arrived
on the Monday evening; we waited as patiently as we
could; and then we waited Tuesday and Wednesday and
Thursday until 4.45. Then we were forced to rush through
two bills in less than one day.

I said at the time that we looked stupid, and I repeat
that we looked stupid. We should devise some rules
whereby we would state clearly that we are going to
tackle our responsibility and our work in a certain way. I
do not mean rigid rules, but I mean rules that are sensible,
that are compatible with the proper carrying out of our
own responsibilities. Coming here for nothing-nobody
wants that.
On the other hand, by no means should we shirk the
responsibility we have in the area of committee work.
Sometimes committee work is more important, as was
mentioned by Senator Molson, than the work in the
Senate chamber itself. I am not trying to say who is right
today as between Senator Molson and Senator Martin, but
I am suggesting that we have adopted, over the last few
years, a hit-or-miss approach that we should try to get
away from.
I am not the Leader of the Government and I do not
think that I will ever be, though I am quite sure there will
be a change of government soon because that is the wish
of the great majority of Canadians, but still I feel entitled
to make this suggestion. The work of the Senate should be
so organized that senators would inow where they stand,
so that tney can arrange to look after otier responsibilities and at the same time discharge their duty in this
house.
You cannot expect senators not to object to the type of
thing that happened recently. We were called back on a
Monday when everyone had thought that we would come
back only on Tuesday. Suddenly we received a telegram
on the weekend to be here on Monday evening. Those who
had already made arrangements to be elsewhere on that
day could not be here. I give that as an illustration of the
ridiculous situations we are forced into at times. We
should try to find some guiding principles for our sitting
and the carrying out of our responsibility, in an organized
and businesslike fashion, principles that are not dependent on the whims and pleasure of the government.

SENATE DEBATES
I have told the Leader of the Government, and I am
telling him again today, that he should worry less about
what the government wishes, and more about what the
Senate should do and would like to do.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, the problem
which has been raised by Senator Molson and others
indicates that it is only part of a much larger question
which has been discussed here before. We find ourselves
now in what surely must be the absurd position of being
told that there are at least 12 bills which it will be desirable in the public interest to see passed before Parliament
rises-under whatever type of ending of our sittings that
might be. We are told that there are 12 bills that it is
desirable in the public interest to put through, possibly
between now and the end of the month. Yet in the first
week of the month we have none of those bills here. We
can anticipate a week with no legislative business before
us, another week of normal business, a week of slightly
abnormal business, and then another of those horrendous
weeks with all kinds of impossible demands being made
on the Senate.
I suggest that the time has come when all senators wish
to see this problem tackled. It is obviously a problem of
the timetable of legislation. It is equally obvious that the
real problem is that the timetable that initiates in the
other place takes no account whatsoever of the fact that
there are two Houses of Parliament. Obviously, if account
had been taken of that, some of these bills would be here
now. I am not suggesting that the timetable is entirely in
the hands of the government, but if it had been planned so
that it took into account the necessity of this house being
given adequate time to consider bills, surely some of these
bills would be before us now.
If one looks at them, it is obvious that whatever delay
there may have been in initiating these bills, or in ordering their way through the process in the other house, there
is still little excuse for the creation of the situation before
us now.
Let us take the CNR financing bill. The CN people will
be coming before us to approve expenditures made more
than 18 months ago. Surely that bill could have been
brought betore us long ago. The foreign takeovers bill is
another one. If there has been any major issue before the

Canadian public that has been the subject of intolerable
and inexplicable delay, it is that particular bill.
I suggest again that we do something about this,
because as I have said before this is a problem that can be
solved. It will be solved if we in this place show the will to
solve it. It will not be solved if we permit this situation to
develop without organized, institutionalized, serious protest to those who can change it.
Hon. Mr. Smith: Honourable senators, I do not intend to

engage in any controversial debate as to whose responsibility this situation is. On certain occasions, perhaps once
or twice a year, we find ourselves in a rather embarrassing position with regard to the disposition of important
government legislation. I think I should point out that
what we are now talking about, however, is whether we
should adjourn until June 6 or whether we should, in the
terms of the motion that I made, adjourn until June 13.
Surely the choice between those alternatives depends on
whether we would be better served by coming back on
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

June 1, 1972

June 13, as I suggested, or on June 6, as Senator Molson
suggested, and, regardless of whether any legislation has
been prepared for us, spend whatever time we care to
spend on doing committee work.

Before touching on what I wanted to say with direct
reference
response
Owing to
chamber

to my motion, I feel I should make some
to something Senator Grosart touched on.
the fact that I have not been a member of this
or the other one for as long as many other

senators present, at least on our side of the house, I
hesitate to express a personal opinion; nevertheless, I
dare to do so. Let me say now what I said to someone over
the luncheon table just today, that pretty soon in one of

our parliaments, perhaps the next one or the one after, we
in this country will finally, willingly and by agreement on
all sides and with the approval of the Canadian people.
come around to a businesslike way of running Parlia
ment and will adopt some relative form of what the British have been doing for a good many years with their

so-called "guillotine" and all it involves. I cannot see any
hope for anv kind of planning unless we are willing to do
our work in a businesslike fashion. Just the other day I
read in a Halifax newspaper about one of the members of
the Government of Nova Scotia who at great sacrifice had
left his private business to become a member of the
administration of that province. He stood it for about a
year and then he just could not stand it any longer. He
could not stand the slowness, the indecision and the delay
of the parliamentary system in this country. I think there
will be a revolution in thinking before many more parliamentary sessions have gone by, and I say that with
strength but without any passion whatsoever.
* (1430)

I had some notice from Senator Molson concerning the
subject being raised at this time and about spending next
week on committee work if we had nothing to come back
to in the chamber. Let me say with reference to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce that it is my understanding the budget bills have
not yet been tabled. So how can we make a preliminary
study, as we did with the tax reform bill, if we do not have
any idea as to what these bills will contain? I also understand from a conversation held between the chairman and
a member of the Senate today that he is not at all sure
it is a good thing to refer such matters to that committee
until we have some concrete form or guide.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Are you sure your leader would not be
happy to have us approve the bills even before they were
tabled?
Hon. Mr. Smith: My leader is always happy even in the

face of adversity.
Coming now to the Standing Committee on Internal
Economy, Budgets and Administration, as honourable
senators are aware, the Cleric has tabled the Senate

accounts and they have been referred by the motion I
made yesterday to the said committee. The practice of
that committee, as authorized pursuant to a motion made

by Senator Benidickson some time ago, is to have these
accounts copied-and they are now in the process of being
copied-and then have them referred for detailed study to
a subcommittee. Then, when they have been studied, it
will be appropriate to have a meeting of the full commit-

June 1, 1972
June 1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

tee at which time there will be several questions to be
considered, questions which cannot in any way be regarded as being of an emergency nature.
Let me point out that if there are real reasons, important reasons for bringing committees back, the chairmen
of those committees can do so. At the request of the
Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal
and Constitutional Affairs, I will be moving a motion later
today to give the committee power to sit during adjournments of the Senate. If permission is granted he will have
power to hold sittings of the committee next week and at
all other times when the Senate is not sitting.
The Rules Committee of the Senate is a very important
one, and I know from talking to the chairman that a
number of matters have been raised from time to time,
some of them two years old, which he is anxious to deal
with. I wish here to express my appreciation of his energy
and initiative in dealing with these things. But surely
these matters are not of sufficient importance at this time
to bring people back from coast to coast particularly if
they are not members of that committee.
I should still like to see support for my motion to
adjourn until June 13, with the proviso, which is always
the case, that we are subject to recall. I understand that
we will have before us then eight or nine bills.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, and at the most unexpected times.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I forgot to
give the usual warning that if Senator Smith spoke at this
time, his speech would close the debate. Senator Buckwold and Senator Molson have indicated they would like
to say a few words. At this time, if you agree, I will give
the floor to Senator Buckwold, and then to Senator
Molson.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I was going to ask Senator Grosart
a question on a matter raised by Senator Smith. This
question has been answered and I have nothing further to
say.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, I was going to
rise on a point of privilege because I doubt very much that
my suggestion could really be called "stupid." However, I
find it is not necessary. I bow to Senator Prowse's superior choice of words.
Senator Flynn indicated a moment ago that he did not
know whether I was right or whether Senator Martin was
right. I hope this question never arises. As far as I am
concerned, Senator Martin is Leader of the Government
in this house and his responsibility is to plan its business.
If I wish to rise and tell him I think he is wrong I will do so
much more unequivocally than I might if I were making
suggestions regarding a sitting of the Senate.
However, I feel we have some committee work to do.
Senator Smith has indicated how easily this can be done
but I call attention to the calendar. The suggestion is that
we return on June 13, and the Prime Minister has indicated we will adjourn the end of June.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That does not mean the Senate will
adjourn.
Hon. Mr. Moison: I understand that it does not mean
Parliament will adjourn. We could be here all summer.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I doubt that.

Hon. Mr. Benidickson: We have been before.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, a moment ago
Senator Prowse indicated that we do not wish to call
people back for nothing. This was not in my mind. I think
that most of us, when we commence a session of Parliament, map out our program on the assumption that, as a
general rule, demands will be made upon us in the middle
of the week. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule.
This session has gone on now for three months. Bills S-2
and S-3 are Senate bills, and the Senate has been given no
other legislation. Apparently it has been relegated to
being not only a second house, but a second-rate house.
We have had inquiries and motions week after week.
The Senate has only one other important function
which I feel it has not fully served, and that is in the work
of committees. Senator Smith has indicated his committee
does not need to consider Senate accounts, that they will
go to a subcommittee. However, will a subcommittee find
a date on which to meet?
Recently, we have also heard that there are only two
committee rooms, 256-S and 356-S. Our reading room has
been turned into a lounge, which I think is proper, and the
smoking room at the front is now a cabinet committee
room. There are 30 senators on almost every standing
committee, and there are three more committees proposed. Our committees have found considerable difficulty
in holding meetings-at least those which can be attended
by their best members-because of the conflict that so
often arises.
a (1440)

It seems to me that as everyone was expecting to be
here next week it is not altogether stupid to suggest that
we return to carry out some committee work. If that is not
the view of my colleagues, then I bow to their decision.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Choquette: Why do you not adjourn the
debate?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It might be a good idea having
regard to some of the arguments I have heard.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Apparently all we need is for someone to raise a subject in the chamber, and we can continue
all day. We might continue until June 13 if no one
adjourns the debate.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I do not think the honourable senator is being serious. It is not my intention to debate the
comments of Senator Molson with respect to committee
rooms. In fact, there is very little,,if any, change in the
committee rooms. We have the two rooms we have always
had, rooms 256-S and 356-S. The little room next to the
elevator known as the smoking room was used very little
as such over the period I have spent here, until such time
as some committees began to use it for meetings. We then
received a request irom tne other place that the cabinet
committee, in which the Leader of the Government in the
Senate is involved, be allowed to use that room part time.
Permission was granted, and that room has been more or
less converted to a committee room because of the desire
to redecorate what has been known as the reading room.
There were a number of large tables in the reading
room, which had also been used as a committee room. In

SENATE DEBATES

order to allow redecoration of the physical facilities of
that room it became necessary to discontinue its use as a
committee room for the immediate future. I do not know
what will be the disposition of the room when the redecoration is completed. The decision whether to convert it to
a committee room or make it a smoking or reading room
will be made by the Senate as a whole. My own view is
that it is much better suited to senators as a reading and
smoking room than is the little room. We do have, however, as much committee room as we have ever had.
A proposal has been made to the Department of Public
Works that some new facilities be made available to the
Senate, both for the use of senators and to provide more
committee rooms. It is my hope, therefore that when we
return after the summer recess better facilities will be
available, for both senators and committees. I want it
understood, however, that the changes which are under
way at the moment are only for the convenience of the
Department of Public Works in carrying out redecoration
work in the room at the back of the chamber.
The Hon. the Speaker: It was moved by the honourable
Senator Smith, that when the Senate adjourns today it do
stand adjourned until Tuesday, June 13, 1972, at 8 o'clock
in the evening.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On division.
Motion agreed to, on division.

LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO SIT DURING
ADJOURNMENTS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Donald Smith moved, with leave of the Senate, and
notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(h):
That the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs have power to sit during
adjournments of the Senate.
Motion agreed to.

SOUTHERN SUDAN
REQUEST FOR AID-QUESTION ANSWERED
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I wish to
answer the question asked me on Tuesday last by Senator
Forsey. I told him at that time I would try to give him a
reply yesterday or today. His question had to do with the
Sudan.
The Government of Sudan has brought to the attention
of the Canadian government the recent agreement relating to the situation in Southern Sudan, and bas drawn
attention to the need for a large scale resettlement and
rehabilitation program if the agreement is to be implemented with success. My colleague, the Secretary of State
for External Affairs, Mr. Sharp, has communicated to the
Sudanese foreign minister the Canadian government's
hope that the agreement will effectively lay the basis for
lasting peace and stability in the area. He has stated his
view that any effective relief and rehabilitation program
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

June 1, 1972

would require strong international co-ordinating machinery, preferably within a framework of the United Nations.
Canada's substantial regular contributions to multilateral agencies have traditionally constituted its principal
channel for providing aid in situations such as this one. I
understand that a consignment of Canadian canned fish
valued at more than $300,000 will be going to Southern
Sudan as part of Canada's contribution to the World Food
Program. The Canadian government is prepared to give
sympathetic consideration to requests for assistance from
Canadian voluntary agencies participating in resettlement
efforts in the area.
POVERTY
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, April 27, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Croll, calling
the attention of the Senate to the Report of the Special
Committee of the Senate on Poverty in Canada, tabled in
the Senate on Wednesday, November 10, 1971.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed that the honourable
Senator Thompson speak now instead of the honourable
Senator McDonald?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Andrew Thompson: Honourable senators, I take
great satisfaction in having the opportunity to commend
the Special Senate Committee on Poverty, its members
and its chairman, on this report. They had a tough, grueling challenge on November 26, 1968, when they took on
the assignment "to report on all aspects of poverty in
Canada and to propose appropriate remedial action."
They travelled across the length and breadth of Canada,
from Cox's Cove out to Vancouver, and up to Whitehorse
in the Yukon.
* (1450)

It is quite clear that those honourable senators concerned applied themselves with dedication and compasion. They searched out poverty. They went into dilapidated and broken-down buildings in the city cores, and into
weather-beaten shacks in the bush country.
The speeches made by those honourable senators were
both stirring and moving, reflecting the need for action on
behalf of Canada's poor. It was Yeats who said, "The best
lack all conviction, while the worst are full of compassionate intensity." Certainly, in this case, those senators who
spoke with such conviction and moving compassion are
among the finest in this chamber. They represent both
sides of the house, and were led by that silver-haired
senator who ever since I have been in Canada has been
symbolic of the drive for legislative reform to provide fair
opportunity for all Canadians.
We have had presented astonishing, staggering figures
of Canada's chronic poor. Before the survey, I doubt
whether many of us in this affluent country were fully
aware of the number of poor people who exist across our
wealthy land. We were informed that three and a half
million Canadians are living in poverty, that four-person
family units existed on $4,000 or less a year, that 82,000
two-person families had an income of between $3,000 and

June 1. 1972

SENATE DEBATES

$3,700, that 12,000 families comprising five or more persons had an income of less than $1,000, which included
also transfer payments.
Prior to the survey, many of us had little or no idea of
the number of working poor in Canada, that over 500,000
heads of families within the labour force were receiving
wages that were below the poverty line. The astonishing
thing is that more than half that number were found to be
located in wealthy Ontario.
The survey revealed that of 150,000 mothers who were
raising 330,000 young children, more than one-third consisted of a mother with dependent children who was
receiving an income below the 1967 poverty line.
The plight of the working poor represents the most
severe indictment of our whole approach towards providing equal opportunity for all Canadians. The brief of the
Department of National Health and Welfare presented to
the committee stated:
In general assistance benefits are not available to
the working poor under existing policies.
I have read this report through twice. It is a magnificent
report, and I urge every senator to read it, as well as every
Canadian who feels that something should and can be
done to assist the working poor. I hope it will be circulated all across Canada, that it will be placed in libraries and
labour halls, and that it will become part of university
courses. It exposes many of the myths which so many
Canadians hold concerning the poor, including the myth
that they are idle and lazy.
Let us consider the welfare population figures. In a
speech given by the Minister of National Health and Welfare to the United Textile Workers of America in Toronto
on September 24, 1971, he said:
Breaking down the welfare population, the permanently disabled represent 41 per cent of the total.
Mothers raising families on their own are 26 per cent.
The older age group constitutes 9 per cent of the total.
Those with a temporary disability or illness are 8 per
cent of the total. Those who are employed but are
being supplemented because of insufficient income
represent 3 per cent of the total. Together, these
amount to 87 per cent of the welfare population. Only
13 per cent of the population is made up of the unemployed employables.
The employables on welfare by and large go on
relief because they had a job and lost it, through little
or no fault of their own. They remain on welfare
because there are no jobs available for which they are
trained. They get off welfare as soon as they can find
such a job. It is as simple as that, and statistics bear
this out.
Thus, analyzing the total welfare caseload, we see
that the figures for unemployed people on welfare for
any lengthy period of time was only about 13 per cent
that of the welfare population as a whole at the time
of this survey last year. It is now only marginally
higher. Moreover, over one-half the unemployed category on welfare has been on welfare less than one
year. We should also note that only 12 per cent of this
category had never worked at all full time and this
can be explained by the large numbers of young

people just now coming on to the labour force or
young people who have worked but not long enough
to accumulate unemployment insurance benefits and
having extreme difficulty in finding jobs.
But do the unemployed go on welfare for legitimate
reasons or are they just there from laziness? Let us
look at some more statistics. Fifty-four per cent of the
unemployed on welfare were laid off. Another 11 per
cent were either fired or not hired after a strike.
0 (1500)

Another 13 per cent, mostly women, left work
because of their family situation-due to pregnancy or
because they had to look after their children. Only 11
per cent quit their jobs.
And you certainly can't deny that these welfare
recipients want to get back into the labour force-over
70 per cent of them indicated that they were willing to
move if necessary to get a job.
One of the solutions many of us felt provided an answer
for the poor in Canada was economic growth. We felt that
all Canadians enjoyed the benefit of economic growth.
Well, this report clearly analyzes that theory and shows it
to be a myth. Indeed Galbraith has been pointing out to us
for a number of years that ridding any industrial society
of poverty is not going to be accomplished by stepping up
the growth rate any more than it would be accomplished
"by incantation or ritualistic washing of the feet," as he
put it. Growth is only for those who can take advantage of
it, and clearly the chronic poor are not able to do so.
Because of the thrust of the report towards one particular solution, that of a guaranteed annual income, I think,
in a sense, the press and the people of Canada may have
lost sight of the many other recommendations. The report
looked at every area of poverty and attempted to look at
each solution for the elimination of poverty. Again and
again the report stresses that employment opportunities
must be provided, not only the provision of job opportunities but training to take jobs. There are suggestions set out
in the chapter on employment opportunities to help the
poor move into the stream of employment.
The report deals with many other aspects of poverty.
There are recommendations with respect to the law;
recommendations with respect to housing; suggestions for
the provision of opportunities for people to have a decent
roof over their heads; recommendations with respect to
health care, and so forth. The report analyzes areas where
people suffer the effects of poor health because of the
inability to pay for the means that provide a cure. The
high cost of drugs, for example, and the need to expand
dental care and other medical care to all the people of this
land, are dealt with. The report examines the poor as
consumers, the nagging fear of wages being garnisheed,
and the enormous debts which straddle and beat families
down. The report offers suggestions in connection with
helping people to get back on their feet again when they
get into such financial difficulties.
The report is laced with many other suggestions in
addition to that respecting the guaranteed annual income.
Again and again the report says that there must be supportive measures as well as financial assistance. I think
even in this chamber some honourable senators in speaking on this report might have, in a sense, lost sight of

SENATE DEBATES

many of its recommendations as they stressed the recommendation from the committee for a guaranteed annual
income.
The report has been hard and critical on what many of

us felt have been worthy services provided at every level
of government to assist the poor. It looks at the maze of
voluntary and government services and it comes down
with the indictment that these services have failed, and
states that a new approach and new thinking is needed in
that area. The case that these services have failed is
documented. Indeed, as we read some of the galling
experiences that people applying for welfare have had to
undergo we realize that in Canada we have failed by
subjecting poor people to such investigations, duplication,
and inadequacy of services. The report points out everything from the coldness of offices, the downgrading
approaches taken. the confusion on the part of the recipient of welfare, and his inability to know his rights and to
whom he can appeal in order to achieve those rights.
I remember a number of years ago when I was first a
member of a provincial legislature I lived for a week with
a constituent in my riding, an unemployed Italian immigrant, in a small house where there were three families. I
remember the admiration I had for these people who were
suffering all the abuse and hardship of being unemployed
while striving to subsist in Canada. The father of this
particular family had suffered an injury when a concrete
form had dropped on his foot, but he did not know that
there was such a thing as workmen's compensation, or
anything else. He used to get up early in the morning and
limp as far as ten miles trying to find emplovment in
order to keep the family going, searching far and wide in
order to find the opportunity of doing any type of work.
I remember how one of the wives upstairs worked every
night in a restaurant for 30 cents an hour, and how every
single penny was meticulously watched. They waited for
the drug store sales in which if they bought one item they
got another for a penny. When there was such a sale they
would dash down to get bottles of vitamins for the children. They would stand in line to save that bit of money.
I stood in line with them when they went into officesthe unemployment insurance office and others-and I saw
the apprehension and anguish on their faces at their inability to communicate. I also saw the coldness on the part
of some of the officials, unfortunately, with whom they
dealt. I remember how gratified I was when this sort of
thing was written up bv Pierre Berton in a series of
articles in the Toronto Daily Star.
I realize there are many people across Canada who are
trying in their own way to change some of these conditions, but they have not been changed. We have this indictment that poor people suffer such indignities across our
land-wealthy and affluent land.

There was considerable discussion of the guaranteed
annual income, long before it was brought up in the
Poverty Committee's report, although that report has certainly infused a new interest and a new desire by Canadians to see if this step is not necessary.
I recently read the papers prepared by a number of
economists and others at the Nuffield conference and
[Hon. Mr. Thompson.]

June 1, 1972

seminar. in which they examined the guaranteed annual
income. J. I. Clark of the Department of National Health
and Welfare summarized the negative income tax developments in Israel, the United States, the Isle of Jersey,
Denmark, and Canada. I think the case for a guaranteed
annual income has been made very clearly in this Senate
report.
As we consider the development of technology across
our land we do not know the extent to which it will take
place, but I am sure that more and more there will be
increasing difficulty in finding employment for all our
people. Indeed, it may not be possible for all our people to
follow the usual pattern of work. Such economists as
Robert Theobald are suggesting that perhaps we do not
need to have the work ethic in the usual pattern, with the
working people having to go to a factory or to do some
kind of mundane, monotonous work, but rather that in
our western societies we are coming to the point where an
income will be provided, and working people will have the
opportunity and freedom to develop their creativity.
Obviously the guaranteed annual income concentrates
on need. Mr. Clark said that under the guaranteed annual
income approach a blind impoverished poet gets an
income, not because he is a poet or blind, but because he
is poor. It means less inquiry, less investigation. Surely all
Canadians want to eliminate the investigative or means
test approach. We have all heard examples of the galling
experience that those less fortunate than ourselves have
had to face through the imposition of a means test. More
and more this government has been working towards
methods by which people will not be obliged to undergo a
means test in order that their needs can be provided for.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It was eliminated in the university

system in 1950.
Hon. Mr. Thompson: Looking at the approach of the
federal government, my own feeling is that we have been
developing a systematic pattern of guaranteed income.
For example, we provide it to people who are receiving
old age assistance. That assistance is really a form of
guaranteed annual income. From reading the speeches of
the present Minister of National Health and Welfare, I
believe his approach is developing to the stage where
inevitably we will move towards a guaranteed annual
income for all Canadians.
When critics talk about this some bring forward all
kinds of concerns. Will Durant is cited for his examination
of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. He pointed
to the fact that free wheat and wine were given to the
citizens of Rome, and suggested that this dole weakened
the poor in the Roman Empire, that luxury weakened the
rich. Some critics suggest that with a guaranteed annual
income the same fate will befall Canada, or any other
country which moves towards it.
We have had an opportunity to see the guaranteed
annual income in operation in the United States. They
have been experimenting with a guaranteed annual
income in Seattle. At page 181 of the report the committee
quotes from the progress report of May, 1971, as follows:
-there was no significant differential in the number
of hours worked per family among the various income
maintenance programs . .. this lack of a significant

June 1, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

differential does indicate that the various combinations of tax rates and guarantee levels have not yet
affected the number of hours a family worksIn other words, in the experiments taking place in the
United States people receiving a guaranteed annual
income were not deterred from getting out and maintaining the same number of hours work as those who were
having to work in order to get an income.
It is interesting to note that the guaranteed annual
income concept has come a long way since Poverty in
Canada was published last November. I should like to
give three further examples. I have a clipping from the
Toronto Daily Star of May 17, which reads:
Manitoba to be First with Guaranteed Wage. Winnipeg-Canada's first experiments with a guaranteed
annual income scheme will take place in Manitoba, in
two districts involving a total of about 5,000 people.
The provincial minister of health, Rene Toupin, told
the Manitoba legislature yesterday that an agreement
had been reached with Ottawa paying 75 per cent of
the costs over a two-year period.
Toupin said details of the scheme are still being
worked out. Canada's first guaranteed income plan
was supposed to get off the ground July 1. Toupin
now hopes for a start in the fall.
One of the major delays has been in agreeing on
costs. Since the plan calls for the substitution of all
welfare and social assistance plans by income supplements, estimates of costs have varied conisiderably.
Ottawa has pledged $1.5 million and Manitoba will
contribute $500,000.
One experiment will take place in an urban centre,
the other in a rural area. Specific boundaries have not
yet been revealed.
Toupin said the aims are simple. The government
hopes to eliminate dozens of agencies now serving
specific needs of low-income and welfare groups by
simply adding to their annual income and lettng them
manage for themselves.

e

(1520)

One suggestion is that any family qualifying for the
guaranteed income be allowed to keep 50 per cent of
anything it earns above the minimum. Unemployment
insurance or workman's compensation payments
would be counted as part of the income for this
purpose.
The scheme is also designed to reverse the present
situation, where an average family on welfare lives
better than one earning the province's minimum
wage, which amounts to $3,232 per year.
Toupin said there will be no commitment to continue the program after the two-year trial period.
Toupin added that the Manitoba experiment could
influence the decisions of Saskatchewan, Ontario,
Quebec and New Brunswick, whose governments
have indicated an interest in implementing a guaranteed annual income.
Honourable senators, another example I should like to
give concerns the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
There, Senator Backman introduced a bill in the legisla25312-30

ture to replace the present welfare system with an adequate standard of living program. I quote from Senator
Backman's foreword, as follows:
It is the inherent right of every individual to be granted the opportunity for the fulfillment of a meaningful
life in accordance with his capacity.
In his introduction to the bill, Senator Backman said:
Over the past several years innumerable studies, on
the state and national level, have analyzed the condition of the disadvantaged in our society. Few people
will argue with the findings of these studies which
describe the conditions of deprivation and the hopelessness that pervades the sector of our society called
the poor. Many have observed that the poor have
special housing problems, special family problems,
special education problems, ad infinitum; and our
society has addressed those special problems
individually with special solutions. This approach,
however, has done more to perpetuate these problems
than it has to cure them. Our failing can be summed
up very simply, "We have avoided the central problem
that lies at the root of all the problems of the poor-an
inadequate income."
The following proposals are a radical departure
from our traditional solutions to the problems of the
poor. These proposals are an attempt to escape the
quagmire of piecemeal solutions to poverty which
characterizes our present approach to the problems of
the poor.
Honourable senators, particularly those on the committee, will be interested to hear that Senator Backman's bill
proposed $5,000 for a family of four, whereas the suggestion of our committee set the poverty line at that figure
but set the income guarantee level at 70 per cent, namely
$3,500, in terms of 1969 figures.
As a final example I cite the action the United Kingdom
has taken toward a guaranteed annual income. Let me
auote from Michael Stern's article in the New York Times
of March 26 last:
For two hours and 10 minutes the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Anthony Barber, stood before the packed
and expectant House of Commons last Tuesday, reading from sheafs of paper he drew out of a battered
dispatch box. Toward the close of his speech he drew
gasps of surprise, cheers and shouts of "Hear! Hear!"
It was the. government's annual budget presentation, designed this year as a cure for Britain's lagging
economy and growing unemployment, and what it
outlined was a program of massive tax cuts and a
sweeping blueprint for economic change.
Mr. Barber proposes a negative income tax as a
substitute for the many kinds of welfare payments
now being paid. This would be joined to the withholding tax system, making it possible for a Government
computer to spew out income to the poor and tax bills
to the rest of the people at a saving of 15,000 civil
servants.
Budgets are political as well as economic documents, and this one is no exception. Roy Jenkins,
Chancellor of the Exchequer in Labor's shadow cabinet, criticized the Government for giving so much to

SENATE DEBATES

taxpayers, particularly high-income taxpayers, and
nothing more for such social purposes as school and
hospital construction.
The point is valid. Although the tax plan incorpo-

rates many measures the Conservatives would have
condemned as socialistic a few years ago, among them
a guaranteed income for all which is what the negative income tax would provide, it remains true to Tory
doctrine in that it lets the people spend more of their

money and the Government less.
The details of the guaranteed annual income in Britain
are to be set out in a Green Paper to be published in July
or August.
Honourable senators. the Special Senate Committee on
Poverty is to be highly commended, with its chairman,

Senator Croll, for being again in the forefront of progressive humanitarian legislation to provide for all the people
of this country the opportunity to have dignity and to be
cared for without having to go through a demeaning type
of investigation, study, frustration and duplication.
I suggest that some, on looking at this report, may think
it unsatisfactory because it does not deal with every conceivable facet and issue concerning poverty, or that in

many ways it does not deal with it thoroughly. I have read
this practical report twice and, believe me, it is a document that every social worker and everyone interested in
the cause of eliminating poverty in Canada should read
and study thoroughly. To satisfy such requirements-that
is, to look at every single area of poverty-would be
almost impossible. There are many academic volumes on
poverty gathering dust on shelves, but rarely is a solution
proposed. This report is packed with concrete suggestions
as to approaches that every level of government should be
taking. But particularly, it emphasizes the guaranteed
annual income. I suggest it is a logical step which will
develop, based on the patterns of legislation which have
been provided across Canada.
I want to have it on record that I do not agree wholeheartedly with the report's condemnation of all social
legislation provided in the past. As the members of the
committee talked to poor people across the country, they
decided there must be drastic changes, but men like the
Leader of the Government, who have very clear ideas on
how to build, brick by brick, a social service system

across Canada, including a health system, know that
those changes cannot be brought about overnight. I
remember that when we were talking about hospital and
medical insurance, for example, and looking ahead to see
that there would be the necessary medical schools and
other facilities available, I wrote a speech for him. I do not
think he ever used it, but it was for the opening of Hum-

boldt Hospital. I believe he described more adequately in
his own words the progressive development of our social
legislation.
* (1530)

In any event, Canadians of every political persuasion
have been knitting together a social assistance pattern,
and that pattern is clearly enunciated in this document. It
is the pattern of moving towards a guaranteed annual
income. I say to the members of the Special Senate Com[Hon. Mr. Thompson.]

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
CONSIDERATION OF FINAL REPORT OF SPECIAL JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, April 26, consideration of the final report of the Special Joint Committee
of the Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, tabled in the Senate on Thursday, March
16, 1972.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, as this

is the first time I have had occasion to speak in this
chamber since the appointment of three new senators
from the Province of Nova Scotia I should like to take the
opportunity to welcome them to the Senate. I did not have
the privilege of knowing Senator Norrie before she came
here, but I do know that she is highly regarded and
respected in the Province of Nova Scotia. Her appointment has met with general approval there. I have known
Senator Graham for some time now. While he is a comparatively young man, nevertheless he has already been
very active in the political and industrial life of our
province.
I might add a special word of welcome to Senator Hicks,
because I have known him longer and perhaps better. He
has already had two distinguished careers. As a former
Premier of the Province of Nova Scotia he had indeed a
most distinguished political career. As President of Dalhousie University he is in the midst of a second distinguished career, and I am sure he will add a third one as a
member of this chamber. It so happens that he and I
served together for a term in the Legislature of Nova
Scotia. While we did not see eye to eye in politics, yet we
worked together for the common good of our province. I
am happy that he and I will again te working together for
the good of our province and our country.
Honourable senators, I should like to say a few words

today on the Report of the Special Joint Committee of the
Senate and House of Commons on the Constitution of
Caiada. As you know, the report of this special joint
committee contains 105 recommendations. Those recommendations are found in the 37 chapters which make up
the report. Obviously it would be at least difficult to
examine all or even many of those recommendations in

one speech, so I propose to confine my remarks to three
chapters which I find e9pecially interesting. I realize, of
course, that the other recommendations are all worthy of
consideration and discussion. Indeed, some of them have
already been well discussed during the course of this
debate.
I shall speak somewhat briefly on the recommendations
contained in chapters 13, 5 and 4, in that order. I mention
chapter 13 first because it deals with the role of the Senate

in the proposed new constitution. Naturally enough, I
have a particular and indeed special interest in that

recommendation.
If we look at page 33 of the report we see that the

committee gave a concise and, in my opinion, an accurate
statement of the history and origin of the Senate, and the

June 1, 1972
June 1,1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

role it was meant to have in our parliamentary system. I
should like to quote in part from that page, as follows:
The Confederation Debates of 1865 prove that there
would have been no Confederation in 1867, or at least
no Canada as we know it today, if provision had not
been made for the Senate. The Maritimes and Quebec
were not prepared to join the union if there was to be
only one elected House, based on population. Canada
would be a federation, and not a unitary state. Consequently, if the Lower House were based on representation by population, there must be an Upper House
giving equality to the regions.
Further on it is stated:
Two roles, then, were intended for the Senate of
Canada: 1) the protection of Provincial, minority or
regional rights; 2) the review of legislation (in the
words of Sir John A. Macdonald, "the sober second
thought in legislation.")
If I may digress for just a moment, I would say that I
have become tired, in fact, completely fed up, with hearing or reading the expression, "sober second thought." It
seems to me to be insulting to the House of Commons to
intimate that they do not give legislation a sober first
thought.
The committee recognized and acknowledged that the
Senate was established as a protection and a safeguard
for minority or regional rights. Indeed, I think it is fair to
say that even the review of legislation was for this purpose. The committee conceded that the reasons which
motivated the Fathers of Confederation to include the
Senate in our parliamentary system are still valid today.
However, the committee wants what it is pleased to call
"reform." On page 34 of the report, the committee states:
We agree with the witnesses who argued for reform
of the Senate, not its abolition. The reasons which
prompted the Fathers of Confederation to set up a
bicameral legislative process in Canada are still valid
today. Federal states in particular have found upper
houses valuable. They allow greater regional
representation at the level of the central government.
The federal legislative process can and does benefit
from regional representation.
The importance of this role cannot be denied. The
problems of regional disparities, the recurring talk of
alienation from some regions, of separatism from
others, and the concern about domination by the Central Provinces reinforce traditional and theoretical
arguments. The growth and development of Canada
has not reduced regionalism in some aspects, but has
rather enhanced it as regions grew stronger. Much
remains to be done to improve the relations and
understanding between regions, and the Senate can
be one important tool.

(1540)

Honourable senators, in view of these statements I am
simply amazed at the recommendations made by the committee concerning the Senate. I need not mention them all,
but the main recommendation is one to the effect that the
Senate should be so reformed, if you can use that word,
that it would lose the veto power it now has. It has had
this veto power for 105 years. Yet, they would replace it by
25312-30

the power to suspend for six months the coming into
effect of legislation which has been passed by the House
of Commons. I have gone over this chapter very carefully
and I cannot see where any sensible reason has been
advanced to support such a foolish recommendation.
True, the report mentions that the powers of the House
of Lords in England have been reduced over the years, so
I presume the inference is that the power of the Canadian
Senate should likewise be reduced. Some people may
consider that to be a reason, but I certainly do not. While I
have every respect for the parliamentary system in Great
Britain, I fail to see how it can have any possible application to the present-day Canadian parliamentary system.
Certainly I can see no reason whatsoever why the Senate
of Canada in 1972 should be patterned after the 1972
version of the House of Lords in England.
Might I digress here for a moment to say that it has
always been a great mystery to me why there appeared to
be such an attitude of mind in Canada which always holds
in veneration whatever is done in England. Let me say
quite clearly that I do not.
It is my opinion that to take away the veto power of the
Senate is to take away the main reason for its existence,
and I cannot see how it could carry out its duties and
responsibilities without such power, because the other
activities which are recommended for the Senate are relatively minor. I cannot see how such activities, even if
carried out with an enlarged Senate, which they recommend, could justify the continued existence of the Senate.
It is my belief that the Senate as an appointed body, with
all the powers it now has, is an important part of our
parliamentary system. I believe it is a safeguard and a
protection, as it was meant to be. And like all such safeguards and protections perhaps it may never, or only
rarely, need to use those powers, but the mere fact that it
has such powers is in itself security that the rights of
regional and minority groups in Canada will be safeguarded. I do not believe, nor can I understand how, such
security could be effective if the Senate had only the
power to delay legislation for six months. It is my opinion
that under the recommendation of the joint committee, if
it were ever put into effect, the major role of the Senate
would be destroyed, and this would result in its abolition
in effect if not in name.
It is my view, honourable senators, that if the time has
come, or if it should ever come, when the Canadian people
are convinced that the Senate is no longer needed as a
part of our parliamentary system, then it should be abolished; but if it is to be abolished, let it be done openly,
aboveboard, with dignity and honour. Let us have none
of this business of undermining the authority and prestige
of the Senate so that it lingers on merely as an historical
curiosity rather than as an effective part of our parliamentary system. In my opinion the joint committee confused reform of the Senate with its destruction. As honourable senators may have gathered, I am opposed to this
recommendation of the joint committee, which would
weaken and limit the power of this chamber.
In Chapters 5 and 4 of the report we find recommendations dealing with an amending procedure and with the
patriation of the Constitution. I think we can all agree
with the statement in the report that it would be unwise to

SENATE DEBATES

proceed with the patriation of the Constitution in the
absence of an agreement as to an amending procedure. I
certainly agree that it is humiliating to Canada to have to
go to the British Parliament to amend her own Constitution. It is, of course, well known that for years an amending procedure has been looked for which would have the
approval of the federal Government and all the provincial
governments. The report adopts the formula to amend the
Constitution that is contained in the Victoria Charter of
June 1971. I believe that the formula, while not wholly
acceptable to all provinces, has a fairly good chance of

being approved with some modifications. In any event,
articles 49, 50 and 51 of the Victoria Charter contain the
proposed amending formula, and they are as follows:
Article 49. Amendments to the Constitution of Canada
may from time to time be made by proclamation
issued by the Governor General under the Great Seal
of Canada when so authorized by resolutions of the
Senate and House of Commons and of the Legislative
Assemblies of at least a majority of the Provinces that
includes
(1) every Province that at any time before the issue
of such proclamation had, according to any previous general census, a population of at least twentyfive percent of the population of Canada;
(2) at least two of the Atlantic Provinces;
(3) at least two of the Western Provinces that have,
according to the then latest general census, combined populations of at least fifty per cent of the
population of all the Western Provinces.
Article 50. Amendments to the Constitution of Canada
in relation to any provision that applies to one or
more, but not all, of the Provinces may from time to
time be made by proclamation issued by the Governor
General under the Great Seal of Canada when so
authorized by resolutions of the Senate and House of
Commons and of the Legislative Assembly of each
Province to which an amendment applies.
Article 51. An amendment may be made by proclama-

tion under Article 49 or 50 without a resolution of the
Senate authorizing the issue of the proclamation if
within ninety days of the passage of a resolution by
the House of Commons authorizing its issue the
Senate has not passed such a resolution and at any
time after the expiration of the ninety days the House
of Commons again passes the resolution, but any
period when Parliament is prorogued or dissolved
shall not be counted in computing the ninety days.
You will see there, honourable senators, that the six
months has now been reduced to ninety days.
It is fairly obvious that the recommendations of the
joint committee are controversial and they could be
debated for years without obtaining a general agreement.
In my view, the whole emphasis should be placed by
governments on a sustained effort to find an amending
formula which would have the approval of all concerned.
If such a formula could be found then we could bring the
Constitution from the United Kingdom to Canada where
it belongs. When we have it in Canada, we can decide
what and when amendments should be made.
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald.]

June 1, 1972

* (1550)

I suggest we put first things first and decide on a formula for amending the Constitution, and bring it to
Canada. Amendments can then be considered, and perhaps agreed upon. By so doing, at least we would have
made a good start towards constitutional reform. I feel
that if we endeavour to create a whole new Constitution it
would be so controversial that we would never find agreement. I sincerely suggest we find a simple formula for
amending the Constitution, perhaps article 49 of the Victoria Charter. I think we should forget articles 50 and 51
because they are controversial. I suggest we find a simple
formula, get the Constitution into Canada, and then do
what we wish with it.

side of the house wishes to adjourn this debate, I will

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT. 1971
BILL TO AMEND-SUBJECT MATTER REFERRED TO
COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Thursday, April 13, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald,
for second reading of Bill S-2, to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I apologize to
Senator Macdonald for the long delay in proceeding with
this bill. I am sure he will appreciate there has to be
consultation with the minister concerned, and he has been
ill. There were other complications as well so I was not
able to deal with this bill earlier.
I have discussed this matter with Senator Macdonald
and I regret to say, on behalf of the government, I cannot
accept the bill and I will give my reasons. But I think
Senator Macdonald and I have agreed on a formula that
might enable the subject matter to go to committee where
witnesses can be called from the Unemployment Insurance Commission, as well as the minister himself.
However, before presenting the formula by which this
matter could be dealt, I point out that this bill proposes
the removal of the provision exempting persons aged 70
and over from insurable employment-and also the
removal of the provision excepting persons receiving
Canada Pension Plan benefits or Quebec Pension Plan
benefits from insurable employment.
The Department of Labour has advised me that the
labour force survey statistics indicate that the number of
persons in the Canadian labour force over 65 years of age
is rapidly decreasing. In 1962 persons over the age of 65
accounted for roughly 16.7 per cent of the labour force.
By 1971 this had been reduced to 11 per cent. It is clear
that there is an increasing tendency for persons in this age
group to leave the labour force. I am sure the Unemployment Insurance Commission could expand on this point
in committee, but the steadily decreasing number who
continue in the labour force represents an above average
draw on the Unemployment Insurance Commission

account.

June 1, 1972
June 1,1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

For persons between the ages of 65 and 70 who receive a
retirement pension, under either the Canada Pension Plan
or the Quebec Pension Plan, the Unemployment Insurance Act provides special severance benefits equal to
three times the weekly benefit. If these people were not
receiving the Canada Pension or the Quebec Pension they
would be entitled to the regular unemployment service
benefit.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If I may intervene, I do not think
that is correct.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am reading from a memorandum
which was given to me by the Unemployment Insurance
Commission. Senator Macdonald could perhaps read this
memorandum. I shall be happy to examine his intervention as well.
The Unemployment Insurance Commission has advised
me that in order to qualify for regular unemployment
insurance benefits a person, among other things, must be
available for work.
I have already indicated that persons between the ages
of 65 and 70 must be retired from their regular employment to draw retirement benefits under either the Canada
Pension Plan or the Quebec Pension Plan. If it were not
for paragraph 3(2)(a) of the Unemployment Insurance
Act, 1971 which Senator Macdonald has called to our
attention in this bill, Canada would be faced with an
anomalous situation whereby residents between the ages
of 65 and 70 could declare themselves retired for the
purpose of drawing Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan benefits, and simultaneously declare themselves
not retired for the purpose of collecting regular unemployment insurance benefits.
Honourable senators will agree that paragraph 3(2)(a) of
the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971 is there for a good
reason and not for the purpose of pressuring people out of
work. These were sufficient reasons for limiting insuraable employment to persons aged 65. However, the fact is
the administration has ignored a mere dollar consideration and has extended the insurable employment to persons up to age 70, and I think for a good reason.
In developing the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971
attention was not confined to unemployment insurance in
itself, but embraced an unemployment insurance program within the national fabric of existing social legislation. I think honourable senators will agree, having in
mind the parameter of existing social legislation, that the
position taken with regard to this proposal is not an
unreasonable one.
Under the Canada Pension Plan, pensionable employment ceases at age 70. In addition to the Old Age Security
and Guaranteed Income Supplement, both of which may
be paid as early as age 65, the Canada Pension Plan is
payable to age 70 without restriction. It may be paid
between the ages of 65 and 70, but with the restriction that
the person be retired from regular employment.
To recapitulate, it will be seen that the purpose of the
new unemployment insurance legislation is, and I quote
from the act:
To insure regular members of the labour force against
the contingency of a temporary interruption in earnings from their employment.

* (1600)

There is nothing in the legislation which prevents an
individual who is over 70 years of age from working, nor
is he or she required to pay contributions. As Senator
Macdonald knows, I did have some difficulty personally
with this provision, because I think it must be left to the
individual, no matter what age, to decide whether he or
she wishes to be in the labour force. However, there is
nothing in the new amendments which alters that, or
compels them to make contributions to the fund.
The administration felt that persons in this category,
however, fall outside the definition of regular members of
the labour force. It was felt that their interruption of
earnings would, in the vast majority of cases, not be
temporary. Given that the Unemployment Insurance Act
cannot solve all our social problems, the government in
the existing law decided that the parameters, within
which a regular member of the work force would be
defined, ought to extend from anyone having eight weeks
or more of labour force attachment through to anyone in
receipt of Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan
benefits. There had been a suggestion earlier, as perhaps
Senator Macdonald is aware, to reduce this from 70 years
of age to 65, or to deduct the proceeds of work-related
pensions from those individuals between 65 years of age
and 70 who had not opted to receive the benefits of the
Canada or Quebec Pension Plans. The government, however, took the position that the exit point should be 70
years of age, with no deductibility of work-related pensions in the interim period.
Although it is incidental to the argument in principle, I
think it is important to note that the proposed amendment
would cost an additional $60 million. At one time I
thought, as Senator Macdonald knows, that this perhaps
would be outside our authority because of the limited
powers of the Senate, and of private members in the other
place, to initiate money bills. I am overlooking that, however, in view of the proposal I am making, in which
Senator Macdonald has concurred, for dealing with this
matter and making sure that his bill is given the fullest
airing.
Finally, I think it is important to remember that the new
legislation substantially liberalized the unemployment
insurance plan. The qualifying period was reduced from
30 to eight weeks, insurability was extended to cover the
contingencies of sickness and maternity, and the maximum benefit was raised to $100 per week from $58 per
week. The maximum in 1968 was only $36 per week. In
addition, the duration of the benefit period is no longer
tied to an arbitrary one week of benefit for every two
weeks of contribution, but is flexible in a reflection of the
current unemployment rate.
It will be recalled that persons voluntarily leaving the
labour force between the ages of 65 and 70 years by
accepting a Canada Pension Plan retirement scheme or
that of the Quebec Pension Plan, and those who leave the
plan at 70, both receive a retirement allowance equivalent
to three weeks of benefits.
Honourable senators, this is the position of the government, expressed to me through the Minister of Manpower
and Immigration. However, Senator Macdonald has put
this matter forward, and I think it is one that should be

SENATE DEBATESJue,17
further examined. I have suggested to hlm, and in this he
has concurred, that for this purpose, in view of the position that I take on behaîf of the government, this bill be
not now read a second time but the subject matter therein
be referred to the Standing Senate Comnrittee on Health,
Welf are and Science for immediate consideration.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Is that not killing the bill?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, that kilîs the bill.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: In a nice way.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is the way in which I like to treat a
man for whom I have very great respect, when he brings
forward a proposai in which he is interested. If, on the
evidence in committee, the committee's judgment should
be other than what I have stated, there certainly will be no
objection to Senator Macdonald's bringing this bill back.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved
by the honourable Senator Macdonald, seconded by the
honourable Senator Choquette, that this bill be read the
second time.
In amendment it is moved by the honourable Senator
Martin, seconded by the honourable Senator Smith that
this bill be not now read a second time but that the subject
matter thereof be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science. Is it your pleasure,
honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, first of
ail I must thank the Leader of the Government, who has

June 1, 1972

obviously given this matter great consideration. I have no
objection to that procedure being followed. I believe that
when the amendment is before the committee it will be
regarded as an improvement to the present act, and the
committee will consequently give it favourable consideration.
I do not see the force of the arguments that have been
put forward. As 1 understand it, the unemployment insurance scheme is actuarily sound, as is the Canada Pension
Plan. A contributor to the Canada Pension Plan should
receive the benefits when he is entitled to them. no matter
whether he is working or not. and no matter whether he
desires to work or not. The same should apply te, unemployment insurance. So long as a contributor has paid
into it and is paying into it, I do not see why the cutof!
should be at 70 years of age, as undoubtedly there are not
too many of that age who wish, or are able, to work.
However. those who are able and willing to work should
have the right to do so, and to draw unemployment
insurance.
In view of the fact that the Leader of the Government is
prepared to have the subject matter referred to committee
in order that it may be given further study, I fully concur
and thank him for his consideration. It may not be too
long before I will introduce another bill to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act.
Motion in amendment agreed to.

IMPROPRIETY
POLICY-NOTICE 0F INQUIRY
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I wish to
give notice that with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 44(2), tomorrow I will cail the attention of
the Senate to the impropriety of public servants making
speeches on matters of policy.
Hon. Senatoru: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the honourable senator leave
to proceed with this inquiry?
Hon. Jacques Flynn: I would suggest that as far as leave
is concerned it could be asked for tomorrow. Things
change so quickly in this place that I should like to withhold my permission until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Croli: Why tomorrow?
Han. Mr. Flynn: The honourable senator has asked leave
to proceed tomorrow, although under the rules he cannot
proceed before Thursday. My suggestion is that he ask
leave tomorrow, at which time we wiJ know if we have
some more urgent matters to deal with. I would not want
to grant leave if there were more urgent matters.
Hon. Mr. Croil: You would deprive yourself of the
opportunity to hear Senator Forsey?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am quite sure we would not deprive
the Senate of the opportunity of hearing Senator Forsey.
If we do not hear from him tomorrow it will be Thursday.

Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, I have not the
slightest desire to get in the way of more important business. If the Leader of the Government is about to delight
and astonish us with vast measures of great public importance from the other house, I can assure the Leader of the
Opposition that I shail be the first to throw my cap in the
air and make way. What I have to say will very well keep;
it may even, lîke good wine, improve with age.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The honourable Senator Forsey understands, I think, that I arn just trying to co-operate with the
Leader of the Government who is always desirous of
dealing with government matters before anything else.
Hon. Mr. Foruey: I know the zeal of the Leader of the
Opposition in this good cause.
Hon. Paul Martin: If it would help to convince Senator
Flynn that he should give leave now, I can assure him that
I do not know of anything from my end that would preclude our granting leave to Senator Forsey to go on with
his speech tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Well, this assurance, given past experience, is not sufficient for me.
a (2010)

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, this is a
quite unusual situation. There was no unanimous consent,
but if I understand the Leader of the Opposition correctly
he has withheld permission until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Notice has been given as normally it
should be.

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(h):
That the name of the honourable Senator Mcllraith

Affairs.
Motion agreed to.

Committee on Standing Rules and Orders.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Leave is granted, of course.

I might say for the information of honourable senators
that a motion in exactly these terms was passed by the
other place a couple of days ago.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: On a point of order. The honourable Senator Argue has given notice, but he has also to
ask for leave to proceed tomorrow. I think we should
adopt the same principle as we did with Senator Forsey,
especially since the length of the motion will probably
require me to read it in Hansard or in the Minutes of the
Proceedingsbefore I can understand its full implication.
Hon. Mr. Argue: It was supported by members of the
Conservative Party.
The Hon. the Speaker: I believe this motion requires
only one day's notice, so the honourable Senator Argue is
giving notice now that he will proceed tomorrow. I understand this is the case.

reason for the ditference.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why? I do not see the difference.
Hon. Mr. Argue: One is an inquiry and the other is a

BANKING. TRADE AND COMMERCE
AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET DURING SITTING
OF THE SENATE WITHHELD

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, with
leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(a), I
move:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce have power to sit while the
Senate is sitting tomorrow, Wednesday, 14th June,
1972, and that Rule 76(4) be suspended in relation
thereto.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Explain.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, there is a
request for explanation. Would the sponsor of this motion
answer it, since there must be unanimous consent?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, the only
explanation I can give is that it is a request from the
chairman of the committee to have permission to sit
tomorrow. To be more honest with you, it is my understanding that the chairman has a desire to deal with
several matters which have been referred to the committee. In his judgment, which I respect, he will probably
need all of Wednesday to deal with those matters. However, this is a decision that neither the chairman of the
committee nor I make. It is for this chamber to decide
whether we grant permission to the committee to meet
while the house is sitting. That is the only explanation I
can give.
Hon. Hartland de M. MoIson: Honourable senators, I do
not wish in any way to delay the work of the Senate or its
committees. However, during the last session we had considerable discussion as to the desirability of explaining
why we ask for the suspension of a rule. I do not think we
are asking too much in this respect. As a matter of fact,
the honourable Senator McDonald has given us a very
valid explanation which, as far as I am concerned, is
perfectly acceptable.
It is much easier to give consent when we know what we
are being asked to do, rather than when we are merely
asked to suspend a certain rule. I thank my honourable
friend for the explanation he has given.
•

(2020)

Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, as chair-

man of the committee concerned, I should explain that we

June 13, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

have organized our meeting for tomorrow and we have
two of the experts who were with us throughout our
sittings on the previous occasion. They are coming in here
for the day. We may finish in the morning, but it is
possible that our consideration might extend to the afternoon. I want to use their services for the full day because
we are paying them for the full day. It seems sensible to
use them to the full extent. I can assure you that the
situation will not be prolonged beyond the point where we
think we have gathered the information that we want.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Would it be possible to decide that at
two o'clock tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We do not know what is going to happen
in the meantime. It would be good if we could adjust our
work so that those of us who would like to could attend
the committee chaired by my honourable friend and also
be here if there is something going on. Perhaps we could
adjust the schedule in order to be able to attend both
meetings. It might be better to suspend this decision,
therefore, until two o'clock tomorrow. After all, there is
no problem with regard to the committee sitting tomorrow afternoon. I am quite sure that the Senate will be
willing, but I do not know what might happen in the
meantime.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not pretend to have an infallible
crystal ball.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order, please. Honourable senators, it would appear that the microphone for honourable
Senators Hayden and Bourget is not functioning. I understand the problern will be solved and the microphone
repaired for tomorrow, but in view of that may I ask
Senator Hayden either to speak louder or to use another
desk.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I believe I can make myself heard
from here. There was a time when we did not have an
amplification system.
All I can tell my friend Senator Flynn is that we have
these two experts appearing tomorrow. They are thoroughly familiar with the recommendations we made. Our
purpose tomorrow is to discuss those recommendations
with thern and to go over the bill, which is part of the
budget, and to consider the extent to which our recommendations have been accepted or rejected. We will then
attempt to analyze why there has been a failure to accept
some, and prepare ourselves for the next step which is to
discuss with the department concerned just why they
have not accepted them.
I would expect with all the material we will have before
us that we will be able to move along very quickly. There
will be no oratory; at least I would not expect so. It is just
a question of research and study and we will move along
as quickly as we can.
We will meet the convenience of any of the senators who
are members of the committee, and we will meet the
convenience of the Senate so that we can be assured of a
fair representation in the Senate at all times during the
day. But, subject to that, this part of the job should be
done as quickly as possible because we are moving
against a deadline as indicated in the public press as to

when Parliament may recess for the summer. Our committee should be ready with all the answers which it is
entitled to have as to why certain of our recommendations
were not accepted.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Again the explanation given by Senator
Hayden does not satisfy me entirely. Does he take for
granted that these bills will have to be passed before the
end of June? My understanding was that we were going to
study these bills in the same way as we studied the tax
reform legislation last year, that is, from a technical
standpoint, and that we could go on considering this legislation even after the House of Commons had recessed or
after the adjournment of Parliament, if you prefer that
expression. Let me make it clear that I am not speaking
now of considering these matters after a dissolution but
after an adjournment, which is quite a different thing, as
the government leader well knows. The reason I hesitate
in granting leave to proceed tomorrow is that it is possible
there may be some matter of great importance to discuss
tomorrow afternoon. For that reason I might want to wait
until tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock before granting
leave to the committee to sit at the same time as the
Senate is sitting. That is the only reservation I have about
this motion.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend is certainly entitled to raise
that question. Certainly, even if permission is given now
for the committee to sit tomorrow afternoon, if something
should arise in the meantime which would require the
attendance of all honourable senators in the chamber,
then we would not pursue the right which we have to sit
when the Senate is sitting. But the point I want to make is
that we would like to become as well educated as we
possibly can and as quickly as we possibly can quite apart
from any consideration as to when the bill may come
before us. I am not speculating in any way. I am simply
saying that we should educate ourselves to enable us to
deal with the bill whenever it comes before us. We should
be educated as to what our position is and as to how far
our amendments have gone. As I say, I am not speculating
as to when the bill will come, but I am simply saying that
we want to be in a position to deal with it at that time.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Let me say that I am in full agreement
with the objectives of the committee, and it is only the
question of timing that is now at issue. Having regard to
the assurance just given by the chairman of the committee I think we can adopt the motion.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators, I am not in
agreement with this motion at all. As I understand the
situation there are no bills and thére will not be any bills
arising out of the budget before the other house adjourns.
What my friend, the chairman of the committee, is saying
is that certain matters that were not accepted by the
Minister of Finance should be once again urged. In my
view that would mean using the committee for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear upon the government
and the minister. That is not the function of a Senate
committee, and particularly it should not be the intention
of a committee of the Senate at the present time. It is a
bad practice and one which should be discouraged.
If there is a bill, then we can discuss it no matter what
form it comes in. But, as I have said, there is no bill.
Therefore there is no purpose and there ought not to be

SENATE DEBATES
any purpose in bringing forward experts or alleged
experts for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear upon
the government. That is a great mistake and we ought not
to agree to this course of action. I am not prepared to give
permission, Mr. Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, in connection
with what my friend has said, may I point out that he
seems not to appreciate that this matter is already in the
hands of the committee, having already been placed there
by the members of this Senate. We can proceed by the
authority we already have to conduct hearings while the
Senate is sitting. What I am saying with regard to tomorrow is simDly this: it might be in the best interests of this
house if we could proceed tomorrow afternoon as well as
tomorrow morning. There is no question about our right
to proceed in the morning. My friend is suggesting something about pressure groups, and I do not profess to know
anything about pressure groups; my friend may have to
educate me on that because if anyone is qualified to know
what is meant by a pressure group he would be the expert
in that field.
* (2030)

Hon. Mr. Croll: I think that is a fair statement, and I am
glad this has come before the house. My honourable
friend spoke about pressure groups, and I accept what he
said. As far as I am concerned it would indicate a conflict
of interest.
As soon as I can get a resolution on the Order Paper I
will ask the Senate to investigate the possibility of a
conflict of interest in this chamber in order that we may
be clear where the conflict lies.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, I think we
are talking a lot of nonsense. The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce is looking into a
very complicated set of amendments to the Income Tax
Act. What does this have to do with building up pressure?
Someone has to know what these income tax measures
mean. They have created all kinds of problems and they
should be studied properly. The Senate must sit down and
examine these questions to determine whether the
changes we have suggested will be made. We would not
have passed the bill if we had not been guaranteed that
these amendments which we suggested would be seriously
considered by the government.
What does this have to do with pressure groups? We are
talking a lot of nonsense. We are dealing with technical
points and I feel we need to determine whether the
amendments we recommended are incorporated in the
amendments to the Income Tax Act. This is all we want to
do.
We will work in committee tomorrow morning. We are
bringing a number of people here at great expense and if
we need to sit in the afternoon I feel we should be granted
permission to do so. If something should occur in the
meantime and we feel that we should be here tomorrow
afternoon rather than in committee, I am sure the chairman will be reasonable and act accordingly. Let us give
him permission to proceed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must
intervene at this point. The only matter before the Senate
[Hon. Mr. Croll.]

June 13, 1972

at this time is a request that the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce be given permission to sit tomorrow while the Senate is sitting. There was
not unanimous consent so it must be left on the Order
Paper for the next day.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might suggest a solution to this difficulty. If the Deputy
Leader of the Government would give a day's notice
rather than ask for leave, this might dispose of the matter
more amicably.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is notice.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I would like to
deal with one statement made by Senator Beaubien. I
know that Senator Beaubien, who is a fair critic, would
not wish to misstate the case. There was no commitment
by the government to accept all of the amendments made
by the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce.
The Minister of Finance said that he would give consideration to the Senate proposals and to the extent that they
were acceptable to the government, they would be embodied in legislation. That is as far as he went. Some of the
recommendationsHon. Mr. Flynn: I rise on a point of order. The Speaker
has already disposed of this matter. In my opinion the
honourable Leader of the Government is not entitled to
start a debate on this point. The Speaker intervened while
Senator Beaubien was speaking to this matter, indicating
that he was out of order. I do not see how the government
leader can be in order in refuting what has been said.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is up to the Speaker to decide.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I rose on a point of order for the
purpose of finding out how His Honour the Speaker feels
about this.
The Hon. the Speaker: I have already decided on the
motion. There was no unanimous consent. I understand
the government leader rose to correct an interpretation.
However, only a point of order or a question of privilege
would justify this. The matter has been disposed of and
we are now dealing with the item Inquiries.
NATO
COMMITTEE MEETINGS AT BRUSSELS, BELGIUM, MAY
1972

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
NATO Committee Meetings held at Brussels, Belgium, 8tn to 12th May, 1972.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like to begin my
remarks this evening on perhaps a more harmonious note
than that to which we have listened over the past five
minutes or so. During the last few years, when I have been
a member of the Canadian delegation to the meetings of
NATO, I have had the privilege of serving with senators
and members of Parliament from both parties represented in this chamber. Despite the fact that on many occasions there have been great differences of opinion
between members of those two parties on a variety of

June 13. 1972
June13

1972

SENATE DEBATES

subjects, including national defence and foreign affairs, I
for one greatly appreciated the fact that when the delegates, both Conservative and Liberal, were sent abroad to
represent this nation they spoke with one voice. In the
event that a delegate of any nation attacked a delegate or
a policy of the Government of Canada, he attacked each
and every delegate from this country, as a group and as
individuals. I wish to thank my colleagues opposite in this
chamber, and to congratulate them, together with our
colleagues from the other place who sit to the left of Mr.
Speaker, for having presented the views of this nation
with a united voice and a united front.
In my opinion an outstanding part has been played by
Canadian delegates to NATO meetings-both meetings of
committees and of the Assembly. Of course, this is no
better demonstrated than by the fact that for the second
time in recent years a Canadian is chairman of the
Assembly. Mr. Terrence Murphy, a member of the House
of Commons, was elected to that post last fall. This, I
think, is recognition by other member nations of NATO of
the contribution made to the organization throughout the
years by Canada.
The meetings that I attended in Brussels last May were
committee meetings, preparing the work and agenda for
the meeting of the Assembly which will take place at
Bonn in, I believe, the month of November.
The spring meetings of the five standing committees are
held on consecutive days, from Monday to Friday. All the
delegates have an opportunity of attending each committee meeting, because they are held on consecutive days.
This is not possible at the Assembly meetings in the fall
because only two days are allotted for them and, of
course, delegates are able to attend only those meetings of
their own committees and the plenary session.
* (2040)

On a previous occasion, at the conclusion of my report
to the house on NATO meetings, Senator O'Leary stated it
was his impression that NATO had responsibilities outside the military and political arenas. He was absolutely
right. In the past I have been more closely associated with
the military committee than with the other standing committees, but this evening I should like to say a few words
about some of the activities of NATO outside the military
and political arenas. One committee to which I should like
to refer is that on education, cultural affairs and
information.
I had the privilege, while in Brussels in May, of attending one day's discussions of this committee which plays
an important role in the total activities of NATO. Unless
NATO is able to convince the taxpayers of member countries, through a program of education and information,
that we must all meet the cost of the maintenance of peace
in the world there will, of course, be no NATO because
there would be no money to support NATO.
There is a continuing program of education and information, and NATO itself has done a good job in this
direction. If I have one criticism, it is that the press, not
only of Canada but of all member nations of NATO,
seems to prefer to publicize murder, arson, rape, and
other spectacular activities rather than the facts about
NATO and information regarding its activities. The press
of the western world must accept far greater responsibili-

ty in informing the public of NATO's accomplishments
during its lifetime.
The main accomplishment of NATO is the fact that
since its beginning the Soviet Union has been stopped in
her tracks in her expansionist policies throughout Europe.
We have had peace in Europe for the past 20 years and, in
my humble opinion, we have NATO to thank for it.
I would ask the public press of this nation, as well as of
the free world, to publish more information, particularly
for our young people, on the expenditures necessary to
maintain peace and, through a program of education and
publicity, to convince the public of the part which NATO
has played in preserving peace in our time. I shall have
more to say about that later in my remarks.
A second committee which has played an important role
in NATO is that on science and technology. One of our
colleagues in the other place, Mr. Paul St. Pierre, who is a
general rapporteur of this committee, has probably done
more than any other delegate from any nation to promote
the idea that NATO and the member countries must share
some responsibility for pollution of the oceans and the
atmosphere.
Three years ago, when Mr. St. Pierre was first charged
with the responsibility of rapporteur, he spoke about conditions in northern Canada and our fear regarding pollution of the Arctic. He walked to a map on the wall and
pointed to the large expanse of land and ice which
belongs to Canada, and the eyes of many European delegates popped because previously they had had little or no
conception of the extent of Canadian territory. He traced
the shipping route, including that of icebreakers, through
northern Canada, and the route of the Manhattan.Many
European delegates were as astounded by the size of the
area which is the responsibility of Canada, as they were
by the information which Mr. St. Pierre gave regarding
problems associated with oil spills in the area.
I extend my congratulations to Mr. St. Pierre for the
part he has played in NATO. In no small way he has been
instrumental in arranging the conference on pollution
which is now taking place in Stockholm under the auspices of the United Nations.
As Senator O'Leary properly pointed out, NATO has
many responsibilities other than in the military and political arenas.
A third committee is that on economics. Discussions this
year, as in previous years, have centred on the monetary
problems of the western world, problems associated with
the support of NATO activities, and problems associated
with trying to find a new monetary system to suit the
needs of the western world in the 1970s.
I shall refer to the military and political committees as
one committee rather than two. They are, in fact, two
separate committees because, after all, a military decision
cannot be made without taking into consideration the
political effects of that decision, and a political decision
cannot be made without consideration of the military
effects. In recent years the military and political committees have met separately for one day, and, as a rule, a
joint meeting is then held. During my remarks this evening I shall refer to the part played by each of these
committees in the total operations of NATO.

SENATE DEBATES
A major consideration of NATO nations was the invitation to attend a conference on security and co-operation in
Europe extended by the Soviet Union and her satellites
several years ago. However, member nations of NATO
were fearful of accepting the invitation carte blanche
without testing the attitude of the Soviet bloc nations with
regard to détente or without having factual knowledge of
whether the Soviet Union and her satellites desired the
conference for political purposes only. They wondered
whether the Soviet Union and her satellites, in extending
their invitation, were sincere in wishing to discuss some of
our mutual problems in the hope that we might maintain
security or détente in the future, and not use the conference as an instrument of political propaganda.
a (2050)

It was the feeling of the NATO nations, rather than
going into a conference on security and co-operation in
Europe, which would be attended by Canada and the
United States, that perhaps they should start some talks
on strategic arms. They asked themselves: Can we not
consider this subject outside a European conference? Of
course, you know the results. Discussions have taken
place in SALT, and I think most of us came to the conclusion that this was a top level conference and nothing
would happen. But only a few weeks ago while the President of the United States was visiting the Soviet Union he
and the Premier of the Soviet Union finally signed an
agreement on strategic arms limitations.
I am not so sure that the agreement that was signed
could not be improved, but the fact that an agreement has
been signed is a step in the right direction. I think it
proves that there is a desire on the part of the Soviet
Union and the Warsaw Pact nations as well as NATO to
try to control to some extent the tremendous cost of
defence as we have known it over the last 20 or 25 years. I
repeat, progress has been made and this indicates that
perhaps we should now enter into discussions of a security conference.
In addition to SALT, the NATO nations wanted some
agreement on Berlin before entering into the general conference. Of course, we have had four-power discussions
on Berlin, and an agreement has been signed. Again, I do
not think any of us believe it is the best solution in the
world, but it is a great step forward in solving the problems that have existed in Berlin ever since the end of the
last world war. We have more access to that city now, and
there is a freer movement of people between East and
West Germany than there has been for many years. There
has been progress, and again this indicates that the Soviet
Union and the Warsaw Pact nations apparently are prepared to enter into negotiations which can prove fruitful.
At about the same time that the proposal was made for
a European security conference, the Chancellor of West
Germany, Willie Brandt, was making approaches to the
Eastern European nations under his policy of Ostpolitik
and talks have been successfully concluded with agreements signed between West Germany and the Soviet
Union, Poland and East Germany. There are now better
communications and a better understanding between
West Germany, the Soviet Union, Poland and East Germany. The agreements have been ratified by the Bonn government, and progress again has been made.
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

June 13, 1972

It was also thought by the NATO nations that before
entering into this security conference perhaps some
approach ought to be made with respect to mutual
balanced force reductions, or MBFR. Mr. Brosio, the Past
President of NATO, was appointed by the NATO nations
to make contact with the Warsaw Pact nations to see if
some progress could be made in this area prior to a
European conference on security. This proposal was
turned down by the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, because
of the progress that has been made in the areas I have just
referred to, it is now agreed that there should be a conference on security and co-operation in Europe. I think the
evidence which we have before us at the moment indicates that we can devise an agenda that would be mutually satisfactory to both East and West, and that a conference can be held on European security which will yield
beneficial results to the peoples of the world.
It has always been the wish of NATO to bring about
some détente with our potential enemy in Eastern Europe.
The thing we had to prove to ourselves was that there was
a genuine desire on the part of the Soviet Union and her
satellites for détente. It now appears that the Soviet Union
is no longer able to convince its people that it must continue to spend the huge sums of money and resources it has
spent in the past on defence, and it must come to some
mutual understanding with Western Europeans and North
Americans with the view in mind of maintaining the
security it has with smaller expenditures. One may feel
tempted to begin a discussion of détente by expressing
doubt about the long term intentions of the Soviet Union,
especially in view of her constantly increasing military
strength, and that of her satellite nations. What are the
facts in this area?
In Central Europe, the relative land and air forces'
capabilities of NATO and the Warsaw Pact have not
changed appreciably over the period 1970 and 1971. The
Warsaw Pact continues to be clearly superior in numbers.
By introducing modern weapon systems the pact continues to improve the quality of its forces.
The NATO leaders' assessment of what they term "the
threat" is as follows, if I may quote Mr. Luns, the present
Secretary General of NATO, who on a recent visit to the
United States said:
It must be underlined that the overall objectives of the
Soviet Union, even if they are presented in a more
subtle way, have not changed. Far from reducing its
overwhelming military might to a level more in keeping with the considerations of self-defence, the Soviet
Union has embarked on an unprecedented program
of military expansion and related research and development. Its military forces are in many instances the
wedge for introduction of Soviet political influence.
And he added:
In Europe, it can be expected that the Soviet Union
will continue to seek dominance by maintaining a
high degree of internal security, pushing for reduction
of U.S. influence, and opposing western unification.
There is no doubt that the main aim of the Soviet Union
is to get the United States forces out of Europe. One can
understand why. Even today, 25 years or more since the
end of hostilities in Europe, there are almost as many
Americans there as there were at that time. The United

June 13, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

States is the only nuclear power in the world that has
forces comparable to those of the Soviet Union. Naturally
the Soviet Union would like to see that nuclear threat
removed from Western Europe, but I would be fearful of
the day when the nuclear umbrella of the United States
was ever removed from Europe.
e (2100)

Certainly the Russians are opposed to western unification in Europe. They are not here talking about military
unification; they are talking about the European Economic Community. I know full well that the Soviet Union
would much prefer conditions in Europe to remain as
they were at the end of the last world war, when the
Soviet Union was able to expand westward by picking off
small independent free nations and bringing them under
their subjugation without a shot being fired. However,
when NATO was set up and we obtained a unified military front, it stopped their western progress in its tracks.
We are now facing not only a unification of Western
Europe in a military sense but, under the European Economic Community, a unification on an economic and
trade basis from which we will have in the very near
future one of the strongest, if not the strongest, blocs in
the whole world. Naturally the Soviet Union is worried,
not in a military sense but an economic sense, about the
pressure that will be imposed on Eastern Europe by that
great economic power that is developing in Western
Europe. The addition of Great Britain to the European
Economic Community will be a great step forward in its
progress. I am as convinced today as I ever was that
Britain will enter, that she bas no option but to enter, and
that Europe has no option but to see that she enters.
Rather than dwell on the economic changes that are
taking place in Europe because of the development of the
European Economic Community, I want to refer for a
moment to this build-up of the strength of the Soviet
Union that was referred to by Mr. Luns. One of the
greatest areas of expansion in their military build-up has
been in naval forces. During the last world war the navy
of the Soviet Union consisted of small coastal vessels.
They had no navy as such, and no fishing fleet or merchant fleet travelling the oceans of the world. But what is
the situation today? This has all happened within the last
20 years, and most of the build-up has taken place since
the Cuban crisis. In a few years the Soviet Union has
become the second maritime power in the world, surpassed only by the United States. This achievement is the
result of a rapid and balanced growth, in both quantity
and quality, of the Soviet Union's naval forces, its merchant marine, its oceanographic survey fleet, and its fishing fleet. The purpose of this naval power has been
defined by Admiral Kasatanov, the first Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet navy, as follows:
The Central Committee has precisely defined the
place of the Navy in the defence of the country, and
has shown the way for the building of a modern
ocean-going nuclear rocket fleet which is capable of
solving strategic tasks of an offensive character in
modern warfare.
I wonder why he used the phrase "of an offensive character in modern warfare."

In order to adapt to its present strategic role the Soviet
navy has steadily expanded its activities and improved its
capabilities, and some of the noteworthy features are as
follows: The Soviet submarine fleet of about 350 vessels is
the largest in the world. A growing number of these
submarines are nuclear powered and nuclear armed.
Each year approximately twelve new submarines are
constructed, of which several are fitted with Polaris-type
ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union graduates over 1,000
marine design engineers and naval architects each year,
which is substantially more than any other country in the
world.
The Soviet Union oceanographic research fleet is larger
than all of the oceanographic fleets of the world combined. The Soviet fishing fleet, which is also the largest in
the world, has up to date equipment such as the most
recent fish factory ships which carry fourteen 50-ton vessels as a mothership, and which can be replaced by landing craft for amphibious operations. The Soviet merchant
fleet comprises a greater percentage of modern ships than
the merchant fleets of the West. Among them are about 80
large hatch-ships which could easily be adapted for military transport. Merchant marine tankers have been seen
refueling Soviet fleet units in the Mediterranean.
But these technical features are not the only evidence
that the Soviet navy is conditioning itself to its new role.
Eight years ago the Soviet naval infantry, or marine corps
as we would know it, was reconstituted. Its importance
has been emphasized by its participation in May Day
parades and numerous exercises. The force now comprises about 15,000 men. This shows the Soviet interest in
developing all forms of maritime capability, including
landing operations.
Today Soviet vessels are deployed as a matter of course
over a considerable portion of the globe's surface, including the NATO area-for instance off Norway, in the North
Atlantic, the Baltic, and the Mediterranean. More recently
they appeared in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and
the Caribbean, areas from which they were previously
absent. Combined with increased Soviet military supplies
to Egypt, Algeria, Libya and other Mediterranean countries, these developments have created a new situation for
the Atlantic alliance.
Many speeches have been made by admirals of the
Soviet navy, and others in the Soviet Union, that are
worrisome, to say the least, to those people who are
charged with the responsibility of defending the free
world on both land and the oceans of the world. Let me
give a list of the marine forces that are now available to
the Soviet Union, the significance of which, I think, was
pointed out by Fleet Admiral Kasatanov a short time ago,
when he said:
Soviet missile carrying torpedo boatsI emphasize "torpedo boats."
-have greater striking power than any World War II
warship.
A torpedo boat with modern armaments, being about 40
feet long with two diesel motors and a crew of five or six,
could sink any battleship afloat today. Let us see how
many of them they have deployed. They have well over
1,000 fast patrol boats, mine sweepers, and amphibious
type vessels. They have a capability of, and in the Middle

East have been successful in, sinking ships many hundreds of tons their size. In addition to the patrol boats,
they have deployed around the world today about 1,000
naval aircraft.
0

(2110)

They do not have any aircraft carriers as we know
them, but they do have helicopter carriers, two of which
are in service at the moment. They have 25 cruisers, 100
destroyers, 100 escort destroyers, and about 350 submarines. These are supplemented by 50 light bombers, 300
medium bombers, 250 reconnaissance aircraft, 290 antisubmarine warfare aircraft, and 200 transports assigned
to the navy. This build-up has all taken place, I repeat, in
less than 20 years and the vast majority in the last 8 to 10
years.
Honourable senators, sometimes I wonder, when we
talk about détente, are our friends on the other side of the
Iron Curtain serious? We can sign agreements with them
under SALT, with respect to Berlin, and with respect to
the new relationship between West Germany and East
Germany, Poland and the Soviet Union. On the one hand
they indicate that they are prepared to talk and to enter
into a period of détente, but on the other hand they seem
bent on continuing to improve their capabilities to wage
war not only at home but abroad.
The point I want to make is that if you are going to talk
détente with the Eastern European powers, including the
Soviet Union, then you have to speak from strength.
There seem to be many people, not only in our country
but in many Western European countries today, who feel
that because we have had peace for 20 years it may be
unnecessary to continue to spend large sums of money on
armaments and on military forces. I am one of those who
believe that we have to pay either the price for peace or
the price of war. To maintain peace is costing a lot of
money, not only to Canadians but to all people in the
Western world. We are able to measure that cost as a
percentage of gross national product, and in our nation it
is a very small percentage.
A great friend of mine who recently passed away, Congressman Mendel Rivers, used to ask the nations of the
Western world to contribute 5 per cent of their GNP for
freedom. I was always prepared to back his request,
because if you can buy peace and freedom for 5 per cent
of your gross national product you are making a good
deal. If you do not pay the price of freedom, then you
have to pay the price of war. NATO has brought us a long
period of peace and security in Western Europe and,
through Western Europe, to most of the world. I repeat
that if you can purchase peace for 5 per cent of your
GNP-and we are purchasing it for less than half of thatit is a good deal.
What is the price of war? You cannot measure it as a
percentage of GNP. If we became involved in another
world war, it would take the whole of our GNP. But that
would not be the total price. What about the destruction,
the suffering and the loss of human life throughout the
world? Can you measure that in terms of GNP? There is
no way.
When I listen to some young people-and some not so
young-belittling NATO and the efforts they have made
and the money they have spent, I wonder how many of
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

.Tnna 13 1 1972

them have visited a military hospital recently. Many of the
patients have been there since World War I, and many
more were added during World War II. Can you measure
the price that they have paid as a percentage of the GNP?
There is no way to do so.
There are two things you can be sure of in life: death
and taxes. As regards freedom and security, you have an
alternative: you can either pay the price of freedom and
maintain peace, or you can refuse to pay it and pay for
war. I do not think anyone would hesitate in making a
choice.
Honourable senators, I challenge the news media to tell
the Canadian public why we have maintained peace and
freedom. We invited the news media of this nation to come
and attend the NATO meetings. The Canadian government offered to fly them from Ottawa to Brussels and
back, letting them pay their own hotel bills and living
expenses. But none came, not even from that great organization the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation-not one.
But we have a conference in Stockholm on pollution
and we have plane loads of media representatives over
there. Pollution is a very great danger to all peoples, but it
will not bother us very much if this old world is unable to
maintain peace.
I repeat to my friends in the press gallery, and to the
people who pay their salaries, that it is about time they
gave a little more publicity and support to this organization which has maintained peace for over 20 years in
Europe. If we give NATO the tools, I am confident they
can continue to maintain peace in the foreseeable future.
If we let down our guard and do not maintain organizations such as NATO, we will not have an opportunity to
pay the insurance premium for maintaining peace. We
will pay a much greater price in dollars and human
suffering.
National defence, like everything else, costs more
money every day. When the military ask for more money,
it reminds me of the chief of the fire brigade in a little
town in Saskatchewan. He was chief for about 20 years
and they never had a loss of life or a major fire. One day
he went to the town council and presented a case for a
new fire engine. The council asked why he needed it, since
there had not been a major fire in 20 years. He replied
that one reason was that there was a good fire department
and good firefighting equipment, but that the fire engine
was worn out now and a new one was needed.
O

(2120)

Well, the same thing is true of NATO. Simply because
we have not had a war for 25 years is no reason to say to
the organization that has put us in that position, "Well, we
don't need your services any longer and you don't need
any new, sophisticated and modern equipment." One position is as logical as the other.
However, the costs involved today are almost prohibitive, and I should repeat that I am convinced that the
Warsaw Pact nations and the Soviet Union are finding the
same thing. They can no longer continue to pay the
masses of money necessary to produce the modern equipment in the numbers that they have been over recent
years. I am convinced that the people in Eastern Europe
have come to the conclusion that they want some of the

June

n

1972

SENATE DEBATES

finer things of life. They want automobiles. They want
refrigerators. They want air-conditioned homes. They
want mixmasters, toasters, vacuum cleaners and so on
just in the same way as our people do. Thank God they do,
because the day the Soviet Union and her satellite nations
begin to meet the domestic demands of their own people,
that will be the day they will no longer be able to meet the
costs of maintaining millions of men under arms with
modern equipment.
Just to give you some idea of the costs involved today,
one aircraft costs about the same amount of money as it
would have taken to equip a whole squadron 20 years ago.
One compared to 20! A destroyer today costs more than a
battleship did during the last world war. A tank costs ten
times as much as it did at the end of the last world war.
As a matter of fact, when I was in West Germany not
too long ago I was informed that the tanks they were
using when they first came into NATO cost on the average about 250,000 West German marks apiece. There are
about three West German marks to the dollar. The tank
which will replace the one they have in their armed forces
today will cost 1,800,000 West German marks.
It costs a lot more today for personnel. Salaries have
gone up and training costs more. There is a big difference
between driving a tank that has an engine, a gear shift
and a gun sight and driving one that is completely electronically controlled. But today there is all of the sophistication of the electronic industry to be found in each
tank, aircraft or ship. So not only do the machines cost
more but it costs more to train the personnel to operate
them. Moreover, it costs more to house troops and to feed
them than it did a few years ago.
Everything is computerized. One of the most highly
computerized industries in the world today is that of the
armed forces. Every tank, aircraft and ship, every vehicle,
every piece of armament today must have a night capability. You must be able to perform the same functions in
darkness as you can in daylight, which means that you
must have a target approach system. You must have
infrared sensers. You must have television.
You have read in the press recently, no doubt, where
they even put television into the bombs themselves. You
put the target on the television screen right in the end of
the bomb and the bomb is guided onto the target. Imagine
how much more that must cost compared to the old kind
of bomb made of a chunk of steel with explosives which
was dropped over the side of the aircraft. No wonder they
need money. But I repeat that we either give it to them or
we pay a hell of a lot bigger price, and not only in dollars
and cents.
Another aspect of this question is that the services
today must compete with industry in recruiting its personnel. You cannot go out and recruit people the way you
could 25 or 30 years ago. We are living in a technological
age. Young men and women want the finer things of life,
things they can get from working in industry and business. If you are going to recruit them into the armed
services you must be able to compete. That costs a lot of
money.
Things are not quite the same on the other side of the
Iron Curtain. Certainly, to equip their armed services it

costs much the same as it does here because their equipment is similar to ours, but when it comes to personnel
that is quite a different story. For instance, in the space
needed to house 20 NATO seamen in bunks, the Russians
would place 20 Russians in hammocks, which costs a lot
less money. Our ships are all air conditioned. Theirs are
not, despite the fact that they are cruising in equatorial
waters in extreme heat. But they don't need it. They are
tough. They are not competing with industry for personnel. Behind the Iron Curtain you are told to be in the
services and that is where you are. You don't argue.
Either you are there or you are nowhere.
Again in the Soviet Union the troops work in the northern regions as far north as Murmansk. They live in uninsulated barracks with virtually no heating. Could you do
that with Canadian, American, British, French or Dutch
troops? You would have a rebellion on your hands.
And what about pay? A seaman in the United States
Navy is paid about $288 a month. Do you know what his
counterpart in the Soviet Union is paid? Seven dollars a
month. A chief warrant officer in the United States Navy
receives $700 a month. His counterpart in the Soviet
Union receives $55. A captain in the United States Navy
receives $1,000 a month. A captain in the Soviet Union
receives $65 a month.
The significance of these figures is that in NATO countries 60 per cent of the total defence budget goes in salaries, pensions and costs to manpower. In Canada it is even
worse. Eighty per cent of our defence budget goes into the
costs of personnel. But in NATO, as a whole, it is 60 per
cent. On the other hand, in the east European countries, in
Russia and her satellite countries, only 20 per cent of the
total defence budget goes into salaries, pensions and so
on. You can see from that that we have little left in our
defence budget for capital expenditures in comparison to
what our potential enemies have at their disposal.
Because of the sophistication of modern weapons, the
soldier, airman or seaman of today must be either a
professional or at least an individual who is prepared to
give four or five years of his time to the services. This is so
because you cannot train men or women to use the sophisticated equipment available today in any less time than
that and still have a period of their services when they are
fully trained and are of full value to you.
Let me repeat again that the costs have been great and
they will increase, but you can only deal with a potential
enemy through strength. I think that the détente certainly
requires mutual good will, cool heads and sometimes,
perhaps, unconventional thinking, but above all it
requires patience.
* (2130)

Some of us, I think, were almost out of patience during
the negotiations concerning SALT and Berlin, but we
have seen that if we keep at it we finally make progress.
However, we must keep up our guard while these negotiations are taking place, and we must be patient. I think the
main objective of the European conference and discussions on mutual balanced force reductions is important
because we hope to be able to reach and maintain a
balance of power, but at reduced strength and reduced
cost. The thing we must all remember is that as a result of
these expenditures for NATO, and for defence purposes

472

SENATE DEBATES

generally, we have been able to maintain peace. Surely
the price we have paid for that peace is not too great when
compared to the price we would have to pay for any
alternative.
The Hon. the Speaker: This inquiry is now debated.
RULES OF THE SENATE
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS-QUESTION

Hon. Hartland de M. Molison: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask the Leader of the Government if he has
given any serious consideration to the letter I wrote to him
on June 9 last in which I suggested, because of the wide
variety of changes proposed for the consideration of the
Rules Committee, and because of the fact that any decisions reached would affect this chamber and each
individual member of it, that we should meet tomorrow in
Committee of the Whole to discuss the amendments to the
rules.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, honourable senators, I have. Senator Molson was kind enough to call me this evening at 7
o'clock. I was busy all day, and I asked Senator McDonald
if he would discuss this matter in a preliminary fashion
with Senator Molson. Senator McDonald hoped to do that,
and I believe he still hopes to do so before the end of this
day. But, as you are aware, honourable senators, Senator
McDonald had another preoccupation, which has resulted
in the vigorous and outstanding speech he made tonight.
I have given some consideration to this matter but I
have not come to a conclusion. I shall not sa'y that I am
opposed to the idea but I wonder if, in considering questions having to do with amendments to our rules, a discussion in Committee of the Whole at this stage is the most
effective way of proceeding. I have some considerable
doubts about it but, of course, I am just expressing my
own personal view. In any event, I think it will be necessary for the committee to meet and to have some preliminary discussion. My own experience of committees is that
they are usually more productive in the preliminary
stages than a general debate.
I have had an opportunity of reviewing a discussion of
the rules which took place in the Senate some years ago,
and I do not think that one could describe the record of
that debate as being anything more than confusing. I
asked some of the officials to obtain that record, and I
had hoped to be able to give it to Senator McDonald to
enable him to discuss the matter.
As I say, I have given consideration to Senator Molson's
letter. I hope there will be further discussion, and that we
will be able to decide on the wisest course to follow in
dealing with this matter.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might ask a supplementary question? When will the
Leader of the Government render a decision on this
matter in view of the fact that there is already a conflict
between the prospective date of the meeting of the Rules
Committee and another very important committee of the
Senate which will discuss the main Estimates?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, I see from
the notices of committee meetings that three meetings
have been scheduled for Thursday next. The Standing
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.j

June 13, 1972

Committee on Standing Rules and Orders, the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance, and the Standing
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs
are all scheduled to meet at 10 o'clock in the morning. I
had hoped to speak with Senator Molson to see if it is
possible to adjust this schedule so as to resolve the conflict that arises when three committees meet at the one
time.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The same situation prevails tomorrow
morning. The Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce and the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs are meeting at the
same time.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What about tomorrow night?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Let us do that.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I should like to discuss this matter
with the chairman of the Rules Committee to see if we can
agree on a date and time that will be satisfactory to all
concerned.
Hon. Mr. Molson: May I ask my honourable friend what
he means by that? Does he mean that the meeting of Rules
Committee should be postponed so that the other committees can proceed?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: No.
Hon. Mr. Moison: Then what is meant by the words
"satisfactory date"?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: What I should like to arrange is a
time when we would not have two other committees meeting, perhaps tomorrow afternoon after the house rises. I
would prefer to have that committee meet at a time when
other committees are not meeting.
Hon. Mr. Molson: My honourable friend will remember
that I tried to call a meeting last week. This committee
was the first to arrange a meeting for Thursday. It is
surprising to me that he should now want to discuss the
matter of rearranging our schedule in order to facilitate
the meetings of other committees.
All committees of the Senate have serious responsibilities-there is no argument about that-but I have tried to
point out on several occasions that the Rules Committee is
different because if a rule is changed every member of
this chamber, and every member of the staff of this chamber, is affected. A decision on something connected with
foreign policy, or with banking, trade and commerce, of
course has enormous significance and is extremely important, but it does not affect the habits and performance of
all members of this house.
The last time certain matters were referred to the Rules
Committee it spent a great deal of time considering them,
and eventually presented a report. My honourable friend
was one of those who said that he could not understand
the reasons for that report. He had not been at the meeting of the Rules Committee, and he found it difficult to
understand what was proposed in the report. I point out
that we had specifically announced the meeting of the
committee, and we had asked every senator who could
possibly attend to do so, because all honourable senators
have an interest in the deliberations of that committee.
The result was that the report presented to this chamber

.Tinp 1,

SENATE DEBATES

was referred back to the committee, and is one of the
items for discussion at its next meeting.
If that is going to happen again-and it can easily
happen for the reasons I have tried to give-then everyone
has a vested interest. It would be much simpler to agree
on suggested amendments-and I have had suggestions
from both sides of this chamber-when every senator has
expressed his opinion and, if necessary, voted on them.
However, it is extremely frustrating when the committee
goes to work, and presents a report that is not dealt with.

have an element of the unusual about them. However, in
this case, I think we will all recall this is not a new
question. As long as we are prepared to have all committees meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays, with the exception of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign
Affairs, there will be this confusion. There is no reason
why committees could not meet Tuesday morning, Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Thursday
evening, or on Friday. Senator McDonald has looked after
this matter, and I do not agree for one moment that there

CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL, 1972
REPORT OF COMMITTEE
Hon. J. Harper Prowue, Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs,
reported that the committee had considered Bill C-2, to
amend the Criminal Code and to make related arnendments to the Criminal Code 1967 Amendment Act, the
Criminal Records Act, the National Defence Act, the
Parole Act and the Visiting Forces Act, and had directed
that the bill be reported without amendment.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Keith Laird: Honourable senators, with leave, I
move third reading now.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, this bill
received a good deal of attention in committee. We had
two sittings and considered every aspect of it. Generally
speaking, I think all provisions of this omnibus bill are
acceptable to the large majority of the Senate and the
members of the committee, except one provision that I
dealt with on second reading, the amendment to section 9
of the Criminal Code dealing with the appeal from a
conviction for contempt of court committed in the face of
the court.
I want to be clear. I do not say that everyone was in
agreement with everything in this bill. In committee some
objection was taken to the idea of having to deal with an
omnibus bill involving many principles, and having only
one vote to bring into force such varied amendments as
those relating to skyjacking, the abolition of corporal
punishment, contempt of court and other matters. Honourable senators will remember what Senator Molson's
position was on corporal punishment. This morning in
committee Senator Fergusson objected to the fact that we
had to deal with this omnibus bill and had to vote for
amendments that we did not favour because we favoured
other amendments in the same bill.
* (1410)

The disagreement this morning was merely about a
provision in clause 4 which would allow an appeal from a
conviction for contempt of court committed in the face of
the court. The idea behind the present wording of the
Criminal Code is that when a contempt of court is cornmitted in the face of the court, the judge's word should be
accepted. The problem of whether or not there really was
such a contempt committed in the face of the court should
not be discussed on appeal, but only whether the sentence
imposed was too harsh and should be reduced.

The Canadian bar and the bar of Quebec have suggested to the Department of Justice to allow an appeal from
the conviction as well as from the sentence. The amendment which is embodied in this bill will do that.
As I said when we discussed this bill on second reading,
the problem is that this amendment comes at a time when
in some of our courts a systematic use of contempt of
court is being made for political purposes or, if not for
political purposes, at least to undermine the authority of
the court. I had some reservations, and I know that I am
not alone in this group, about the timing of this amendment. It seems to me that we risk seeming to support
those who abuse or who could abuse the possibility of an
appeal from the contempt of court committed in the face
of the court. I know that many members of the supreme
courts or superior courts of this country are worried
about the principle and also about the way that this problem is deaIt with in this Bill C-2.
Their main preoccupations were, first, that they would
not want to be in a position to be called as a witness
before an appeal court, especially where the contempt of
court would take the form of a gesture which could not
form part of a written record. Another point was the idea
advanced a long time ago that we really should provide
the judge, when the contempt is committed in the presence of the court, with a cooling-off period, as they say.
This would also give the accused time to reflect on his
gesture before a decision was made and sentence was
passed.
My amendment will provide machinery ensuring a cooling-off period and will provide machinery enabling the
appeal court to deal with the problem of the conviction
without having to have the judge take the stand before the
appeal court in àpposition to the accused. This is the
amendment which I proposed in committee this morning.
I will read it to you and then I will make my motion. I
hope I will not have to repeat the whole thing.
I have proposed that clause 4 of Bill C-2 be amended so
that the proposed subsection 9(1) of the Criminal Code
would read as follows:
9. (1) Where a court, judge, justice or magistrate
charges a person with a contempt of court committed
in the face of the court, he shall describe the facts
upon which he bases his charge and shall invite the
person so accused to justify his behaviour at a sitting
to take place not sooner than the following day.
(2) At any such sitting, the court, judge, justice or
magistrate shall ensure that the facts upon which the
charge is based and the justification offered are made
part of the written record, and if, in his opinion, the
person charged with the contempt failed to justify his
behaviour, he may then summarily convict such
person of the contempt.
(3) Where a person is summarily convicted for contempt of court, whether committed in the face of the
court or otherwise, and punishment is imposed in
respect thereof, that person may appeal

(a) from the conviction, or
(b) against the punishment imposed.
(4) An appeal under this section lies to the court of
appeal of the province in which the proceedings take
place, and, for the purposes of this section, the provisions of Part XVIII apply, mutatis mutandis.
(5) The hearing of such an appeal shall be given
priority by the court of appeal.
Let me summarize the results of that amendment. The
first paragraph provides for the description by the court,
the judge, justice or magistrate of the facts upon which
the charge is based. Therefore, we know exactly why the
judge considers that a contempt of court has been committed in the face of the court. We know exactly what the
problem is.
The second principle involved in paragraph (1) is that
the accused is given the opportunity to justify his behaviour. You may recail that that principle is explicitly provided for in the Civil Code of Procedure of the Province
of Quebec. And I might point out that the timing is of the
essence here, because it is provided that the justification
will be offered not sooner than the following day. That
delay of 24 hours permits the judge to cool off, if he is a
bit-how would you say it?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hot under the collar.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, hot under the collar. It also gives
time to the accused to prepare an adequate defence, if he
bas one. And I said, "not sooner than the following day."
It could also be later depending on the circumstances of
the trial and the atmosphere in which the contempt of
court took place. This period would allow the judge to
take all the circumstances into consideration before determining the date on which the accused would be called
upon to justify his behaviour.
* (1420)

The second paragraph, as has been mentioned in committee, deals more with a problem of procedure than
anything else, but I think it is a very important problem of
procedure inasmuch as it deals with this question: if there
is an appeal, on what basis will the court of appeal
decide? It is provided here that:
... the court, judge, justice or magistrate shal ensure
that the facts upon which the charge is based and the
justification offered are made part of the written
record....
There wil be a record in which the judge will say, "You
have said this" or, what is more important, "You have
acted in such a manner that I shal find you in contempt
of court if you are not able to offer an adequate
justification."
In justification, the following day or any other day, the
accused may say, "Well, I suggest that I should not be
found in contempt of court for the following reason...".
This will all be made part of the written record and then a
decision will be made by the judge or magistrate in which,
let us say, he finds the person guilty of contempt and
passes sentence. Then there arises the problem of appeal.
The person sentenced has the right to appeal from the
conviction and/or the sentence. This is the main thing that
was provided for in the bill. Now, we know that, if he

appeals, the court of appeal will be able to have a complete record and will not have to call upon the judge to
testify, or the accused, to find out what really were the
circumstances of the case in the court below before deciding whether they should quash the conviction. It would
also be very helpful, I suggest, in a case where they would
want to reduce the sentence. That is dealt with in paragraph (3).
As far as paragraph (4) is concerned, it is exactly in
accordance with the existing provision, that is to say that
an appeal is provided for in accordance with the provisions of Part XVIII.
This morning the Minister of Justice appeared before
the committee and I would say that he was not entirely
opposed to the amendment that I proposed. He suggested
that possibly it was not necessary in that it was up to the
judge not to make a decision right away so as to give the
accused time to justify his behaviour, and so on and so
forth. But the fact remains that up to now this has not
been the case very often, and I think it is essential, if a
cooling-off period is desired, that the law should provide
for it. The minister also said that he thought that in some
cases it would be useful for the judge not to have to wait
until the following day to hear the justification of the
accused. Let me say, with ail due respect to the minister,
that I do not think he was very convincing in the arguments he put forward in connection with the continuation
of the trial or the proceeding already under way. Unless
there was a problem of contempt of court on the part of
the lawyer for the defence or possibly the lawyer appearing for the Crown, I do not think that it would serve any
purpose for the judge to make a decision right away. He
might as well adjourn the matter until the following day.
To sum up the objections of the minister to this procedure, I would say he is not convincing. With regard to the
procedure whereby all facts upon which a charge is laid
should be made a part of the written record, as well as the
justification offered, the minister suggested that it was
possible for the courts or for the minister under the
powers granted to him by the Criminal Code to establish
rules. He was not entirely certain about this matter. He
offered this opinion off the cuff.
Since listening to the minister this morning I have had
occasion to discuss this matter with some senators who
are lawyers. They have doubts regarding the power of the
minister to establish such rules as would be provided by
subsection 9(2) of my amendment. There is considerable
doubt regarding the power of the minister or of the
courts, through their rules of practice, to deal with this
matter in any event. If the courts had this power, we
would have a set of rules in Quebec which would be
different from those in Ontario, the Atlantic provinces, or
the western provinces. I do not think this would be a
satisfactory situation.
Finally, as you may remember, the last paragraph provided that the appeal be given priority by the court of
appeal. An opinion was expressed that this should be
dealt with promptly, let us say within a matter of 10 days.
I agree with this suggestion, but I was not sure whether it
should have provided for a precise delay. However, this is
not the essence of the amendment. This is merely mentioned for the information of honourable senators.

476

SENATE DEBATES

As I indicated earlier, under present circumstances we
have to be very careful that we do not undermine the
authority of the courts. We have to ensure that members
of the judiciary do not interpret the legislation which we
have been invited to pass as condemnation of actions
which the courts have taken in recent cases in Quebec
when, I would suggest, anarchists who do not believe we
should retain our present democratic system have been
abusing the contempt of court provision of the Criminal
Code. I feel Parliament should make clear that it is not
siding with these anarchists and against our judges. After
all, our judicial system probably enjoys the best reputation of any system existing in the world today, at least in
any democratic country. I would suggest that the minister
has no fundamental, legal objection to this amendment.
He expressed some doubts about it. However, I think this
amendment would serve to reassure not only members of
the judiciary but the public as well that Parliament stands
on the side of our judicial system, and it supports those
who desire to maintain a peaceful, democratic society.
* (1430)

Honourable senators, I move, seconded by Senator Choquette, that this bill be not now read a third time, but that
it be referred back to the Standing Senate Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs for amendment as follows: that clause 4 of the bill be abrogated and replaced
by-I have already read this and I hope that the reading
of it again will be dispensed with.
Hon. Senators: Dispense.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Thank you.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved
by the honourable Senator Laird, seconded by the honourable Senator Carter, that this bill be now read the
third time.
In amendment, it is moved by the honourable Senator
Flynn, seconded by the honourable Senator Choquette,
that this bill be not now read a third time but that it be
referred back to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal
and Constitutional Affairs for amendment as followsHon. Mr. Flynn: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No.
Hon. Keith Laird: Honourable senators, I have a great
deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by the
Leader of the Opposition. Let us be frank about it. For
two fundamental reasons I do not accept the proposition
that we should refer this bill back to committee for
amendment. The evidence of the minister and from other
sources is that this problem, which is very real, will be
carefully considered by the Law Reform Commission
and, it is hoped, by the judges. If that is so, I consider it to
be the best manner in which to proceed.
The second fundamental reason for my not just gladly
accepting the amendment, but urging the passage of the
bill, is that some degree of urgency attaches to the problem of hijacking aircraft. It is true that one man at least
was sentenced to jail for a long period for hijacking.
However, as I pointed out originally, hijacking as such is
not provided for as an offence in the Criminal Code. The
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

June 14, 1972

Canadian Air Line Pilots Association, we were informed
this morning by Senator Goldenberg who spoke with
them, are most anxious for passage of this law. Of course,
it is in support of two conventions, in connection with
which each country participating has agreed to pass legislation of this type.
Therefore, with some reluctance I must say that I
cannot agree to the amendment and would urge this
house to reject it and to pass the bill.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I rise to
say that I entirely agree with the arguments put forward
by the Leader of the Opposition. I in my turn am not
impressed by the objection just made by the honourable
Senator Laird. It seems to me that in principle probably
every member of this house agrees with the amendment
proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. I find it very
difficult to believe that if the committee amended the bill
in the manner suggested there would be any great difficulty in getting it through the other place in jig time. I
am not impressed by this argument about hijacking. I
think the matter which Senator Flynn has raised, the
difficulties which he has raised and the importance of the
point that he has made about the support of the judiciary,
especially in the conditions which are prevailing now in
the Province of Quebec-and they may happen anywhere
else tomorrow-these points are so important that I propose to support the amendment which I hope will be put
to a vote by the Leader of the Opposition.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I had
intended to speak on this bill in committee this morning,
but I was otherwise engaged and could not attend.
There is a point in this bill which follows along the lines
developed by the Leader of the Opposition. It is the question of appeal. This is a summary conviction matter. It is
so stated in clause 4 of the bill.
The procedures for taking an appeal from a summary
conviction are specifically set out in the Criminal Code,
and notice of appeal must be served within 15 days. Time
is provided under the rules of the province for completing
the appeal, and in the ordinary way the appeal should be
completed within the following month in order to be listed
for the following month's sittings. If the appeal is not
ready, there are provisions under which one can defer it
further.
There is no provision in the bill, or in law, which would
permit that 15 days' notice of appeal to be changed. It is
statutory. I understand there was some development of
this point this morning, and the suggestion was made that
provinces have authority to make rules in connection with
criminal appeals. That is quite true, but it is in relation to
appeals from indictable offences.
In Ontario, for instance, we have criminal appeal rules
in relation to indictable offences where rules enacted by
the province, and by a convocation of judges in the province, may provide for the procedure in connection with
appeals. However, there is no such flexibility with appeals
from summary convictions.
Under this bill, an appeal from conviction for contempt
in the face of the court cannot be brought within less than
15 days, the period within which to serve notice of appeal.
If there is one type of offence which, in the interests of the

Tiii,

14 1972

SENATE DEBATES

administration of justice, needs to be deait with as
promptly as possible, it is contempt in the face of the
court. This includes boisterous behaviour, wilful miscnnduct, swearing at the judge, challenging his authority,
refusing to obey his directions. and generally creating
turmoil in the court.
I recognize that there are other things involved in contempt in the face of the court, and I do flot propose to deal
with them at this time. A witness might refuse to answer a
question, and give as his reason the explanation that it
was on the advice of his lawyer. In such a case I strongly
believe there should be a right of appeal from the conviction, because there may be some grounds upon which the
witness would be justified in taking that decision, and for
the judge to threaten him with contempt unless he
answers the question, no matter what the legal advice
may be, is, in my view, to behave improperly. There is a
judicial decision on this point. I arn addressing myseif
particulàrly to conternpt in the face of the court. We have
had some instances of this in our courts, I regret to say. 0f
course, in the United States it is almost becoming a standard form of procedure.
0

(1440)

If a trial judge records a conviction for contempt of
court and the person convicted then has 15 days within
which to file notice of appeal, the whole administration of
justice will be completely interfered with until such time
as that appeal is disposed of. In my view the issue is a
very simple one: whether or not it is a proper conviction
for contempt. It is something that does flot require any
great length of time to deal with. The notice of appeal in
those circumstances should be reduced to a very limited
period. The preparation of the necessary material could
be quickly deait with.
My submission to the Senate is that the time for filing a
notice of appeal in these cases should be very short,
perhaps five or six clear days following the date of conviction. Within two clear days after that, the judge commissioned to deal with the appeal should hear and dispose of
it. Thus the ordînary progress and administration of justice would not be interfered with.
You could have a series of contempt charges if some
person is wilfully misbehaving himself in the face of the
court simply to embarrass and to delay the procedure in
the court. The proper administration of justice, the decorum and dignity in the conduct of court proceedings, is
the responsibility of the judge. If we take away his real
authority by providing appeals from these charges, then
we will be interfering very substantially with that role. It
is something that we should seriously reflect on.
This is what I wanted to say in committee this morning,
but I did not have the opportunity as I was presiding at
another meeting. I feel strongly on that point. I agree that
there is a lot of ground for granting a right of appeal from.
a conviction of contempt in the face of the court. However, you cannot specialize and say, "There will be no
right of appeal if your conduct is boisterous and you are
wilfuily disobeying orders of the court," et cetera. So.
generally, a right of appeal is provided. The way to control the situation is to limit the time that this can continue
without there being a final disposition of the matter. I feel
the right way would be to provide a limited period of, say,

five clear days from the date of conviction for notice of
appeal. The appeal itself should be to the Chief Justice of
the trial division of whatever the province may be, or to a
judge directed by him to hear the appeal.
If this procedure were followed there would be no possibility of a notice of appeal allowing 15 days for service,
during which tîme many other instances of misbehaviour
in court could occur by people reckless enough to indulge
in that type of practice.
Having that in mmnd, I feel the matter should be further
considered by the Standing Senate Committee on Legal
and Constitutional Affairs, and therefore I support what
the Leader of the Opposition has said.

RULES 0F THE SENATE
ADVISABILITY 0F EMBODIMENT 0F CODE 0F CONDUCT
FOR SENATORS-NOTICE 0F MOTION

Hon. David A. Croil: Honourable senators, I give notice
that on Tuesday next I will move:
That the Standing Committee on Standing Rules
and Orders consider the advisability of embodying in
the Rules of the Senate the following two principles as
a code of conduct for Senators:
(1) That in any debate or proceeding of the Senate
or its committees or transactions or communications which a Senator may have with other Senators
or with Ministers, Members of the House of Commons or servants of the Crown, he shail disclose any
relevant pecuniary interest or benefit of whatever
nature, whether direct or indirect, that he may have
or may be expecting to have.
(2) That it is contrary to the usage and derogatory to
the dignity of the Senate that a Senator should bring
forward by speech or question, or advocate in this
House or among his fellow Senators any bill,
motion, matter or cause for a fee, payment, retainer
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

-June

or reward, direct or indirect, which he has received,
is receiving or expects to receive.
And that the said committee examine and report
upon ways and means of establishing an effective
parliarnentary machinery for the proper enforcement
of the foregoing code of conduct.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of
order. 1 would ask Your Honour to consider whether
paragraph (2) of this notice is not already covered by the
law. I think it is a duplication of the law, and should not
be consîdered as an amendment to the rules governing
this very matter as far as senators are concerned. It seems
to me that the matter of receiving a fee for doing anything
in the Senate is already covered by either the act concerning the Senate and the House of Commons, or some other
act.
I would ask Your Honour to look into this question. The
first paragraph may be a problem for the Rules.Committee, but I doubt that an act can be amended by this
method.
The Hon. the Speaker: I understand that the notice is
given for Tuesday next. In the meantime I shall look into
this matter.
PUBLIC SERVANTS
IMPROPRIETY 0F MAKING SPEECHES ON MATTERS 0F
POLICY-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey rose pursuant to notice:
That he will cail the attention of the Senate to the
impropriety of public servants making speeches on
matters of policy.
He said: Honourable senators, it may be thought that
the question I am raising today is one which ought not to
arise at ail, that the constitutional principles on the subject are so well understood, so unquestioned, so firmly
entrenched and so faithfully observed, that any discussion
of themn is a work of supererogation. Unfortunately, certain recent events have shown that this is not so.
By the British North America Act, our Constitution is
explicitly declared to be a constitution "similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom." One of the most
firmly established conventions of the Constitution of the
United Kingdom is that it is for ministers, not civil servants, to make public pronouncements on matters of
policy. That convention, that usage, that practice has
hitherto been generally considered to be equally well
established in our own Constitution; and indeed it is still
generally acknowledged, formally acknowledged, even by
those who break it.
The reasons for the convention are clear. If the civil
servant makes a speech or writes an article or gives an
interview, either praising or attacking existing government policy, he makes himself a partisan and bis usefulness is gone. If he makes a speech or writes an article or
gives an interview in which he propounds a new policy, he
usurps the functions of ministers and of the members of
both Houses of Pariament and involves himself at once in
political controversy, and again his usefuiness is gone; he
destroys bis usefulness.

June 14. 1972

1972

SENATE DEBATES

Exactly the same holds true of any reports which he
makes to Parliament, with certain minor exceptions,
explicitly provided for by statute, which I shall come to in
a moment.
It may be objected that I am setting forth a ridiculously
antiquated and unrealistic view of the functions of the
modern civil servant, that I would make of him a mere
rubber stamp, that I would impose on him a Trappist vow
of silence. Not at all. It is perfectly proper and, indeed,
highly desirable that public officials should make
speeches, write articles and give interviews explaining
government policy, explaining how it works, explaining
why certain difficulties arise in the course of its operation,
explaining how their department or section or branch or
division or office operates, explaining the grounds for
certain rules or practices followed in the public service
generally or in their part of it. It is equally proper and
desirable that, if need be, they should do likewise in any
reports they make to Parliament or to either house, or in
appearances before any committee of either house.
Within the last year, for example, the Clerk of the Privy
Council has delivered, first to the Institute of Public
Administration, and then to the Royal Society of Canada-a matter of about a week ago-papers on "The
Changing Role of the Privy Council Office" and on "Official Responsibility, Private Conscience and Public Information," which are models of the kind of thing that I have
in mind. Both papers give the lie to any contention that
observance of the constitutional proprieties must reduce
the speaker or writer to platitudes or innocuous generalities. But this kind of activity by public officials is worlds
away from mounting a platform, literally or figuratively,
to advocate the repeal or amendment of statutes, or the
modification or reversal of public policies.
Nor does the constitutional rule ignore or deny the part
the public servant, the permanent official, plays-indeed
must play, should play-in the formation of policy,
administrative or legislative. But again with the minor
exceptions explicitly provided for by statute, that part
should be played behind the scenes, not before the footlights or television cameras or in speeches or in the public
prints or in reports to Parliament or in evidence before
parliamentary committees.
The official has the right and the duty to tell his minister or the cabinet whatever he thinks necessary about the
shortcomings of the existing law or existing policy and to
advocate changes, even fundamental changes, in that law
or policy. But, having done so, he has exercised his right,
his sole right; he has discharged his duty. If the decision
of the minister or the cabinet, or eventually of Parliament,
goes against his conviction, and he feels he must make his
dissent public, then he must resign. Having resigned, he
can, of course, stump the country. But so long as he
remains an official he must, in public, on matters of
policy, be seen and not heard.
* (1510)

All this, of course, applies with special force to the
higher officials-and the higher the more strictly. If a
stenographer criticizes government policy or expresses
her disapproval of a law or policy or proposes changes,
the peace, order and good government of Canada is obviously not going to be very seriously disturbed. But if a

deputy minister or someone of equivalent rank does likewise, the results can be subversive.
I have twice mentioned minor statutory exceptions to
the general constitutional rule in this matter. I shall give
three.
First, the Auditor General. By the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C., 1970, F-10, section 61, he is required to
report to the House of Commons on a variety of matters
listed, ending with ".. . any other case that the Auditor

General considers should be brought to the notice of the
House of Commons." By statute, therefore, this official is
not only permitted but required to go beyond what would
ordinarily be expected in a mere auditor's report-and
this for reasons which successive parliaments, with overwhelming public support, have considered conclusive.
Second, the Chief Electoral Officer. By the Canada
Elections Act, R.S.C., 1970, First Supplement, Chapter 14,
section 59(1)(d), he is required to report to the Speaker of
the House of Commons, within ten days of the commencement of any session, on, among other things, "any amendments that, in his opinion, are desirable for the better
administration of this Act."
Once again, this official is not only permitted but
ordered to go beyond a mere recital of what his office has
done or not done, what difficulties it has encountered and
so forth; though it is noteworthy that he is to confine
himself strictly to amendments which he considers desirable for the better administration of the existing law. He
has no mandate to propose, for example, abolishing the
ballot and going back to open voting, or even, to take a
more realistic example, abolishing that recent, and in my
judgment dubious, innovation of recognizing political parties in the act.
Third, the Official Languages Commissioner. By the
Official Languages Act, R.S.C., 1970, 0-2, section 31(2) he
is empowered to conduct certain investigations; and, if an
investigation shows that an act or omission should be
referred to any department or institution for consideration or action if deemed necessary, or that any statute or
regulations thereunder should be reconsidered or any
practice should be altered or discontinued, or that any
action should be taken, he reports to the Clerk of the
Privy Council and the deputy or administrative head of
any department or institution concerned, and may make
recommendations, setting a time limit for compliance. So
far, all behind the scenes. By the same statute, however,
section 33, if, within a reasonable time, no action he considers adequate and appropriate has been taken, he is
permitted to transmit a copy of his report and the recommendations to the Governor in Council, and further permitted "to make such report to Parliament thereon as he
deems appropriate." By section 34(1) of the same act, he
must also make to Parliament, each year, a report, including his "recommendations, if any, for any proposed
changes in this Act that he deems necessary in order that
effect may be given to this Act according to its spirit and
intent."
In other words, this official is permitted to make recommendations to Parliament on particular cases, and
ordered to propose such amendments to the act as he
thinks necessary to give better effect to its spirit and
intent. Note again, however, that he must confine himself

480_

SENATE DEBATES

strictly to amendments designed to give better effect to
the purpose of the act. He has no mandate to suggest its
repeal, or its extension to languages other than English
and French, as one senator suggested in this house in 1892
in the case of Gaelic. He has no mandate to do that sort of
thing or suggest that sort of thing in his report, or to
suggest any other change of principle.
There may be other statutory exceptions to the general
rule governing what officials may say publicly by way of
advocating changes in the law or in public policy. I have
chosen these because these three officers have been singled out, by the chairman of the Public Service Commission, as being servants of Parliament-and I quote his
very words-"in exactly the same relationship" as his
commission.
Now let us look at the Public Service Employment Act,
R.S.C., 1970, P-32. Does that act contain any provisions
similar to those I have just cited from the other three? It
does not. True, section 5(e) requires the commission to
report to the Governor in Council "upon such matters
arising out of or relating to the administration or operation of this Act and the regulations as the commission
considers desirable," and that could be construed as
allowing, or even ordering, the commission to propose
changes in the act or the policy embodied in it, though I
should think not fundamental changes. But in any case
this report is only to the Governor in Council, the Cabinet;
not to Parliament. There is nothing to indicate that it is to
be made public. Presumably, the paragraph merely
makes explicit statutory provision for confidential advice
to the government; and in such confidential advice the
commission may, of course, with perfect propriety, advocate a return to unbridled political patronage, or the adoption of a quota system for entry to the public service, or
any other change, big or little, that it thinks desirable.
That the report provided for by section 5(e) is not
intended to be placed before Parliament or otherwise
made public is, to my mind, made clear from the fact that
section 45 of the act requires the commission, within five
months after the 31st day of December in each year, to
transmit to Parliament, through the minister designated
by the Governor in Council, "a report and statement of
the transactions and affairs of the commission during that
year, the nature of any action taken by it under section
6(1) or (4), and the positions and persons, if any, excluded
under section 39 from the operation of this Act and the
reasons therefor." That is all: no mention of any power,
let alone requirement, to do anything more; certainly
nothing about proposing amendments, even of a limited
kind.
Whether the report recently submitted to Parliament is
a report under section 5(e), or a report under section 45, is
not altogether clear. It is not addressed to anyone in
particular. It plunges in medias res. However, from the
facts that (a) the reports required by section 5, paragraph
(e), are not specified to be annual or required to be submitted to Parliament, and presumably are not intended
for submission to Parliament, and (b) that the published
report bears on its cover the words "Annual Report" and
begins with the heading "The year in review," it seems
plain that it is intended to be the report provided for and
required by section 45.

I now come to a very disagreeable part of what I have to
say. I am well aware that permanent officials should
ordinarily be immune to criticism in either House of Parliament. But there is a condition attached to that immunity. The late Professor MacGregor Dawson in his book
"The Civil Service of Canada," at page 203 states the
principle in these words, which he applies specifically to
the Civil Service Commission, the predecessor of the
present Public Service Commission:
TheyThat is, the commissioners.
-should be forbidden ... either by law or custom, to
speak on any controversial question ... In return for
this abstention they should be accorded full protection in Parliament against irresponsible criticism.
If members of the public service invade the field of
Parliament, then they must expect to be criticized for it.
At the outset, I wish to make it clear that there is
nothing personal in what I have to say. I barely know Mr.
Carson, and our few brief meetings have always been
pleasant. I know Mr. Lussier slightly, and have the highest
respect for him. Mrs. Johnson I do not know at all. I have
the most perfect confidence that the commission in its
report and Mr. Carson in his speech to the Public Personnel Association on June 1-of which I took care to get a
copy, telling Mr. Carson why I wanted it-had the best
intentions. I feel perfectly confident that both the commission and Mr. Carson have the best intentions. I have the
most perfect confidence that all the commissioners are
zealous and devoted public servants, actuated only by the
highest motives and desirous only of giving us the best
public service possible. But I think some of the statements
in the report and in Mr. Carson's speech are unfortunate,
to say the least, ill-advised and likely to give rise to apprehensions in the minds of a public service whose morale is
already in a delicate condition. And constitutionally their
whole tenor is grossly improper.
* (1520)

I wish now to give my reasons for using those adjectives. First, the commission's annual report. That document does not, it is true, explicitly propose changes in the
Public Service Employment Act or in the basic policy it
embodies. It does what to a great many of us, public
servants and others, is almost worse; it utters dark hints;
it raises a fog out of which come muffled detonations, and
this impression is strengthened by the chairman's speech
of June 1. The parts of the report which seem to be
objectionable all appear on page 1 and all have to do with
the alleged defects of the merit system in the Public
Service of Canada.
I wonder if the commissioners fully realize out of what
tribulations that system was born. People of my age with
any familiarity with our political history realize it only too
well. I was brought up in a civil service family whose
service goes back to 1855 and continues to this hour, and I
well remember after the election of 1911 the lively speculation in our household about how many civil servants
would be dismissed because of the Conservative victory. I
recall also a story of my grandfather's about a minor
member of the House of Commons staff who had been
accustomed during the long years of Conservative rule

June 14,1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

before 1896 to proclaim from the housetops his ardent
devotion to the Conservative Party. The morning after the
election of 1896 to the great astonishxnent of his colleagues
he was going around the corridors of the old building
trumpeting his equally ardent devotion to the Liberal
Party, and somebody said to him, "?r. so-and-so, you
have always declared you were a strong Conservative."
"That's right, but no government can change faster than I
can."1
I remember the kind of atmosphere that existed before
the Union Government of 1917 put an end to that sort of
performance, at least for the most part and for most of
the service, and I hope no one wants to go back to it.
Certainly the commission does not, nor does it in its
annual report, suggest anything of the sort. But it does
make statements that appear to cali into question the
validity of the menit system. This may be no more than an
unfortunate choice of words, but the words are there and
I amn not surprised that they have caused alarm among
members of the public service, especially as they happen
to coincide almost exactly with a speech by the chairman
which certainly is open to very disturbing interpretations.
What specificaily does the report say? First, that-and I
amn quoting here exactly, leaving out certain parenthetical
remarks which are not material-"the menit concept ...
has tended to develop a sacred cowishness of its own."
Well, to a great many ordinary readers that suggests at
least a slightly amused condescension; certainly no great
respect for the principle. The report goes on, "Tamper
with it . . ."-that is, tamper with the menit concept-".. .
suggest that it evolve to meet changing values and conditions and there are those who would see in the change a
return to less honest times." Not necessarily, but if the
commission talks about "tampering" with the principle,
about making it "evolve" to "meet changing values and
conditions," unspecified, there are certainly those who
will feel uneasy; who will fear not a return to the less
honest times of political patronage, but an evolution to
something unknown and perhaps equaily undesirable
though for other reasons: the introduction of a form of
group patronage.
The uneasiness and fears are certainiy flot likely to be
set at rest by some of the statements in the next paragraph of the report. First, this:
But the existing application of the menit system has
failed in one respect. It has not given us a representative public service.
That is a strange statement indeed and the obvious
answer is: Why should it? What is the purpose of the
public service? Is it to provide a mirror of the geographic,
provincial, regional, ethnic, linguistic, religious, class, age,
sex or other composition of the nation? Or is it to do the
public business as efficiently as possible?
The most certain way to get a "fully representative
public service," a mirror public service, would, of course,
be to have it elected by a series of communal electorates,
though some of the communities wouid overlap-the
young and the Ukrainians, for example, or the French
Canadians and the women. Perhaps there would have to
be an elaborate system of subcommunities. That would
accord with the idea of American Jacksomian democracy
although even Jackson might have jibbed at seeing his
25312-31

principles pushed quite so far. But it could give us an
overrepresentation of people whose capacity for performing the duties of public service might leave something to
be desired. A quota system applied by the Solons of the
Public Service Commission might avoid that danger.
In his evidence before a committee of the other place
the chairman has tried to get out of lis difficulties by
producing a new definition of the menit principle. He says
le and his colleagues "feel that when one talks of the
menit principle you are reaily talking about two separate
elements. One, and very important, is the fittest will get
the job, but related, and very closely related-it seems to
me that it flows through ail the language of the law-is
that the opportunity to compete wiil be spread as broadly
among ail Canadians as it can possibly be. This is just as
much an element of menit, it is just as much an element of
the merit prînciple that ail Canadians shall have equal
access."
Honourable senators, this is plain nonsense from start
to finish. It is pure Humpty Dumptyism. "When I use a
word," said Humpty Dumpty, "it means just what I
choose it to mean." Spreading the opportunity to compete,
or "'equai access" may be a good principle; but it is no
more an "element" of the menit principle than soup is an
"element" of fish. The "equal access" principle is not only
flot "closely related" to the menit principle: it is totally
unrelated, and may be in direct and flagrant conflict with
it. The "equal access" principle does not'«flow through ail
the language of the law." I defy anyone to cite so much as
one syllable in the act which has the faintest reference to
anything of the sort. The act empowers the commissioners
to do a great many things; it does not empower tlem to
revise the English dictionary to remould the meaning of
words nearer to their hearts' desire.
Now, of course, a civil service made up exclusively of
people from one area of the country, one ethnic or religious group, one province, one region, one age, one sex,
would be highly undesirable and, I may add, highly
unlikely. It wouldn't be ideal, it wouldn't be desirable and
it is not likely to happen and it is daily becoming less
likely. But it does not follow that we should scrap the
menit system for a quota system. We do flot want to see a
situation where a highly qualified applîcant for a position
in the public service is told, "Sorry: the Nova Scotia quota
(or the Alberta quota, or the Eskimo quota, or whatever it
may be) is full." Nor, of course, does the commission's
report suggest quite that. But it does seem to hint that the
menit system-and the chairman's evidence before the
committee in the other place more than hints it-that the
menit system should be modified by a hemi-demi-semiquota system; that it should be a menit system with knobs
on, or holes in it. There must, it says, be a different
"application" of the "menit concept." How different? Different in what ways?
*(1530)

The commission goes on to give some hints of what it
means. It says:
In the past the service las been domninated by Englishspeaking maies. There are indications that this dominance exercises a subtle if umintended discrimination
against other groups competing for jobs or careers in
Canada's Public Service. French-speaking Canadians

SENATE DEBATES
are under-represented, although a little less so now
than a few years ago. Women in the higher ranks are
virtually non-existent.
I wonder how the ladies, admittedly few, who are in the
higher ranks will like that? It seems to me to qualify for
what Punch used to call, "Things that might have been
expressed more happily."
The report continues:
And there have been few programs in the past to
encourage native peoples to share in the work of the
public service. A growing feeling has been that the
merit system in the past has been applied too narrowly and that equality of opportunity for these groups
has been lacking.
On this, several comments are in order. Is there anything surprising in the public service having been in the
past, or being still, though to a less degree, "dominated by
English-speaking males"? I am an ardent believer in bilingualism, in the equality of women, and in the rights of the
native peoples. The more French-speaking Canadians
there are in the public service, and in the higher ranks of
that service, the better pleased I shall be; the more women
there are in the service and in its higher ranks, the better
pleased I shall be; the more Indians and Eskimos there
are in the service and in its higher ranks, the better
pleased I shall be; always provided the people concerned
are the people best fitted, or at any rate well fitted, for the
jobs in question. But let us be honest about this thing.
First, about two-thirds of the people of this country are
English-speaking; so, even on the strictest quota principle
one would expect the public service to be something like
two-thirds English-speaking. I do not advocate that principle, but if we are going to talk about a "representative"
public service, that is one fact we shall have to face.
Second, until comparatively recently, women's education tended to be rather specialized, and in subjects or
disciplines-for example, teaching and nursing-which
did not lead very naturally to careers in the Public Service
of the Dominion.
Third, until comparatively recently, French-Canadian
education also tended to be rather specialized, and in
subjects or disciplines which, again, did not always lead
very naturally to careers in the Public Service of the
Dominion; besides a largely unilingual Ottawa, with
unfamiliar systems of education and civil law, was not
very attractive to French-speaking Canadians. I am not
saying this is the whole story; I am not saying there was
no bias, or no discrimination, however unconscious or
unintended. I am simply pointing out certain factors
which help to explain some of the things the commission
deplores.
Fourth, whether through our fault, our most grievous
fault, or otherwise, the native peoples still are not producing very many people qualified for at least the higher
posts in the public service.
Certainly, I think, most of us want to see more Frenchspeaking Canadians, more women, more Indians and
Eskimos in the public service and in the higher ranks of
that service. But surely the proper ways to bring this
about are reasonably clear.
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

June 14, 1972

First, make every possible effort to ensure that the
service, and its higher ranks, are really open to all. This
may involve changing the requirements for certain posts
to allow for the special gifts, knowledge, experience, expertise of French-speaking Canadians, or women, or Indians and Eskimos, or other groups who may appear to be
deprived of the equal opportunity which the commission
says may have been lacking.
Second, make the opportunities fully known to the various groups in question; set up special recruitment programs; go out into the highways and byways, and use all
the arts of persuasion to get qualified people from these
groups.
Third, set up special training programs for people from
these groups who may lack the specific skills or knowledge required.
Fourth, help the provinces to improve their educational
systems to qualify their people better for careers in the
Public Service of Canada. Unless something of this sort is
done, one of the unintended results of the policy of bilingualism and biculturalism may be to give us a public
service in which Quebec, New Brunswick and eastern and
northern Ontario will be heavily "overrepresented," and
from which many people in the west, and in the most
eastern provinces, will be effectively excluded.
Except for the part depending on the provinces, all this,
it seems to me, can be done without "tampering" with the
"merit concept," or at any rate without any serious "tampering." In fact, it is already being done. The report itself,
on the very same page, notes:
-the introduction of special recruitment programs
for French-speaking Canadians, of programs aimed
at improving the opportunities for female public servants, and our newly-launched Native employment
program.
And there is statutory authority for at least measures of
this sort.
First, section 10 of the Public Service Employment Act
lays down that:
Appointments to or from within the Public Service
shall be based on selection according to merit, as
determined by the Commission, and shall be made ...
by competition or by such other process of personnel
selection designed to establish the merit of candidates
as the Commission considers is in the best interests of
the Public Service.
Section 12(1) adds:
The Commission may, in determining pursuant to section 10 the basis of assessment of merit in relation to
any position or class of positions, prescribe selection
standards as to education, knowledge, experience,
language, age, residence or any other matters that, in
the opinion of the Commission, are necesary or desirable, having regard to the nature of the duties to be
performed, but any such selection standards shall not
be inconsistent with any classification standard prescribed pursuant to the Financial Administration Act
for that position or any position in that class.
That seems to me to give the commission ample power
to use the first way to get more French-speaking Canadians, women, Indians and Eskimos or any other group into

June

SENATE DEBATES

the service without "tampering" with the "merit concept."
True, it is cabin'd, cribb'd, confined by that last proviso
about the Financial Administration Act. But surely that is
not an undesirable restriction. And surely the commission
is not hinting that it is.
True, also, section 12(2) says:
The Commission, in prescribing selection standards
under subsection (1), shall not discriminate against
any person by reason of sex, race, national origin,
colour or religion.
But again, surely this restriction is not undesirable; and
again, surely the commission is not hinting that it is.
There is also, in the act, provision for certain modifications or exceptions to the application of the merit principle. Section 16(3) and section 17(4) provide for the veterans' preference and for a preference for Canadian
citizens in certain cases. Section 6(1) empowers the commission to delegate most of its powers, including its power
of selection, to deputy heads of departments; and subsection (5) empowers the deputy heads, subject to the commission's approval, to delegate in their turn. Section 39
provides:
In any case where the Commission decides that it is
not practicable nor in the best interests of the Public
Service to apply this Act or any provision thereof to
any position or person or class of positions or persons,
the Commission may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, exclude such position or person or
class of positions or persons in whole or in part from
the operation of this Act.
Section 37 makes a special provision for ministers' executive assistants, special assistants and private secretaries to
be appointed to the public service without competition,
under certain defined rules.
All that seems to me to give pretty considerable leeway
in the application of the merit principle. So I can't understand why the next paragraph in the commission's report
asks:
Is a public service that does not fullythe French word is "totalement," totally,
-represent the people it serves the best possible
public service? And if not, how can we ensure that
there is true equality of opportunity for all peoples
when it comes to being considered for appointment or
promotion in the public service?
This seems to suggest a straight quota system, which
would mean not merely "tampering" with the merit
system but overthrowing it.
* (1540)

That scares me. How can you run a modern state with a
civil service based on anything but merit? Granted, there
may have to be certain exceptions and special provisions
for special purposes or circumstances as, in fact, there are
in our legislation and policy. But merit must remain the
general rule or we shal plunge "through hideous ruin and
combustion down to bottomless perdition, there to dwell."
The Canadian state will simply collapse.
My alarm increases when I read the commission's
answer to the two questions I have just quoted. I quote
again:
25312-31½

The answer may be found in a dynamic concept of
merit, one which is able to adaptOnce again we find that disembowelling of transitive
verbs which has grown up on this continent; the commission should have said "adapt itself," of course.
-to the real conditions and the changing values of
society at large.
What precisely does that mean? "Dynamic" is one of the
most overused words in the language, and in many
instances it is used when the speaker or writer wants to
sound impressively avant-garde, and at the same time
conveniently vague. That seems to me to be the case here.
I can attach no definite meaning at all to the word. What
are the "real conditions," what are "the changing values
of society at large," to which the merit concept must be
"dynamically adapted"? This could mean almost anything. It could throw the public service wide open to the
standards of hippiedom. To be sure, the report adds at
once:
It is this philosophy that lies behind the recent introduction of special recruitment programs for French
Canadians, of programs aimed at improving the
opportunities for female public servants, and our
newly-launched native employment program.
But if that is all it is, why deck it with all this fearsome
and inflammatory verbiage, this cloud of flames? And
why add what, in the context, can scarcely fail to reawaken the fears the previous sentence might have quieted? I
quote from the report again:
It is a preoccupation we wil be increasingly facing in
the future.
Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad. The
commission, in the wild and whirling words it repeatedly
uses, risks destroying not itself but the Public Service of
Canada, which it justly describes as "top quality ... and
one which Canada and Canadians are proud of."
The introductory page of the report by itself is bad
enough. Taken in conjunction with the chairman's speech
of June 1 to the Public Personnel Association, it is much
worse. First, at page 4 of the speech we have again the
complaint that the merit system as applied since 1918 "did
not necessarily provide us with a fully representative
public service." Then on page 5 we are told that:
Last year ... only 8 per cent of the 66,000 appointments made to, or within the public service, required
French as the essential language, 80 per cent required
English as the essential language and only 9 per cent
... required bilingualism.
Well, on that there are two obvious comments. First,
that the percentages may in fact have corresponded to the
actual requirements of the positions to be filled. Second,
that if they did not so correspond, it must have been the
commission's own fault. Who else is responsible for drawing up the requirements?
Next, still on page 5, we have this:
The federal public service is equally unrepresentative of another very large section of the populationnamely, women.
Then, on page 6 it is the native peoples:
We set up a whole department to administer-

SENATE DEBATES
An obvious misprint for "minister."
-to their needs but we never specified in our selection
standards for positions in that department, that it
might be a useful qualification if one had an understanding or appreciation of the native cultures.
Well, do we have to "tamper" with the merit principle to
get some qualified women? Later in the same speech, at
pages 8 and 9, Mr. Carson says:
First, a better break for women in the Public Service. More than a year ago, the Public Service Commission set up its office of equal employment opportunities for women. This action stemmed not only from
the report of the Royal Commission on the Status of
Women, but also from what has come to be called the
Archibald Report, or "Sex in the Public Service." It
was very evident that if the discriminatory situation
exposed in both reports were to be corrected, some
drastic action would be required. Obviously, it would
be necessary to effect a change in built-in attitudesand not just those of men.
I understand that. I have encountered occasionally,
some years ago I admit, among some women with whom
this matter was being discussed an attitude which seemed
to say, "We are inferior and nobody is going to take our
inferiority away from us." I gather that Mr. Carson has
encountered something of this sort too, because he says
that built-in attitudes have to be changed-and not just
those of men. The speech continues:
-Women themselves, we discovered, had to decide
whether they wanted to break out of their ghetto and
try for the higher level jobs for which they were
qualified. We went as far as to lecture high school
guidance counsellors on the fixed patterns that were
created-often for life-first by acceptance on the
part of a girl's parents of the idea that only certain
types of work were appropriate for females and
secondly by the guidance counsellor's tacit acceptance
of the same premise.
We have been carrying on an educational campaign
among government departments, trying to get more of
the talented women already in the public service
enrolled in management training courses, such as the
Career Assignment Program. At the other end of the
scale, we started, last February, a series of three and
four-week training courses specifically for secretaries
and for the clerical group in which so many women
find themselves, to help those who want to, to break
out of the clerical ranks.
And he adds sadly:
But prejudice dies hard-no matter what kind it is.
Recently, the federal cabinet took a hand in helping us
and directed government departments to take
immediate steps to move more women into middle
and senior management positions.
Exactly. Precisely. Perfectly proper and eminently sensible. And on the native peoples, the commission's report,
at page 12, says:
In November 1971, the commission announced a special program to help resolve problems relating to the
employment of native people. The commission has
made it clear to the National Indian Brotherhood and
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

.ine'
June

14 197

to other organizations representing native people that
it welcomes the participation of Indians as members
of selection boards for positions involving the welfare
of the Indian peoples. Indians serving on the boards
do so on the understanding that they serve as
individuals with special insights rather than as representatives of an organization, and that all members of
selection boards have as their prime responsibility to
ensure that selections are made in accordance with
the merit principle.
Again, perfectly proper and eminently sensible.
And in both cases, not the slightest necessity of "tampering" with the merit principle as set forth in the existing
legislation. But if you talk about making the service "fully
representative" of either women or the native peoples,
you are going to have to raise the proportion of women
from less than 30 per cent to almost exactly 50 per cent;
and to do that in anything like short order would certainly
involve a major invasion of the merit principle. I have no
figures for the proportion of Indians or Eskimos in the
public service, but I should be surprised if the same
considerations did not apply there in miniature.
Next in the speech, at page 6, comes something much
more omnous:
And the young, whether male or female, French or
English-speaking we have viewed as merely people we
bring in to train in already well-established ways of
doing things.
Well, honourable senators, surely young entrants must,
in general, be viewed in this light? Not "merely," of
course; and if they have been viewed "merely" in this light
in the past, which I find difficult to believe, then the
commission is gravely at fault. After all, the chairman, at
least, was not appointed yesterday: he has been in office
for about seven years, and presumably is not without
influence upon his colleagues of the commission or the
higher civil servants generally.
The passage on the young which I have just quoted
should be read with another, on page 15, where Mr.
Carson makes the suggestion that:
-we (that is, the personnel group in the service) start
concerning ourselves about the need for flexibility
and freedom in our approach to this changing society.
Most of us have grudgingly accepted some of its more
superficial manifestations such as hair and clothing
styles, but I'm not sure we have embraced the more
fundamental aspects of flexibility and freedom. I
refer to personal life styles and the rejection of
authoritarianism-including the right to dissent on
policy issues.
0 (1550)

Now, wait a minute: the right to dissent privately in
discussions with the minister or the government; yes, certainly; and this right exists now, and has always existed,
and surely has been exercised, times without number. The
Clerk of the Privy Council, who is not without experience
and knowledge of the subject, in his recent paper to the
Royal Society of Canada, said:
Generally the development of the factors to be
taken into account by the cabinet in considering a
particular problem, the assessment of the advantages

and disadvantages of various policy options, and the
selection of the recommended course of action will
have taken place at the official level. The document
will have been prepared by officials. The sponsoring
minister may have made a personal contribution to
the paper as it emerges for transmission to the cabinet: in some cases, indeed, the argument and recommendation may be very much his own. But normally
the official contribution will be very large and may be
total except for the minister's final approval and
signature.
Of course, that carries with it the idea that the submissions which have been made may be rejected, and the
officials know perfectly wel that they may remonstrate
with the minister and urge upon him the desirability of a
different course of action. They can dissent in private
until they are as old as Methuselah, or until an earlier date
when they are required to retire by statute.
So if Mr. Carson means the right to dissent privately, to
the minister or the cabinet, he is banging at a door that
has been wide open these many years. But if he means a
right to dissent publicly, that is a very different matter.
That right has not existed, does not exist, and should not
exist, for reasons I have already stated, reasons admirably set forth by the Clerk of the Privy Council in the
same paper from which I have just quoted. Speaking of
the notion that cabinet documents prepared by officials
should be published, he said:
The cabinet, when it discusses a recommendation,
may have perfectly sound reasons for varying it or for
rejecting it. Ministers may perceive considerations of
broad policy or public acceptability of which the officials were not aware, or they may give weight to one
factor or another quite different from that given by
the officials. If cabinet documents were published, it
would be readily apparent in many cases where official advice had been rejected or departed from and
where, perhaps, warnings as to the disadvantages of
the course decided upon had been overborne. It has
always been recognized as fundamental to the principle of ministerial responsibility for policy that confidentiality be maintained about advice received from
officials. It is the ministers who decide: the policy is
theirs. It does not matter whether it was devised by
officials, or whether they argued for it or against it.
The principle would not last long, nor would the
anonymity of the public service, if cabinet documents
became publishable without some prescribed and substantial delay.
Further he adds:
In a context of values in which established authority
and procedures are more to be rejected than respected, and in which government tends to be seen more as
a threat to the individual than as his means of acting
for shared needs and purposes, it is not surprising
that many, even in the service of government, give
scant weight to any arguments about confidentiality
or secrecy. This is especially so if an individual has a
deep emotional or intellectual attachment to a particular line of policy he may have helped to develop, or
from which he hopes to see benefit for some element
of the population or some cause that he thinks deserv-

ing. Rejection of secrecy as essentially wrong, scepticism about established authority and impatience with
the slowness of government processes for decision
can readily lead to the conviction that revealing a
document may be the best way to force the hand of
government and to foil the plots of those who are
thought to be frustrating desirable action.
Exactly the same applies and for exactly the same reasons
to public expressions of dissent from government policy
by public officials.
Finally, in the very last sentence of the paper, the Clerk
said:
If we believe that representative and responsible government is the best way we have so far been able to
work out to provide a degree of participation that is
consistent with effective action and to give expression
and reality to the general will in determination of the
interests and wishes of the people as a whole, we
cannot accept as permissible a liberty by those in the
service of the state to place their personal convictions
about policy, or about the public right to know ahead
of their official responsibility.
Well, as James Russell Lowell said, "There you have it
plain and flat."
But Mr. Carson is apparently blissfully unaware of
these principles, or of the long historical experience on
which they rest. For he goes blithely on, at page 15 of his
speech:
Most of my generation came to the public service in a
different era, when the traditions of anonymity and
obscurity were still revered.
I may interject here that in some quarters those traditions still are revered, and by at least one person who had
considerable experience of them, and who is usually supposed to have some brains. Listen to this, honourable
senators, from the present Secretary of State for External
Affairs. I quote from Bureaucracy in Canadian Government, Selected Readings, edited by W. D. K. Kernaghan,
at pages 82 and 83. Mr. Sharp says:
I found a civil service career to be far from dull and
humdrum. Those 16 years were full of stimulating
experiences and highly exciting activities ... I made
the choice to remain in Ottawa and I have never
regretted it.
This was written at a time when he had left the service
and had not gone into active politics. He goes on:
The main reason for that decision was one man-the
late Clifford Clark, Deputy Minister of Finance. The
contribution of this man to the Canadian nation will
never be fully appreciated, because the story can
never be fully told of his influence upon the course of
events. Being a civil servant, he worked anonymously,
in the background, his views and his actions finding
their expression in official utterances of ministers and
in the statutes approved by Parliament. Nor would he
have wished it otherwise and he inculcated into ail of
us his ideal of the good civil servant.
But to Mr. Carson this is anathema. His speech goes on:
To a new generation of potential bureaucrats raised
on participatory democracy, our Spartan silence
andlor timidity seems like an abdication of freedom.

SENATE DEBATES
"Spartan silence!" Has Mr. Carson been deafened by his
own voice? "Timidity!" Has he read his own report or his
own speeches, a report and speeches which rush in where
angels might fear to tread? I have sometimes thought that
one of the best things the government could do would be
to put in next year's Estimates an item for a green baize
bag to be fitted firmly down over the head of Mr. Carson.
If Mr. Carson really means that members of the public
service should have the right to dissent publicly on matters of policy, then he is proposing something which
strikes at the very foundations of the whole system of
responsible cabinet government: as subversive as anything that the wildest revolutionary in his wildest
moments ever dreamed of. The end of that road is
anarchy.
There is one other feature of Mr. Carson's speech
which, though it pales almost into insignificance by comparison with what I have just been speaking of, is, in the
short run, likely to be even more destructive of good
government. That is the passages, on pages 13, 14 and 15,
in which he sets out the "totally new set of demands in
terms of the way in which work is structured and performed," and then proceeds to cast aspersions on the
present members of the public service, wholesale. Just
listen to this, honourable senators. Remember this is from
the official text of the speech sent to me by Mr. Carson
himself. I am not relying on some reporter's version of the
thing, which may highlight certain things, quote them out
of context, or, for brevity's sake, leave out certain things.
Just listen:
* (1600)

Increasingly, the emphasis is going to be on relevance,
integrity, flexibility and freedom.
I pause there to ask what is meant by "relevance,"
another of those blessed and blessedly vague, high-sounding words by which so many people now muddy the
waters or cover their tracks. "Relevance" to what? As far
as I can make out from what follows, "relevance" here
signifies, and I quote Mr. Carson's words, "meaningful
work." But this is not very enlightening; in fact, it leaves
me, at least, completely in the dark.
However, to resume:
ThisThat is, relevance, integrity, flexibility and freedom, and I
am quoting ipsissimaverba.
-is going to be the new morality in the world of work.
Mr. Carson then goes on to "emphasize"-his own wordthat he is "talking about the embryo administrator and/or
young professional," and asking, "how do we cope with
the changing needs and profile of the budding young
bureaucrat"-not, observe, with the needs of the public or
its service. Mr. Carson has, quite simply, got his values
upside down. Perhaps someone should read to him the
celebrated letter in which an Englishman, remonstrating
with a government official, wound up, "You have the
honour to be, Sir, my obedient servant."
Having "emphasized" that he is talking "about the
embryo administrator and/or young professional," Mr.
Carson then proceeds to cast aspersions on pretty well the
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.

June 14, 1972

whole of the higher ranks of the public service. Listen to
this:
My first suggestion is to start caring about the relevance of work. Based on what I hear from our
administrative trainees and from the career-oriented
summer employees who come to Ottawa, I sometimes
wonder whether our middle-aged managers haven't
forgotten what a thrill it is to do meaningful work and
what a colossal drag it is to fill in time.
The evidence for this slur is, of course, beyond reproach,
beyond even question: it comes from the infallible, the
omniscient, young. Roma locuta est.
Mr. Carson goes on:
Let's not delude ourselves with thinking that tomorrow's potential bureaucrat can be bought off with a
pay cheque in lieu of meaningful work. This only
creates cynics and/or time servers-and all our public
services have enough of these.
How to win friends and influence people in the public
service!
In his next paragraph, Mr. Carson casts his net even
wider:
My second suggestion is to startNote, "start;" nobody has done this before.
-caring about integrity in the work setting in a way
that is meaningful to our young recruits. I'm not suggesting for a minute that public servants ever intentionally steal from the public troughAt this point, present members of the public service will
no doubt exclaim with Florence Nightingale when she
received the Order of Merit, "Too kind! Too kind!"
I'm not suggesting for a minute that public servants
ever intentionally steal from the public trough nor
that they deliberately lie.
The public service steps forward to take a modest bow.
The speech proceeds:
However, to the extent that we mislead or conceal,
obfuscate issues, waste the time and/or manhoursI like that distinction between "the time" and "manhours;" reminiscent of the Anglican Prayer Book's distinction between "quires, and places where they sing;"
and I stand in awe of the man who can waste both time
and manhours.
-waste the time and/or manhours of our subordinates, we inevitably tarnish our reputation for integrity-and thereby, turn off the more earnest of our
students.
And then comes the gem of the collection (finis coronat
opus), the immortal phrase already graven on the hearts
of thousands of public servants:
We have only ourselves to blame if it is the corruptible
slobs who stay on.
Reading that, I understand why the Public Service Commission is no longer called "civil."
Upon what meat doth this our Carson feed, that he is
grown so great? For observe, honourable senators, the
"quiet revolution" which he proposes-a revolution in the
definition of "merit," and, therefore in the very basis of

DEBATES

the public service, a revolution in the fundamental rules
of conduct for public servants-this revolution is to be
accomplished not by a change in the law, not by the action
of the Parliament or the will of the people, but by a
revival, in Mr. Carson's person, of that "dispensing power," the power to set aside the law, which cost James the
Second his throne, and which we thought had been banished forever by the English revolution of 1688, of which
we are the lawful and undoubted heirs.
[Translation]
Hon. Renaude Lapointe: Honourable senators, my reply
will be very brief. I should like to say that I regret to differ
with my honourable colleague. I consider Mr. Carson to
be one of the bravest civil servants who has ever existed
and if he spoke a little out of turn, and allowed a few
unfortunate utterances to escape him, I believe it was in
reply to a group of fanatics. Mr. Carson's purpose is to
introduce a little more justice in the public service, and he
is performing this duty admirably.
In my opinion, his new definition of merit, whereby
bilingualism is considered as an element of merit, is quite
valid. I believe the Prime Minister also shares his opinion.
If he is dissatisfied with Mr. Carson, it is his privilege to
dismiss him and the fact that Mr. Carson is still in tenure
leads me to believe that the Prime Minister is in perfect
agreement with the policies he seeks to establish.

NATIONAL GALLERY
ACQUISITION OF SCULPTURE-QUESTION
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, may I ask
the Leader of the Government whether he has seen the
latest acquisition to the National Gallery? I think a photograph appeared in the Ottawa Journal of May 12 last. It
exceeds anything that I have yet discovered that even the
talented Director of the Gallery has been able to pick up
from the rubbish heaps. It is another product of the fibreglass factory at West Lorne, apparently. Has he seen this
thing which is called "Klonos," "violent and confused
motion," which is to be exhibited in Venice and then
brought back to be exhibited here, let us hope indoors.
Can he give us any information about the cost of this
masterpiece?
a (1610)

I said the other day that we are told it is not policy to
provide information of the cost of things that are bought
by the National Gallery. I should like an answer from -fle
Leader of the Government as to why it is not policy. This
money that is being spent for this rubbish-because really
this thing is nothing but a collection of things such as you
could pick up from any garbage heap in any city in any
part of the country, if you used about 10 minutes of your
time-is paid by the people of Canada; it comes out of the
income tax of everybody in this house, and everybody out
of this house who pays income tax.
Why in the world should we be denied information
about the cost of these things? I think it is a public
outrage, and I should like to get from the Leader of the
Government, after his mature consideration and deliberation, and consultation with his colleagues, the reason for
this extraordinary practice of secrecy in this particular
matter. I do not know whether it is supposed it will endanger national security or whether it will endanger our
relations with Maoist China or the Soviet Union, or what.
Surely there must be some explanation for this concealment of the cost of this trash that is being foisted upon the
public, and, worst of all, exhibited to the world in foreign
countries as an example of "Canadian art."
I hope I can get an answer, a straight answer and a
complete answer, in due course from the Leader of the
Government.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: From an expert.

He said: Honourable senators, the purpose behind this
motion is to register the Senate's concern regarding the
kind of disaster that has recently happened at Cherry
Point in the United States, with its dire consequences to
the coastîine of Canada, and to recommend certain action.
1 might say that this motion is in the same terms as a
motion that was unanimousîy passed by the House of
Commons on Friday îast. That house did the right thing in
passing that motion, and the Senate would also be doing a
useful thing by passing the same motion to show that the
Parliament of Canada is speaking with one voice to the
Government of the United States, to the United States
administration and, yes, to the people of the United
States, in asking that action be taken to protect our
Canadian environment.
This spill on June 4 at the Cherry Point refinery just a
few miles away from British Columbia consisted of some
12,000 gallons of oùl. Some damage was done. Senator van
Roggen, who seconded tis motion, will be givmng some
indication to the Senate of precisely what has happened in
British Columbia and the reaction of its people. The spill,
only a few thousand gallons, is merely an indication of

SENATE DEBATES
SENAE DEATE
what might happen if there were a serious disaster such
as the breaking up of one of the large oil tankers.
In the last war oil tankers were of a size of some 16,000
tons. Today they are being constructed, and are on the
oceans, in sizes up to 300,000 tons. A major disaster
caused by a spill from one of these huge tankers could
result in not 12,000 gallons of oil being discharged but
anywhere up to 2.35 million gallons.
While we are following the House of Commons in presenting this motion, the Senate is not a Johnny-come-lately so far as taking a position on this particular question is
concerned. Last year the House of Commons had a oneday debate on March 15 discussing a resolution opposing
the Trans-Alaska pipeline. There was no formal conclusion. It is obvious from the debate that the Commons was
opposed to the Alaskan pipeline system.
Following that debate I had the honour to move in the
Senate a motion, seconded by Senator John Macdonald,
on April 1 in these terms:
That this house opposes the Trans-Alaska pipeline
and tanker project and urges the government to proceed with the various economical and ecological feasibility studies of alternate routes and to report from
time to time upon the most appropriate steps that in
the government's opinion may from time to time be
taken to accomplish the prudent and efficient transportation of northern oil and gas.
Following the presentation of that motion there was a
considerable debate in the Senate, and the terms of the
motion were referred to a Senate committee. One of the
witnesses invited to appear before that committee was
David Anderson, Member of Parliament for EsquimaltSaanich, who was doing then and is still doing a marvellous job in promoting policies to protect Canada's environment. He gave us some very useful information and
made an excellent presentation. Following that presentation a report of the committee was made to the Senate,
and the Senate passed this motion by way of approval of
the report on June 29, 1971. So, honourable senators, the
Senate has taken a stand in the past and I am confident it
will take a similar stand at this time.
This is a very, very difficult problem for Canada as it is
a very serious problem for the United States. That country wants to move its oil from Alaska by pipeline to the
Port of Valdez and then by tanker down to the Cherry
Point refinery and other refineries situated along the west
coast. Those who understand the straits between Vancouver Island and the mainland, and who understand the
problems of navigating the seas west of Vancouver Island,
are absolutely convinced that if this project is proceeded
with and oil is taken by tanker down Canada's west coast,
at some time there is going to be an extremely serious
disaster that will cause untold damage to Canada's west
coast and to Canada's environment.
Therefore the Canadian government and the Canadian
people have been pressing upon the United States the
need to consider an alternate route to protect our environment. Feasibility studies with regard to a pipeline are
nearing completion. We see in this morning's newspaper
that there is to be a consortium of oil and gas pipeline
companies and other companies prepared to proceed at
an early date with the construction of a gas pipeline down
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

June 15 1972
Jun 15.197

the Mackenzie. There is every inference and every possibility that they will soon announce that they would also be
prepared to construct a pipeline to carry oil. The spill was
at Cherry Point in the United States, but a great deal of
the damage was done to Canada's coast. When a refinery
was constructed at Cherry Point some years ago, there
was no talk of a Trans-Alaska pipeline; the oil going to
that refinery was going through Canadian pipelines by
way of an inland route. We have said to the United States
that we are prepared to supply oil to the Cherry Point
refinery by an inland pipeline which would ensure that
the kind of disaster which took place on June 4-or an
even greater one-would not be repeated. However, our
representations so far appear to have fallen on deaf ears.
This is not a matter of one political party taking a stand.
This is a matter where members of all political parties in
both Houses of Parliament have taken a stand.
a

(1420)

It is clear from the Debates of the House of Commons
that the members are united in this matter. Prime Minister Trudeau pointed out the dangers of the Trans-Alaska
pipeline to President Nixon when he was in Ottawa in
April, and he asked that consideration be given to an
inland pipeline. Three Canadian cabinet ministers, the
Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, Mr. Macdonald;
the Minister of the Environment, Mr. Davis, and the
Secretary of State for External Affairs, Mr. Sharp, met
with Secretary Rogers during that same period to impress
upon him the dangers to Canada if the United States
should proceed with the Trans-Alaska pipeline system.
The House of Commons took further action on May 15
and set a precedent by passing unanimously and without
debate a motion dealing with external affairs. This motion
appears on page 2245 of the House of Commons Hansard,
as follows:
That this house herewith declares that the movement of oil by tanker along the coast of British
Columbia from Valdez in Alaska to Cherry Point in
Washington is inimical to Canadian interests, especially those of an environmental nature,
And further, that this resolution be forthwith transmitted to the Government of the United States of
America in order that that government be apprised of
the concern that the House of Commons of Canada
has about the proposed movement of oil.
The Secretary of State for External Affairs had this
motion delivered to United States authorities the following day.
As I indicated, last Friday the House of Commons
passed, in identical terms, the motion which is now before
the Senate. I hope that the Government of the United
States will listen. What more can we do when the Prime
Minister makes his position clear, the cabinet ministers
follow through, the House of Commons and the Senate
follow through, and public administration opposes the
events which are occurring? On May 12 the administration in the United States announced that they were prepared to proceed with the Trans-Alaska pipeline system. I
do not think this is as discouraging as it looks, because
there are powerful organizations within the United States
which are opposed to this pipeline system as well. They

June 15, 1972
June 15, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

are voicing their opinions, and I think the fight within the
United States has by no means ended.
The Government of Canada has done its best. The
House of Commons has passed resolutions. The next
thing that might be done would be for a delegation of
members of Parliament and senators to go to Washington
to impress upon the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate the great fear that Canada has of the
possible danger to Canada of the Trans-Alaska pipeline
system. By so doing they would strengthen those forces in
the United States which are opposed to this pipeline
system. We might have a powerful ally in Senator McGovern. We might have a powerful ally in Senator Humphrey.
There is a Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group, of which distinguished members of the Senate are
members. That is a forum where the Canadian position
can be delivered most forcefully and, in my opinion, with
important effect.
I suggest that the matter we are now considering is
important, constructive and something that the Senate
can and should do as quickly as we can come to a decision. Our action might just have sufficient effect to make
the difference in the United States decision.
When we took a position with regard to this in the
Senate last June and passed a motion unanimously, it
seemed to be almost totally disregarded by the news
media of this country. Sometimes I do not think they
really know what news is. I should think that a motion
passed unanimously by the Senate of Canada regarding
such an important question would be worthy of widespread publicity in Canada and the United States. I suggest that the prestige of the Senate of Canada, added to
that of the House of Commons and the Government of
Canada, will have an important bearing on future development. I am confident that in the long run the TransAlaska pipeline system will not go forward as is now
projected and that the environnent of Canada will in fact
be protected in the years ahead.
Hon. George van Roggen: Honourable senators, it gives
me particular pleasure, as a British Columbian, to second
this motion of Senator Argue. The motion passed in the
other place last week was put forward by another British
Columbian, the member for Fraser Valley East. In the
course of the debate in the other place the motion was
amended, the last few lines of the motion we now have
before us being proposed by the member for Yukon.
If I may interject a personal note, this takes me back, as
the member for Yukon was my partner when I practised
there many years ago. While we were partners at law, we
were not partisan partners. This support of his, in the
amendment which was included in the unanimously
adopted motion in the other place, indicates the non-partisan nature of this motion. It was treated in a non-partisan
fashion in the other place, and I know that it will be so
treated here.
* (1430)

The wording of the motion which particularly impresses
me is the reference to the movement of oil in various
waters. I ask honourable senators to take particular note
of the words, "in te narrow waters of the Straits of Juan
de Fuca, Georgia Strait and Puget Sound".
25312-32

Honourable senators who have had the privilege of
visiting the west coast have an idea of the magnificent
area encompassed by these waters. They are confined
waters. It is not the open ocean. The area is dotted with a
myriad of islands. The span of water between the islands
is often not more than a few hundred yards, sometimes a
mile. The widest point is probably not 25 miles. It is an
area where the forces of nature cannot be relied upon to
handle major oil spills. They cannot be entirely disposed
of by nature in these narrow waters and the oil, washing
up on the beaches and shores, can do irreparable and
inconceivable damage.
Fortunately, the experiences of the past have served as
warnings. There have been small spills. The spill which
occurred the other day at Cherry Point amounted to
between 4,000 and 12,000 gallons, an infinitesimal amount
in view of the fact that tankers of 200,000 tons are to ply
between these islands. About five or six years ago a small
barge being towed by a tug sank in Howe Sound in
Georgia Strait. A few tons of oil seeped from that barge,
desecrating the beaches and affecting many hundreds of
summer cottages in the area. It was two or three years
before those beaches were again fit for use.
I referred particularly to the words "narrow waters" in
the motion, as the motion makes no reference to transportation of oil on the high seas or out in the Pacific. It is
unfortunate in one sense that so much of the discussion
concerning the movement of oil has been related to the
building of TAPS, a pipeline across Alaska. That pipeline
has not yet been built. There is no movement of oil from
Alaska to the Cherry Point refinery. The oil comes from
Venezuela and elsewhere. I would not wish to say to the
Americans that they must not carry their oil on the high
seas 100 miles off our coastline from Alaska to California
but what we object to is the transportation of oil in huge
tankers in these narrow confined waters which we share
as a common heritage with our friends in Washington
State.
The Cherry Point refinery is the second refinery built at
that location. The older refinery has been supplied for
many years with Canadian oil from Alberta by means of
the Trans-Mountain Oil Pipeline. The new Cherry Point
refinery was obviously built by Atlantic Richfield in
anticipation of Prudhoe Bay oil. It has been made clear by
the Government of Canada that this refinery need not be
discarded or dismantled but that it can be supplied oil
from Canada via pipeline. They need not wait for the
building of an oil pipeline down the Mackenzie-which as
Senator Argue has pointed out will inevitably comebecause there is ample oil in Alberta and an existing
pipeline to supply that refinery without their bringing oil
through these narrow waters.
So our objective is not to have Alaskan oil come to
Cherry Point, and to keep oil from any source from being
carried through these narrow waters in huge tankers. I
might say that the tankers now being built to transport
Alaskan oil to Cherry Point range in size up to 200,000
tons. When you think of the damage caused by the escapement of a few thousand gallons of oil, your mind boggles
at the havoc that would be wrought by an accident involving one of these huge tankers. This must be prevented,
and to this end every bit of weight must be added to that

SENATE DEBATES
of the Senate, the House of Commons, and the Government of Canada.
It bas already been said by such men as Jacques Cousteau and Thor Heyerdahl that man is killing the oceans.
Well, if man can possibly kill the oceans-and we all know
now he can kill one of the Great Lakes-it would certainly
be a simple matter for him to kill the confined island-dotted waters of a small recreational paradise such as the
Strait of Georgia. It would be insane to bring these tankers into these waters, and it is essential that the Government of Canada press the United States in every manner
possible to stop this proposed movement of oil. I would
think there is no better place to start than by persuading
the United States to have this matter referred to the
International Joint Commission, as Senator Argue's
motion suggests. Honourable senators, it gives me great
pleasure to second his motion.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I am certainly not an expert on pollution nor on the problems
created by the movement of oil from Alaska to the State
of Washington. Senator Argue, however, in the course of
his very interesting discussion, and Senator van Roggen
also, referred to the fact that the Canada-United States
Interparliamentary Group might consider this problem
and be an instrument for applying pressure on the American government.
Last February when these parliamentarians met here
and at Montebello, this question was raised but it was not
dealt with in any definitive way. However, I think it is
wise to inform the Senate that the cards are not all in one
hand in this case. On the occasion of the February meeting we were informed that Canada is not without blame in
respect of oil pollution at sea. We were told that some
Canadian flag ships which are moving oil are not
equipped to do so and are the cause of considerable
pollution. This particularly happens off the east coast of
the United States and, perhaps, off our own east coast.
Apparently all the bad guys are not in the United States
when it comes to the movement of oil. Perhaps what
applies to Canadian ships may apply to ships of other flag
registries as well.
* (1440)

Hon. Mr. Molson: Will my honourable friend permit a
question? I understood that we had no Canadian flag
ships left which could be committing the offence he has
just mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I was rather afraid I
would get a technical question like that. The answer must
be that I do not know, but this is what was said in the
discussion we had with the American legislators last February. Perhaps they spoke of ships on Canadian charter.
In connection with the movement of oil from Alaska,
one point specifically emphasized was that the new ships
to be used on that run will have the very latest equipment.
The chances of spill will be minimal. Ship movements will
be controlled carefully with the aid of computers, and
there will be air cover and ample warning of adverse
weather conditions. Perhaps this is no assurance that
there will not be monumental spills. But I think the Senate
should be alerted to the fact that there is an argument
made by responsible people to the effect that all of this
proposal is not bad. We all want to be extremely fair that
[Hon. Mr. Roggen.]

June 15, 1972

in approaching this problem both sides of the case are
thoroughly aired, and I am sure this could be done by the
International Joint Commission.
Senator van Roggen also said, for example, that nobody
would object if American tankers were going to move
between Alaska and a refinery on the American mainland
farther south, 100 miles out at sea. This may be the
answer. Perhaps instead of going to a port close to the
existing refinery it might be possible for these tankers to
go to a port farther away and have the ou from Alaska
piped into the Cherry Point refinery, which I understand
bas recently been enlarged, if it has not only recently been
installed.
I rise only because I thought it would be of interest to
Senator Argue and other honourable senators to know
that there had been at least a cursory discussion of the
very problem that is the subject matter of this motion at
the last meeting of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group.
Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, I should
like to support this motion, and I propose to do so very
briefly.
Senator Connolly suggested that Canadian flag shipswhatever they may be-are leaking oil as they sail by the
east coast of the United States. I presume he is referring
to ships transporting oil from Venezuela to Montreal or
other refineries on our east coast-ships bringing offshore oil to Canada.
Our oil-producing companies in Alberta are cut back on
a pro-rata basis to the point where they are producing 40
per cent of what is considered to be their safe geological
productive capacity. In other words, we have deliberately
cut back in order to keep an orderly market. That might
open up another matter for discussion, but the fact is that
we have in western Canada today sufficient oil to supply
all of Canada. That is one point.
The second point is that the oil companies have discovered oil in Prudhoe Bay for which they can reasonably
expect a market. If they start bringing it into Cherry Point
one-third of the export market for Canadian oil will be
lost; it will be replaced by ou from TAPS. That may or
may not be of benefit to the Americans, but there is no
way in which it can be interpreted as being of benefit to
Canadians-in either having people explore for oil, or
having people who have already discovered it look for a
reasonable return on their investment.
I have another suggestion to make. I will not put it in the
form of an amendment to the motion; I offer it merely as
a suggestion. In the last Canadian-Japanese Trade Council publication, which we all get, it was pointed out that
the Japanese at the present time have a balance of just
under $14 billion of American money. In other words, in
their sales around the world they have collected 14 billion
American dollars which they are not spending on American products. There is a simple solution to this. Japan is a
country that is in need of energy, which is synonymous
with oil. Let those tankers with dead weights of 200,000,
300,000, and now 400,000 tons transport that oil from
Valdez to Tokyo. All of those tankers transporting all of
the production from Prudhoe Bay would still not be able
to meet the needs of the Japanese energy market.

SENATE DEBATES

The transportation of that oil across the Pacific to
Japan would provide two benefits. First, the Canadian
environment would not be interfered with. Secondly, by
purchasing this oil the Japanese might be helping the
Americans out of their difficult economic position, for
which every one of us in the western world has to pay
today.
Honourable senators, I simply offer those suggestions.
That is all I have to say. I hope the motion will pass, and
that somebody in a position to do something will at least
consider carefully the suggestions I have made.
Hon. Guy William.: Honourable senators, I have seen
the spill. I live only a few miles from it. You have no idea
of the condition that these oil spills leave a beach in. It
may be somewhat fortunate that the sea birds and the
fowl have already migrated in great numbers out of the
area. You may not have read of the bird death rate caused
by this spill, but it is high. Other forms of life on these
beaches, which are fed on by other and larger fish, no
longer exist. It interests me to hear the reference to
narrow waters. The motion should have gone beyond that
and said "narrow waters and treacherous tidal currents,"
which at times make navigation of the large and heavy
tonnage ships difficult.
a (1450)

Honourable senators, I speak in support of this motion.
You would have to see that spill to know the extent of the
damage that a major oil spill will cause to the entire coast
of British Columbia.
Motion agreed to.
CANADIAN FILM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE STUDY OF ADMINISTRATION
AND OPERATIONS BY HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Renaude Lapointe moved pursuant to notice:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to examine and report
upon the administration and operation of the Canadian Film Development Corporation.
[Translation]
She said: Honourable senators, the subject with which I
am going to deal is entirely different from the previous
one. The Canadian Film Development Corporation has
been in existence five years. Most of my honourable colleagues wil recall that when this legislation was discussed
here in the Senate, the principle of the bill was approved
by all senators. However, during the debate, a few speakers expressed some concern as to how the $10 million
allocated to the corporation would be administered.
When going through reports of this debate held on
March 2, 1967, I noted that the sponsor of the bill had
suggested that the new corporation be given the time to
get organized, adding that after a few years of operation,
a Senate committee should examine and analyze its
performance.
On two occasions, in June 1970 and May 1971, the Standing Committee on Broadcasting, Films and Assistance to
the Arts, in the other place, invited the Chairman, Mr.

Gratien Gelinas, and the Executive Director, Mr. Michael
Spencer, to give evidence and account for the activities of
the corporation.
As five years have gone by since the corporation was set
up, I suggest that it might be useful for the Senate to
examine the administrative procedure and the activities
of the said corporation and also to provide an opportunity
for all persons interested in the Canadian film industry to
appear before a Senate committee to express their views
on the efficiency or inefficiency of the Canadian Film
Development Corporation. We could thus know whether it
is in a position to reach the goals that warranted its
establishment. Would it not also be useful to hear from
those people their ideas and suggestions to improve the
operations of that corporation?
Upon her appearance before the Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce, on March 2, 1967, the
then Secretary of State, the Honourable Judy LaMarsh,
stated that before the passage of the legislation creating
that corporation, Canada was, along with the United
States, one of the few developed countries that did not
provide any financial help to the film industry for the
production of feature films.
Three years later, upon the second appearance of
Messrs. Gélinas and Spencer before the Standing Committee on Broadcasting, Films and Assistance to the Arts,
on May 6, 1971, the chairman, Mr. Gélinas, pointed out
that the corporation's first preoccupation was to find a
good script, which would allow them to make a good
movie, and to find producers of a higher level which,
according to him, was not easy. The executive director,
Mr. Spencer, added the following:
One thing we did not know when we began, which we
have discovered, is that you can have a feature film
industry in the correct sense of the term; namely, an
industry which earns a certain amount of money and
is reasonably self-supporting. However, it is very clear
that if you want to have an industry which also produces films of international acceptability, you have to
raise the standard of the writers, the performers and
the directors.
The third problem, he pointed out, was the problem of
distribution of films throughout English Canada, on
account of the influence of the American industry on
English-speaking Canadians, and the problem concerning
the control of movie theatres by American corporations.
While stating that fact, Mr. Spencer went on to say:
So I think we are arriving at the point of trying to
decide whether we should take an action which might
be, for instance, that the corporation would own some
theatres or we should go to the government and say
that we think we should own some theatres because
we think if we did we would get a better show of
Canadian pictures than the present film industry provides. This is a possibility which we have considered.
The suggestion was also made to impose quotas for
Canadian films to movie theatres in this country. And not
long ago the Czech director, Jiri Weiss, while visiting
Toronto, as a member of a jury on Canadian films, strongly recommended the imposition of such a quota. In his
view, that is the only way the domestic film industry can
survive in some small European countries.

SENATE DEBATES
On the French side, the distribution problem is much
less acute. Canadian films are welcome and well-attended.
It is said that distributors who lose money in Quebec are
the very ones who do not show Canadian films.
By May 6, 1971, the corporation, according to Mr. Spencer, had in circulation 14 pictures which have paid back
part of their investment, that is about $100,000, while some
50 others were in preparation.
A study by a Senate committee of the work performed
by the corporation would show us what can be done to
better promote that industry; such a study would provide
the producers and all those concerned with that art an
opportunity to state their views. Probably such a study
would not take more than ten sittings and would involve
limited costs. The English-speaking members of the committee might listen to the representations of the Ontario
producers while the French-speaking members might
meet the Montreal producers.
As a movie critic for many years, I was closely interested in this industry in general. In 1966-67 I welcomed as
many others did the creation of this corporation which
gave a tremendous boost to our movie-makers. A few
weeks ago, the French Canadian producer, Gilles Carle,
rightly said about the corporation that:
-it is the only public national organization which has
worked and helped everybody. But I do not know how
long this will last.
As for Darryl Zanuck, a Hollywood veteran, who
recently was in Toronto for the distribution of awards to
Canadian movies, he said that we can be proud of our
film industry which is much more alive than that of many
countries he has visited.
In fact, our private film industry is now a $43 million
business-let's not forget it, $43 million-with $25 million
in Ontario or about 59 per cent. Moreover, the movies
made by private industry have nothing in common with
those nice little productions the National Film Board is
famous for. Someone has even written recently that our
Canadian feature movies had "the shaggy magnificence
of a roaring lion." However, a film producer has suggested that only one Canadian film industry is a dream since
there are two cultures in Canada which it is difficult to
bring together.
As for feature movies in French, producers suggest they
are too costly for the small Quebec market and they are
not acceptable to the French market because of the
Canadian accent. And yet we Quebecers are clever
enough to understand all French films, whether the actors
speak with an accent from Paris, from Marseilles, from
Berri or Auvergne, from Belgium or Switzerland or the
colonies. Let us note, however, one rather extraordinary
success in Canada, that of a very sexy but very amusing
film: "Deux femmes en or," which cost $225,000 and
brought in $2.5 million in Quebec alone and attracted one
million Quebecers.
This year again, two Canadian features have been
accepted at the Cannes Festival, one in English-"A Fan's
Note" by Eric Till, which cost $850,000-and the other in
French, "La vraie nature de Bernadette" which cost $328,000, an amount that the producer Gilles Carle is sure to be
able to pay back in very little time.
[Hon. Miss Lapointe.]

June 15, 1972

A few weeks ago the Secretary of State, Mr. Pelletier,
announced that he intends to decentralize and degovernmentalize culture and to give private industry a larger
piece of the federal cake. He also wants, he said, to redefine federal agencies, amongst which are the National
Film Board, the CBC, the Canada Council and the
Canadian Film Development Corporation. At a time when
big decisions are also about to be made by the Ontario
and Quebec governments concerning the film industry, it
might be extremely interesting for us to stay and see
where we stand.
I hope that several honourable senators will want to
take part in this debate and tell us what they think of this
suggestion. We have here a growing enterprise which
groups an already important number of really talented
people and to which the government has been able to give
vigorous impetus. This impetus can become even stronger
if a short investigation, which will in no way resemble an
inquisition court, enables us to determine the failings and
inadequacies in the legislation or in the operation of the
corporation itself which so far may have slowed down the
progress of that industry which in other respects is most
promising.

[English]
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I rise
simply to support the suggestion of Senator Lapointe,
which I think is a good one. I was one of those who
participated in the original discussions in 1967, and I
welcomed the establishment of the Canadian Film Development Corporation because I thought it represented an
opportunity to give encouragement to the creative arts in
Canada for the reason that the film industry draws on all
of them. I also felt it was an opportunity to develop a
promising Canadian industry.
Nothing that has happened in the interval between 1967
and now has changed my mind on that. In fact, I believe
the setting up of the Canadian Film Development Corporation has been more than justified. However, it is timely
that after five years we should take a look at it to see
whether we are developing the potential we should, and to
see what means we have of really expanding this phase of
Canadian life.
I wholeheartedly welcome this suggestion. I realize that
as time is short we will probably not be able to get it
under way before the fall, but I must say that it is a
worth-while effort and I hope the Senate will concur in it.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, I rise only to
indicate that two senators who are not present this afternoon, because they are engaged elsewhere, have
expressed to me their desire to speak on this motion at a
later date.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Honourable senators, it is also
my intention to speak on this motion and for that purpose
I should like to move that the debate be adjourned until
next week.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Lamontagne, debate adjourned.

INTERNAL ECONOMY, BUDGETS AND ADMINISTRATION
DATES AND RECORDS OF COMMITTEE MEETINGSQUESTION
Hon. Rhéal Belisle: Honourable senators, I notice that
the Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration is not present,
and I had wished to ask him a question. Perhaps the
Leader of the Government will take note of my question. I
wish to know when the last meeting of the Committee on
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration was held
and when the next meeting will be held. Moreover, as a
member of that committee, I want to know if I can be
supplied with the full record of the meetings for the last
two years.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I will ask Senator McDonald to answer
your question.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The reason the Chairman of the
Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration is not present at the moment, Senator Belisle, is
that he is engaged with some officials of the Senate in
collecting information and preparing an agenda for a
meeting of that committee which we hope to hold next
week.
In the meantime I shall try to furnish you with the
information you have requested so that you can have it
before that meeting is held.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: May I ask a supplementary question,
Mr. Speaker? I understand the House of Commons staff
has received pay increases recently. I wish to know
whether pay increases for the members of the Senate
staff will be on the agenda referred to, as well as consideration of the Clerk's report?

Hon. Mr. McDonald: I cannot say yes or no at this point,
but I can inform the honourable senator that this is one of
the subjects being discussed by the chairman at this very
moment.
PUBLIC SERVANTS
IMPROPRIETY OF MAKING SPEECHES ON MATTERS OF
POLICY-ORDER STANDS
On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Forsey calling the attention of the Senate
to the impropriety of public servants making speeches
on matters of policy.-(Honourable Senator O'Leary).
Hon. M. Grattan O'Leary: Honourable senators, on a
question of privilege, I should like this order to stand. I
must say in all candour that I dislike the way in which one
party in this house, having a vast majority, monopolizes
the discussion.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am sorry to
hear Senator O'Leary say this. Senator O'Leary knows
how anxious I have been to listen to his contribution to
this debate. It was for this reason that Senator Lamontagne adjourned the previous debate. The matter raised
by Senator Lapointe is one on which any senator could
speak. I want Senator O'Leary to know that there certain-

ly has been no effort at any time to monopolize the
discussion.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Is there no way by which the government side can control their own speakers on matters
before the house? Surely you can control the Order Paper
to some extent. Three speeches were made today which I
think were very good speeches, but they were not at all
essential. Why in the name of heaven cannot we on this
side of the house, who are in such a great minority, get a
chance to make some use of the time spent in the house? I
dislike it intensely. It is very unfair, and I must say that it
is entirely characteristic of the Liberal Party when it is in
office.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am sorry to
hear Senator O'Leary say that. He knows very well that I
have suggested to him that he should participate in the
debate initiated by Senator Forsey instead of discouraging members of his party from taking part. I am sure you
will agree that the charge he has laid is not fair in light of
the fact that we on this side of the house have urged himand I personally have urged him-to speak because of his
outstanding qualities as a speaker.
When Senator Lapointe spoke it was not in any way
intended to prevent any other honourable senator from
taking part. Furthermore, I do not think it is up to any
senator to say to another, "You cannot speak in this
particular debate." If a member of the Opposition wishes
to speak then every effort should be made to alternate the
speakers between the government side and the opposition
side. If Senator Lapointe is to be followed by a senator
from this side of the house, it is simply because at the
moment no senator on the other side is prepared to take
part in the debate. There certainly was no intention to
monopolize the debate, and nobody knows that better
than my friend Senator O'Leary.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I am sorry to have to say it, but I
cannot accept the explanation given by the leader. Even
though I yielded the floor, I was still prepared to proceed.
But why should two Liberals speak, one after the other?
As I say, I was prepared to speak, but Senator Lapointe
looked at me and I yielded the floor whereupon she
launched into another long speech. I have sat here for two
hours prepared to speak on this motion and I think, even
as a simple matter of good manners, you should have
permitted me to speak.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You have this on the record.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Don't be so cross with me.
Order stands.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
LABOUR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTES AFFECTING PUBLIC
SERVICES-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, May 30, the
adjourned debate on the motion of honourable Senator
Haig that the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be instructed to examine and report
upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public services.

496

SENATE DEBATES

SJune 1

June

Hon. Charles McElnan: Honourable senators, when this
motion was put on our Order Paper by the honourable
Senator Haig on April 26 last we had already entered a
difficult year of labour-management relations in Canada,
and some predict that it may well become, if it has not
already become, the worst in our history.
When this motion was introduced, Canadians had
already suffered through the work stoppages, involving
the federal Department of Transport, the air traffic controllers, the airport technicians, and the airlines, which
had seriously affected the economy, caused immense
public inconvenience and antagonized a large segment of
the general public.
Irrespective of the cause of the then recent work stoppages, and whether the responsibility rested with management or organized labour or both, the public was saying,
"Enough!" From the public at large and the mass media
there were demands for action to bring an end to such
costly and exasperating strikes, particularly those in the
Public Service. Instant solutions were available from
many quarters-compulsory arbitration, compulsory and
binding arbitration, labour courts, removal of the right to
strike by Public Service unions, and so on.
So, honourable senators, when this motion was introduced, the public was already in a reactionary mood, first,
against strikes; second, against unions; and third, against
government because it had respected the recognized
procedures of collective bargaining and had not intervened against organized labour. Perhaps one might
reverse the order of priority in the public mind to make it,
first, against government; second, against unions; and
third, against strikes.
Whatever the priorities, the public mood, as I have said,
was reactionary in April of this year, and it was against
labour. That was not at all surprising, since the public
receives its news, news commentary and editorial comment from a predominantly management-oriented mass
media, particularly the daily print media.
At this point I should be totally candid and say that in
my opinion the cause of these stoppages by air traffic
controllers and airport and other technicians was that of
management. I believe that management, the government
agencies involved, had quite accurately assessed the
public mood at the time in both instances and felt that
they could hold out until public opinion scorched the
unions into submission. With air travellers and ships at
sea as the prospective victims in this game of Russian
roulette, something had to give, and it did. With public
sentiment being what it then was, time lay heavily on the
side of management, and they knew it.
However, unions and their negotiators are not without
fault. Too many leaders-and this applies to both labour
and management-have fallen prey to one of the disturbing illnesses of our time, namely, public confrontation.
The militant labour leader is happiest when he gets a time
slot on the national news of one, or both, of our national
television networks. He makes provocative statements
that render useless the next day's negotiating sessions.
Exactly the same thing applies to the militant management representative. Both are the darlings of many TV
journalists and producers. They are newsworthy. They
are also the instigators of work stoppages.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

Responsible labour and management negotiators shun
the TV cameras like the plague. They fear being cut up in
the TV editing room before they reach the sets in the
homes of the Canadian public; and they abhor the
provocative questioning of sensation-seeking interviewers. They are the bane and the despair of many so-called
newsmen. The negotiating process itself has suffered
badly in recent years. The basic elements of good faith
and integrity have been eroded.
Too often, when contract negotiations get under way,
the union says, "We need so much in wages, pension fund
improvements, safety measures, fringe benefits, et cetera,
so for starters we will double that amount in our initial
demands and gradually water it down to what we really
will be prepared to accept." At the same time, management too often says, "We can afford a total package that
will mean an increase of 'X' percentage points, so for
starters we will slice that in half. Then we can afford, over
a period of bargaining, and perhaps a strike if necessary,
to give ground up to that point."
Honourable senators, I suggest that is not bargaining in
good faith by either side. It is irresponsibility on both
sides. It is the stupidity that leads to strikes, lockouts,
confrontations, public frustration and anger. It presents a
grave danger to the whole process of collective bargaining-a process that works, and works well in a vast
majority of labour-management contract negotiations, the
vast majority that are successfully and peacefully concluded without strikes or lockouts, the vast majority of
which we hear little or nothing from the mass media.
Good news is not news, and the lack of its publication
gives imbalance to public opinion and leads to the type of
reaction we have from the public today.
I repeat that these were the circumstances and the
public mood when this motion was brought before us last
April. And at that time I thought that surely the Senate
should not hold an inquiry on such a volatile subject in
the midst of a period of stress, emotion, anger and reaction. I did not believe it could get balanced testimony from
witnesses. I did not believe it could reach well-balanced
conclusions in such a charged atmosphere. Unfortunately,
the general public image of the Senate is not the best to
begin with, and something less with organized labour. If
we were to put such an inquiry into the hands of a committee with the unlikely name of "Health, Welfare and
Science," we would be ridiculed beyond endurance.
At the same time, honourable senators, I did, and do
now, understand fully the frustration, anger and sense of
good purpose that motivated the honourable Senator Haig
to present us with this motion. What we could not know at
that time in April was that the work stoppages we had
then experienced were merely a prelude to those that
were to follow in the public service of municipal, provincial and federal governments. It is becoming a "hot"
year-stinking and health-endangering garbage strikes in
Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, strikes of municipal
workers and the whole construction industry in British
Columbia, a strike of transit workers in Halifax, and a
general strike of over 200,000 workers in the Province of
Quebec. And on and on it goes across the country. There
are all the earmarks of a hot summer ahead because there

.ine

SENATE DEBATES

are many delicate negotiations occurring in both the private and public sectors.
Most of this is due to the fact that both management and
organized labour have permitted public confrontation and
intransigent positions to replace good faith and integrity
in the collective bargaining process. Some of it is due to
totally irresponsible labour leaders who are misusing the
trust and authority of their union members for political,
ideological and revolutionary purposes. And some is due
to highly irresponsible management which is misusing
reactionary public support for the short-term gain of
higher profits and unfair contract settlements with their
workers.
However, the responsible majority of both labour and
management representatives are rapidly realizing that the
irresponsible few have been forcing them down a dangerous road-a road that spells misery for labour, management, the general public, and our national economic and
social objectives. And those responsible leaders of both
management and labour are actively working to restore
sanity and good will in the established system of labourmanagement relations in this country.
Honourable senators, let us not forget that most representatives of management accept and are prepared to live
within the law and recognized processes that govern
labour-management relations in Canada. Let us also
remember that labour knows better than anyone else that
strikes, work stoppages and lockouts work their greatest
hardship upon workers and their families. A great majority of labour leaders carry this fact as their principal term
of reference into all contract negotiations.
And let us not forget, despite all the sensational publicity associated with work stoppages, that the vast majority
of contract negotiations are carried out successfully,
including those affecting public servants, without strikes,
lockouts, work-to-rule, plant shutdowns, or any other disruptive occurrences, to the mutual satisfaction of both
management and labour and in the public interest. That
record of successful bargaining is, I believe, the proof that
our law and accepted procedures in labour-management
relations are not at fault in the disruptive strikes and
lockouts that have so greatly aggravated the general
public. The fault lies with an irresponsible minority who
have failed or refused to act in good faith within the
existing structures of law and procedure.
I do not believe that a generally effective and acceptable
process for collective bargaining in our nation should be
destroyed by precipitous reaction against the minority of
irresponsible leaders in both unions and management.
Both management and labour are working hard and
agonizingly to overcome the problems in their midst. They

have successfully met equally thorny issues and problems
in the past. I have faith that they will do so again if we will
but leave them to do so. And recent events in Quebec and
other provinces give us good cause to hold that faith.
Provincial and federal governments are currently conducting studies to overcome problems that have arisen
recently in the process of labour-management negotiations. This Parliament currently has before it extensive
amendments to the Canada Labour Code.

Honourable senators, there is the old adage: Too many
cooks spoil the broth. I have been trying to say, perhaps
poorly, that in current circumstances the Senate would be
one cook too many in this particularly tense situation.
With all due respect to Senator Haig, I hope that this
house will not approve such an examination at this time.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, for Hon. Mr. Goldenberg, debate adjourned.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I remind honourable senators that
there is to be royal assent at 5.45 p.m. I know we will be
here in large numbers.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 5.45 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

THE SENATE
REFLECTION UPON THE INTEGRITY OF THE CHAIRMAN
OF BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE COMMITTEEQUESTION OF PRIVILEGE
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I rise on a
question of privilege, under Rule 39 of the Rules of the
Senate, which reads as follows:
A senator considering himself offended or injured in
the Senate, in a committee room, or in any of the
rooms belonging to the Senate, may appeal to the
Senate for redress.
The particular thing I want to refer to is a statement
which was read by a member of the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, Senator
Croll, last Wednesday morning, June 14, at a sitting of the
committee, in which in part he reflects upon the integrity
of the chairman.
You have before you excerpts from the transcript,
because the printed record is not available as yet. The
unrevised transcript is ready and has been available to
the members. In the course of the statement which Senator Croll made, critical of the outline of the course of
action which I proposed for the committee, he said:
In addition to thatThat is, in addition to the other things he had said earlier,
and which I will deal with later.
-my third objection is that I consider it highly
improper and unethical for two members of the chairman's law firm to appear before a committee as
experts, to be anointed with the mantle of the prestige
of the committee and the advantages that can flow
from that. For that reason I object to the procedure
taken, until such time as the bills come before us for
examination.
Now, I can tell you that no member or members of my
firm appeared before that committee on that morning.
There were two tax experts who were before the committee that morning, and they were the same tax experts
whom the committee engaged in September of 1971 when
we were about to start on our study of the income tax bill,
Bill C-259. They were Albert Poissant, who is a senior
partner in the accounting firm of Thorne, Gunn, Helliwell
and Christenson of Montreal, and Charles Mitchell, who is
the senior partner of the same firm operating out of the
Toronto office. These two men worked with us throughout the whole period when we were engaged in hearing
representations last fall; when we were analyzing the
briefs that were submitted; when we were preparing the
reports which we submitted to this chamber; when we
were preparing the drafts of amending legislation which
we were proposing in those reports. When we were considering the matter of budget resolutions and the planning

and the organization of our meetings in order to determine how we should deal, in May of this year, with the
reference from the Senate to the committee, we called
upon these same tax experts again and they appeared
before the committee that morning.
In order to follow a certain sequence, then, we started
out with a statement that was entirely incorrect and
unfounded. The next thing that happened-and it shows
just how quickly there can spread the whole way across
Canada a statement which is vicious in its allegations and
which is untrue-was that that afternoon in the edition of
the Toronto Star an article appeared quoting word for
word what I have just read to you, which Senator Croll
read in the committee that morning. The article then went
on to say:
Two lawyers from McCarthy and McCarthy were
appearing before the committee today in support of
Senate recommendations on tax reform that had earlier been rejected by the government.
There were no two lawyers. There were no lawyers,
except the chairman, who is a lawyer and who is the
senior partner in the McCarthy and McCarthy firm. That
was the only representation from that firm before the
committee that morning.
<2010)
(

The next day I was in touch with the Toronto Star. I
should mention that they have organized what they call a
"Toronto Star Accuracy Bureau," and I told them that
they had written up the purpose of this so completely that
I thought they were sincere and that they would be interested in my further statement to them that they had made
an absolute incorrect statement of the facts. The next day
they published a correction but, I would say, did no more
than lip service to the question of accuracy, because
having referred to the article they simply said that no
member of the firm of McCarthy and McCarthy had
appeared before the meeting that morning.
The next thing that happened was that on Wednesday
afternoon a representative of the Canadian Press went to
the Senate Reporting Branch and asked to see the unrevised transcript, and it was shown to him. He remained
there for a while and read over the transcript, and then
we find in the Journal a CP dispatch which, as I learned
later, went as a service of CP the whole way across
Canada the next day. In this dispatch there is, of course,
an exact quotation of the statement which I read to you
earlier, which Senator Croll made against me and my
position, alleging highly improper and unethical conduct
in bringing two members of my firm to this committee,
the idea being to establish prestige for them so that they
would be able to attract business, and I assume that
means to earn dollars.
This CP article went even further, honourable senators.
It was more extensive in its quotation, but when it came to
dealing with persons appearing before the committee that
morning of June 14 they had had the benefit of reading
the transcript, and they discovered that the two men to

June 20, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

appear were Albert Poissant and Charles Mitchell, so in
order to tie that in to Senator Croll's statement, for whatever the purpose might be, they then said "the advisers
Albert Poissant and Charles Mitchell are both employed
by the Toronto law firm of McCarthy and McCarthy of
which Senator Hayden is a partner." To make that statement indicates how utterly nonsensical it is. These two
men are partners in an outstanding chartered accountancy firm in Canada and they are not now and never were
employees of the firm of McCarthy and McCarthy. The
attention of CP was directed to this late on Thursday
evening, the item having appeared in Thursday's edition
of the Journal.

Nothing occurred until Monday of this week when I
called the number two man in CP because the number
one man was away, and said, "Now, you have a complete
misstatement; you just cannot appoint people to work for
our firm, and they may not want to do so," and that
certainly they did not work for our firm. I suppose he
must have been on the telephone with me six or eight
times that day trying to achieve some sort of correction,
and I told him that the correction was something he had
to make, that I was not going to make it for him. I asked
him if any other source had approached him in connection with this misstatement of fact and he said no. So in
the two cases where the correction took place they were
really initiated by my telephone call and letter to the
editor of the Toronto Accuracy Bureau, and a telephone
call to the number two man at CP.
I cite this merely to illustrate how quickly a misstatement, whether deliberate or otherwise, in which is contained a series of allegations of impropriety, when it
becomes embarked on its way, moves across Canada. The
Canadian Press serves a major number of daily papers
across Canada. I think that is a fair statement.
Honourable senators, having stated that, I will tell you
the only possible references which could be made to the
two members of my firm in relation to this committee.
When we were about to begin our hearings in September
of last year in connection with Bill C-259, to amend the
Income Tax Act, and while we were still receiving briefs
and before we had studied any of them, I suggested to the
committee that since this was a very complicated bill
perhaps a little education would help members of the
committee. I indicated that we had two men in our office
who had prepared a series of lectures for the continuing
education program of the Law Society of Upper Canada.
These lectures were for the benefit of the practising
profession in Ontario and were being delivered to members of the profession. I indicated that if the committee
thought this kind of education, along with a question and
answer period and blackboard demonstrations, would be
of value or would serve any purpose, I would offer this
service on the stipulation that there would be no fee, no
remuneration other than out-of-pocket expenses for travelling to and from Ottawa and for living in Ottawa.
They appeared on three occasions, September 29 and 30
and October 7. From October 7 to this date these men
have not been consulted by the committee; they have not
been before the committee; they have not taken any part
in the hearings or in the analysis of any briefs which were
submitted; they have not taken any part in conferences

499

with our advisers, in the drafting of our reports to this
Senate, or in drafting legislation to cover recommendations which we made. They have not been part or parcel
of these proceedings at all. October 7 was the last day on
which they appeared before the committee.
I mention this to illustrate how carefully I hoped I was
proceeding so that members of my firm would not be
identified with the affairs of this committee. I insisted the
committee could have the services of these two men if
they considered them of value, and they invited the men,
and they appeared as witnesses before the committee.
Senator Croll did not attend many meetings of the committee. However, he was at a meeting on December 13
when we considered our final report to the Senate, and
that report was given that evening. In that final report we
were making the usual acknowledgments and thanking
the members, staff, and any person or group contributing
to the sum total of the work we were doing.
e (2020)
I recall very distinctly Senator Croll's presence, because
in that report we had listed important headings in the
income tax bill, and the references to where the development of these headings in the evidence of these two men
could be found in the proceedings of the committee.
Then the following paragraph appeared in the report:
The above references are to a series of lectures or
explanations on the various provisions of Bill C-259
with section references. Your committee wishes to
express its great appreciation to Mr. Arthur R. A.
Scace and Mr. Stephen Smith and for their assistance.
It should be noted that their services were given without remuneration-expressly so stipulated.
When it came to Mr. Poissant and Mr. Mitchell we said:
Your committee retained the services of Mr. Albert
Poissant and Mr. Charles B. Mitchell, senior partners
in the accounting firm of Thorne, Gunn, Helliwell and
Christenson. Their services were invaluable in every
phase of the work of your committee.
I recall Senator Croll's participation in the discussion of
that report because when we came to acknowledge the
great contribution made by the Honourable Lazarus Phillips to the work of this committee as general counsel, he
felt that we had not emphasized enough our appreciation
of the quality of his contribution as against our remarks
concerning these two men and their contribution. We
made some changes in the language. Do not ask me what
they are now; I could not tell you. In any event, we ended
up by saying:
Your committee wishes to acknowledge in a particular way the contribution of the Honourable Lazarus
Phillips to our study of this Tax Reform Legislation
and Bill C-259 as Chief Counsel to the Committee.
You will recall he was Vice-Chairman of the Committee in its study of the White Paper Proposals. In the
drafting of the Report of the Senate thereon and in
the preparation of the several reports of the committee on its examination and consideration of Bill C-259,
his advice and direction were invaluable.
There is the background of information which was
available regarding this charge of highly improper con-

SENATE DEBATES
duct, in respect of which I may say that the Ottawa
Journal in heading the CP report last Thursday used this
language: "Senator Croll on attack." Then it says in great
big black letters, over an inch high: "Hayden's conduct
branded 'unethical.' " This is the heading for the article.
I think it is important that the first thing this chamber
should realize is that the statement which was made in
committee was not true. We should then realize how fast
that untruth piled up and these men became employed by
the firm of McCarthy and McCarthy, of which I am a
partner, and also piled up to the extent of saying that
these two men were there as tax experts. This is the chief
charge which I find so offensive, because how does one
defend against this sort of thing? The only mode of
defence has to lie in the responsibility of the senator and
his appreciation of that responsibility. When you realize
how quickly the big lie can travel the whole way across
the country, it becomes apparent that there is a tremendous duty on those who participate in public life and who
are proposing to make criticism-and adverse criticismto make very sure that their facts are right.
This is my main concern here. I am sure that the corrections which appeared in the Ottawa Journaltoday, and in
the Toronto Daily Star last Thursday, will never reach all
those who read the original. Some may read the corrections, and may not read the original. The correction-and
honourable senators will note that there are no regrets
and no apologies here; it is simply a correction-will never
reach all of the people. But as far as my friends are
concerned, I am confident that whether the correction
reaches them or not is unimportant in so far as it may
disturb their friendly relations with me. I know that the
members of the Senate committee were unanimous, at the
conclusion of our meeting the other day, in their support
of the chairman and in the course of action which he took,
notwithstanding the allegations contained in this
statement.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The one thing that I take pride inafter all, I have been in the Senate for over 32 years and
have participated in many important debates-is the fact
that I have accepted responsibility. I have explained complicated and intricate bills and, in so doing, have enlisted
assistance in order that I might understand the measures
more completely and provide the best possible information both for the committee and the Senate.
I shall not be deterred from that course because of this
experience in committee. As long as I have the support of
the committee and of the Senate I shall keep right on. I
shall not allow myself to become engaged in any libel
action over the sort of thing that has occurred, because
that would be a waste of time. You have to stand on your
own feet, and those who do not like you, as long as they
are not overwhelming in number, can go their own way.
That is the way in which I shall continue to operate,
unless the Senate says, "No, you must not do that." I will
continue to proffer assistance to any committee of the
Senate from any outside source but not without first
obtaining the express approval of the committee of the
Senate concerned.
A situation might arise in the future where the committee might need assistance in understanding the complexi[Hon. Mr. Hayden.)

June 20, 1972

ties of a bill, and I might feel that I should first come to
the Senate and explain what I propose to do and seek the
approval of the whole Senate. In view of this attack, I
might feel that I should go that far. However, time will
tell.
I have tried to analyze why this sort of vicious, ill-founded and unfounded statement was made, and the allegation
levelled-because charges of unethical conduct or highly
improper conduct, in the context in which they are made,
have very serious implications-but I am left without a
rational explanation. However, I am not concerned now
about whether or not I receive an explanation, rational or
otherwise.
I move now to the second part of what I wish to say.
What has happened in this case makes a farce out of
political reporting. These statements referring to members of my firm are not in quotation. They are statements
of fact made by those who wrote the article. Their minds
could have been disabused by merely asking a question of
either a member of the committee or myself. However, the
philosophy seems to have been, "Plough ahead. If we are
caught up with and a correction becomes necessary, then
we will make a correction." What damage might have
occurred in the meantime or who might have been hurt
seems to be relatively unimportant. I would hope, if there
is one good thing to come out of this shemozzle, it would
be that possibly the checking of facts will be a little more
seriously done, especially when it can be done so easily,
before allegations of this kind are made which reflect
upon the ethics of not only a senator and a chairman of an
important committee of the Senate but a senator who is a
practising lawyer of almost 50 years' standing in the Province of Ontario, and a man who has been a member of the
Senate for over 32 years. Instead of checking in these
circumstances, these statements have been made on the
assumption, "Well, maybe they are right; if they are not
and someone complains, then we will make a correction."
O

(2030)

The second allegation which Senator Croll made-you
will find it on page 3 of the excerpts which you have-is as
follows:
Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a few preliminary
observations. From your outline of the course of
action you propose, it is my view that the purpose is to
bring pressure to bear on the government for special
consideration for a small group which the government
did not deal with in the last budget speech. As I said in
the house, special pleading on behalf of special interests who seek special privileges leaves a greater tax
burden on the rest of the taxpayers, and more particularly on those Canadians 25 per cent of whom are
existing on less than $5,000 a year.
When Senator Croll had finished reading this statement
I asked him, "Who is the small group and who are the
special interests which you suggest we are promoting
when we support the position of those employees who are
in deferred profit-sharing plans?" His answer was that it
was the deferred profit-sharing plan and the employees of
those plans about whom I had spoken in the Senate the
week before. These were the special interests.
This is an allegation that not only the chairman of the
committee but the members of the committee permitted

Tune 20, 1972

June

20

1972

SENATE DEBATES

themselves to be high-pressured into recognizing special
interests of a small group. May I take a minute or two to
tell you the facts? We had before us as witnesses giving
evidence in relation to deferred profit-sharing plans the
Institute of Profit-Sharing Associations, the membership
of which consists of 14 different companies. This association represents some substantial companies in Canada
such as Shell, Defasco, Canada Packers, Simpsons-Sears,
and Simpsons. It was indicated that the employees participating in that type of plan who are members of the
Institute number about 50,000. The feature of this plan
was the lump sum payment which they could take out at
the end of the road.
To label these people, in the circumstances, "special
interests" is the thing that I find shocking. Who are these
people? We are told that they are the sweepers in the
buildings, the clerks, the maintenance men, the elevator
operators, the stenographers, the truck drivers, and so
forth. Every phase of occupation in these companies is
represented by people who are prepared to work for a
living, and who are prepared to put a part of the money
they earn into a deferred profit-sharing plan that will
bring them a lump sum payment at the end of the road
when their years of being able to earn have been considerably reduced. These people prefer to work and to earn a
living and put part of their earnings into this type of plan
rather than lean on public welfare and public charity. To
call them special interests I find a shocking misuse of the
expression "special interests." I would rather expect to
find that in other areas where we have wild-eyed orators
who are prepared to support every allegation against
organized society by saying, "Ah! You favour the special
interests." These people are not special interests, and
when I submit these facts to you I am sure you must
conclude that they are not.
I can tell you that in the evidence before us there were
tables produced, in relation to about ten different
employees, in which they calculated the tax or the revenue the country got from taxation on the lump sum payments that came out to these people under the existing
law, and then the same tables were prepared to show the
position of these same people under the new law if they
chose the less onerous method of taxation, which would
be to forget about the lump sum payment and take the
annual amount of money that comes out and buy a forward averaging annuity. The incidence of taxation in
those circumstances would be substantially lower according to the information before us.
When my friend is being, as he was, critical of us, and
unduly so-critical of the members of the committee-for
favouring special interests, the evidence before us was, I
understand, the same evidence as has been provided to
the Department of Finance, and to this moment-"this
moment" being a couple of days ago, having checked to
see whether there had been any change in the figures-I
find there has not been any change.
The evidence stands there to show what these people
were seeking. They were seeking to make their incidence
of tax apply at the time they were in money, and at the
time they were in money they wanted the benefit of an
averaging provision which they had enjoyed since 1962,
which gave them some lessening of the burden of taxation

on the lump sum payment in one year which would boost
their income tremendously over their annual salary.
Under the bill as it stood at that time, when we considered this whole question, the general averaging provisions
were not available to these people if they took advantage
for a limited period of the old averaging provision, and
the forward averaging provisions were not available if
they took advantage of section 36 of the old act, which
gave them an average on their income and their taxes,
and the average rate as a result of that for the last three
years before they took their payment.
What we recommended-and the only recommendation
that was not followed-was that as we have introduced a
capital gains tax, and the capital gain in the trust earned
on investment of these moneys, and the capital gain on
shares, which may be distributed out of the fund to the
employees, should be taxed in the same way and under
the same general rules as every other kind of capital gain.
That is the one thing that still has not been done.
If you call that favouring special interests, then as the
chairman of the committee, participating in this discussion and supporting it, I must plead guilty. But to me that
is the oddest definition of "special interests" I have ever
run into. It is not special interests at all. These people who
participate in these plans are sturdy, self-reliant,
independent Canadians who are prepared to go their own
way, work their own way, earn their own money and
spend part of it to provide for their declining years. If this
puts them into a special category maybe we should
enlarge the special category, because it is the kind of
citizenship and the kind of moral fibre that it is good to
have in the workers of Canada.
* (2040)

As far as I am concerned, you can number those people
by the thousands-the people who participate in pension
plans, in retirement savings plans, in profit-sharing plans,
in deferred profit-sharing plans, and who contribute their
own money, out of their own work, in order to provide the
wherewithal to take care of them at the end of the road. I
would say that the more we can increase the number of
such workers in Canada and achieve more and more in
the way of self-reliance and sturdiness in this country, the
better. Therefore, I resist any allegation that, in doing
what we did, we were catering to or in any way promoting
special interests.
Honourable senators, may I move on? This is taking a
little longer than I expected, but to me it is an important
subject and I hope you will tolerate me, and agree with me
that it is.
We come to a stage when we ask: "Where do we go from
here?" I can tell you very briefly that Rule 39, which I
read to you, gives me the right, as an offended or injured
person, to come to you and say the Senate should give me
some redress. I am not asking for any redress, I do not
want any redress; all I want is to have the relationships
which I have with the Senate continued, in the same
manner as I now enjoy its confidence. I am not asking or
expecting any withdrawal, any apology, or any regret
because, if there were one-of which I am doubtful-any
such apology, regret, withdrawal, whatever you want to
call it, would never catch up with the harm which has
been done.

SENATE DEBATES

I hope that out of it all, a better sense of responsibility
may develop. When people feel stirred up and worked up
to the extent that their bile floods out their reason, they
should remember that senators have a duty, a responsibility and an obligation-a duty to their brother senators, a
duty to the dignity of the Senate, and a duty to the publie-that the public be well informed; and that when they
make a statement, to see that it is an authentic statement,
it is fair comment, and the facts have been properly
stated.
So far as the newspapers are concerned, I am not
asking for any particular treatment for the very faulty
reporting which I think made a farce, as I said before, out
of political reporting. There was a complete absence of
any checking, when it was so easy to have checked. Take
the idea, for instance, of knowing that Poissant and Mitchell were members of an outstanding chartered accountancy firm in Canada and that they were chartered accountants, and then stating-when there is nothing in the
record anywhere which would show this-that they were
employees of McCarthy and McCarthy. That indicates to
what a low level political reporting of this kind has
descended in Canada.
Arising out of that, some effort may be made to report
seriously and to verify the facts before assumptions are
made. You would almost think that the media were
saying, "Well, here are some allegations; let us tear into
them; and if they do not turn out to be right, we can
always regret or correct or apologize." This time it was a
correction.
Tonight the Journal-and I assume other papers across
Canada who used the CP report-carried a heading which
is a long way from the heading which they had on Thursday, when they said: "Senator Croll on attack" and "Hayden's conduct branded as unethical." The heading today
was: "Tax Consultants not members of Senator Hayden's
legal firm." Can you imagine a more innocuous-

June 20, 1972

the committee when it commences is fully informed, and
has as much education as it can be expected to absorb in
the beginning in some of the complicated things it has had
to consider. Then, he must be able to organize the flow of
representations and briefs; to organize the analysis of
those while they are flowing in; to organize the consideration by the staff of the committee of the result of all that,
so that the committee is ready, within a limited period of
time, to put the whole thing together into a report. And
remember that last fall all of that was done between the
first meeting on September 29 and the last report on
December 13, and we had terminated our meetings on
November 10. No wonder, as I described to this committee, that some of the staff were long on work and very
short on sleep, because the work had to be turned out and
the time limit was there.
Honourable senators, now that you have been kind
enough to permit me this indulgence and I have said what
I have to say, I do not propose tonight to stay in my place
any longer. I do not know what, if any, answer may be
made, but I have no desire to listen a second time to
another instalment of the statements which were made
the other day.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: -insecure way of attempting a retraction, when the whole basis of the branding of my conduct
as being unethical turned on the question of whether
members of my firm were being used by the committee, at
my insistence, as tax advisers to the committee? That
statement was basically wrong and false and can be
demonstrated so. I do not think there is any doubt-there
is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the
committee-as to the absolute falsity of that statement.
In those circumstances, surely it is about time there was
some new kind of morality. It may be I am expecting too
much. They say that sometimes as you get older-and the
Lord knows I am certainly moving along now-your sense
of morality gets a little sharper. I would hate to think I
was going in that direction; I would rather retain the
broadness of viewpoint which I thought I had shown in
dealing with legislation and with issues, and in conducting
the affairs of the committee.
Honourable senators, may I just sound one last word.
The job of a chairman of a committee like the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee, and the responsibility
attaching to it, is very heavy. In order to get things going
he must initiate the preparation of many materials, so that

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this report be taken
into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate, and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(f), I move that this
report be adopted.
Honourable senators, the reason I ask for the suspension of this rule is that this chamber approved the following motion of honourable Senator Argue on April 26,
1972:
That in the opinion of this house it is desirable, in
the interest of both eastern and western agriculture,
to establish a Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture to consider legislation and other matters of concern to agriculture that may be referred to the said
committee by the Senate.
Acting on the express wishes of the committee, I feel
that there is no reason for this report to be delayed.
Moreover, as there is the possibility of legislation of an
agricultural nature reaching this chamber, it would be to
our general advantage to have the committee established
forthwith.
Motion agreed to.

Your committee further recommends that the
foregoing amendments come into force at the commencement of the next session of Parliament.
Your committee further desires to report, for the
information of the Senate, that it is giving continuing
consideration to the distribution of duties as among
the several standing committees and to certain other
proposed amendments of a housekeeping character,
and that in general, subject to the wishes of the
Senate, the committee considers that the number of
standing committees should not be further proliferated and that greater use might be made of
subcommittees.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Molson moved that the report be placed on the
Orders of the Day for consideration at the next sitting of
the Senate.
Motion agreed to.
THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Douglas D. Everett, Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance, presented the
report of the committee, to which was referred the Estimates laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1973, and asked that the report be printed as an
appendix to the Debates of the Senate and the Minutes of
the Proceedingsof today and form part of the permanent
record of this house.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it
agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(Fortext of report, see Appendix pp. 510-11)
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Everett: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(f), I move that the
report be taken into consideration now.

June

SENATE DEBATES

My reason for asking leave to proceed now is that, as
you know, this report must be in the hands of the Senate
prior to the coming down of the supply bill from the other
place, and I shall not be here tomorrow to deal with the
report itself.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed that leave be given,
honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Everett: I appreciate that leave has been granted to me. I will not deal with the report in detail, but I
should like to discuss briefly some of the highlights so
that honourable senators may understand the report a
little better when they come to read the appendix itself.
The main Estimates for the year 1972-73 amount to
$15,749 million as compared to $14,352 million in the previous year. This is an increase of $1,397 million or 9.7 per
cent.
Members of your committee have been interested to
find out whether the increase in the budgetary expenditures approximates that of the increase in the gross
national product. As I have said, that increase is 9.7 per
cent, and the increase in the gross national product is 9.1
per cent.
Of these budgetary expenditures, statutory expenditures accounted for some 50 per cent of the total Estimates. Seven billion, six hundred and forty dollars of the
Estimates are statutory while $8,109 million represents
funds for which Parliament will be asked to give
authority.
There are only one or two other items which I should
like to deal with. One is an interesting item that concerns
the changes in the legislation setting up the Unemployment Insurance Commission. In the past, before the
change in the act, the government estimated every year
the amount of contribution it would have to make to the
Unemployment Insurance Fund. When the act changed,
the government decided to pay in the following year the
actual contribution to the fund, based on the deficit. This
accounting change caused a hiatus of one year, and it
amounts to $111 million. In that period the government
also no longer pays the administration costs of some $70
million. So that means that there is a change, purely of an
accounting nature, of $180 million in the Estimates. If one
begins to consider that matter, one finds the budgetary
Estimates by virtue of this accounting change are actually
$180 million higher than is actually shown.
Honourable senators, some of the major increases in
expenditure are a $165,700,000 increase in the interest
charges on public debt; $139 million in increases on hospital insurance; $110 million in increases in medical care for
a total medical and hospital increase of $249 million; an
increase of $80 million in post-secondary education payments; an increase in the post office deficit of $41 million,
and an increase in the regional economic expansion Estimates of $91 million.
Honourable senators, as I say, the report will be printed
as an appendix to today's proceedings and I hope honourable senators will take the trouble to read it.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Grosart, debate adjourned.

RULES OF THE SENATE
ADVISABILITY OF EMBODIMENT OF CODE OF CONDUCT
FOR SENATORS-MOTION STANDS
On the Motion by the Honourable Senator Croll:
That the Standing Committee on Standing Rules
and Orders consider the advisability of embodying in
the Rules of the Senate the following two principles as
a code of conduct for Senators:
(1) That in any debate or proceeding of the Senate
or its committees or transactions or communications
which a Senator may have with other Senators or
with Ministers, Members of the House of Commons or
servants of the Crown, he shall disclose any relevant
pecuniary interest or benefit of whatever nature,
whether direct or indirect, that he may have or may
be expecting to have.
(2) That it is contrary to the usage and derogatory to
the dignity of the Senate that a Senator should bring
forward by speech or question, or advocate in this
House or among his fellow Senators any bill, motion,
matter or cause for a fee, payment, retainer or
reward, direct or indirect, which he has received, is
receiving or expects to receive.
And that the said committee examine and report
upon ways and means of establishing an effective
parliamentary machinery for the proper enforcement
of the foregoing code of conduct.
The Hon. the Speaker: This motion is standing in the
name of Senator Croll.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Stand until July 11.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is going to age in the meantime.
Motion stands.
POINT OF ORDER-SPEAKER'S RULING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I should
like at this stage to deal with a point of order raised by the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn) when notice of
motion was given by honourable Senator Croll on
Wednesday last, June 14, respecting the advisability of the
embodiment in our rules of a code of conduct for senators. The Leader of the Opposition raised the following
point of order as it appears on page 478 of Senate Debates
for that day:
HON. JACQUES FLYNN: Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point
of order. I would ask Your Honour to consider whether paragraph (2) of this notice is not already covered
by the law. I think it is a duplication of the law, and
should not be considered as an amendment to the
rules governing this very matter as far as senators are
concerned. It seems to me that the matter of receiving
a fee for doing anything in the Senate is already
covered by either the act concerning the Senate and
the House of Commons, or some other act.
I would ask Your Honour to look into this question.
The first paragraph may be a problem for the Rules

SENATE DEBATES

Committee, but I doubt that an act can be amended by
this method.
It is to be noted here that this point of order by honourable Senator Flynn was only dealing with paragraph (2) of
the notice by Senator Croll. I undertook to look into the
matter.
It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition is
seeking a legal opinion from the Chair as to the suitability
and propriety of the language employed in the motion of
Senator Croll. Bourinot's 4th Edition, at page 180, is quite
clear on this point where he states that the Speaker:
-will not give a decision upon a constitutional question, nor decide a question of law, though the same be
raised on a point of order or privilege.
There are many precedents for this practice being followed, the latest of which took place on July 8, 1969, and
will be found on page 10,955 of Hansardof the House of
Commons, where Mr. Speaker Lamoureux ruled that it is
not the responsibility of the Chair to rule on a question of
law or on a constitutional question, and stated that this
ruling has been made in many instances by previous
Speakers.
Therefore, in my opinion, the question raised by the
Leader of the Opposition could perhaps be discussed by
honourable senators in the course of the debate on the
motion when it is put to the house, or in committee if it is
referred there. But it is not for the Chair to decide on any
question of law.
I therefore rule that this motion as worded is procedurally acceptable.
INTERNAL ECONOMY, BUDGETS AND ADMINISTRATION
DATES AND RECORDS OF COMMITTEE MEETINGSQUESTIONS ANSWERED
Hon. Rhéal Belisle: Honourable senators, last week I
took the opportunity of asking three questions of the
Chairman of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration. Seeing that I have not
received an answer to any of the questions and seeing that
I have read that the committee will be meeting next week
and subsequently learning, if I have read correctly, that
the committee is not scheduled to meet, and having
received the information that we will be sitting for only
one week, and in view of the fact that we have now been
sitting for at least six months without a meeting of that
committee, is it the intention of the Chairman of that
committee to ignore the members and rule without them?
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, I
have the answers to Senator Belisle's questions that he
asked on Thursday, June 15. It is quite true that he asked
three questions. In the first he asked the date of the last
meeting of the Senate Committee on Internal Economy,
Budgets and Administration, and that date is December
15, 1971. Here let me apologize for not having the answers
in written form, but the facilities at my disposal are not
such that I can do everything that needs to be done in
what might be considered the proper fashion.
His next question was as to when the next meeting will
be held. There are two subcommittees of the Internal
Economy Committee and it is to be hoped that they will be
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

June 20, 1972

able to meet tomorrow, perhaps after the bouse has risen.
Should that be the case, then I would hope that we could
have a meeting of the full committee either on Thursday
of this week or as early as possible in the following
week-perhaps on Monday or Tuesday.
Senator Belisle then asked if he could be supplied with
the full record of the meetings of the last two years. I have
that here, and I will ask the page to give it to Senator
Belisle.
This was followed by a question by Senator Phillips, as
follows:
May I ask a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker? I
understand the House of Commons staff has received
pay increases recently. I wish to know whether pay
increases for the members of the Senate staff will be
on the agenda referred to, as well as consideration of
the Clerk's report?
In reply to that question I can report that both these
matters will be on the agenda.
Hon. Mr. Belisle: May I ask a supplementary question?
In view of the fact that not all members of the house are
privileged to be members of this committee, could the
records you have given me be made an appendix to
today's proceedings?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That is not a question for me to
answer; it is for the house.
Hon. Mr. Belisle: I ask that they be printed as an appendix to today's proceedings.
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I do not think there is anything in
the committee's reports that all honourable senators do
not have access to, and furthermore I do not think they
contain anything that would be detrimental should the
public read it. It is simply a record of this house. But these
are rather lengthy documents covering a period of two
years, and there is the question as to whether the bouse
wishes to proceed with that amount of printing.
MEMBERSHIP AND EXPENDITURES OF
SUBCOMMITTEES-SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS

Hon. Orville H. Phillips: Honourable senators, I rise to
ask a supplementary
question. Senator McDonald
referred to two subcommittees, and both Senator Belisle
and I, as new members of this committee, have found it
very difficult to get information. There are always mysterious subcommittees dealing with these matters. I would
appreciate it if Senator McDonald would indicate who are
the members of the subcommittees; who acts as chairmen
of the subcommittees in the absence of the chairman of
the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets
and Administration; and what have been the authorized
expenditures of these rather intriguing subcommittees?
* (2110)

Hon. Mr. McDonald: First of all, I can assure my honourable friend there is certainly no intrigue with respect
to the subcommittees of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration. There are two
subcommittees. One is chaired by Senator Molson, and
the other by the chairman of the Standing Committee on

ne 20 1972EAT
20

June

1972

SENATE DEBATES

Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration, Senator
Smith. I am not able to give you the names of the members of these subcommittees, but I will obtain that information for you.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: What are the names of these
subcommittees?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The subcommittee chaired by
Senator Molson deals with accounts, and the subcommittee chaired by Senator Smith deals with budgets of the
standing and special committees of the Senate. This is the
subcommittee to which the budgets of all standing and
special committees are submitted before expenditures can
be made by any committee. I will be prepared to give you
the names of the members serving on these subcommittees tomorrow.
When you say "expenditures," Senator Phillips, I am not
certain to which expenditures you are referring. Are you
referring to the expenditures of the Standing Committee
on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration?
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Yes; after all, Senator McDonald, an
expenditure is the money of the taxpayers. I would like to
know what amount has been authorized.
Honourable senators, as much as I appreciate the
courtesy and sincere attempt which Senator McDonald
has made in replying to my question, the thought
occurred to me that we have a government leader in the
Senate. I rather expected he would know the names of the
members of these committees. I am wondering if he has
laryngitis this evening.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I do not know
how to participate in what appears to have become a
debate on an interrogation. Perhaps I will put my remarks
in the form of a supplementary question to the Leader of
the Government or the deputy leader. Is it not rather
unusual that a committee which deals with the internal
economy, budgets and administration of the Senate has
not met since December 15 last? I ask the Leader of the
Government if he considers that a committee such as this,
carrying on, as we are told, without calling a meeting of
the full committee, is not in dereliction of its duties when
it does not inform its members regarding the status of the
budgeting.
I ask this because it may be of interest to honourable
senators to know that for the current year there has been
a decrease in the expenditures of the House of Commons
and an increase in the expenditures of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: There is more work performed here.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, I am not able
to answer Senator Grosart's question. However, I am sure
the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Internal
Economy, Budgets and Administration is well able and
prepared to answer it.
If the committee bas not met as often as some senators
would like it to meet perhaps that is because we all need
to accept some responsibility, especially those of us who
are members of the committee. In any event, I will bring
your remarks to the attention of the chairman, and I
expect he will be able to reply to your question upon his
return.

507

Hon. Mr. Phillips: Honourable senators, as I recall,
Senator McDonald stated last week that the staff was
preparing the agenda for this committee meeting. Is not
this an unusual procedure? Is it not customary for the
senators themselves to prepare the agenda and decide
what will be discussed at a committee meeting?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Perhaps I used the word "staff"
loosely in reference to the preparation of the agenda.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: You were being factual.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Senator Phillips asked a question
regarding pay increases for the staff of the Senate, and
whether they would be considered at the next meeting of
the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets
and Administration. Of course, the staff of the Senate is
involved in preparing the documents which come before
the committee respecting the different categories of
public servants who work for the Senate. Increases are
proposed. After observing what occurs in other branches
of the Public Service, I would say the staff is directly
involved in this area, but perhaps I was wrong when I
indicated they were involved in drafting the agenda. Even
if they were involved, I would not complain. Sometimes
we find ourselves in a position where we are glad to
receive help from anyone. This could have been the case.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I agree with you on that point.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I happen to be a new member of one
of these subcommittees, I believe-I had a telephone call
to that effect-although I am not entirely certain as to my
status. I ask the Deputy Leader of the Government if it is
his intention to call these committees for a time when no
other committee is sitting tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It would be my intention to do this,
but I do not know whether I am able to. The Standing
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is
sitting at 10 o'clock tornorrow morning, and the Standing
Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs is sitting at 10.15.
Yes, I expect those two subcommittees will meet after the
house rises.
HEALTH. WELFARE AND SCIENCE
LABOUR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTES AFFECTING PUBLIC
SERVICES-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, May 15, the
adjourned debate on the motion of honourable Senator
Haig that the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be instructed to examine and report
upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public services.
Hon. H. Carl Goldenberg: Honourable senators, the
motion in the name of Senator Haig which has been
before this house for several months is to instruct the
Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science "to examine and report upon the efficiency of
existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in
areas affecting public services."
The motion is not very clear. I assume the sponsor is
referring to what those of us involved in labour-manage-

508

SENATE DEBATES

ment relations call "public interest disputes." Some of
these are easily identifiable as such, for example, those
affecting police and f ire protection, hydro electric service
and hospital services. There are others which, to a greater
or lesser degree, affect the publie interest. However,
whether or not they are public interest disputes in the
proper sense of the term is a matter of controversy. The
sale of liquor in Canada is a public service, but I doubt
that a strike in this area could properly be classed as a
public interest dispute.
* (2120)

The motion refers to federal legislation governing disputes in areas "affecting public services." "What does it
intend to include in the term "public services"? In federal
legislation "public service" covers employees as defined
in the Public Service Employment Act, who are governed
in the matter of labour relations by the Public Service
Staff Relations Act; that is, employees of government
departments and of specified boards, commissions and
other agencies as set out in schedule I of this act.
Is it also intended to include employees of crown corporations as listed in schedules A, B, C and D of the Financial Administration Act; for example, employees of the
CNR, Air Canada and the CBC? These are governed by
section 5 of the Canada Labour Code.
If the term "public services" is intended to include both
of these categories, the motion involves an inquiry both
into the operation of the Public Service Staff Relations
Act, under which Treasury Board bargains as employer
with the unions representing government employees, and
into the operation of section 5 of the Canada Labour
Code, which applies to all industries under federal jurisdiction and under which the respective crown corporations bargain with the unions representing their
employees.
These two acts differ in important respects. For example, in the constitution and power of the two boards, the
Public Service Staff Relations Board and the Canada
Labour Relations Board, in the scope of bargaining and in
the provisions governing the right to strike.
The motion, of course, excludes provincial legislation
but far more employees fall under provincial jurisdiction
than under federal labour legislation. Let us not forget
that most recent strikes in public services have occurred
within the provincial jurisdiction. I may add that at the
federal level 95 per cent of contract negotiations under the
Public Service Staff Relations Act have been settled without strikes. These are facts that have been ignored in
some speeches on the motion before the house.
In urging an inquiry at this time some honourable senators also appear to have forgotten that a most thorough
inquiry into labour relations in Canada was carried out
within the past five years by the Task Force on Labour
Relations presided over by Professor H. D. Woods of
McGill University, and that this task force reported but
three years ago. The task force, consisting of highly
experienced authorities in the field of labour relations
and with a large staff of experts, travelled across Canada
and to the United States, Europe and Australia. It met
with and received the views of the same people and the
same organizations that the Senate committee would
invite. It presented its report, with some 25 volumes of
[Hon. Mr. Goldenberg.]

-June 20,1972

accompanying studies, which are still being examined. I
wonder what novel views and solutions a Senate committee is likely to receive?
Moreover, following the report of the task force, the
Minister of Labour began to draft amendments to the
Canada Labour Code, which are now under consideration
in the other place. I understand that the committee which
has been studying the bill is in the reporting stage. This
committee also has heard many witnesses, as honourable
senators know from the voluminous reports of the proceedings which we have received. In view of this, I again
ask what purpose can a Senate inquiry now serve?
When the amended Canada Labour Code comes before
us we shall have the opportunity to examine the operation
of federal legislation, which is what Senator Haig's
motion calls for. Is it not premature, to say the least, for
the Senate to undertake the proposed inquiry in advance
of a study of the measure which is now before
Parliament?
Some honourable senators may believe that a Senate
inquiry will find a cure-all for strikes. I assure you, there
is no cure-all. The motion before us is clearly attributable
to two recent strikes which affected air transportation in
Canada. They caused inconvenience and annoyance, but
Canada is not alone in facing such problems. Let us not
forget the national coal strike which a few months ago
almost brought the economy of the United Kingdom to a
standstill. It was followed by a railway strike, and within
the last few days by a strike of longshoremen. All of this
happened after the enactment of stringent and unprecedented labour-relations legislation by the United Kingdom
Parliament.
I also remind honourable senators of the recent strike of
west coast longshoremen in the United States, which
lasted 140 days and caused losses in the billions of dollars.
There have been recent strikes even under the authoritarian regimes in Spain and the Soviet Union. It is clear that
no country has found a solution.
When a strike which causes particular inconvenience
occurs there is a tendency to say "there ought to be a
law." Honourable senators know there are laws and, of
course, there must be laws. But we must appreciate the
fact that labour relations are human relations and that
problems in human relations cannot be solved by law
alone. This applies to relations between employers and
employees as it does to relations within the family.
I have often said that, while under the Civil Code of
Quebec, a wife must live with her husband and follow him
wherever he goes, if she does so, it is not because the Civil
Code tells her to, but for other considerations. I submit,
therefore, that laws, however stringent, will not by themselves assure industrial peace. Too often laws are enacted
in this field which cannot be enforced, and legislation
which is not enforceable serves only to bring the law into
disrepute. Accordingly, if it is found that changes in the
law are required they must be such as are enforceable
and will be enforced.
[Translation]
Some changes in law and practice may be found necessary, but I suggest that we look first at some of the human
considerations underlying the current unrest.

SENATE DEBATES

A basic cause of our malaise is that we are living in a
society of rising expectations in which more and more
people want more and more of the good things of life.
Their demands are intensified by mass advertising and
the styles of living it portrays and by banks and finance
companies which encourage and facilitate the incurring
of debt to attain those styles. Rising educational levels
have also increased the desire for more material goods. In
this, workers are no different from other people, and they
look to their trade union leaders to obtain for them the
necessary means to satisfy their wants.
e

[English]
In studying industrial unrest, honourable senators, we
have to take note of a relatively new phenomenon. The
tendency is to associate strikes with industrial workers.
But we all know that strikes are no longer confined to
them. We have in recent years witnessed strikes by teachers, nurses, engineers, policemen and firemen, whether or
not such strikes are permitted by law. As a Quebecer, I
would point out that these strikes have not been confined
to Quebec. Honourable senators have only to read today's
papers to learn of a strike of nurses in Cape Breton.
Moreover, two provinces have experienced strikes by the
medical profession. It is difficult to think of a strike more
dangerous to the health and safety of the nation.
In this connection I draw to the attention of the Senate a
recent speech by a former President of the Manitoba
Medical Association, as reported in the Montreal Star on
May 19, 1972, in a Canadian Press dispatch. It was a
speech delivered in Hamilton, and the relevant part reads
as follows:
A former president of the Manitoba Medical Association suggested yesterday that doctors form unions
and be prepared to strike in order to deal with
governments.
Dr. G. E. Mosher of Winnipeg was addressing the
annual meeting of the Canadian Association of Medical Clinics and the Medical Group Management Association of Canada.
He saidAnd this is in quotes:
"Only the development of medical trade unions, with
a hard-headed willingness to disrupt society to get
their point of view heard, will roll back this obstruction in communications between our political masters
and those of us who are called upon to provide health
care."
I repeat his words: "the development of medical trade
unions with a hard-headed willingness to disrupt society
to get their point of view heard." I hope that when honourable senators criticize the speeches of so-called "labour
bosses," they will also remember this shockingly callous
and irresponsible statement by the former head of a medi-

cal association who, I assume, on graduation took the
Hippocratic oath to heal the sick.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: A medical boss.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: I hold to the view that where the
interests of the parties to a dispute conflict with the overall interests of the community, it is the interests of the
community that must prevail, and this principle must
apply whether the health, safety or welfare of the community are injuriously affected by a trade union, a business organization or a professional association.
[Translation]
In the final analysis, if the parties to the dispute disregard the public interest, the state must intervene to protect it by enforceable measures appropriate to the particular situation. Neither party can afford to ignore the
community except at its peril.
[English]
Honourable senators, I have gone beyond the terms of
the motion before this house because of certain views
which have been expressed in the course of the debate.
Some of my colleagues have flattered me by suggesting
that it is essential that I take part in the proposed inquiry.
I thank them for their confidence and regret that I may
have to disappoint them if we proceed with the inquiry. I
believe I have made it clear that I do not favour such an
inquiry. I have pointed to the recent exhaustive study and
report by the Task Force on Labour Relations. I have also
said that with an amended Canada Labour Code before
the other place, an inquiry by a Senate committee now
would be premature. Finally, I suggest that at a time when
important negotiations in the Public Service are under
way, with more to follow in other areas affecting public
services, such as the railways, a Senate inquiry could be
detrimental in its immediate effect. Let us avoid pouring
oil on troubled waters.
Senator Haig's motion has produced a useful debate,
but circumstances have changed since he presented it.
For example, an amended Canada Labour Code is now
before Parliament. Moreover, new public service labour
relations acts imposing compulsory arbitration have just
been enacted by the Legislatures of Ontario and Alberta,
while Quebec is reviewing its position. I believe that these
changed circumstances, together with the other considerations I have mentioned, call for withdrawal of the motion
at this time.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: May I ask Senator Goldenberg whether he was not guilty of some kind of slip a moment ago
when he suggested that he would not wish to pour oil on
troubled waters? Surely he meant "pour oil on flames." I
imagine he has no objection to pouring oil on troubled
waters.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: I stand corrected by my old
friend.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

APPENDIX

(See p. 504)
THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL FINANCE PRESENTED BY
HON. DOUGLAS D. EVERETT
Tuesday, 20th June, 1972.
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance,
to which were referred the Estimates laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1973, has in
obedience to the order of reference of Thursday, 24th
February, 1972, examined the said Estimates and reports
as follows:
1. Your Committee was authorized by the Senate,
as recorded in the Minutes of the Proceedings of the
Senate of 24th February, 1972, "to examine and report
upon the expenditures proposed by the Estimates laid
before Parliament for the fiscal year ending the 31st
March, 1973, in advance of Bills based upon the said
Estimates reaching the Senate."
2. In obedience to the foregoing, your Committee held
one meeting on the Estimates and heard evidence from
Mr. D. B. Dewar, Deputy Secretary, Program Branch,
Treasury Board, and Mr. B. A. MacDonald, Director
General, Budget Co-ordination, Treasury Board.
3. The Main Estimates for 1972-73 amount to $15,749
million as compared with the Main Estimates of 1971-72
when the amount was $14,352 million. Of the total of
the Main Estimates for 1972-73, $7,640 million are
statutory in nature while $8,109 million represent funds
for which Parliament is asked to provide authority. In
addition to these amounts there are $790 million of nonbudgetary items. The change in budgetary expenditures
as contained in the Main Estimates of 1971-72 and 197273 is $1,397 million or 9.7%. In the past there has been

interest in your Committee in comparing the rate of
growth in expenditures and the rate of growth in GNP.
The most current figure we have is for the rate of
change in GNP between 1971 and 1972, and that was
9.1%.
4. Statutory expenditures account for almost 50% of
the total in the Estimates. These cover some very large
payments, such as the interest on the public debt, fiscal
transfer payments to the provinces and payments to the
provinces under shared cost programs. Statutory expenditures rose by $549 million or 7.7% between the
Main Estimates of 1971-72 and these for 1972-73.
5. Your Committee noted that a change in the method
of accounting for Unemployment Insurance Commission
payments has resulted in a one year reduction in the
Estimates of $180 million which is composed of $111
million in government grants and contributions and $69
million in operating expenditures. The effect of this
change in accounting is to understate the amount of the
budgetary expenditures by some $180 million and your
Committee recommends that in future the changes in
accounting procedures that affect the year to year comparison of Estimates be brought more clearly to the
attention of the reader.
6. Attached to this report is a list which compares
the disaggregated differences between the Main Estimates
for 1972-73 and the total forecast expenditures for 197172. It is to be noted one of the largest increases is to
be found in Health and Welfare which is partially
composed of an $84 million increase in Medicare costs
and a $100 million increase in hospital care costs.
Respectfully submitted.
D. D. Everett,
Chairman.

(English text).

subcommittee is also responsible for reviewing the Estimates of the Senate for each fiscal year.
The function of the Subcommittee on Clerk's Accounts
is to review the detailed statement of receipts and disbursements covering revenues and expenditures for each
fiscal year as submitted by the Clerk of the Senate under
Rule 112 of the Rules of the Senate.
In all cases the report as made by the subcommittee to
the main committee is sent through the main committee to
the Senate as a whole.
While I am on my feet, honourable senators, I should
like to inform the house that the two subcommittees
referred to in the answers which I have just given will be
meeting today. The Subcommittee on Budgets will meet in

Room 256-S immediately the Senate rises, and the Committee on Clerk's Accounts will meet in the office of the
Director of Administration of the Senate, Mr. Dean, one
hour after the house rises. It

is hoped that the whole

committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration will meet on Tuesday of next week.
RULES OF THE SENATE
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON STANDING RULES AND
ORDERS (RECOMMENDING CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE
RULES) ADOPTED

Hon. Hartland de M. Molson: Honourable senators, I

INTERNAL ECONOMY. BUDGETS AND ADMINISTRATION
MEMBERSHIP AND EXPENDITURES OF
SUBCOMMITTEES-QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, yes-

terday there were several questions asked by honourable
Senator Phillips to which I obtained answers. I should like
to give those answers to the house now.
Senator Phillips asked who the members of the subcommittees of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy,
Budgets and Administration were. The answer is as
follows:
The Subcommittee on Budgets is made up of the following members: Senator Smith, Senator Martin, Senator
Flynn, Senator Molson, Senator Grosart and Senator
McDonald. It is chaired by the honourable Senator Smith.
The members of the Subcommittee on Clerk's Accounts
are: Senator Molson, Senator Beaubien and Senator
McElman. Honourable Senator Molson is the chairman of
that committee.
Senator Phillips also asked what had been the authorized expenditures of these "rather intriguing subcommittees." I do not know how intriguing they are, but the
answer is as follows:
There have been no expenditures authorized for or
incurred by the subcommittees. The function of the Subcommittee on Budgets is to review the budgets submitted
by the standing and special committees of the Senate
pursuant to Rule 83A of the Rules of the Senate. This

move, seconded by honourable Senator Basha, that the
Report of the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and
Orders be referred to the Committee of the Whole, and
that the Senate do now resolve itself into Committee of
the Whole.
Motion agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, pursuant
to the order of this honourable house, I leave the Chair.
The honourable Senator Bourget will please take the
Chair of the committee.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

REPORT CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

Hon. Maurice Bourget in the Chair.
* (1410)

The Chairman: The Senate is now sitting in Committee
of the Whole to consider the Report of the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and Orders which recommends
certain amendments to the Rules of the Senate.
Paragraph 1 of the report amends Rule 3. Shall this
paragraph carry?
Hon. Mr. Molson: Mr. Chairman, would it be helpful if I
commented on these recommendations as we go through
the rules?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is the way we should proceed.

June 21, 1972
June 21, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

The Chairman: Is this the wish of the committee?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, in the case of
Rule 3, as you will remember there was an amendment
two years ago which stated that when the rule, or any part
of it, regarding leave for suspension was requested, the
rule, or the particular part, should be specifically
mentioned.
It was also discovered in the course of our experience
that members of the chamber invariably wished to know
why the rule was being suspended. We tried this for a
period of time and we requested that it become part of the
motion put to the chamber by honourable senators, but it
did not work. Therefore, it was decided by your committee at the last meeting that the following amendment be
made:
3. Any rule or part thereof may be suspended without notice by leave of the Senate, the rule or part
thereof proposed to be suspended, and the reason for
the proposed suspension, being distinctly stated.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I would like to
state for the record that I agree with the proposal. However, I was wondering whether this question regarding the
reason for suspension of any rule would require a debate,
and what kind of debate would be required? Is it a debate
in which any member of the Senate can participate more
than once? Up to this point there has been no problem.
But for future studies of the Standing Committee on
Standing Rules and Orders, I think I should mention that
from time to time the occasion arises where we discuss at
length the validity of a reason, and members of the Senate
speak more than once.
Hon. Mr. Carter: I notice that Rule 3 on page 2 does not
refer to the French version. It does not amend the French
version.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Mr. Chairman, this happens automatically. When rules are amended they are amended in both
official languages. This has been the practice of the Rules
Committee. However, it has also been the practice to deal
with the text of one language only in the chamber.
The Chairman: Is Senator Carter satisfied?
Hon. Mr. Carter: Yes, I am.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 1 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Paragraph 2.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators will remember
that this was included in the last report submitted by the
Rules Committee. There was a good deal of misunderstanding about the reasons for this recommendation, and
it was referred back to committee and reconsidered by it.
I may inform honourable senators that the committee has
not changed its mind in any respect. The principle
involved here is to endeavour to have our daily order of
business deal first with matters which may be considered
the most important. There have been occasions on which
inquiries and motions have, quite rightly, taken up considerable time but, coming ahead of the Orders of the Day,
they have preceded legislation. It has been generally
25312-33

agreed that the first function of the chamber is to deal
with legislation.
The other effect of this is to place the question period
before inquiries and motions. If honourable senators will
reflect, they will recall that on occasion they have waited
through an hour or more of inquiries and motions before
being able to pose a one-sentence question to the Leader
of the Government or the chairman of a committee. The
effect of moving the question period ahead is that questions will be in a more natural place in the routine proceedings of the day. The fundamental issue, however, is to
place any legislation on our order of business ahead of
items of the nature of a motion or an inquiry.
Hon. Mr. McIlraith: Honourable senators, it is with a
great deal of hesitation that I rise to pose a question
concerning these proposed amendments. This is for two
reasons: One, because I first saw the proposed amendments at lunch time and therefore was not able to fully
study them. The second reason is that I am very inexperienced and lacking in knowledge of the rules and practices of this honourable house. I therefore approach the
subject with some trepidation.
I would like to ask for clarification of one point with
respect to paragraph 2. It concerns me because of some
experiences in another place. It is proposed, as I understand the effect of the amendment, that motions will be
placed last in the order of business as set out in Rule 19.
The definition of motions contained in the rule governing
definitions gives a very wide interpretation. It seems to
me that placing motions at the end of the order of business each day will handicap the chamber to a considerable extent. I have no doubt that there is some explanation of this and that the committee has considered it. I
would like to hear that explanation. "Motions" embraces,
among other things, such matters affecting the conduct of
the chamber itself as the conduct of its business, hours of
sittings, and when and how a particular legislative item
will be dealt with. In view of this, if the one having the
responsibility of leading the Senate, or any other honourable senator, wishes to put forward a motion concerning
the conduct or business of the chamber, he can easily be
denied the right to have it dealt with by senators who wish
to pursue the matters on the Orders of the Day and avoid
coming to the subject until it is too late.
0 (1420)

I had previously understood that motions were dealt
with in the early part of the order of business in any
parliamentary chamber, and before the chamber dealt
with the major business of the day, because those motions
might involve matters concerning how the business of the
house was to be conducted. I would be grateful if the
chairman of the committee could explain what I obviously
do not understand, namely, why in this house motions are
inserted in what under ordinary circumstances would
appear to be an unusual position, at the end of the Orders
of the Day.
Hon. Mr. Molson: I appreciate the way in which Senator
McIlraith worded his question. I am a little disturbed that
he, with all his experience, should have any diffidence
whatsoever. For me to answer his question is perhaps a
little ridiculous, as his knowledge of such matters is much
greater than my own.

SENATE DEBATES
I would say only that in the discussions on this matter in
committee, which first occurred prior to the last report,
which was over a year ago, and again on this last occasion, it was felt that if a motion or an inquiry ought to
appear early in the business of the day, it was a simple
matter to move that this be done, and that no serious
problem would occur. In this chamber we have repeatedly
deferred items "until later this day," and quite often have
reverted to items on the Order Paper which had been
called earlier in the day but had not been proceeded with.
I do not think there has been any occasion when, if
necessary, an urgent motion could not be dealt with ahead
of other business. Quite often inquiries and other matters
have kept the chamber occupied for perhaps two hours
before the legislative business on the Order Paper has
been dealt with. I hope that answers my honourable
friend's question.
Hon. Mr. Mcllraith: I thank the chairman of the committee for his explanation, but it still leaves part of my
question unanswered. I fully appreciate his reference to
inquiries, but his reply did not deal with the narrower
point about motions, and motions only. It is my understanding that the rules of this chamber, as they have been
applied, have been largely free from restrictions. But here
we are introducing what is, in effect, the right of veto over
the conduct of business in the chamber.
I have an abhorrence of rigidity of rules, acquired, I
might say, for good reason in the other place. It appears to
me that in correcting something, we might inadvertently
be embodying a new doctrine which, I am sure, all honourable senators would not find tasteful. It is the doctrine
of any individual having, virtually, the right of veto. I am
sure that is not intended. Perhaps my honourable friend
would bear with me and explain a little more fully the
narrow point of procedure with respect to motions.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, this matter was
fully discussed in committee. I am sorry my honourable
friend did not attend the committee meeting. The Leader
of the Government, the Deputy Leader of the Government
and the Leader of the Opposition were in attendance and
have discussed this matter fully. I do not think they foresee any problem.
Perhaps the Leader of the Government or the Deputy
Leader would care to answer this question.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, there is one
remark I might make which could be of assistance to
Senator McIlraith in his understanding of the procedures
we have followed in this chamber. Motions dealing with
the work of the house are not normally dealt with under
the item Motions; they are dealt with under Notices of
Motion. If this amendment is adopted, the item of Notices
of Motion will remain in the same position as it has
occupied in the past. I think all motions dealing with the
work of this chamber and the work of committees are
dealt with under Notices of Motion and not under
Motions.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Perhaps I might help Senator McIlraith in his difficulty by suggesting to him that there is a
difference in our rules between a substantive motion,
which is dealt with in one of the suggested amendments
[Hon. Mr. Molson.]

June 21, 1972

which we will come to later, and motions of a "merely
formal or uncontentious character." (Page 20, Rule 46(s).)
The motions referred to in the Orders of the Day are
those for which notice must be given. There has always
been a close link between Notices of Motion and Motions
coming up as a result of notice having been given. Our
rules provide for one day's notice, two days' notice, and,
on occasion, no notice. The type of motion that Senator
McIlraith is concerned about would normally come under
Rule 46(s) which reads:
other motions of a merely formal or uncontentious
character.
As those motions require no notice, obviously they can be
moved at any time. That is my interpretation of the rules.
I repeat, the motion referred to in this suggested amendment is only the type of motion for which notice is
required.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 2 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 3 carry?
Hon. Mr. Molson: This follows on from what we were
just discussing. it simply sets out an order of precedence
for these items as the Committee views their importance.
If honourable senators will look at Rule 21 they will see
that it provides:
Unless otherwise ordered by the Senate, orders of
the day take precedence according to priority as
follows:
(a) orders of the day for the third reading of bills;
(b) an order of the day which was under consideration at the time of adjournment;
(c) orders of the day which had not been reached at
the time of adjournment;
(d) remaining orders of the day.
This amendment in paragraph 3 sets out the order of
precedence for these items.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 3 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 4 carry?
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, there was some
question raised as to whether under Rule 36 there was any
way of adjourning a debate. In the rule as it stands there
is no specific provision for adjourning a debate. This is
really tidying up that rule so that it is specifically stated in
paragraph (2) of Rule 36 that:
* (1430)

A motion to adjourn a debate shall be deemed to be
a motion to postpone.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 4 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Paragraph 5.
Hon. Mr. Molson: As Senator Grosart said a few
moments ago, there is no actual rule covering the making
of a substantive motion in our rules. This is a correction,

June 21. 1972
June 21. 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

and in Rule 45 we recommend. the insertion of a new
paragraph (h), which reads:
for the making of a substantive motion.
A substantive motion requires one day's notice, which is
spefled out in paragraph (h).
Hon. Mr. Martin: I arn not clear about the lettering here.
Would that not be (i)?
Han. Mr. MaIson: The present paragraph (h) is re-lettered (i), and goes to the bottom; paragraph (i) is inserted
there. The present paragraph (h) becomes the bottom
paragraph. That is a catch-ail phrase, as you wlll see,
which reads:
for any purpose to which neither rule 44 nor rule 46
applies
This would be a specific purpose, the making of a substantive motion. That is under (h). Then under (i) would be
the general application:
for any purpose to which neither rule 44 nor rule 46
applies.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: A good question and a good answer.
Hon. Mr. Grosaîrt: Perhaps for the record it should be
pointed out at this time that we have a defimition in our
rules of what I cailed a "substantive" motion. Senator
Molson cails it a "substantive" motion. It means "an
independent motion, neither incidentai to nor relevant to
a proceeding or Order of the Day already before the
Senate." (Page 6, Rule 5(t).) I think Senator Mcflraith will
be happier because there is this definition of "substantive" motion.
Han. Mr. Choquette: Both pronunciations are correct
according to the Oxford dictionary.
Han. Mr. Faruey: Senator Grosart takes refuge in the
Oxford dictionary.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I now cail it a "substantive" motion, in
deference to the chairman. I point out that there is this
distinction, and this is the type of motion that requires one
day's notice.
The Chairman: Shahl paragraph 5 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Paragraph 6.,
Hon. Mr. Maison: This matter was brought to the attention of the comrnittee. It had been the subject of a great
deal of discussion before the last revision of our rules. At
that time this rule, as amended, appiied. Committees were
appointed for a session, and it was feit then that this made
for too much change in the membership of the committees, that it would be much better if a committee carried
its membership through a whole Parliament. Accordingly,
the rule was changed so that when senators were appointed to a comrnittee they were appointed for a whole parliament. Since that change was made experience has shown
that perhaps this was not a wise move, that it more or less
froze the situation-if I may use that term-and that, with
the length of modern sessions, it may be better to go back
to the old rule under which committees were appointed
every session.

This was thoroughly discussed and it is safe to say that
the committee was in unanimous agreement that we
should go back to the position where ail standing committees are appointed for a session. This means that at the
beginnmng of each session we would go through the process of nomination of senators to serve on these committees. The members of the committees would then meet
and appoint their chairmen. In practice, such committees
would last for about a year, which seemed to be long
enough.
The Chairman: Shail paragraph 6 carry?
Han. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 7 carry?
Hou. Mr. Maison: Paragraph 7 iists those committees the
membership of which has been changed to conform with
the recommendation of the Rules comrnittee that committees in future consist of 20 senators plus the two ex-of ficio
members of ail committees, that is, the Leader of the
Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. They have been spelled out at length
here.
In actuai fact, the difference is only in the size of the
committee membership and, with that change in membershîp, the reduction in the quorum-which, in every case, is
reduced from seven members to five. We discussed at
length the fact that the mernbership of the Senate is not;
large enough to permit 30 members on ail these
committees.
A paper was presented at our committee meeting showing that we actually have a totai membership, on standing
joint committees-those are committees in which we join
with the House of Commons-and standing committees of
the Senate, of 278. This has nothing to do with any speciai
committees. The membership of the Senate last month
was 92. Ail honourabie senators know what the active
membership is and what the actuai attendance is. It is
necessary only to look at the report of the daily proceedings to see that, and to realize that 278 rnemberships for 92
potentiai members is simply too many.
The committee therefore agreed that we shouid reduce
the membership of these committees from 30 to what is in
fact 22, because it will be 20 plus the two leaders who are
ex-officio members. If we are to make our committees
effective, I suggest that we have no other reai choice.
Hon. Mr. Cook: If this rule cornes into force and the
membership of these committees is suddenly reduced to
20, what happens to the 10 members who wouid then be
superfluous?
Han. Mr. Maison: At the end of this report you wiii note
it is recommended that these changes corne into effect at
the beginnrng of the next session. Therefore, it would be
an autornatic process.
Han. Mr. Cook: Thank you.
The Chairman: Shail paragraph 7 carry?
Hon. Senatais: Carried.
The Chaliman: Shall paragraph 8 carry?
0 (1440)
Han. Mr. Maison: This is simply to clarify the fact that
the recommended membership is 20 select senators in

addition to the two leaders. In other words, the total
membership will in fact be 22. At the moment it is 30 but it
will become 22, comprising 20 plus the Leader of the
Government and the Leader of the Opposition.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 8 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 9 carry?

Hon. Mr. Molson: This is to correct a very glaring omission in our rules. At the moment there is no distinct
provision for the appointment of a special committee. The
only authority we have, if it can be called that, is in Rule
44(d) which requires two days' notice for the appointment
of a special committee. That is the only rule that so much
as acknowledges the existence of a special committee. So
paragraph 9 is designed specifically to provide for the
creation by this chamber of special committees.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 9 carry?
Hon. Mr. Cook: Mr. Chairman, may I ask Senator
Molson if there is any limit to the number of senators who
can serve on a special committee? Is there any stipulation
as to the membership of special committees?
Hon. Mr. Molson: There is no limitation whatsoever,
senator. Each special committee will be the creation of the
chamber, and in creating the committee the Senate will
not only specify its size but will spell out the terms of
reference, the responsibilities, and also to what extent the
special committee is authorized to do such things as print
its proceedings, call witnesses, incur expenses, and so on.
In each case the terms of reference will include the size of
the committee, its quorum, and its responsibilities.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: While we are on the subject of
housekeeping, is there any need to make any changes with
respect to rules governing the establishment of joint committees, or is that sufficiently covered at the present time?
Hon. Mr. Molson: I think it is properly covered right
now, Senator Cameron.
The Chairman: Shall paragraph 9 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall the penultimate paragraph recommending that the foregoing amendments come into force
at the commencement of the next session of Parliament
carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall the last paragraph carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall I report without amendment the
report of the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and
Orders, recommending certain changes in the Rules?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

The sitting of the Senate was resumed.
The Hon. the Speaker: The sitting is resumed.

Hon. Mr. Bourget: Mr. Speaker, the Committee of the
Whole to which was referred the report of the Standing
Committee on Standing Rules and Orders has taken the
said report into consideration, and now reports the same
without amendment.
Hon. Mr. MoIson: Honourable senators, I move that the
report of the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and

Hon. Mr. Flynn: The reason for that is, of course, that
the Senate is unanimous in this matter.

are in a frame of mind to pass the report now.

Report adopted.
PUBLIC SERVANTS
IMPROPRIETY OF MAKING SPEECHES ON MATTERS OF
POLICY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, June 14, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of honourable Senator
Forsey calling the attention of the Senate to the impropriety of public servants making speeches on matters of
policy.
Hon. M. Grattan O'Leary: Honourable senators, it is
always an ordeal to follow the almost awesome scholarship of my friend, Senator Forsey. Last week Senator
Argue complained that what he called the communications media, which is a new name for the press, paid little
attention to the proceedings in this chamber. As an old
journalist I should like to say that if we could get more
speeches of the character of that delivered last week by
Senator Forsey the press would beat a path to our galleries. The press is not going to report the innocuous proceedings that too often take place in this house. The press
is not concerned, not at all concerned, with cliché-ridden
motions such as we have here from time to time.
I am interested in the inquiry of Senator Forsey,
although I feel he should have widened his territory a
little. The inquiry reads in part:
-the impropriety of public servants making speeches
on matters of policy.
In due course in my speech I will ask him why he restricted his motion to speeches. Surely, written articles, books,
and things which amount to little more than election
propaganda should be prohibited as well.
* (1450)

But before I go further, honourable senators, I should
like to address a remark to the distinguished Senator

Lapointe, who followed Senator Forsey and intimated, if
she did not say it explicity, that those of us who might be
critical of Mr. Carson are moved by motives based on
hostility to the French fact in Canada. I would say to
Senator Lapointe that I am an exile from Quebec and I
yield to no person in the Senate or outside of the Senate,
or, indeed, anywhere in Canada, in my admiration for the
French fact in Canada, for the glory that it has been and
the glory that I hope it always will be.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. O'Leary: As a journalist, when I was writing
editorials for the Ottawa Journal for 30, 40 or even more
years, I complained about public servants getting into the
area of policy in their speeches and writings. I remember
one occasion when Mr. Graham Towers, then Governor of
the Bank of Canada, made a speech somewhere in this
country and told the Canadian people it was time for
them to tighten their belts. I said to Mr. Towers that he
should mind his own business; it was not his business to
tell the Canadian people that they should do this, that or
the other thing; he was there to administer the Bank of
Canada Act, and that was all he was or should be concerned with.
I must say that what my friend calls the "press media"
has often been at fault in this sort of thing. For example,
when Mr. Donald Gordon was appointed head of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, immediately the press
started to refer to him as a czar. He was not a czar,
honourable senators. His job was to administer an act of
Parliament given to him to administer, and outside of that
he had no business at all.
But this sort of thing has grown in Canada. I go back a
great number of years in observing political affairs in this
country, and I often wonder what Sir Wilfrid Laurier
would have said to his able and gifted secretary, Mr.
Ernest Lamaire, if he had started making speeches and
writing articles about public policy. I wonder what Sir
Robert Borden would have said to his secretary, a very
able man too, Mr. A. E. Blount, if he started making
speeches or writing articles about public men or public
policies.
This is all changed today, and the only criticism I have
to make of the speech delivered by my friend, Senator
Forsey, is that he dealt almost exclusively with Mr.
Carson. I agree with him, and I add a hearty amen to
everything he said about Mr. Carson, but I think he
should have widened the area covered by his speech and
dealt with men, some of them from the Prime Minister's
office, who daily are dealing with public questions and
public men, and not only making speeches about them but
writing articles in foreign publications such as Foreign
Affairs, and putting out publications that can only be
characterized as campaign literature.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudière): Do you say they do
not have the right to do this?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: That is utterly irrelevant, as are most
of the interruptions of my honourable friend. It is not a
question of right or wrong; it is a question of whether they
have the right to indulge in that sort of thing at all.
Frankly, I do not care what is written in ForeignAffairs;
it has become so dull today that nobody reads it. It is
financed and practically owned by a few old bankers now
retired who have an office on Park Avenue. But I do
object strenuously, when an election is in the offing, to a
member of the Prime Minister's staff-and I will name
him because he is not anonymous, Mr. Ivan Head-writing
an article on Mr. Trudeau in which he practically says
that he is a cross between Jesus and Lincoln. Honourable
senators, this is utter nonsense. This should not be
allowed in this country, and this is why I am surprised
that my friend, Senator Forsey-and God knows he has
never been afraid to speak his mind-deliberately omitted

Mr. Ivan Head from the criticism which he levelled
against Mr. Carson.
I think Mr. Carson's position is absurd. Of course, we all
want our civil service to be representative of all the races
in this country, but how do you achieve that? When he
says, "We will make it representative," does not that
involve a quota system? How do you make a distinction
between a representative system and a quota system? If
they are going to make it representative, then you have to
have a quota, and we cannot have a civil service based on
quotas because this principle could be included in our
public lives.
It began with Confederation when Sir John A. Macdonald was forming his cabinet. One of the first priorities
that he adhered to was that all races, all regions of the
country, and all religions should be represented in cabinet, and he was so insistent on this point that two of the
giants of Confederation, Charles Tupper and Thomas
D'Arcy McGee were excluded from that cabinet.
We have a quota system in the Senate-although I must
say it does not seem to affect the Liberals, unfortunatelyand there are representatives of various religions, various
races, and various regions of this country. But while you
can do that in a Senate, in a legislature, or even in a
cabinet you cannot do it in a civil service-at least not if
you have a merit system.
I often wonder how many of our young pundits who
write and speak all the time on public affairs know that
the merit system in this country was the work of a Conservative prime minister. We had a Civil Service Commission
before that, and Mr. Adam Short was the chairman of it.
But Sir Robert Borden brought the first true merit system
into being in this country, and he thought so highly of that
system that he made one of his own cabinet ministers, Dr.
Roche, the first chairman. This is the merit system. It is
based and must be based on the simple proposition that
you hired the man best capable of doing the job, and,
honourable senators, you simply cannot do that under a
quota system.
I want the French fact to be recognized in Canada, and I
must say that over the years that I have sat in the Parliamentary press gallery the French fact was not recognized,
and those who were mostly to blame for this situation
were the French Canadian members themselves. In all the
years I sat in the press gallery I never heard Sir Wilfrid
Laurier say a word in French, and I remember on one
occasion when a question arose about bilingual money,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier pooh-poohed the idea and he said, "I
have never known of one of my compatriots who could
not understand, use and recognize a $20 bill in English."
The French fact in Canada, in the years that I sat in the
Parliamentary press gallery, was recognized by the existence of a translation system, and a poor one at that. But
the members from Quebec were themselves responsible,
or mainly responsible, for that situation in that they did
not insist upon their rights. The right was always there. A
speech in French was always in order. However, it was
weeks and months before you heard a member from the
Province of Quebec rise to address the chamber in
French. I have been complaining about this matter over
and over again, and I repeat it now.

SENATE DEBATES
* (1500)

I glory in the French fact in Canada. I hope it will
continue; I pray it will continue. As an exile from the
Province of Quebec I myself do not believe the people
from that province would ever vote to separate from
Canada. They are a part of our lives, and a great part. I
dislike hearing Canadians, whether they are Anglo-Saxons, Scots, or of Irish ancestry, attacking the position
which the Province of Quebec is taking at this time. We
cannot do that. I sat here during the conscription era and,
once again, Anglo-Saxon Canadians did not understand.
They have never understood the French mind. I will add
that my party, the Conservative Party, was as much to
blame as anyone else. I am not making a partisan speech.
I am saying that I want French Canadians and Canadians
of any other race to have full access to civil service jobs in
Canada. However, giving them full access is not to say
that we should move to an equal quota system. Of course,
they should have access. But if they lack training, if they
lack the capacity to do the job in this age of technology
where a lot of skill is required then, no matter what their
racial origin is, they should not be given the job. This
applies to English-speaking Canadians as well as Frenchspeaking Canadians. The merit system is the merit
system, and if we start tampering with it and frittering it
away we will lose it. I say God help the Civil Service of
Canada if we lose the merit system.
I have said, perhaps, more than I intended. However, I
hope that Senator Forsey and people like him-and it will
not always be easy to find men who can put the position
as he put it the other day with that skill, clarity, and
scholarship which characterizes all his speeches in this
chamber-will continue to raise their voices.
In conclusion, I should like to say to Senator Forsey that
if I had the influence which he has with the Prime MinisterSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: This is not a laughing matter. He is an
old comrade in arms of the Prime Minister, and today he
is still a comrade in arms, even if it is under a different
flag. If I had his influence with the Prime Minister I would
go to him and ask: "Mr. Prime Minister, are you sure that
somebody near to you is not helping to motivate Mr.
Carson in the position he is taking?" I would say that to
him. I could be wrong. However, there is a feeling in this
country, and let us make no mistake about it, that somebody high in the Prime Minister's office, or somebody
near to him, is behind those who, in their mad and frantic
anxiety to consolidate the Liberal Party in the Province of
Quebec, are endangering national unity.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudière): My friend, Senator
O'Leary, referred to Sir Wilfrid Laurier. During the first
war Sir Wilfrid met a young Tory, as Senator O'Leary is
today, who said to him: "If I had your authority and your
prestige in the Province of Quebec, I would go to the
French Canadians and tell them to enlist." Sir Wilfrid
answered: "If I was your age, my friend, I would not go to
them. I would just enlist."
Hon. Miss Lapointe: Honourable senators, I will say a
few words in English so I am better understood by my
honourable colleague, Senator O'Leary.
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary.]

June 21, 1972

[Translation]
The Hon. the Speaker: Order, please. I believe Senator
Lapointe has already spoken on the subject, and we must
respect our rules. Rules 28 stipulates that a senator shall
not speak twice to a question except in explanation of a
material part of his speech in which he may have been
misunderstood.
Unless I am mistaken, Senator Lapointe wishes to put a
question and not introduce new considerations pertaining
to her speech.
[English]
Hon. Mr. Choquette: The honourable senator wishes to
ask a question. She does not need consent to ask a
question.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudière): This was the interpretation given by the Chair when the honourable senator
rose to speak.
Hon. Miss Lapointe: I will ask only one question. Does
Senator O'Leary think that all English-speaking civil servants have been placed in their positions on account of
their merit?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: No, I certainly do not. I am afraid we
have not reached that degree of perfection in the government of this country.
The Hon. the Speaker: This inquiry is now considered
debated.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Before the debate is closed, might I
mention a matter in regard to a statement of Senator
O'Leary?
The Hon. the Speaker: I think we should proceed under
the rules. Senator Forsey has already spoken on this
inquiry. There is no question with regard to closing the
debate on the inquiry. Under Rule 28 he has the right to
rise at this time and explain certain matters, or clarify
certain points which he has already made, but he must not
introduce new arguments at this time.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: No, I merely wish to clarify two points.
First of all, I mentioned articles as well as speeches; and
secondly, I was talking about public officials and not
about people like executive assistants or whatever they
may be called. I think they are in a somewhat different
category. I do not wish to argue the point with Senator
O'Leary. However, I think there is a distinction to be
made between people who are executive assistants and
those who are members of the Public Service of Canada.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: There is a distinction without a
difference.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate adjourned.

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, this
item has been standing in my name for some considerable
time. At one time I thought I might make a contribution to
the debate, but I do not think I can add anything to what
has been said. In view of the fact that we are now

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, with
leave of the Senate, and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(g), I
move that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Monday, June 26, 1972, at 2 o'clock in the
afternoon.
Honourable senators, perhaps a word of explanation
would be in order. It is my understanding that tomorrow
will be a government business day in the other place, and
I would hope that some legislation might come to us. It is
anticipated that at the end of next week we shall be
starting our summer recess, and therefore we have come
to the conclusion that we should sit next Monday instead
of Tuesday. Because there is a dinner to be held Monday
evening, we propose to sit in the afternoon, at which time
we will be able to start dealing with any government
legislation that should come from the other place in the
meantime.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And if we have nothing else to do we
can prepare our appetite.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Some of our appetites are quite keen
right now.
Motion agreed to.

That the following senators be appointed to serve on

the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture,
namely, the honourable Senators Argue, Benidickson,

Hon. Mr. Martin: In some places the speeches produced
fruit.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, in Assiniboia.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The Leader of the Government and
the Leader of the Opposition are ex officio members of
the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture as they
are on all other committees. I am looking forward to their
speeches on agriculture.
Motion agreed to.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, since this
motion has carried, might I advise the members on the

Hon. Mr. McDonald: I had a private conversation with
Senator Molson before the house went into session this
afternoon, and he advised me that he would rather purchase some of the raw products rather than grow them.

However, since the motion has carriedHon. Mr. Flynn: No it bas not carried. I am not sure
whether the names of the Leader of the Government and
the Leader of the Opposition are on that list. Of course,
you will remember that Senator Martin was the agricultural expert on the Liberal side in the House of Commons

for the adoption of the Report of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance which was authorized to

examine and report upon the expenditures proposed by
the Estimates laid before Parliament for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1973.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, the report

of the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance
for 1972-73 appears on page 510 of the Debates of the
Senate for last Tuesday, June 20.
* (1410)

Honourable senators will find there some comments by
the chairman, Senator Everett. To these I have the honour
to add a few comments of my own which may be of
interest in view of the fact, of course, that we are expecting an appropriation bill next week and the Senate committee is charged with the responsibility of reporting on
the Estimates before any appropriation bill is considered

by the Senate. I need hardly say that parliamentary

approval of the Estimates, in whole or in part, is a necessary precondition of the passing of any appropriation bill.
The Estimates on which the Senate committee's report
is based are projected expenditures, budgetary and some

non-budgetary, totalling-I will be using round figuresapproximately $15.7

billion. Now, just in case anyone

might have the impression that this enormous figure of

$15.7 billion can be regarded as the total intended spend-

June 22, 1972
June 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

ing by the federal government next year, I should perhaps
add four qualifications.
The first is that the figure of $15.7 billion does not
include certain non-budgetary items amounting to
approximately $790 million, bringing the total immediately up to approximately $16.5 billion. Secondly, the Estimates were prepared and presented before the presentation of the last budget by the Minister of Finance on May
8. If my arithmetic is correct, the additional changes in the
government spending intentions announced in that
budget would raise the figure to over $17 billion.
This is not all. One of the difficulties that the committee
has always faced in examining the budgetary Estimates is
this very fact that they are not all-inclusive of government
spending intentions. Other figures are now available and
are to be found in a document appended to the budget
speech, which is entitled "Federal Government Revenue
and Expenditure on a National Accounts Basis." This
shows the federal government forecast of expenditures
for 1972-73 as $20 billion, which is the realistic figure that
I believe parliamentarians should keep in mind when
discussing an appropriation bill or the Estimates. We can
add an amount, comparatively small in relation to the
figures which I have been mentioning, of $180 million as a
result of some bookkeeping legerdemain which appears in
the budget Estimates. Senator Everett commented on it,
but the fact, of course, is that although these Estimates
are intended to give an accurate statement of government
spending intentions, there is that $180 million anticipated
as due from the government as its share of payment into
the Unemployment Insurance Fund. This is left entirely
out of the $15.7 billion figure which I have given because
of a change in the Unemployment Insurance Act by which
the government will make its contribution at the end of
the year, when the deficit is determined.
Therefore, I say that we are dealing with approximately
$20 billion of government spending intentions in the next
year. There has been a custom in recent years of the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance to
attempt to relate these expenditures to the growth of our
gross national product. The purpose of doing that is to ask
the essential question: where does the money come from,
where will it come from?
Each year we are dealing with very substantial
increases in government spending at all levels, federal,
provincial and municipal, and obviously the only place
that money can be provided to accommodate these
increases in government spending is from increases in
national productivity. So one would assume that all governments, including the federal government, would not
increase expenditures beyond the increase, in current
dollar terms, in national productivity.
This, I am sorry to say, is not so. Senator Everett gave
two figures, the projected increase in current dollars of
GNP for this year, as indicated by the Minister of
Finance, which represents an increase of 9.1 per cent.
Sehator Everett, in correctly examining the figures in the
Blue Book in relation to this, said that the increase-and
this is only in relation to the $15.7 billion-would amount
to 9.7 per cent. Therefore, as a starter, on the bottom level,
we know that it is the intention of the federal government
25312-34

to spend more than the national productivity will provide,
which means, of course, added deficit.
If we take into account the other figures that I have
mentioned, I would suggest that the real increase in government spending this year is over 11 per cent, not the 9.7
per cent in the Blue Book. This is so because more recent
tables show that the comparable figure to this year's $2
billion is $18 billion for last year, which means an increase
of $2 billion, which I suggest is 11 per cent.
It is only fair to say that some part of this, particularly
the non-budgetary items, may be or will be recoverable,
because these figures include loans, investments and
advances, most of which go to crown corporations.
On the other hand, from the point of view of the economy, it is important that there should be some relation
between increases in national productivity and the
amount which the government finds necessary to extract
from that productivity to support its programs and policies. It is not all nonrecoverable, but, of course, much of it
is.

This raises a question which is concerning a great many
peopleHon. Mr. Martin: Concerning what?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: -which is concerning a great many
people, particularly economists. It is whether there is a
limit to the growth in the demands of the public sector,
vis-à-vis the private sector. There are those who are in
favour of increasing the demands on national productivity for public sector use, and there are those who hold
other views. But no matter how we look at it, it seems to
me to come back to the fable of the golden goose.
* (1420)

I do not know if there is any other way of looking at the
major factors in the economy than to say that any money
expended by the public sector-that is, by the government-can only come from productivity engendered by
the private sector. As far as I know, there is no study
being made with respect to this problem. Perhaps this is a
study that our own committee might undertake. At the
present time we do not know, as far as I have been able to
determine, what percentage of the total productivity is
now controlled by government. I have mentioned the
figure of $20 billion as the federal government expenditure. We can add to that at least another $20 billion as the
expenditures of the two other levels of government, bringing us to $40 billion of the national productivity which is
probably in the neighborhood of $100 billion. But this
again is only the start of the equation. Beyond these
particular expenditures that appear in the various tables I
have indicated are all the other extractions from national
productivity which are placed under the control of government or government corporations of one kind or
another. If the arithmetic was done at the present timeand it would be a difficult and laborious job, but I think it
should be done-it would certainly show that governments-the public sector-now have under their control
more than 50 per cent of national productivity. I am not
arguing as to whether this should be so or not. What I am
saying at this time is that it should be the subject of very
serious study and we should not arrive at a point of
catastrophe or disaster in this respect without at least

SENATE DEBATES

foreseeing it. So often in such matters we discover the
facts after the facts have led us into trouble.
Senator Everett gave some indication of the functional
areas which account for these increases in the Blue Book.
It has been customary in the past also to make comparisons department by department. We in the committee
selected the seven departments which did account for the
largest increases in the budgetary Estimates.
Honourable senators might be interested in a brief rundown. The Department of National Health and Welfare
Estimates are up $240 million. This increase is accounted
for mainly by an increase of $140 million in hospital costs
and $110 million in the costs of medical care. It is not $150
million as there are some contra accounts.
The Treasury Board Estimates are up $145 million.
There is some difficulty in accounting for that as part of
this is in a contingency fund which has been set up prior
to the passing of a bill relating to student summer employment; $25 million of it is for the extension of bilingualism
in the Public Service.
The Department of Regional Economic Expansion Estimates are up $79 million, largely due to incentive grants to
industries to locate in keeping with the policies and programs of that department.
The Department of the Secretary of State Estimates are
up $85 million, mainly accounted for by the federal government's costs in the subsidization of secondary education. These are transfers to the provinces in keeping with
the federal government's undertaking to fund 50 per cent
of the cost of post-secondary education.
For the RCMP the Estimates are up $43 million. This is
accounted for largely by salary increases, increases in
population and increase in responsibilities of the force.
For the Department of National Defence the projected
expenditures are up $43 million, the main reason there
being the move towards what is called pay parity in the
Armed Forces; that is, for pay entitlements equivalent to
comparable positions in the Public Service other than the
Armed Forces.
With the Post Office we had some difficulty in finding
an accounting for the situation. This seems to me to be
still rather obscure. It is still costing the federal government something like $70 million or $80 million a year. We
all agree that some efficiency improvements have been
made. We looked for indications that these might have
had some important effect on Post Office deficits, but we
could not find evidence of that.
Although the figure is not in the Blue Book but is
incidental to it, there is an increase in the public debt. The
total figures of the increases in the last fiscal year may
indicate to honourable senators that there is some validity
to my concern about government spending running year
after year in excess of the rate of GNP increase. The
public debt of Canada is now $47 billion. This is not an
unmanageable figure, but in the last fiscal year the
increase was $4.6 billion, the largest increase in peacetime
that we have had.
The status of some of the large government-operated
funds may be of interest to honourable senators. The Old
Age Security Fund had receipts of about $2.1 billion and
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

June 22, 1972

expenditures of about $2.2 billion, a deficit of about $85
million.
The Canada Pension Plan fund had receipts of $1.1
billion, $167 million in excess of pay-outs.
The Unemployment Insurance Fund seems to be
approaching a dangerous stage. Its reserves are now only
$15 million, and these reserves dropped from $351 million
a year ago.
The loans to crown corporations now stand at $1.249
billion, an increase in the year of $128 million.
Loans to "Others" now stand at $513 million, an
increase of $270 million in the last year.
The Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation indebtedness now to the government-money which we would
all hope would be recoverable in full, or close to thatstands at $6 billion.
The Canadian National Railways-Air Canada account
shows $2.5 billion in loans; the Farm Credit Board $1.25
billion in loans; the St. Lawrence Seaway $700 million;
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, $617 million the
Export Development Corporation $500 million; loans to
provincial governments, $500 million; and "Others," $1.8
billion. Honourable senators may be interested to note
that amongst those there is the 1946 loan to the United
Kingdom, which now stands at $997 million. The United
Kingdom, of course, is paying back every year on the
principal involved.
* (1430)

Honourable senators may also be interested in the fact
that there is a new table out, prepared recently, which
shows where the money comes from. Of total federal
government revenue, 44 per cent now comes from the
personal income tax; 15 per cent from corporations tax;
14 per cent from sales tax; 7 per cent from customs duties;
6 per cent from excise taxes; 3 per cent from other taxes,
and 11 per cent from non-tax sources.
As to where the money goes, this table shows that 24 per
cent goes on Health and Welfare; 15 per cent on Economic
Development and Support; 13 per cent on Public Debt; 12
per cent on Defence; 9 per cent on Fiscal Transfer Payments, (those are not personal transfer payments but payments to the provinces); 7 per cent on Transport and
Communications; 4 per cent on Education Assistance, and
16 per cent on other expenditures.
I place some of those figures before honourable senators, as I indicated in starting, to place in context the
appropriation bill which will come before us next week,
we presume.
In closing, I would like to say that as a member of that
committee I believe I am expressing the concern of other
members, and certainly of the chairman, that Parliament
as a whole does not seem to be doing an adequate job of
examination and assessment of the Estimates and therefore an adequate job of the control of public finance. This
view is growing in the other place; it was expressed by
some leading members of that place in the last week, in
vigorous terms.
The role of the Senate is obviously the lesser one. The
House of Commons has problems of its own, with its rules
and with its time, in that time is not available. I take it that

June 22, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

they are not in any way satisfied that the new system of
referring Estimates to committees automatically on
second reading is working as well as had been hoped. We
are all anxious to see the House of Commons finding ways
and means to make more adequate the parliamentary
control of government expenditure. Of course, that can be
done only if there is an awareness, after assessment, of
the expenditures and the reason for those expenditures.
Of the budgetary Estimates of $15.7 billion, over half is on
statutory expenditures. That is to say, those are expenditures required under existing acts of Parliament.
Of the other total that I spoke of, $20 billion, only about
$8 billion actually comes before Parliament regularly for
approval under the main Estimates. The statutory items
are merely given for information and report.
Honourable senators, I believe it is the feeling of my
own committee that we should in due course take a larger
share of responsibility for doing a more sophisticated job
in the examination of the Estimates. I think I am revealing
no secret when I say that I know the chairman has this
very much in mind and I for one hope that the Senate, in
spite of its lesser role in this area, can add to its achievements in the public interests in this field.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, unfortunately,
Senator Everett who is chairman of the committee is
unavoidably absent. However, as I listened to Senator
Grosart it occurred to me that there should be some
contribution on behalf of the government, not because
Senator Grosart's statement has been controversial or
lacking in objectivity but rather because it was not possible for him to cover every conceivable aspect of the problems arising out of the government's presentation of the
Estimates for this fiscal year.
I fully support what Senator Grosart has said about the
desirability of Parliament, through its two houses, exercising the utmost scrutiny over public expenditures. Certainly, with more time at our disposal in this house of
Parliament we have an opportunity of giving a thorough
examination of government expenditures, and also to
recommendations for the arrangement of the Public
Accounts, as Senator Grosart pointed out in his statement
when he spoke on the report of the presentation of the
main Estimates.
The main Estimates for 1972-73 are, as are pointed out
in Senator Everett's report, $15.749 billion as compared
with $14.352 billion for the previous fiscal year, 1971-72.
This increase of $1.397 billion represents, according to our
calculations, a 9.7 per cent increase in the Estimates,
although, unless I misunderstood Senator Grosart, he
thinks that that figure is not accurate and that it should be
11 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Grouart: I hope the Leader of the Government
will allow me to intervene at this point, because the last
thing in the world I meant to indicate was that the 9.7 per
cent figure given by Senator Everett was not accurate. It
was an accurate figure. The 11 per cent figure that I spoke
of was with respect to a comparison of the $18 billion and
the $20 billion. I would not want the impression to be left
that I had any doubt about the accuracy of the figure
given in the reoort by Senator Everett.
25312-3l

Hon. Mr. Martin: I am glad that Senator Grosart has
made that correction. Perhaps I should have noted it
myself, because he did say that these Estimates as presented did not comprehend all the expenditures of the
government, and he did use the figures $18 billion and $20
billion.
Senator Grosart made that point in the committee and it
is a point that he has made in other years. As I understand
it, his complaint is that the government Estimates, traditionally, do not reveal the total spending or lending of the
taxpayers' money that it is intended to disperse in any one
year.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: If the Leader of the Government will
again allow me to intervene, I should like to help him
interpret what I said. I did not complain. I was bringing
facts to the attention of the Senate. It would be absurd for
my remarks to be interpreted as saying that I thought the
Blue Book should contain the $20 billion figure. The purpose of the Blue Book is well known to anyone who has
lived with it: it does not purport to give all the figures and
I was not suggesting that it should.
* (1440)

Hon. Mr. Martin: I think there was an honest misunderstanding here. I was just looking at some of the remarks
that Senator Grosart made in other years on the presentation of the Estimates, and putting those remarks together
with his statement concerning the $20 billion figure. I
thought this was a reiteration of what I think was an
understandable argument, but one that can be answered.
It seems to me that there are some answers to the fact that
the Estimates do not include all the obligations, the
pecuniary obligations, of the government. This is because
there are certain conceptual aspects. It is a question of
dealing with these in the Public Accounts. For instance,
how would the expenditures of crown corporations be
treated? One crown corporation, for example, may be
financed in part from its own revenues. Should these
expenditures be included in the Estimates?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: They are.
Hon. Mr. Martin: With great respect, no, because that
would mean reporting twice.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Look at the Blue Book and you will
find those corporations reported on.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am sure my statement is correct,
otherwise the government would be reporting twice with
regard to the same expenditure. Let us take pension funds
as another example. Should expenditures from these
funds be included when the government contribution to
the fund has already been included in the Estimates? You
cannot do it twice. A change, for instance, in the nature of
the Estimates would have to include a review of the relationshipHon. Mr. Grosart: Just a moment, while you are dealing
with thatHon. Mr. Martin: If I may at least finish this sentenceHon. Mr. Grosart: I wish to say this before my honourable friend finishes his sentence because it may help him
and he may not need to finish the sentence. There is no
question and nobody has ever suggested, so far as I know,

524

SENATE DEBATES

that the government should not report expenditures in
several documents. I have not suggested that and I don't
know of anybody else who has suggested that. In fact
nobody has ever suggested that the Blue Book should
contain figures that should not be there. So what the
Leader of the Government is talking about are figures
that are not in there, and that are not in there for a good
reason.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am glad to hear that statement. My
interpretation of the argument that Senator Grosart made
in previous years was that the Estimates did not reveal the
full source of government financial obligations and proposed expenditures, and that they should. But now we
have had a clarification. I think this is satisfactory in that
it will help when we come to consider the appropriation
bill next week.
Hon. Mr.Grosart: I had hoped it would also shorten your
speech.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Well, I have never found that any
intervention of mine was capable of shortening one of
your speeches.
I repeat that one half of the main Estimates, or $7.64
billion, is accounted for by statutory expenditures, and
the remainder, $8.109 billion, represents funds for which
Parliament must give its authorization.
Statutory increases arise from the following factors:
increase in costs and transfers to provinces and other
arrangements whereby the federal government shares
with the provinces costs for health, welfare and
education.
My friend spoke of non-statutory expenditures, which
are accounted for by the following factors: rising costs
and development of policies which reflect the emphasis of
the government's concerns, such as increased allocations
for regional and economic expansion, environmental
problems, and Canadian development funds. The
increases are broken down as follows: $165.7 million for
increases in interest charges on the public debt; $139
million for hospital insurance; $110 million for medical
care; $80 million for post-secondary education; $41 million
for the post office deficit, and $91 million for the budget
of the Department of Regional and Economic Expansion.
Other items in the Estimates include $62 million for
student summer employment, which is a figure over and
above the existing $23 million set aside within departmental budgets. There is also a figure of $790 million in
non-budgetary expenditures such as loans, investments
and advances.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I ask the Leader of the Government if he is merely repeating the figure I gave?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, but I am drawing different conclusions and trying to explain the figures. My friend has
quoted figures mentioned in the report presented to this
house by Senator Everett, and nobody objects to Senator
Grosart's quoting figures from any source, including.the
report now under discussion. But if it is right for Senator
Grosart to do that, it is right for anybody to do it, particularly the spokesman for the government in this bouse.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I was just wondering if you listened to
my speech.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.)

June 22, 1972

Hon. Mr. Martin: The forecast for last year's expenditures totals $15.058 billion, which represents about $700
million less than the Estimates for 1972-73. In keeping
with the government's policy of clarifying the Estimatesand Senator Grosart has assisted in developing over the
years this process of clarification-and providing as much
information as possible-the Estimates now include programs which generate revenue. These programs are now
shown with the exact source of their revenue, be it sales of
permits, proceeds from sales or fees for services. That is
something that Senator Grosart urged two years ago.
Here, honourable senators, I am simply pointing out that
this has now been accepted.
It is wrong to argue that the government expenditures
are not keeping in tune with government responsibilities. I
think government expenditures are not, however, rising at
as great a rate as the increase in the responsibilities of
government today. The government's responsibilities
grow as the population rises and as the Gross National
Product expands. In fact, increases in government
expenditure at the federal level closely approximate rises
in the Gross National Product.
Federal expenditures rise at a slower rate than do the
expenditures, incidentally, of municipalities and of the
provinces, and that has been the case in Canada for some
time. The average growth rate of federal expenditures
between 1967 and 1971 was 11.8 per cent per year. Senator
Grosart nods. I hope he is not going to argue again that
this is something he bas adequately covered in the admirable statement he made a few moments ago.
a (1450)

Each year substantial sums of federal expenditures are
transferred to the provinces. If one subtracts these transfers, the average growth in federal expenditure amounts
to about 9.3 per cent per annum, which is approximately
the same as the growth in the GNP.
Provincial government expenditures have grown much
more dramatically, and even if one subtracts the transfers
to the local governments for administrative control and
expenditure purposes one is left with an average annual
growth rate of 19.5 per cent.
One half of the federal government's total expenditure
derives from statutory provisions made by Parliament,
from uncontrollable items. Costs under these programs
rise each year. The other half derives from programs set
forth in the Estimates and the appropriation acts.
I think Senator Grosart mentioned this: growth in statutory expenditures has increased from 43 per cent to 48 per
cent in the last five years. It follows therefore that the
scope for the government's non-statutory expenditures
each year has been reduced rather than enlarged.
The government does exercise what control it can over
items that are not controllable. This is reflected in the
statistics on the growth of the federal Public Service. The
Public Service has grown at an average annual rate of 1.5
per cent, which is much less than the growth of government responsibilities for the administration of programs
such as the Canada Pension Plan, the guaranteed income
supplement and numerous other complicated measures
involving the rise and expenditure of public moneys.

In answer to those who would criticize the form in
which the Estimates are presented, it should be pointed
out that the existing form resuits fromn the unanimous
recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee in the
other place, a recommendation which was given lengthy
consideration. As Senator Grosart has pointed out, that
committee spends more time examining the substance
and form of the accounts. The government did give careful consideration to the recommendations of the Public
Accounts Committee.
I think Senator Grosart would agree that this year's
Estimates provide more information and that the new
committoe system for considering the Estimates has
increased considerably the time available for this task. I
think also the new format enables a longer period for
questioning the minister concerned with the administration of the Treasury Board itself.
I hope I have not; added a quality of boredorn to Senator
Grosart's interesting speech, by presenting these supplementary facts.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I wish to say something to, the Leader
of the Gavernment and I do not want ta transgress the
rules. I find it difficuit ta put it in the form of a question.
So I merely say to him. that far from being bored, I found
his comments regarding my remarks exciting and unquestionably educational.

POVERTY
REPORT 0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed fromn Thursday, June 1, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon. MIr. Croll, calling
the attention of the Senate ta the Report of the Special
Cornmittee of the Senate on Poverty in. Canada, tabled in
the Senate an Wednesday, November 10, 1971.
Hon. Chesloy W. Carter: Hanourable senatars, we have
had an excellent debate on the Report of the Special
Senate Committee on Poverty. It began in the last session
and has cantinued again in this session. I should like ta

congratulate ail who have spoken in this debate on the
excellence of their presentations.
In his eloquent and masterful contribution in this chamber on Thursday, June 1, Senator Thompson drew attention ta the many recommendatians contained in the report
over and above the guaranteed annual incarne. He deait
with these so effectively and summed up bath the report
itself and the debate that has taken place so eloquently
and sa thoroughly that little more remains ta be said on
the subject.
My purpose, therefore, in cantinuing the debate today is
ta deal with one or two miscanceptions that have arisen in
the public mind, and particularly ta focus attention on the
committee's main recammendation, the guaranteed
annual incarne, about which there appears ta be some
confusion.
One of the cammonest reactions ta the report is that the
answer ta poverty is jobs and more jobs. In this reactian
there are twa implied criticisms. One is that the Senate
committee has rejected the policy of economic growth as
an answer ta poverty. The ather implied criticism is that
by facusing on the guaranteed annual incarne as their
main recommendation, the committee has flot only downgraded the importance of warkîng for a living but has also
lessened the will ta hunt for jobs, while at the same time
favauring handouts and the expansion of the welf are
state.
0f course, nothing could be further from the truth. In
the Summary of Recommendations at page xvii of the
repart under the heading of Recommendations with
respect ta Ecanomic Policies, the very first recommendation reads:
... that "full ernployment" must be the prime objective and responsibility of government fiscal and
monetary policy ...
And this recommendation is emphasized and implied aver
and over again throughaut the text.
This recommendation for full employment is reinfarced
by four other recommendations, namely:
2. That "equal pay for equal work" legislation be passed
and enforced by aIl levels of gavernment for both the
public and the private sector.
3. That easier access ta labour unions for workers, particularly those in low-wage industries, be encouraged and
f acilitated.
4. That prohibitions against discrimination in hiring be
enforced.
5. That job development, particularly of para-professional careers, be vigorously pursued.
0 (1500)

Furthermore, in discussing the cost of the guaranteed
annual incarne, the committee takes pains ta emphasize
that the policy of full emplayment is essential because it is
obviaus that the mare jobs we create through economic
grawth, the less will be the cast of the guaranteed annual
incarne and the better the ecanomy will be able ta support
the expenditure.
It should be clear, therefore, ta everyone that the cornmittee is salidly in favour of ecanamic grawth-the more
the better-but in the course of its investigations which

SENATE DEBATES

the committee pursued with an open mind, we became
aware of three significant facts. The first one was that
even with maximum economic growth there was a possibility that there would still not be sufficient jobs for
everyone willing and able to work.
The second one was that economic growth is not, and I
repeat not, an answer to poverty. This is probably where
the confusion arises, because it is so firmly fixed in the
public mind that the more jobs we create the less poverty
we will have. That, honourable senators, is a myth and it
is one that we should do everything in our power to
eradicate.
We only have to examine the figures for the 1960s,
which was a period of more than average economic
growth in Canada. During that very period of high economic growth and so-called full employment, poverty
actually increased at the same time and it increased most
in those very areas where economic growth was highest.
That is a paradox but it is nevertheless a fact, and we only
have to look at the 600,000 working poor to realize that for
them jobs are not an answer to poverty.
The committee report in its introduction on page xxix
refers to this paradox in these words, and I quote:
It has also been a comforting assumption that continued economic growth would go some distance
toward reducing poverty. But this has not been the
case. As J. K. Galbraith once noted:
There must be no doubt that the means of rescuing
the victims of chronic poverty or their childreninvestment to conserve and to develop resources,
assistance in relocation of workers, assistance to
new industries, vastly improved education, training
and retraining, medical and mental care, youth
employment, counselling, urban recreational facilities, housing, slum abatement, and the assurance of
full civil equality-will require public effort and
public funds. Poverty can be made to disappear. It
won't be accomplished simply by stepping up the
growth rate any more than it will be accomplished
by incantation or ritualistic washing of the feet.
Growth is only for those who can take advantage of
it.
The third fact that the committee discovered was that in
many cases poverty was the result of the way in which our
economy operates. In other words, we know now that
poverty is a by-product of our economy just as is air and
water pollution and other undesirable results. It should be
evident, therefore, that economic growth by itself will
never eliminate poverty.
I come now to the guaranteed annual income, which
Senator Thompson emphasized is the main thrust of the
committee's report and for that reason may have overshadowed some of the other important and essential
recommendations.
The concept of a guaranteed annual income as a matter
of right is not a new idea. It goes back to 1795, 177 years
ago when in Speenhamland, England, the magistrates
decided to subsidize wages in accordance with a scale
dependent upon the price of bread, so that a minimum
standard of living would be guaranteed to everyone, irrespective of their earnings.
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

June 22, 1972

Over 20 years ago the Latimore Report in the U.S.A.
referred to the guaranteed income concept in these words,
and I quote:
The guarantee of wages is not a panacea but a tool
which becomes sharper, not duller, with wide and
intensive use. To mistake the tool for the end product
will blunt the tool and spoil the product. And to suppose that a single goal-be it a guaranteed wage, a
public works, or any other device-can become a multi-purpose instrument by which all the ills of the
economy are going to be remedied can only lead to
confusion and failure. The guaranteed wage, used
with care, with full recognition of its limitations, and
with eyes open to the dangers in exceeding those
limitations, can become an integral part of a foundation program for greater security, for harmonious
industrial relations and for more lasting prosperity.
The committee's main recommendation of a guaranteed
annual income has been generally well received throughout Canada. From coast to coast press comment, church
groups and various organizations have endorsed the guaranteed annual income as a viable means of coming to
grips with the problem of poverty in Canada.
I have in my hand a release from the Family Service
Association of Metropolitan Toronto. I should like to
place this on the record because it is typical of statements
and resolutions made by so many other organizations. It is

headed, "Review of the Report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty," and reads, in part, as follows:
The Family Service Association of Metropolitan
Toronto, because of its intimate contact with many
families in financial need, has a particular interest in
the recent report of the Special Senate Committee on
Poverty. This report has been carefully studied by the
Social Action Committee on this association, and the
following statement, approved by the board of directors, is offered as an expression of our views with
respect to the provincial findings and recommendations. For convenience these views are grouped under
three headings: Endorsements, Reservations, Proposals for Action.
Then, under the heading of "Endorsements," which is
all I intend to quote verbatim, the release goes on to say:
The association wishes first to record its appreciation of the work of the Senate committee and its
substantial agreement with the thrust of its main
proposals. Now, recognizing and regretting the compromises that the committee found it necessary to
make between the implications of its findings and
what seemed politically expedient to recommend by
way of resolutions, we believe that the report has a
comprehensiveness and authenticity to stand as an
undeniable challenge to all Canadians. We particularly endorse the following from among the many significant features of the report:
(1) The genuine and intensive effort to look at the
realities of poverty in Canada, and especially to
consider the views of the poor themselves.
* (1510)

(2) The analysis it contains of the nature, and
although less thoroughly, the causes of poverty

June 22. 1972
June

22

1972

SENATE DEBATES

which makes it clear that poverty is the result
mainly of social and economic conditions rather
than the personal inadequacy of the poor or their
unwillingness to contribute to society.
(3) The fact that the poverty line developed by the
committee is more realistic and humane than those
developed in earlier enquiries.
Perhaps I should add here, for the benefit of those who
may not have been able to study the report, that the
poverty line developed by the Senate committee has three
distinct advantages over previous poverty lines. The first
is that previous poverty lines became obsolete within two
or three years. The Senate poverty line does not. It is
always up to date.
The second is that the Senate poverty line makes provisions for families of every size. Previous poverty lines
made no provisions for families of five and over.
Thirdly, the Senate poverty line is designed to keep pace
with economic growth, so that it keeps pace with the
standard of living as well as with the cost of living.
To continue reading from the review, under the heading
"Endorsements":
(4) The concern for the working poor who comprise
such a large percentage of the poverty group.
(5) The scope of the committee's proposals which
embrace the need of the poor not only for income
but also for a variety of social utilities-housing,
health care, legal aid, day care-and for readier
access to education, manpower training and
employment opportunities.
(6) The emphasis placed on the guaranteed annual
income approach as a means of reducing the stigma
and humiliation associated with the use of needs
tested welfare programs.
(7) The enrichment of the full employment debate
by the constructive suggestions regarding avenues
of job creation that can and should be developed
within the public sector.
(8) The proposal to make personal bankruptcy more
readily available to the over-committed consumer
debtor.
(9) The proposal for a Council for Applied Social
Research and especially its mandate to "be responsible for comprehensive human resource development."
The review then goes on to express a number of reservations concerning what they consider to be major weaknesses in the guaranteed annual income proposal. In particular, they express reservations about the low level of
benefits offered, the exclusion of non-citizen residents
and single unattached persons under forty, the shift from
universal to selective programs and the fear that the poverty line itself would tend to become an income ceiling
rather than an income floor for many persons.
These are all valid reservations with which I personally
can fully sympathize, and I think this is true of most if not
all of the other members as well. But the committee felt
that its recommendations had to be credible, and to be
credible they had to be sufficiently realistic that their
costs would be within the capacity of the Canadian economy to support.

I am sure the whole committee would have preferred to
start payments at the poverty line level instead of at 70
per cent of the level, but the cost would have been prohibitive. Nevertheless, 70 per cent is a great improvement on
what they are now receiving. Here I should point out that
the new ceiling of $3,420 a year for a married couple,
announced by the Honourable John Turner, Minister of
Finance, in his budget on May 8, is very close to the $3,570
poverty line payment established by the Senate Committee on Poverty. But the $1,800 for the single person is still
$340 below the poverty level for 1969.
This is a very important step forward, nevertheless,
because the latest statistics available from Statistics
Canada for the year 1969 show that of all Canadians age
65 and over, 6.7 per cent had annual incomes of less than
$1,000; 37.4 per cent had incomes between $1,000 and
$1,499; 18.2 per cent had incomes between $1,500 and
$1,999; while another 10.8 per cent had incomes between
$2,000 and $2,499. For families where the male head or the
female head was age 65 or over, 9 per cent received
incomes of less than $1,000; 8 per cent received incomes
between $1,000 and $1,999; and 24.15 per cent received
incomes between $2,000 and $2,999. In other words, in
1969, 73 per cent of all single persons over 65, and 41 per
cent of heads of families over 65 had incomes of less than
$3,000.
I am equally certain that the whole committee would
have preferred to recommend a work incentive of 50 per
cent instead of 30 per cent. In fact, that was our original
recommendation, but here again the cost turned out to be
prohibitive, and research projects carried out in the
United States disclosed that as long as the incentive factor
was there, the amount of the incentive above 30 per cent
was not too significant a factor.
You will have noted from the review I quoted that the
Family Service Association of Metropolitan Toronto has
made a clear distinction between the principle of a guaranteed annual income, which they heartily endorse, and
the method by which the principle is implemented, about
which they have some reservations. Other individuals and
organizations have not been able to make this clear distinction, and this has given rise to some confusion in the
public mind.
Once the guaranteed annual income is accepted in principle, there are several ways of implementing it. The
Family Service Association of Metropolitan Toronto
clearly prefers a universal program over the selective
program recommended by the committee. In other words,
they would prefer a demogrant method with the benefits
recovered through the tax structure from those who do
not need them. The committee was aware that the demogrant method does have some advantages, but under our
present tax structure it has one very great disadvantage in
that it would be much more costly because the guaranteed
annual income would be paid to everyone regardless of
need, and you could collact back only that part of it
represented by the marginal tax rate of the taxpayer. If
the taxpayer's marginal rate is 30 per cent, then only 30
per cent of the guaranteed income would be collected
back in taxes. Very few taxpayers have a marginal rate of
over 50 per cent, which means that not more than 50 per

SENATE DEBATES
cent would be collected back in taxes from even the most
wealthy taxpayers.
* (1520)

When you compare that with selective programs which
are geared to about 25 per cent of the population, then it
becomes evident that a universal demogrant would cost
several times as much as the selective program-far
beyond what our present economy could possibly afford.
On the other hand, to recover benefits fully from those
who do not need them would require a radical change in
our present tax structure, and the complexities involved
in recovering the benefits would add considerably to the
cost of administration. The committee's terms of reference were simply to investigate and report upon all
aspects of poverty in Canada and to make recommendations within the existing tax structure. The committee
certainly had no mandate to devise a new tax structure
for Canada, particularly since the government had
already announced its own policy of tax reform.
After pondering the various alternatives, the committee
decided to recommend the negative income tax method.
Incidentally, it is possible to devise a universal program
under the negative income tax method based on income
tax exemptions or the unused part of the income tax
exemption.
Suppose, for example, a family in a given year has a
total of $3,000 worth of unused exemptions and an earned
income of $2,000. Under this system the family would
receive a payment of all or a portion of the $1,000 difference. This is the system favoured by Dr. Milton Freedman
of Chicago University and which has been incorporated
into the platform of Senator McGovern, the leading
Democratic candidate for the presidency of the United
States.
Under the rate of exemptions in force at the time the
report was compiled, the total exemption for a family of
four was still less than $3,500; that is, below 70 per cent of
the poverty line as recommended by the committee. The

June 22, 1972

great disadvantage of a scheme based on exemptions is
that it is not geared to a definite poverty line and therefore the payments become obsolete within a few years.
Our new scale of tax exemptions which went into effect
at the beginning of this year is $1,500 for a man, $1,350 for
his wife, $550 for a child over sixteen, and $300 for a child
under sixteen. Thus, a family of four including one child
under sixteen and one over sixteen would have a total
exemption of $3,700, which is $200 more than under the
plan recommended by the committee. However, the $2,850
exemption for a man and wife is still considerably below
the $3,420 a year which is the new combined rate of old
age security plus the guaranteed income supplement for a
married couple.
Any selective program must of necessity have an eligibility test, but the test required by the negative income tax
method does not involve any demeaning means test. It
simply requires an income tax return which every citizen
has to make and this method is already in use with respect
to the guaranteed income supplement to the old age pension. After considering all possible alternatives, the committee recommended the negative income tax method,
because being selective it has the lowest cost, it is easy
and cheap to administer, and the disincentive is likely to
be less than with universal demogrants. However, as
pointed out in the Latimore Report to which I referred
earlier, the guaranteed annual income is not a panacea
but a tool which becomes sharper, not duller, with wide
and intensive use.
The plan put forward by the Senate Committee on
Poverty was intended to be a starting point which, it was
hoped, would be refined and improved with experience.
No one claims that it is perfect, but those who condemn it
have the obligation to produce something which is better
and still within the limits of what the Canadian economy
can support.

SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
The
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Léopold Langlois: With leave of the Senate, now.
Honourable senators, on March 29 last, approval was
given for the first interim supply bibi for the fiscal year
1972-73. The bill, Appropriation Act No. 2, 1972, was based
on the 1972-73 Estimates and provided for the expenditures for the months of April, May and June, in the
amount of $2,399,125,993.20.
These Estimates were tabled in the Senate on February
24, 1972. The Estimates on which the bill was based were
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance on February 24, 1972. These Estimates were discussed in committee with Treasury Board officials on
June 20, and reported on by the committee on June 20.
The 1972-73 Estimates total $16,539,080,169, consisting of
budgetary expenditures of $15,749,301,169 and boans,
investments and advances of $789,779,000. The bibl now
before us provides for full supply for the balance of the
1972-73 Estimates.
As honourabie senators will recall, there was a previous
Appropriation Act, Appropriation Act No. 1, which covered Supplementary Estimates (B) for 1971-72. The
present bull when passed will provide full supply for the
balance of the main Estimates and will be known as
Appropriation Act No. 3. This bibi is in the ordinary form
of similar bibis passed in previous years and no additional
voting authority is requested in it.
I submit this bill for the consideration of the house.
Hon. Alliater Grocart: Honourable senators, I think a
very short comment would be in order at this time in vîew
of the fact that we had a rather full discussion of the
report of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance concerning the Estimates on which this request
for full suppiy for the balance of the year is based. First I
wish to congratulate the sponsor of the bill on his usual
cbarityHon. Mr. Flynn: Simplicity.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: -and in this particular case his
unusual brevity in presenting this bill.

The statement was repeated in a subsequent Canadian
Press series tagged on at the end. It is flot true to say that
we passed the Estimates on Wednesday, because we discussed them at some length on Thursday, particularly in
connection with the comments made by the Leader of the
Government, who seemed to interpret my remarks as
criticism.
We had quite a full discussion. I hasten to say to him
now that on reflection I was rather surprised that he
interpreted my remarks as a complaint-that was the
word he used-and as a reflection on the government. If
that is so, I can only say that I was merely giving the facts,
and the amounts are very extraordinary.
I should like to ask the sponsor of the bull why it has
been found necessary to ask us to vote full supply for the
year. It seems to me that on other occasions the practice
has been to vote il months' supply, leaving the last
month's supply open and subject to later discussion. The
figure of $16.5 billion which we are given here as being
the projected expenditure on budgetary items and loans,
investmnents and advances, is probably lower than what
might be the final figure.
I pointed out on a previous occasion that it was an
unrealistic figure if we are speaking about total federal
government expenditures, which are much higher than
the $16.5 billion referred to by the sponsor of the bil.
Perhaps there is a reason for this. Perhaps it has not
always been customary to withhold a month's supply.
However, I think it is a useful practice, because as time
goes on we will no doubt be faced with supplementary
Estimates and further requests beyond the $16.5 billion.
Perhaps the sponsor of Appropriation Bibi No. 3 now
before us would indicate if he has any information on
forthcoming supplementaries?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: If there are any further questions to
be asked, I will answer them together.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators, I move the
adjourniment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That will give the sponsor time to provide a proper answer.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien, debate adjourned.

SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, with leave of
the Senate, I move that this bill be read the second time
now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Leave is granted with pleasure to the
honourable Senator Argue.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, this bill comes to
us from the House of Commons with the support of all
parties in that house. It was presented in a somewhat
different form in the last session as Bill C-238. At that
time the original bill contained a provision for the possibility of placing rye, flax and rapeseed under the operations of the Canadian Wheat Board. The Honourable Otto
Lang, the minister in charge of the Canadian Wheat
Board, made it clear that it was not the intention of the
government to place rye, flax and rapeseed under the
Canadian Wheat Board unless in so doing it had the
support of a majority of the producers. However, there
was a good deal of apprebension and a good deal of
opposition even to the possibility of this being done, so the
clause which would have allowed rye, flax and rapeseed
to be placed under the board was removed, and the
present legislation, Bill C-204, is now before us in this
somewhat amended form and after passage by the House
of Commons.
I presume that honourable senators will agree to have
this bill sent to the Standing Senate Committee on

Agriculture for further study and further consideration.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We will have to try that committee,
anyway.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I have no doubt in my mind, in spite of
the fact that the chairman of that committee may not be
as efficient or as well versed in the rules as he should, that
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

June 26, 1972

the high-powered personnel of that committee will make
sure that it does a competent job.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I will go to the committee meeting if
Senator Martin goes.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I want to inform Senator Flynn that
Senator Martin was at the initial meeting. When I was
asked by the press whether I thought the leaders of the
parties in the Senate would be attending committee meetings, I expressed confidence that they would be at least as
active as the average member of that committee; in other
words, that they would be fully active members.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am quite confident that I know as
much about agriculture as Senator Martin.
Hon. Mr. Argue: If you do, you know a great deal. As

Senator Flynn would agree, there was no one in the other
place in years gone by who could make a more forceful
speech on agriculture than Senator Martin when he was
the Opposition critic.
* (1420)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Without knowing what he was saying.
Hon. Mr. Argue: His speeches were well received at the
time and should have been acted on even earlier than they
were.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You should see the smile on Senator
McIlraith's face when you say that.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Senator McIlraith is himself well versed
in agricultural matters.
I am very pleased that the Senate has given support to
the setting up of this committee. I am particularly pleased
that it has the support of the Leader of the Government
and the Leader of the Opposition. I know that the farm
organizations are happy this has been done, and I would
hope that it may be useful to agriculture and to Canada in
the days ahead.
This bill received full support in the other place and is a
very important bill with important provisions. There are
five main reasons for amending the act. First, revision of
the quota system was extensive following the Boden Committee's Report, and it has been found necessary to redefine the quota delivery base in line with the assignable
acreage feature in the new delivery quota system.
Secondly, revision of the Canada Grain Act, in particular the changes allowing for the introduction of a protein
grading system for wheat, requires that the sections in the
present Canadian Wheat Board Act be revised to take into
account these changes in so far as they relate to the
methods of making initial payments to producers.
Thirdly, with the introduction of preceding announcements of minimum quota levels for an ensuing crop year,
it has become necessary to make allowance for those
years in which the minimum quota levels may not be
achieved, and hence it may be necessary to allow farmers
to deliver the balance of the announced quota levels after
the crop year bas ended.
Fourthly, as barley exports increase, an increasing
amount of barley is being shipped out of the west coast.
Presently the greater volume goes out through Thunder
Bay, and initial payments are based in-store Thunder
Bay. This means that Alberta barley, for example, bears

ý - - 9r 11072

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

the freight cost to Thunder Bay, even though some of it
may move out of Vancouver, for which the freight is
lower. The change in this section of the act relating to the
purchasing base for feed grain will make it more flexible,
and will enable the purchasing base to be changed should
the level of Alberta barley moving out of the west coast
render this desirable.
Fifthly, experience with the enforcement of the act has
shown a weakness in terms of the penalties which may be
imposed by the courts for breaches of the act. This has
resulted in nominal penalties being handed down by the
courts on numerous occasions, sometimes fines of $1 for
infractions.
These amendments are far reaching. The definition of
"quota" has been extended to include a definition of the
acreage base that may be laid down by the board from
time to time as the basis for making grain delivery. This
takes into account the revised quota system whereby a
producer may assign a number of specified acres to the
delivery of a particular grain. Previous deliveries for
wheat, oats and barley were made on a total specified
acreage basis without any assignable feature; that is, the
total could not be redistributed by producer option to the
delivery of any particular grain. Deliveries of other grains
were restricted to seeded acreage for each grain as
declared in the permit book. The assignable feature lends
much greater flexibility and specificity to the producers
in their planning of grain deliveries.
Up until now, when a producer has applied for a permit
he has listed a specified acreage which, in the main, is
cultivated and is the basis for quotas for wheat, oats and
barley. Particular crops like malting barley or flax have
had their quotas based, perhaps, on the seeded acres or
extra cars for delivery, or on some other basis.
Now, by means of assignable acres, if a producer has a
quota of, say, 1,000 acres and a great deal of wheat on
hand, even though he may have large acreages in barley
and oats, he may, according to the system, decide to
ignore the acreage he has placed in oats and barley and
assign all his acreage to wheat. He would do this because
he has a surplus of wheat and it is important for him to
sell wheat.
This allows a farmer a greater flexibility in the marketing of his grain and to take the initiative himself-at least,
in this degree-to decide what his quota base will be, what
his marketing opportunities will be, in relation to the
grain he has on hand for delivery.
The powers of the board to fix delivery quotas for each
kind of grain from time to time are extended actually to
specifying the individual grades and the quantity of each
grade the board will accept. This amendment is designed
to enable the board to react to specific market demands,
and thus avoid clogging of the marketing pipeline with
kinds of grain which are not necessarily in the immediate
market demand. Not only can the board decide, shall we
say, that there should be an additional five bushel quota
for Durum wheat, but it can decide that it shall be for
grades 3 and 4 Durum, which are in demand at that time.
So this new system will allow the board itself a great
deal of flexibility in ordering the kind of grain that is in

demand from the country elevator system and in turn
from the producers themselves.
A major change in the bill is the amendment laying
down the basis for initial payments for wheat. Initial
payments will now be made in respect of a base grade to
be prescribed by order in council rather than in relation
to No. 1 Manitoba Northern, which has been the case
heretofore.
In fixing the initial payment for the base grade each
year, the government will take cognizance of the introduction of protein grading. This will mean that the base grade
used to set the scale of initial payments may not necessarily be the same grade in each crop year but will depend
upon crop conditions and the world marketing situation
with reference to the demand for specific levels of protein. Amendments in this area will also enable the Governor in Council or the board to determine the initial and
final payments with respect to specific grades of wheat, so
as to reflect the quality within a grade, that is, the protein
levels, and to adjust the final payments on such wheat so
that producers may receive the premium consequent
upon the demand for a particular quality of wheat.
We have all known that Canada produces high grade
wheat, and a large factor in high grade wheat is high
protein. But there has not been a factor for protein used
in the grading, so there was some unfairness in that producers of No. I wheat, for example, did not always have
the same protein but always received the same return.
It perhaps had another disadvantage. Senator McNamara, who is a great expert in this field and has had long
years of experience in the selling of grain, would agree, I
believe, when I say that customers are interested in the
level of protein in particular purchases and that it will be
a helpful factor for the Canadian Wheat Board to have the
protein factor considered in the base grades themselves.
Moreover, from the producers' standpoint, at least at a
particular marketing point, some recognition will be given
to the producers of high protein wheat.

e

(1430)

Where pre-seeding minimum quota levels announced by
government are not achieved in a particular crop year, it
will now be possible for producers under these circumstances to deliver the balance of the announced quota
levels in the ensuing crop year at the initial payment
levels fixed for the previous crop year. Presently, the
terms of the act do not allow two different levels of initial
payments to be made in the same crop year for a particular grade of grain. It has happened in the past that, at the
end of July, if some producers have not been able to
market their grain because of full elevators or an elevator
system unable to take delivery of the grain, in many
instances the quota has been lost. However, if the quota
was extended, then the question arose whether that wheat
should be credited to the next year's pooling account or to
the pooling account for the year in which it should have
been marketed.
This amendment makes it clear that, if at a given marketing point on July 31 there is not room to accept all the
deliveries based on the present quotas, the board can
decide to extend the crop year for another couple of
weeks. For example, the wheat being marketed in that
extended crop year will be considered for bookkeeping

SENATE DEBATES
purposes-for all purposes-the same as though it had in
fact been delivered by July 31.
In the past, farmers who were allowed to market their
grain in the new crop year because they had been unable
to market certain quotas in the previous year were happy
to obtain that privilege. But, in those circumstances they
had to take the next year's price, and when the next year's
price was lower, naturally, they resented the fact that they
were not given a chance to get the same price for wheat as
other producers who were at marketing points more
favourably situated so far as boxcars and the hauling out
of grain to terminals were concerned.
This welcome provision merely makes it possible to
provide justice to the farmers and to keep the accounting
system in such a way that producers who deliver grain
against quotas for any one crop year will receive the same
final payments.
Hon. Mr. Lang: I wonder if I may ask my friend a
question? I was interested in knowing what the farmers'
reactions would be with respect to the undeliverable grain
when the next year's crop prices were higher.
Hon. Mr. Argue: The farmers believe that it should be
considered within the crop year and they are willing to
take their chances on whether it is higher or lower. They
feel that justice will be served if the quota has to be
extended into the next crop year. As it happened in the
past, sometimes when it was extended the price was obviously going to be lower, and there was resentment. In
other words, I think the farmers are willing to accept this
amendment because it means that when one farmer markets his grain on a given quota on July 31 and another
markets his on August 7, one week later, the two farmers
will receive exactly the same final payment. There will be
no complaint at all.
Another amendment will enable the initial payment for
oats and barley to be fixed basis-in-store, Thunder Bay or
Vancouver, or only Thunder Bay or only Vancouver. The
idea of this is to give Alberta farmers, who may be producing a lot of barley going into the Vancouver market,
the advantage of the fact that they are situated close to
the Vancouver market and not penalize them as at present
with the prices based on in-store Fort William-Port
Arthur.
Minimum penalties have been established for infractions of the act in the case of producers and elevator
operators. Previously such fines were left completely to
the determination of the courts and frequently resulted in
minimal fines of sums not exceeding, for example, $1
being imposed, which in effect nullified the penalty
clauses of the act as they presently operate. With respect
to contraventions of the act, there is a further amendment
whereby the board will now have the power, when a
producer does not wish to go to court, to reduce delivery
privileges if it has evidence that particular individuals
have been in breach of the delivery regulations.
I am not a lawyer and I cannot really give a legal
opinion on this, but as I read it it will provide that if there
is an infraction of the law and a producer is taken to
court, the minimum fine must be $50 or one third of the
value of the amount of his overdelivery; that is, one third
of the value of the money he gained by making an infrac[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

June 26, 1972

tion, whichever is the greater. However, it is provided that
the board may deal directly with producers, and may levy
a penalty by reducing his future delivery privileges if a
producer does not question or challenge the infraction in
the courts.
There are some pretty good lawyers in the House of
Commons, and I did not read of any particular objection
to these proposals. I can say that having looked at the
evidence in the Agriculture Committee of the House of
Commons, and having considered the representations
made by the various farm organizations and knowing
from the attitudes of producers and farm organizations
that while there may be a difference of opinion as to
whether or not rye, flax and rapeseed should be placed
under the board now, there is no objection to the amendments proposed in this bill, and in fact there is complete
support for them. I should think that if at some future
date there is an indication by a majority of producers that
they would wish rapeseed, for example, to be brought
under the Canadian Wheat Board, and if an appropriate
amendment were brought in, such amendment would
receive general support.
With that explanation, honourable senators, I am happy
to move second reading of this bill.

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved, with leave of the

That the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture
be authorized to examine and report upon the Report
of the Canadian Wheat Board for the crop year ended
July 31, 1971, tabled in the Senate on Tuesday, 25th
April, 1972.
He said: Honourable senators, there are a few remarks I
should like to make before this motion is put to the house.
Upon examining the report of the Canadian Wheat Board
for the crop year 1971-72, which is referred to in the
motion, some very interesting facts come to light. At the
end of the report there is a table which I think indicates
the wisdom of this chamber in setting up a Standing
Senate Committee on Agriculture. For instance, page 18
of the table section indicates what has happened to the
price of wheat over the past 25 years. On the average,
wheat is selling for around 16 cents a bushel less than it
did 25 years ago.
A few days ago we were discussing another motion in
this house concerning wages and salaries. I indicated then
that I did not believe the increased productivity of this
nation was equally divided among our labour force. This
is, perhaps, the most glaring example of one section of the
labour force which has not received anything. As a matter
of fact, they are receiving less for their products today
than they did 25 years ago.
On page 3 of the same section of the report I note that
the production of grain has almost doubled over the same
period. In the last three years of the 1940s, prairie farmers
were producing around 700 million bushels of grain. That
production has nearly doubled. This has occurred with
fewer people employed in the industry. Every producer of
cereal grains must have a permit to deliver grain to the
Canadian Wheat Board. Twenty-five years ago there were
around 233,000 farmers engaged in the production of
cereal grains in western Canada, compared with 182,000
today. Fifty thousand fewer units are producing double
the quantity of grain, and they are receiving about 16
cents a bushel less than they were 25 years ago.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You are speaking collectively and not
individually.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes, collectively.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But each individual may be receiving a
greater amount if there is only a difference of 16 cents a
bushel.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: No, it would indicate that collectively they are producing double the amount of grain, but
individually they are receiving 16 cents a bushel less.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That point was not clear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Are you speaking about all types of
grain?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I am referring to wheat. The same
thing would hold true with respect to oats and barley.
Flax and rapeseed fluctuate more than do grains which
come under the Canadian Wheat Board.
The message I am endeavouring to get across is that
many people outside the Prairie region look at western
Canadian farmers when they happen to meet them in
Toronto or Montreal-the odd one even makes it to Florida, Texas or California during the winter-and they think
they have money sticking out their ears. There is no
segment of Canadian society which has made a greater
effort to increase productivity and which has received less
for it. In my humble opinion, if the three sets of figures
which have been referred to today are true, we are facing
a tremendous problem. And I would wager this year's
indemnity that in 20 years from now western Canadian
farmers will be producing double what they are producing today-some 2J billion bushels of grain. Surely they
will not have to do this and face another cut of 15 cents to
20 cents over the same period of time. When we begin
producing in excess of 2 billion bushels per year there will
be fewer farmers in the business. There is no segment of
our society which has made a greater effort, and has been
successful, in modernizing its activities. No industry in
Canada can compare with the modernization and efficiency which has taken place in western Canadian agriculture. They are receiving little credit for it.
In the last few years, as the bill which Senator Argue
introduced today indicates, consideration has finally been
given to one of the most productive industries in this
country. I hope that the Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture can make more progress in the future than
we have in the past.
Motion agreed to.

and involve other people in that dialogue, which it also
did.
What has happened since the report was published in
November last, seven months ago? Much has happened
since that time. It has all been good. There has been
progress in many directions. The committee made 13
recommendations, and there has been progress in the
matter of day care, legal aid, medicare-particularly
dental care-housing, and in the matter of a guaranteed
income, to name just a few.
The subject of a guaranteed basic income attracted the
most attention. At present, the aged, the crippled, the
maimed, and the female heads of families receive a guaranteed income. It is grossly inadequate by our standards,
and by comparison, but nevertheless they receive it at the
present time.
Those who are suffering most are the working poor, the
people who work full time, part time, or any time at all,
and there are about 640,000 of them in Canada. They are
the ones who are most deeply wronged by the inequalities
of Canadian life. They heed the copybook maxim to work
hard and all will be well. Is it? For most of the working
poor, the reality mocks the promise of reward. They do
their best to maintain personal and family dignity. They
play the game according to the rules, but when they fail to
win, we say to them, "Too bad. That's the way things are."
I said there are some 640,000 working poor in this country-those who earn less than they could receive on welfare, yet stay at their jobs and work day in and day out.
The picture is not exactly as I have stated, because there
has grown up in this country a method of providing supplementary income. A guaranteed income is being provided for such people by the backdoor method. Some form of
supplementary income is being given to the working poor
of every province, more in some provinces and less in
others, to stop people from going on welfare.
If the working poor raise the roof, make a lot of noise
and make a nuisance of themselves, they will be given the
supplementary income; otherwise they will not. That is
unfortunate.
I suppose that in Alberta there must be at least 5,000
needy families receiving supplementary income, and in
some of the other provinces there are less. There are some
in Ottawa, and there are many in Ontario. But instead of
having a plan for everyone, we are handling the matter in
a haphazard, uneven, quiet sort of way. One might almost
think we were hiding it from people. If we continue with
the present method, we will encounter the same kind of
mess that we experienced when the welfare system was
first introduced.
Let me illustrate my point. At the present time a family
of four in the Province of Alberta receives $360 per
month. In the Province of Ontario, it receives $330 per
month, and, in the Province of Nova Scotia, it receives a
maximum of $175 per month. But the same family of four,
living in the City of Ottawa, receives $100 more per month
than a similar family living in Hull under exactly the same
circumstances. That is what is happening in this country.
Family allowances are paid to such people in equal
fashion, as is unemployment insurance and payments
under the Canada Pension Plan. People pay taxes on a

uniform basis. But when it comes to receiving assistance
for the necessities of life the amounts vary, because of our
present haphazard, unco-ordinated system.
Supplementary assistance is, of course, available in the
larger communities. One applies for it and, under certain
circumstances, one gets it. But in the less affluent communities a person may apply, but if he does so he gets it in
the neck. The larger communities have the money and can
pay this assistance, but the smaller communities do not
have the money and people just do not receive it.
Under the Canada Assistance Plan, the basis for qualification is need, but at the present time supplementary
assistance is provided on the basis of means. A means test
is given, and it is just as mean as it ever was. I do not
think that anyone has thought much of it at any time.
The federal government is now making some tests. In
collaboration with provincial governments, it is carrying
out pilot projects to study the guaranteed income. In the
fiscal year 1972-73, $5 million, plus any savings to the
federal government under the Canada Assistance Plan,
will be provided to assist in carrying out such studies on
the basis of 75:25 per cent federal-provincial sharing.
These funds would be used to finance transfer payments
and research on experimental projects testing the guaranteed income approach. Testing may focus on a number of
objectives, such as obtaining information on the question
of work incentives, family change and mobility, the economic and social impact of guaranteed income, and
administrative problems related to such a program. Such
information would be needed before a program could be
adopted covering all people in the labour force.
The Province of Manitoba has already undertaken a
study, as has the Province of Ontario. I understand a
couple of other provinces will be undertaking the study
very soon.
* (1510)

Hon. Mr. Martin: The Province of Alberta.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am informed that the Province of
Alberta will be.
You may well ask, "How do we assess our accomplishments to date?" I can say that by our work and by our
report we have made a difference. The report is not for
dust gathering. It has stimulated debate and dialogue on
the topic of a guaranteed annual income which hàs been
partially applied in a way that I hoped it would not be; I
hope it will not continue.
The report has been examined by social bodies and
concerned people and, in the main, the decision has been
overwhelmingly that it is a meritorious report. The comments have been widespread and they have been favourable, agreeing in principle. One of the criticisms that we
have had is with regard to the work ethic. It has been
difficult to overcome that. In this country we have now
begun a redefinition of the work ethic-the concept of
work and jobs. There are lessons to be learned from the
Local Initiatives program and the Opportunities for
Youth program. Yet, no great changes have yet come
about for the poor. To be poor one must be patient, docile
and grateful-at least one must learn to simulate gratitude
even if the heart is burning with silent rage.

the government is seeking to implement, and in this
regard they should incur less blame than if they had
really been promoting a policy of their own.
It happened in the past that the problem occurred in a
more indirect way, when senior officials expressed their
own opinions through their ministers. I think this is what
happened in Lester Pearson's case when he was UnderSecretary of State for External Affairs and eventually
appointed Secretary of State for External Affairs. This is
probably what happened also with Mr. Pickersgill, Mr.
Drury and Mr. Sharp and with many other senior
officials.
I shall not mention Senator Lamontagne because he
was first deputy minister in a department where at that
time the political problems were less acute. Of course,
when he became special assistant to the Leader of the
Opposition, he unquestionably suggested some good ideas
to his boss. It was mentioned the other day that one must
include in a separate group those who indeed have this
direct responsibility of assisting a politician, and hence
the responsibilities to the public of expressing or stating
policies.
So, what I wanted to say very simply, honourable senators, is that one should not use statements by Mr. Carson
and Mr. Lussier to condemn a policy which invites Francophones to be better represented in the public service.
In fact, I do not feel that people necessarily go against
the merit system when, as they say in English, they "bend
over backwards" to see to it that the Francophone element in this country is more adequately represented in
the public service.
It is undeniable that if we want Canada to last and last
as a whole, considerable efforts will have to be made in
that respect, as well as concessions that might at times
seem exaggerated but which, over the long term, really
are not. That is why I wish to record in Hansard this
modest personal opinion, although, as I said before, in the
light of the future it is very important.
The public service must represent the two linguistic
elements of the country and, if we want to give the Francophones service in their own language, we may have to
get away somehow from an absolute system of merit or
competence; something will surely have to be done to
ensure that Francophones are adequately represented
and can hold positions wherever the public requires their
services.

CANADIAN FILM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE STUDY OF ADMINISTRATION
AND OPERATIONS BY HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, June 15, the
adjourned debate on the motion of honourable Senator
Lapointe that the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science be authorized to examine and report

upon the administration and operation of the Canadian
Film Development Corporation.
[Translation)
Hon. Maurice Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I
would like first to commend Senator Lapointe for having
raised this question and drawn the attention of this house
to such an important problem. Furthermore, I wish that
Senator Lapointe will continue to have a deep interest in
the cultural matters and cultural policy of this country,
for I have realized that there are not many in this house
who have the time or interest to keep abreast of that
important aspect of federal policy, also that important
aspect of life in Canada. As I have been directly involved
as Secretary of State in the assistance program to the film
industry, I would like to take this opportunity to give you
a brief historic outline of it.
The preparation of the project dates back to 1964. We
had then realized that the private film industry was very
weak in Canada. Feature films, which were presented to
the Canadian public, came almost exclusively from outside, while we were demanding from our telecasters more
programs of Canadian origin. That situation was not to
the benefit of our cultural life; it was not healthy either
from an economic standpoint, for good commercial films
can positively contribute to employment, national revenue
and our international balance of payments.
Our private film industry had made heroic efforts to
become viable, but at that time it was still in a very
difficult position. According to experts, this was not due
to a lack of artists and technicians; the reputation which
the National Film Board had acquired in the world was
an obvious indication of our potential in this field. The
great difficulty with which this industry met was financial. Our situation was not unique in the world. Most other
countries, including Great Britain and France, had had to
face the same problem and had offered their government's assistance, a thing which Canada had not done yet.
At the beginning of 1964, the federal government asked
an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Film
Commissioner, Mr. Guy Roberge, to consider this matter.
I received the first report a few months later, and on
August 5, 1964, I announced in Montreal that the government intended to create a loan fund.
Nevertheless, I later asked the interdepartmental committee to study in more detail the problems inherent in
this industry, and particularly the matter of distribution
within the country as well as abroad. The committee went
to work. Two outside experts, Dr. O. J. Firestone and Mr.
Fernand Cadieux, were hired and two government advisers, Messrs. Spencer and Côté, were invited to prepare
special studies on various aspects of the film industry and
on the steps taken in other countries to support it.
The committee considered those special studies and
drafted a second report which was presented to me in
August 1965. Taking into consideration the recommendations set out in this report, the government then came to
the conclusion that the creation of a Canadian film industry would contribute a great deal to making Canada
known to Canadians themselves, as well as abroad. Such
initiative would also allow our film producers, authors,

SENATE DEBATES
composers, artists, and technicians to take a great part in
the cultural development of this country.
* (1530)

[English]
For these reasons, I announced in Toronto on October
13, 1965, that the government intended to establish a
Crown corporation with an initial capital of $10 million, to
assist the Canadian private film industry in the production of feature films of commercial value and good quality. I said that the corporation would be empowered to
make agreements with private producers, under which it
would make loans or investments without, however,
becoming a legal partner in these undertakings. In addition, the corporation would also be able to make significant financial awards to Canadian films judged to be of
high quality by appropriate juries. It would provide aid in
the creative, technical and administrative sides of film
production. It would be expected from time to time, and
in the light of its own experience, to advise the government on various other means of helping the industry.
In addition, an advisory board-representative of the
producers' associations, the film-makers' associations, the
unions associated with the film industry, the exhibitors,
and distributors-would be set up to maintain liaison and
co-operation with the industry, the corporation, and the
government.
The corporation, and the producers which it would
assist, would be expected to work with and through established distributors to arrange for the widest possible distribution of the films in Canada and abroad. We did not
intend to put special restrictions on imports of foreign
films, but we expected that Canadian films would be
treated fairly-both at the initial stage of financing and at
the final stage of distribution-by Canadian and foreign

June 26, 1972

distributors. Some countries had decided to impose
import controls to protect their industries in their domestic markets. We preferred at first to try to get a reasonable
share of the domestic and foreign markets through measures of encouragement and international co-operation
rather than through measures of restriction and control.
As a result of this co-operation and joint ventures,
which we hoped would develop not only with American
but also with French, British and other producers, we
expected that Canadian films would have free access to
foreign markets, just as foreign films had to the Canadian
market.
This was the broad outline of the film policy which the
federal government intended to implement in 1965. I
added in my statement that we expected such a policy to
achieve satisfactory results in the next five years, and that
we would be reviewing the progress made and the effectiveness of that policy from time to time.
Such was the background of the plan to offer public
assistance to the private film industry in Canada. I
thought that honourable senators would like to know how
the new policy was developed in its preliminary stage.
Subsequent developments-including the legislation
which was approved by Parliament in 1967-have been
described by Senator Lapointe, and are part of the official
record. I fully concur with Senator Lapointe that the time
bas come, after five years of operation, to review this
program very carefully, and I strongly support the motion
which is now before us.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I would ask leave to move the
adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Or ask when the committee is going to
start?
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

AIR TRANSPORT
CONVENTIONS ON UNLAWFUL SEIZURE OF AIRCRAFT
AND UNLAWFUL ACTS AGAINST CIVIL AVIATIONDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Paul Martin rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure
of Aircraft, signed at The Hague December 16, 1970,
and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful
Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, done at
Montreal September 23, 1971, which were tabled in the
Senate on Monday, 26th June, 1972.
He said: Honourable senators, yesterday I tabled two
conventions dealing with the problem of international
hijacking. The first of these, The Hague Convention for
the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, was
signed at The Hague on December 16, 1970. The other
convention, dealing with the Suppression of Unlawful
Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, was signed at
Montreal on September 23, 1971. The Hague Convention,
which is that for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of
Aircraft, came into force in October 1971. Canada signed
the convention in December 1970, and in so doing became
the thirty-fourth of the 81 countries which have acceded
to that convention.
The Hague Convention deals with hijacking, obliging
contracting states to extradite offenders or to prosecute
them for "unlawful seizure of aircraft."
The Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts
Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, which was signed in
Montreal and is now called the Montreal Convention, was
also tabled yesterday, but it has not yet come into force.
Canada was the third country to accede to the measure,
having entered into the convention in September 1971.
The convention will not come into force until at least 10 of
the signatory powers have ratified the agreement,
although I must stress that so far 39 countries have
entered the convention.
The Montreal Convention deals with "Other Unlawful
Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation" short of outright piracy. Violence and sabotage, destruction of air
navigation facilities, and communication of information
known to be false, fall into this category. Such offences
are governed by the terms of the Montreal Convention for
the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of
Civil Aviation.
The Hague Convention, like the Montreal Convention,
obliges contracting states either to extradite or to prosecute offenders.
Cuba has signed neither of these conventions, and my
information is that there are no prospects of her doing so.
In view of this, Canada and Cuba have been negotiating a

bilateral treaty which we hope will contain the substance
of the obligations contained in the Convention for the
Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, and the
Montreal Convention.
We expect to hear in the very near future that the
Cuban government will send a delegation to Ottawa for
the second round of negotiations. The first round was
held in Havana in February of 1971. Canada believes that
the major air service states should agree to take concerted
action against any state which does not live up to the legal
obligations contained in such international agreements as
The Hague Convention or the Montreal Convention.
0 (1410)

It is only when potential offenders realize that no
havens will be available to them that we shall be able to
eliminate most acts of unlawful interference with civil
aviation. This is the thrust of the initiative which Canada
and the United States have been pursuing for some time
now in the International Civil Aviation Organization in
Montreal. The government is pleased that on June 19,
1972, the ICAO Council in Montreal decided that a special
legal subcommittee would work, as a matter of priority,
on the preparation of an international enforcement
convention.
I am sure all honourable senators will heartily concur in
the government's decision to contract the obligations
which are entailed under these conventions. I am confident that we fully support all lawful means of bringing
about the swift demise of air piracy and all of its attendant risks.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate adjourned.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 3, 1972
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the adjourned
debate on the motion of honourable Senator Langlois, for
the second reading of Bill C-221, for granting to Her
Majesty certain sums of money for the public service for
the financial year ending 31st March, 1973.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, it is not my
intention to delay the passage of Bill C-221. I feel we have
to vote these sums of money to Her Majesty in order that
the government can carry on its business until March 31,
1973. Therefore, I am going to vote for the bill. However,
before I do so I should like to say one or two words. The
thing that strikes me every year when looking at the
Estimates is the extraordinary way in which they have
grown. When I was summoned to the Senate, which is not
too long ago, the federal government's budget was $6
billion. Today, taking everything into consideration and
the fact that we might have a supplementary budget now
and then, we are looking at a budget of $18 billion. As all
of us are taxed by the municipal, provincial and federal
governments, we must look at the total picture.

SENATE DEBATES
In 1960 the federal government spent a good deal more
than the provincial government; however, in 1970 this was
reversed. As an example, in 1960 the federal government
had a budget of $6 billion, and the Province of Quebec
had a budget of $600 million. This year Quebec's budgetand I have Mr. Garneau's statement-is up to $4.6 billion
from $600 million. In other words, it is over seven times
the total of the 1960 budget. Honourable senators, this
shows that we are at the saturation point as far as taxation is concerned. Yet, we hear people, with very good
cause, telling us that 20 per cent of our population is living
below the poverty line and that we have to do something
more for them. According to the Financial Times, the
gross national product this year is expected to be around
$93 billion or, perhaps, even a little more. When $18 billion
is spent by the federal government and then about as
much again by the provinces, you are getting to the point
where something like 35 per cent of the gross national
product is being spent by the three levels of government.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: More than that.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I am trying not to exaggerate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On this side we never do.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What should we be doing? I think
we must try to delve into this and see where a lot of
money is wasted. I believe our whole tax system should be
looked at. For instance, I think it is terribly bad that we
have a federal sales tax. There is no such tax in the United
States. The federal sales tax in 1920 was one per cent; in
the middle of the depression it was raised to 8 per cent; in
1951 it was raised to 10 per cent, and in 1959 it was raised
to 12 per cent, where it stands today. For those who live in
a province that also has a sales tax, it does not take long to
sit down with pencil and paper and work out the effect of
this.
Let us say that an article costs $80 to produce and is
sold by the manufacturer with a markup to, say, $100.
Then the federal government adds $12 and the article is
carried for six months before being sold. Before long the
price goes up to $125, and on this the merchandiser has to
make his profit. Today many people are living below the
poverty line, and they have to pay this tax on nearly
everything they buy. It is tax on tax, and it makes no
sense.
This federal sales tax is expected to bring in $2.2 billion.
It is a big percentage of the federal government budget, so
it cannot be abolished. I think it ought to be reduced, but
if it is reduced then some of our expenditures must be
drastically cut.
In my opinion, the Senate should do more work in this
direction. This is the sort of thing we can study to advantage. However, an awful lot has to be done. If we are to do
more for those below the poverty line we must find the
money, and the only way we can do that is to cut out
foolish expenditures. Everything always seems to bring
me back to the good old CBC.
Hon. Mr. McElman: We thought you would never get to
it.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Just think, they are spending $207
million of your hard-earned money.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The strike is over.
[Hon. Mr. Beaubien]

June 27, 1972

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Then there is another $30 million for
capital account that they should pay and do not have.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudière): What about the
National Film Board?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I think the Senate should look into
this, and when we come back in the autumn I would be
just delighted to lend a hand.
Hon. Léopold Langlois: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, if the bonourable Senator Langlois speaks now his speech will have
the effect of closing the debate on second reading.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, yesterday I
decided to delay answering questions put to me by some
honourable senators, knowing that there would be other
speakers in the debate and having in mind that it has been
the practice of this house to delay answering questions
until all those wishing to do so have addressed the Senate,
so that all the points raised can be dealt with in one
closing speech.
* (1420)

Yesterday my honourable friend Senator Grosart commented on the brevity of my remarks in introducing this
measure, and he compared those remarks with the huge
amounts involved in these Estimates. The reason I
abstained from adding to what I said resides in the fact
that these Estimates received a thorough study by our
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. Had I
added any thing it would have been tantamount to repeating what was said in committee and what is contained in
its report, which was printed as an appendix to Senate
Hansard of June 20. It was in order to avoid such repetition that I abstained from elaborating further on the
measure before us.
Besides this comment on my remarks, the honourable
senator asked me two questions. The first one reads as
follows:
I should like to ask the sponsor of the bill why it has
been found necessary to ask us to vote full supply for
the year. It seems to me that on other occasions the
practice has been to vote 11 months' supply, leaving
the last month's supply open and subject to later
discussion.
In this regard, I should like to remind the Senate that it
has been the practice in each of the last three fiscal years
to secure approval for the balance of the main Estimates
at this time. The request for release of the balance of the
funds is the result of the present Standing Orders in the
other place, whereby their consideration of these Estimates is completed in June of each year and then
approved by the covering supply bill.
As honourable senators are aware, there are three
supply periods set out within the Standing Orders, within
which certain Estimates are passed by the house. The first
supply period, ending June 30, provides for consideration
of the main Estimates; the second period, ending December 10, provides for passage of supplementary Estimates,
if required; and the third period, ending March 26, provides for approval of final supplementary Estimates, if
required, and the passage of the first interim supply bill
based on the main Estimates for the coming fiscal year.

I wish to add that the Estimates on which the present
bill is based were tabled in the Senate and referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance on February 24, as I stated yesterday. The committee reviewed
these Estimates and reported back to this house on June
20. Therefore, since consideration has been given to these
Estimates by Parliament, it is proposed to proceed with
the requested release of supply for the balance of the
main Estimates, as approved by the House of Commons,
rather than reduce the Appropriation Act by one-twelfth.
I should like to add that I was very much surprised by
the question of my honourable friend yesterday, since we
have been so used, in this and in the other place, to
hearing criticism of the government's seeking authority to
approve the expenditure of public funds after those
expenditures have been made. This may be the first time
we have had the reverse; that is, a criticism that the
government is asking Parliament for such authority in
advance of the date on which these expenditures likely
will be made.
I pass to the second question:
Perhaps the sponsor of Appropriation Bill No. 3 now
before us would indicate if he has any information on
forthcoming supplementaries?
My answer is that I am sure the honourable senator is
aware that I cannot at this time say that no supplementary Estimates will be required for the balance of this fiscal
year.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But you can say that there will.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: No, I mean it either way.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Oh, oh!

Hon. Mr. Langlois: I should add, however, for the information of the Leader of the Opposition that I am
informed that we are not presently preparing supplementary Estimates. That is as far as I can go at the moment.
We are not preparing supplementary Estimates for
tabling, either at this time or later on in the fiscal year, but
there is a possibility that there will be future requirements
of funds.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is a certainty.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: That possibility exists not only to
meet any unforeseen emergencies which may arise during
this year but also to finance any revisions of existing
programs which were not anticipated when the main Estimates were prepared some time ago, and also for the
implementation of any new programs which may be
required for the public good.
I now pass to the remark made by my honourable
friend Senator Beaubien a short while ago when he
referred to the growth of public expenditures. I should
like to refer the honourable senator to the report of the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance which
was produced as an appendix to the Debates of the
Senate of June 20. I would refer him to page 510, paragraphs 3 and 4, in which there is an explanation of these
increases in expenditures and a comparison with the
growth of the gross national product over the same period
of time.
Just to remind the house of what was said in this
respect by the Chairman of our Standing Senate Commit-

EA

S

tee on National Finance the other day, I should like to
read from paragraph 3 of the committee's report:
The main Estimates for 1972-73 amount to $15,749
million as compared with the main Estimates of 197172 when the amount was $14,352 million. Of the total
of the main Estimates for 1972-73, $7,640 million are
statutory in nature while $8,109 million represent
funds for which Parliament is asked to provide
authority. In addition to these amounts there are $790
million of non-budgetary items.
The total growth of these expenditures in terms of percentage is 9.7 per cent as compared to a growth in the
GNP over the same period of 9.1 per cent.
Another point I should like to bring to the attention of
honourable senators, and I am referring to paragraph 4 of
the report, is that statutory expenditures in the present
Estimates amount to almost 50 per cent of the total of the
Estimates. I feel that it is worth mentioning that aspect of
the main Estimates and drawing it to your attention,
because, as it is stated in the report: "These cover some
very large payments, such as the interest on the public
debt, fiscal transfer payments to the provinces and payments to the provinces under shared cost programs."
With that, honourable senators, I conclude my remarks
and recommend this measure to the Senate for its
consideration.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Langlois moved that the bill be placed on the
Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS
NOTICE OF COMMITTEE MEETING
Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, I wonder if
I might crave your indulgence for a moment to make an
announcement of some importance with respect to a
meeting of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs which was set for three o'clock this
afternoon?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed
that honourable Senator Prowse shall have leave to
address the house on this matter now?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Prowue: Thank you. What I want to say is
simply this: When we got the date for this afternoon's
committee meeting we thought that the house would be
sitting this evening. But now in view of the fact that the
house is sitting this afternoon, the meeting will be held
when the Senate rises. I can assure honourable senators it
will not be a long meeting.
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of honourable Senator Argue, for

SENATE DEBATES
the second reading of Bill C-204, to amend the Canadian
Wheat Board Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, this order appears
in my name and I now wish to yield to the honourable
Senator John M. Macdonald.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is this agreed, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, first of
all I must thank my honourable colleague for his courtesy
in yielding to me at this time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You told me to.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is not my intention to comment
on the various amendments contained in this bill which
relate to its main objective. Most of them are technical,
and I think that Senator Argue convinced us yesterday
that they are necessary in view of changing conditions. In
any event, my colleague Senator Haig is much better
qualified than I am to speak on the substance of the bill,
and I have no doubt he will do so.
My purpose in rising today is to make a few comments
on the amendments respecting offences and penalties
under this bill.
Under the present act sections 42 to 45 inclusive deal
with offences and penalties. I want to quote these sections
as I feel the amendments are wrong, and in some cases
contrary to our idea of justice under the law. Section 42 is
as follows:
42. (1) Every person who
(a) being required to make any return or declaration
under this Act or any regulation or order, furnishes
any false information or makes any false statement
in such return or declaration or fails fully to complete such return or declaration,
(b) makes a false entry in any permit book or other
document required to be completed by him under
this Act, or
(c) contravenes or omits to comply with this Act or
any regulation or order, is guilty of an offence and
liable on summary conviction
(d) in the case of a producer or operator of an
elevator convicted of an offence relating to the
delivery of grain, to a fine not exceeding three hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding three months, or to both, and
(e) in any other case, to a fine not exceeding five
thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding two years, or to both.
Now, clause 6 of the bill proposes to change the penalty
which is set out in section 42(1)(d) of the act and to break
the penalty, as it were, as between a producer and an
operator. The effect, so far as a producer is concerned, is
to leave the maximum penalty at $300, but it imposes a
minimum penalty of $50 where formerly there was no
minimum, and in the case of an operator or manager of
an elevator, the minimum penalty is also set at $50 and the
maximum penalty is reduced to $2,000.
Honourable senators, I have not seen what I consider
any valid reason why a minimum sentence of $50 should
[Hon. Mr. Prowse.]

June 27, 1972

be imposed where now there is no minimum. True it has
been said that penalties as low as $1 have been imposed,
but I expect that a magistrate or a justice who imposed
such a sentence had a good reason for so doing. Usually
when a small fine is imposed it is because the accused is
technically guilty of an offence but has acted through lack
of knowledge or has made an honest mistake.
You will note that subsection 42(l)(a) of the act states
"Every person who ... furnishes any false information
. . .. It does not say, "who knowingly furnishes false information." I believe the discretion should be left to the
magistrate or judge to impose a fine of $1 if he is convinced that in all the circumstances surrounding the
offence this is all that is called for.
I think however, there is a worse feature than the
increased penalties. At least such penalties can be
imposed only by a court. But clauses 6 and 7 of the bill
give some really extraordinary powers to the board, and
to give you an idea of this amazing authority I will quote
from clause 7. It adds a new section 44.1, which reads, in
part:
(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Act or the
provisions of Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, unless
otherwise directed by the Attorney General of
Canada, the Board may proceed in accordance with
sections 44.2 to 44.5 in respect of any offence against
this Act alleged to have been committed by an actual
producer in respect of the delivery of grain, in lieu of
following the procedure set out in the Criminal Code
in respect of proceedings for summary conviction
offences.
So what do these sections contain? In brief they allow
an inspector appointed by the board to sign what they call
a contravention notice in respect to an alleged offence. I
presume by contravention they mean a violation of some
law, rule or regulation. Then the notice must be served
personally on the producer, or if he resides outside
Canada it is sent to him by registered mail. The producer
in Canada then has 14 days to dispute, as they call it, the
allegations contained in the notice. It is of interest to note
that the producer upon whom notice is served by registered mail has 20 days from the date of the posting of the
registered letter, not from the date it is received by him, to
make his denial. If a producer disputes the allegation,
then an ordinary court action can be taken against him. If
he does not dispute the allegation or if he does not answer
it, then the board imposes the penalty set out in clause
44.5 of the bill. In other words, the board takes the place
of and in effect becomes a court of law, although not the
kind of court we want in our judicial system.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Is there not a provision whereby this is
subject to an action which might be taken by the Attorney
General of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. It says, ". . . unless otherwise

directed by the Attorney General of Canada, . .. " This is
the way they ordinarily proceed. In effect, the board tells
the accused: "You are guilty of an offence and we will
impose a penalty on you unless you prove you are not
guilty." There is the constant threat that if a producer
should dare to dispute the allegation or deny his guilt, the
board will charge him in a regular court of law. There are
no safeguards; there are no hearings. A producer residing

SNT

outside Canada could, if the mails were slow, be convicted
and sentenced by the board before he actually knew he
was being charged.
* (1440)

I believe it is wholly wrong to give such power to the
board. Such a system will leave the door wide open to
abuse, to favoritism, or the reverse. To make matters
worse, the board is given power to restore the penalty
they have imposed when they wish to do so, which is a still
greater way in which abuses can occur.
Honourable senators, I believe we should be vigilant in
safeguarding our legal system. Let us not weaken it by
giving power to boards to act as courts of law. Indeed, I
am surprised that such a distinguished body as the
Canadian Wheat Board would even agree to accept such
powers. I suggest to the Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture that they amend Bill C-204 by deleting from it
those clauses which will give the board such unusual and
extraordinary power with respect to offences and penalties under the act. We have courts of law, and we have
confidence in and respect for them. Let the courts administer the law, and let the Canadian Wheat Board administer the Canadian Wheat Board Act.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, debate adjourned.
ADULT OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Margaret Norrie moved the second reading of Bill
C-195, to amend the Adult Occupational Training Act.
She said: Honourable senators, I should like to express
my pleasure with the opportunity I have been given to
move second reading of the bill to amend the Adult Occupational Training Act. May I say at the outset that the
proposed amendments to the Adult Occupational Training Act are evidence of the government's continuing commitment to the program of occupational training which it
introduced in 1967, and its concern for equity of accessibility to economic and social programs by the citizens it
serves. I believe the changes will strengthen this important and proven legislation by making it more meaningful
to a larger segment of the Canadian labour force.
There are five changes proposed and I shall discuss
them one by one.
As you are all aware, the existing eligibility criteria for
the receipt of training allowances-allowances which are
intended to be replacement income for adult trainees with
family responsibilities-have excluded, through what has
become known as "the three-year rule," the majority of
our nation's youth from benefiting under the program at a
time in their lives when it now appears they need this type
of assistance the most. They need occupational training in
order to find and keep a job. Also, many married women
who have been returning to the labour force in increasing
numbers during recent years have found that financially
assisted training was inaccessible to them because they
did not have the required three-year attachment to the
labour force.
The first change which is proposed is the removal
altogether of the "three-year rule" to permit all adults

who need it to benefit from the program of occupational
training. I believe this change will provide young workers
with the opportunity to become productive without a long
delay, and the married woman returning to the labour
force with the opportunity to refresh the skills she once
learned, or to learn new ones, and to receive financial
assistance while doing so.
I should like to say, in addition, that this change reflects
the views expressed to the Department of Manpower and
Immigration by social agencies and private groups, as
well as by the provincial governments which have been
unanimous in their desire to see the rule lifted and the
training program made more accessible and flexible to
meet the needs of all groups in our rapidly changing
society.
I must hasten to add that while the "three-year rule" is
no longer needed to give the priority in training to the
older and more mature worker, we have, on the other
hand, ensured that we will not be encouraging young
people to leave regular school before completing their
basic education. The criteria for receiving allowances,
therefore, will be exactly the same as the criteria for
referral to training-that is, a trainee must be one year
older than the school-leaving age in the province where he
or she lives, and be one year out of school.
There is provision too in the bill for increased flexibility
in payment of training allowances to provide explicitly for
those who have no financial responsibilities or do not
have the same financial obligations as a married person
with dependants. By paying a little less to those who have
no financial responsibilities, for example, to those who
live at home with their parents or spouse, there will be
more to provide to those who do have obligations-obligations which without financial assistance might preclude
these individuals from taking the training they so badly
need. Regulations providing suitable allowance rates are
presently being drafted.
I shall move on now to the proposed new section 4(1) of
the Adult Occupational Training Act. It too is related to
eligibility, but in this case to eligibility for training, not
allowances. Under the existing legislation a mature adult
who goes back to school at his own expense and then
seeks a training course under the Canada Manpower
Training Program is ineligible until he again has been out
of school a year. It was never the intent to penalize mature
adults for showing initiative in returning to school of their
own volition to attain needed qualifications for further
training. What could have been further from the spirit of
the original concept of an adult occupational training
program?
e (1450)
Although only a few people are adversely affected by
the present wording of the act, it is necessary to amend it
so that no ambiguity exists and all interpretations lead to
but one conclusion-that adults who have at any time
been a year out of school do not lose eligibility for training
if they subsequently return to school and then seek training under the Canada Manpower Training Program.
Honourable senators, I should like to draw your attention to a most important feature of the bill-the proposal
to amend the legislation in regard to on-the-job training.

SENATE DEBATES
In the existing legislation there is an impediment which
makes it impossible to provide on-the-job training within
the Training-in-Industry Program, except where necessary, because of technological or economic changes
affecting an employer that would otherwise result in loss
of employment to the employees concerned.
Before proceeding further I should like to remind honourable members of the highly successful Canada Manpower Training-on-the-Job Program initiated last October
in response to the critically high unemployment situation
of last winter. The program was designed to stimulate
employers to prepare for future expansion and to permit
persons, who would otherwise be unemployed, to learn on
the job skills which would be of a continuing value to
them by increasing their employability or earning capacity, and preparing them to take advantage of future
employment opportunities.
Honourable senators will recall that the program was
mounted quickly as part of the Special Winter Employment Program, and that the initial allocation of $20 million was increased to $50 million in late February.
Employers eagerly seized the opportunity to train future
employees right in their own plants. In fact, the response
from industry has exceeded all expectations. So far,
12,345 contracts have been signed, providing training for
43,052 unemployed persons at a cost to Canada of just
under the $50 million allocated.
I give this background to show that the proposed
change which removes the impediment to providing onthe-job training, except in the special circumstances
which I have described, is a necessary and most reasonable step for the government to take. From experience
gained through the special Training-on-the-Job Program
last winter, it is clear that on-the-job training is a most
effective method of conducting occupational training, and
that more emphasis should be placed upon it in the future.
The change will enable the department to include training-on-the-job in Training-in-Industry projects on a continuing basis, and will increase the government's ability to
assist those workers who day after day are being laid off
as a result of new machinery and processes being introduced in their plants and work sites. Workers whose skills
become obsolete overnight, as it were, can be retrained
with the minimum of dislocation and hardship. I am sure
this house will agree that this change will benefit both
employer and employee alike, and will increase the flexibility of manpower programs in the industrial training
field.
Another change relates to training in industry. The
recommended amendment will permit the Department of
Manpower and Immigration to enter into training-inindustry contracts with groups of employers. This change
will streamline the administration of the Training-inIndustry Program, because the department will be able to
write one contract for the common training of employees
from various companies. Under the existing legislation,
whenever a group of companies decides to join together to
provide training for their employees-for example, in
some new process-the Department of Manpower and
Immigration must enter into separate contracts with each
individual employer.
[Hon. Mrs. Norrie.]

June 27, 1972

A good example of such a situation, which I will use as
an illustration, has to do with the Canadian Lumbermen's
Association and the need to retrain lumber graders. In
1970 a new set of standards was issued by the Canadian
Lumber Standards Division of the Canadian Standards
Association for the grading of softwood, which provided
for a new, uniform, North American standard.
Lumber graders from across Canada had to be trained
or they would face the prospect of losing their employment. The Canadian Lumbermen's Association developed
a training program arranged to conduct courses in various centres across the country, and approached the
Department of Manpower and Immigration for financial
assistance under the Training-in-Industry Program. It
was necessary, because of the existing legislation, to write
separate contracts with each individual lumberyard
owner to fulfil the requirement of the legislation. It would
have been much more efficient to have entered into a
contract with the association on behalf of the hundreds of
lumberyards which sent candidates to the training
courses, and the proposed change will permit this type of
an arrangement in the future.
I believe the change will help to encourage employers to
benefit from the Training-in-Industry Program, and will
go a long way towards upgrading manpower qualifications among industrial workers, and increasing productivity across our great nation.
The last change proposed by the bill is one which will
simplify financial arrangements between the Department
of Manpower and Immigration and the provinces. At
present interim payments are made on a monthly basis by
the department to the provinces based on estimated costs,
with an adjustment after the end of the fiscal year and
after a detailed audit of the provinces' books. In practice,
this process has proven unwieldy and laborious. To rectify the situation, discussions have been held with the provinces, and there is broad agreement that training should
be purchased at mutually acceptable prices without the
subsequent final settlement process. The change will
permit the department to offer provinces the option of a
negotiated fixed price, rather than the present arrangement of interim payments and complex audits.
Honourable senators, I have outlined the nature of the
changes which the bill proposes to the Adult Occupational
Training Act, and the rationale behind the changes. The
bill should in no way be considered a major overhaul of
the current legislation, but it will enable more Canadians
to benefit from occupational training according to their
own needs, and at a time in their lives when the opportunity is needed most.
The change which recommends the elimination of the
"three-year rule," the rule which demanded a three-year
attachment to the labour force, unless one had dependants, before training allowances would be paid, is a most
progressive step forward in the evolution of the adult
training program. The recognition of, and the response to,
the plight of young workers in this day and age of increasing technological change, caught between school and the
labour market without a marketable skill, has been widely
recommended, and is now proposed as a legislative
change. The special needs of women returning to the
labour market will also be met by this change, reflecting

the government's commitment to equity and its response
to the recommendations made by the Royal Commission
on the Status of Women and other groups who made their
views known on the subject of women's rights.
The other changes which I have described are not as
full of headline material as the "three-year rule" change,
but they will, in time, be equally as important because
they build flexibility into the legislation, and will allow the
department to place more emphasis in the future on
industrial training.
a (1500)

Training in industry and the learning of skills on the job
will be a training method used with increasing frequency
in the years ahead. It will never, of course, fully replace
institutional training, but it has application in so many
areas where no other method is quite suitable, and it has
proven itself efficient both economically and socially.
This government wishes to be in a position to offer one of
the most flexible, dynamic, and realistic occupational
training programs in the western industrialized world.
The change which has to do with the method of purchasing training from the provinces emphasizes the government's commitment that consultation and co-operation
with the provinces in the critical area of manpower planning and training will receive top priority in the days and
months ahead. A province's role in determining training
needs and providing the type of training its citizens
require has always been an important feature of the
Canada Manpower Training Program, and this role is to
be emphasized and strengthened. The change in the legislation which permits a negotiated price for the purchase
of training is one step along the way towards an environment of close consultation and co-operation at every level.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I urge your support
of this bill which I present for your consideration today
and which, if enacted, will increase the employment
opportunities and earning potential of all Canadians.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, first of
all, may I congratulate my colleague from Nova Scotia,
the honourable Senator Norrie, on her very fine presentation. It is obvious that she is a fine speaker. This was her
maiden speech in this chamber, and I can assure her we
all look forward to hearing her many times in the future.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators, as has
already been so well stated, this bill proposes five amendments to the Adult Occupational Training Act. I might
note that this act can now be found in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, chapter A-2. I do not think any of
the proposed amendments are controversial. All should
find ready approval. Of course, as was stated, all are not
of equal importance. Indeed, so far as the person seeking
training is concerned, I think the most important amendment is the one which eliminates the requirement that he
has to have been in the labour force for three years, or
that he supports dependants in order to be eligible to
receive training allowances. Section 3 of the present act is
to be changed, and this three-year business is being done
away with.
Under the proposed amendment the minister will be
able to pay to an adult who is being trained an allowance
25312-35

related to family circumstances and the living costs of
that adult. It is provided that a smaller allowance is to be
paid to an adult without dependants, but this cannot be
less than $20 a week. While it is obvious that this is an
important amendment, and one which experience has
shown is both necessary and desirable, I expect difficulties will arise as to the amount to be paid unless some
proper guidelines and safeguards are laid down. I do not
know just what the guidelines are that are now being
followed, but I do not like the idea of a training allowance
being set as $20 a week for anyone. Let us face it, when
such a vague means test as "training allowance related to
the family circumstances and living costs of that adult" is
set down, great care must be exercised to prevent discrimination among such adults. I expect the level of
unemployment insurance and welfare payments would
have to be considered in determining the amount to be
paid under the provisions of the Adult Occupational
Training Act. The other amendment of importance to the
applicant for training is that which permits training on
the job.
While I support the amendments proposed in Bill C-195,
I do not think they go far enough. Indeed, I think it is time
the whole Adult Occupational Training Act was given a
thorough study in order to bring it in line with present day
conditions. Perhaps when we return after the summer
recess-if we do return-one of our standing committees
might undertake such a study.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is a good idea.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not wish to be too critical of
the training program. I know it has done good work, but it
may well be that it needs to be changed in order to meet
the new social and economic conditions. The weaknesses
of the program have been pointed out on various
occasions.
Honourable senators will recall that the Report of the
Special Senate Committee on Poverty, for instance, devoted a chapter to this point entitled "The Poor and the
Manpower System," which is to be found at page 149 of
that report. I quote, in part, from that chapter:
In operation, the Federal Manpower program is oriented toward providing a service to employers-that
is, toward labour demand. Department priorities are
directed at meeting the existing and forecast needs of
the labour market and not at meeting the needs of the
individual worker. This conflicts to some extent with
the purposes of the Adult OccupationalTrainingAct,
as stated on March 3, 1967, by the then-Minister of
Manpower and Immigration who said:
We want to provide a second chance to the people
who need it most. These are the men and women
who missed the chance to acquire a skill during
their youth or whose skill has been made obsolete
by technological change.
The report continues:
Thus what was intended as a "people-oriented" program has become an "economy-oriented" program. In
practice, the evidence presented to the Senate Committee clearly indicates that the programs of the
Department are just not available or accessible "to the

and

May I add that I do not feel there has been any improvement since that report came out. To my mind, this is
borne out by the fact that provision has been made for
training allowances in certain cases of only $20 a week.
Such a miserable allowance must be meant as bus fare or
pocket money for the children of the well-to-do; it is not
even a subsistence allowance for the children of the poor.
Honourable senators, in any study of our manpower
training courses the recommendations of the Special
Senate Committee on Poverty deserve to be kept in mind.
I should like to place the major recommendation of that
committee in this matter on record again, and it is:
That the Government of Canada shift its emphasis
from Manpower training in narrow labour-force
terms to a broad policy aimed at developing and
making the best use of the human resources of the
nation. This will require a number of changes in the
priorities and emphasis which are reflected in the
policies and programs of the Department of Manpower and Immigration. The departmental activities
should be re-oriented from a service to employers to a
service to individual citizens in terms of their particular needs for academic up-grading, occupational
training, mobility assistance, and job placement.
Restrictions which now effectively exclude the poor
and disadvantaged from departmental programs
must be removed.
I believe Bill C-195 could be improved a great deal by
including in it a few more amendments to the act. For
example, under clause 2, which amends section 4(1) of the
act, a manpower officer may arrange for the enrolment of
an adult in any occupational training course which will, in
the opinion of the manpower officer, provide training
suitable for that adult and increase his earning capacity
or his opportunities for employment. Honourable senators
will note the wide discretion that is given to the manpower
officer, and also the fact that there is no provision for an
appeal from his decision. I do believe there should be an
appeal procedure provided against the decision of the
local manpower officer if he refuses to arrange for an
adult to enrol in an occupational training course.
* (1510)

I think too a second look should be given to the provision in the act which provides that no occupational training course may exceed 52 weeks of full-time instruction,
or 182 hours of part-time instruction. I believe this to be
wholly wrong, as it could work to the disadvantage of
many students.

I also believe it to be wholly unfair that to be eligible for
training an adult must have been out of school for at least
a year. I would expect this is a wasted year in too many
cases. Indeed, it would be beneficial, in my view, to have
the occupational training course as soon as possible after
leaving school.
While I believe these occupational training courses are
very worth while, and while I support the proposed
amendments as being helpful, I think we must never lose
sight of one great truth, which is that all the training and
all the courses, no matter how good in themselves, will be
of little benefit to the person receiving them unless we can
provide him with employment when he has completed his
course. If he is to get full benefit from his training, he
must have the opportunity to use the knowledge and the
skill he has acquired, so that he will be a useful, respected,
and happy member of society.
I know the situation today, at least in some regions of
Canada, is such that there is no employment for persons
who have completed these courses. What, then, are they to
do? Personally, I think all those taking adult occupational
courses should come under the Unemployment Insurance
Act. The premiums could be deducted from their allowance, and the employer's contribution could be made by
the government and form part of the cost of the program.
If no employment is then available, at least unemployment insurance would be paid, and the person would
know he was being treated as part of the labour force and
not as a welfare case.
Honourable senators, I mentioned a few moments ago
that in 1967 the then Minister of Manpower and Immigration said:
We want to provide a second chance to the people
who need it most.
I agree with this, but I would go one step further and say
we must provide a first chance to those who need it most,
a chance for employment, which will permit them to live
useful and happy lives. This must be our first priority.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Yuzyk, debate adjourned.

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of honourable Senator Argue for the
second reading of Bill C-204, to amend the Canadian
Wheat Board Act.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, the
motion for second reading of this bill was made by Senator Argue on June 26. He gave several reasons why these
amendments should be proceeded with. I do not think
anything further needs to be said about this matter owing
25312-354

to the fact that Senator Argue outlined the reasons for the
adoption of the bill very well on that day. His reasons are
contained on pages 530 and 531 of Hansard.
As all honourable senators know, the Canadian Wheat
Board is an important agency which affects a large part
of our western economy. If honourable senators will read
and discuss the remarks of Senator Argue of June 26,
which received very comprehensive reporting, and knowing that the new revived Agriculture Committee of the
Senate wishes to discuss this, I would suggest in all sincerity that this bill be referred to that committee forthwith.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion for second reading?
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must
inform the Senate that if honourable Senator Argue
speaks now it will have the effect of closing the debate on
second reading.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, I am sure grain
producers will appreciate the importance given to second
reading of Bill C-204 in the Senate. There has been general approval for all the provisions of the bill, except in the
case of Senator Macdonald who raised certain objections
to the penalty features.
The Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture was
informed this morning that the experience of the board
has been that in some instances where producers have
overdelivered grain by as much as 5,000 bushels-that is,
to a value of $6,000 or $7,000-and they have been subsequently charged in court, the penalty imposed at times
has been as little as $1. Therefore the Canadian Wheat
Board feels that there should be an increase in the penalty, so provision is made for a minimum penalty of $50.
However, as I take it, the offences involved are usually, if
not exclusively, for overdelivery of grain. The attitude of
the board is that if the farmer wishes he may deal directly
with the board after having committed this offence, and
his penalty will be a reduction in his delivery opportunities to the extent of his previous overdeliveries, plus a
further penalty equal to the value of the amount of his
overdeliveries.
* (1410)

While I cannot speak on this as a lawyer, I can certainly
speak on it as a farmer, and my understanding is that the
board does not take objection to a small overdelivery. For
example, as a producer I may have delivery quotas at a
given time for 1,000 bushels of grain; I may have hired a
neighbour with a 400-bushel truck to come and haul out
my grain. If there are two deliveries at 400 bushels a load,
there are 200 bushels left to be delivered. Somebody has
to estimate a 200-bushel load in a 400-bushel truck.
There are and have to be errors, and the Canadian
Wheat Board has informed me that if the error is within
25 bushels or so they do not take any objection at all. On
the other hand, if there is a serious overdelivery-in other
words, a deliberate effort by someone to beat the quota by

SENATE DEBATES
delivering an excessive amount-they feel these provisions are in order and should be adopted.
At the conclusion of my remarks I will move that this
bill be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture. I am sure the Honourable Otto Lang will be
able to appear before that committee, and he can give in a
more specific and more elaborate way the reasons for
suggesting this clause in the new bill.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

AIR TRANSPORT
CONVENTIONS ON UNLAWFUL SEIZURE OF AIRCRAFT
AND UNLAWFUL ACTS AGAINST CIVIL AVIATIONDEBATECONCLUDED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the inquiry of honourable Senator Martin, calling the attention of the Senate to the Convention for the
Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at
The Hague December 16, 1970, and the Convention for the
Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil
Aviation, done at Montreal September 23, 1971, which
were tabled in the Senate on Monday, 26th June, 1972.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, there is very
little I can add to the speech made by the Leader of the
Government on this matter. All Canadians agreed with
the government when, in December, 1970, it signed the
Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of
Aircraft. They also agreed when, in September, 1971, the
government signed a Convention for the Suppression of
Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation.
We are evidently all opposed to air piracy, as we are
opposed to all other unlawful acts against the safety of
civil aviation. Air piracy, however, is no longer a problem
involving only the Cuban and United States governments.
It has become an international curse. Measures of precaution, reminiscent of police states, have had to be taken in
most major airports of the free world, and still people
seem to be able to smuggle weapons abroad planes, still
they use these weapons for purposes of air piracy.
Air piracy is not the only problem today. No longer have
we to contend only with people looking for a free ride to a
country with the type of government they think they
would prefer. The airlines have become the favourite
target of another brand of fanatic-the extortionist, who
threatens to blow up planes unless huge sums of money
are paid to support his cause.
Airlines are also used now by some people at times to
exert political pressure. I refer here to the use of violence

and sabotage. The Middle East conflict between Israel
and the Arab nations has given rise to a lot of this.
Threats against the safety of airplanes are also used by
other demented individuals to blackmail the airline

companies.
We have witnessed recently the novel use to which the
skill of parachute-jumping has been put by some in the
United States.
(Hon. Mr. Argue.]

June 28, 1972

All of this despicable behaviour jeopardizes the lives of
thousands of innocent individuals. Something must be
done to bring an end to it. We in this country have recently
amended our Criminal Code to provide much more seri-

ous penalties for air piracy. It is to be hoped that this will
act as a deterrent. But no such measure can be significantly effective in suppressing air piracy and other outrageous acts against the safety of civil aviation until such
time as it is bolstered by an international agreement
among all states to extradite and prosecute offenders.

Unless more nations sign these conventions and unless
more of the nations more directly involved-and Canada
is not one of them, thank God-sign them, we cannot look
forward to much improvement. Canada can sign all the
extradition agreements it wants with Cuba. That makes
little difference on the international landscape, because
very few offences of this type occur on Canadian airlines.
It would be more useful if Canada might convince Cuba
to sign these two conventions, rather than an extradition

treaty binding only our two countries. We have to wipe out
all the havens available to potential criminals, if we are

ever to restore complete safety to air travel. Whatever this
government can do by influence or example to bring this
about will receive our complete and unreserved support.
The Hon. the Speaker: This item is now considered as

having been debated.
ADULT OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING ACT

SENA TE DEBA TES

Senator Macdonald pointed out some of the important
hindrances in the Adult Occupational Training Act which
cripple the manpower training program in effectively
reducing poverty and unemployment. These can be briefly summarized as follows: First, the underlying principles
of the manpower training program are not oriented
towards the disadvantaged groups, in short contrast with
the manpower strategy of the United States and some
other countries. Secondly, as was voiced by the Special
Senate Committee on Poverty, the federal manpower program is more oriented toward providing a service to
employers than toward meeting the needs of the individual worker. Thirdly, the act provides that no occupational
training course may exceed 52 weeks' duration of fulltime instruction. This deprives those persons who require
more than one year's academic upgrading, particularly
those below the Grade 8 level. Statistics prove that the low
educational level of the population results in a comparatively high rate of unemployment, notably in the Atlantic
region.
Fourthly, under this act a person employed in insurable
employment is not eligible for unemployment insurance
while in receipt of a training allowance, but does retain
his benefit and contribution rights. If unemployment
insurance is to be truly universal, as was apparently
intended by the government, why should trainees, who
must pay income tax on their allowances, also not pay
unemployment insurance and thus collect benefits that
are often needed at the conclusion of the training
program?
It is obvious that this new bill does not solve the numerous problems in the Canada Manpower Training Program. I do not share the belief of the minister, Mr. Bryce
Mackasey, that this "-is already perhaps the world's
finest manpower program."
The Eighth Annual Review of the Economic Council of
Canada states that the federal government has spent
approximately $1.4 billion since the inception of the adult
occupational training program in 1967, to March 31, 1972.
In the absence of detailed evaluative data regarding the
effect of the manpower training program on unemployment in Canada, it is impossible to write up a balance
sheet of the credits and debits. The lack of concrete data
on the operation of the scheme and the effects on unemployment motivated the Financial Times to publish an
editorial on February 22, 1971, part of which I quote:
What taxpayers will find almost incredible is that no
assessment of the program's value has been made
since September 1967. On the basis of surveys made in
the first nine months of 1969, the government happily
claims that three out of every four trainees are getting
jobs in 1971. On that ancient evidence, it is happy to
go on spending more than $300 million every year.
"No minister," we are told, has ever asked for a more
up-to-date check.
It is no wonder that the public is getting more and
more skeptical-and more and more angry-about
government pretensions. The wonder is that the federal government can remain so complacent.
Since this editorial, the Report of the Canada Manpower Training Program for 1970 was tabled in Parliament on
December 16, 1971. But it falls far short of meeting the

DE-.--

criticism of the FinancialTimes, as it still lacks concrete
evaluative data.
The recent report of the New Brunswick Task Force on
Social Development refers to today's labour market, in
which many trainees cannot find jobs after they leave the
programs. It says:
Unfortunately, programs attempting to improve the
supply of labour (such as vocational education and
the various federal manpower programs) have never
been directly related to programs that attempt to generate a demand for labour. The result is that persons
are trained for jobs that may not exist, and jobs are
created requiring skills that may not be available
locally.
The Royal Commission on the Status of Women complains that there is discrimination against women, stating
that:
Occupational segregation by sex is being perpetuated
in the occupational training for adults programs.
They demonstrate that manpower offers the bulk of
women trainees low-paid work like hairdressing, clerical
and sales jobs, and trains few in management courses.
Women make up almost 35 per cent of the labour force,
yet last year only 20 per cent of the people trained in
manpower were women. Women want more womanpower.
Because substantive changes in the manpower training
program have not been forthcoming, the Province of
Quebec has declared its desire to administer its own adult
vocational program, since the federal program "no longer
reflects the needs of the people of Quebec."
Quebec Labour Minister, Mr. Cournoyer, complained on
June 5, 1971, that the federal government selects candidates for their financial worth and ignores those who
have less than the average education, which constitute the
chronic welfare cases that the province has to support.
In view of the widespread criticism of the manpower
training program, it is obvious that greater changes must
be made than those offered in Bill C-195. I approve the
present changes as far as they go, but they should go
much further. Consequently, I should like to see this bill
considered in committee where senators could discuss
these matters with the officials of the Department of
Manpower and Immigration. Also, I believe it is evident
that the operations of this program should be thoroughly
reviewed, investigated and concretely evaluated. This
could be undertaken by one of our standing committees
or by a special committee in the very near future. We
could thus perform a useful service in the interests of the
Canadian people in this vast and rich land of ours, where
human resources should fully benefit from the natural
resources.

SCIENCE POLICY
CONSIDERATION OF VOLUME II OF REPORT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONCLUDED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 28, the
adjourned debate on the consideration of Volume II of the
Report of the Special Committee on Science Policy, tabled
in the Senate on Thursday, February 24, 1972.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, first of all, may
I say to Senator Edgar Fournier how happy we are to see
him in his seat and looking so well.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
[French]

L'hon. M. Martin: Nous sommes tous si heureux d'ac-

cueillir le sénateur Fournier.
[English]
Honourable senators, some time has gone by since the
Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Science
Policy submitted the second report of that committee's
outstanding work. I need hardly add that the committee
has rendered a distinctive service. Its hearings have
stimulated much thought and discussion at many levels in
the general public through the news media, the scientific
and technological communities, professional organizations and societies, and, I may say, even within the government itself.
My colleague, the Honourable Alastair Gillespie, Minister of State for Science and Technology, has said, and I
now say on behalf of the government, that we regard the
committee's report as an important contribution to the
development of an effective science policy for Canada.
Perhaps I should say science policies, for it has been
argued by Mr. Gillespie, with the support, I think, of a
good many others, that science policy is not something
that can be tied up in one neat package for all time, but
rather it is a series of policies using and applying science
in support of national objectives; a set of policies for
different sectors, reflecting the priorities of the government and the objectives of agencies. I think it is fair to say
that no one rigid science policy should be looked for.
National objectives are central, of course, to the formulation of science policies. These objectives are determined
by political factors, socio-economic factors, and so forth.
These factors may change with time and thus new policies
will have to be developed to meet new objectives. Any
national science policy will be the composite result of
policies developed in various areas.
The committee in its reports has referred repeatedly to
the weakness of the research and development effort of
Canadian industry and noted the extent to which government departments and agencies perform research and
development work in their own laboratories. Since the
committee's report was submitted, my colleague has
advised me that the government has decided that wherever possible research and development work will be contracted out to industry. After all, it is in industry that the
results of such activities are most likely to find their way
into the marketplace as new goods and services.
Among the 45 recommendations spread through several
chapters, there was one calling for the allocation of about
10 per cent of the national research and development
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.)

June 28, 1972

effort to basic research by the year 1980. The report urges
that an immediate start be made toward this goal.
This would appear to mean a 100 per cent increase in
the support of basic research in the next eight years. But
let us examine more closely what would, in fact, happen if
the recommendations were followed. Current basic
research expenditures in Canada are about $255 million.
This represents about one-quarter of the total spending on
research and development. If approximately 10 per cent
of the national research and development effort were
devoted to basic research by 1980, as is recommended by
the Committee, this would amount to $475 million. While
that is a doubling in dollar amount, it is a deceptive
increase. The reason is that the increase is just about
enough to meet the inflation-sophistication factor which
runs to some 64 per cent or 7 per cent a year.
If the basic research spending were to grow at a rate of
6.5 per cent a year, by the year 1980 spending would total
$479 million, slightly more than recommended as a target
by the committee's report. Thus, honourable senators can
see that if that recommendation were to be implemented,
no real increase in expenditures for basic research would
result. It may be that the amount of the basic research
done by a country should more properly be related to
what that country can afford to do. That is, the measure
may be more appropriately one of the proportion of gross
national product than of the total spending on research
and development. This is an important question which
must be more closely studied.
The committee has recommended that the Economic
Council set up a special commission on the future which,
among other things, would look at the years 2000 and 1985
and attempt to project various possible environments that
could emerge. No one would disagree that this examination into the future or "futurology," as it is called, is an
essential part of policy planning process.
All one has to do is read Herman Kahn's book entitled
The Year 2000 to see the attention that is being paid in so
many areas of the world to this aspect of planning for the
remaining years of this century. No country can hope
successfully to compete in the modern world unless these
techniques are observed not only by scientists but by
those who have the responsibility of public administration. A variety of institutions in government and outside
are now involved in this very area.
* (1440)

A related recommendation of the committee concerns
this house. The committee suggested that this chamber
sponsor a conference for the purpose of establishing a
commission on the future, the responsibility of which
would be to help as many private and public organizations as possible to forecast and build their futures not
only in isolation but together. The Senate has examined
that proposal.
The committee has also proposed that the Canadian
government and Parliament should adopt an overall plan
for the seventies for science and technology based on
longer-term projections and overall national research and
development targets. Existing projections are probably
inadequate, and in some cases forecasts of expenditures
six years hence have been no better than assumptions

JunC

SENATE DEBATES

based on the experience of the proportion of the gross
national product that R and D has been in the past.
In connection with this proposal the committee has said
that the procedures and organizations of the planning,
programming and budgeting system should be improved
to provide a better assessment of the output of research
and development activities and a better basis for determining annual appropriations for financing these
activities.
The committee believes that after 1980 this approach
can be adapted to the arrangement and formulation of
successive five-year plans. It should be noted that the
existing budget forecasting techniques cover only three
years, not five years, as is stated in the report.
Another measurement tool of research and development recommended by the committee is a national inventory to be kept by the Minister of State for Science and
Technology. The committee says that the ministry should
be made responsible for developing a national audit of
current R and D programs and projects which are the
beneficiaries of support by public funds. In this regard
the nucleus of such an inventory now exists with respect
to federally funded university research. It can be found in
the National Science Library information exchange
centre. I understand also that study is being given to ways
of extending this inventory to other sectors and to other
sources of funding.
One of the recommendations which has attracted considerable attention and probably will involve considerable
debate relates to spending goals. The committee proposes
that the national expenditure on research and development will reach 2.5 per cent of the gross national product
by the beginning of the next decade. This represents a
substantial increase from the current 1.3 per cent of the
GNP which now is devoted to research and development.
The federal government funding should be restricted to
worth-while programs and projects, says the committeeand I am sure there will be general agreement with this.
Federally funded programs are being scrutinized now, I
may say, as perhaps never before and it is likely to take
some time before a final judgment can be reached about
how realistic a goal can be set.
Another area of controversy concerns the recommendation that a Canadian research board be set up, together
with three foundations, to be responsible mainly for the
development of a capacity for, and the support of, curiosity-oriented basic research in universities and similar institutions. It is suggested that the board report to the Secretary of State. Related to this recommendation is another
that the three foundations cover the physical sciences, the
life sciences and social sciences and humanities and bear
the full cost of the projects and programs they support.
Honourable senators will appreciate that these two
recommendations have very far-reaching implications,
not the least of which involves the complete separation of
free basic research, mission-oriented basic research, and
what is called applied research. Such a step must be
carefully examined in the light of the views of many
agencies and scientific disciplines, and I think Mr. Gillespie, the Minister of State for Science and Technology, has
emphasized this on several occasions since the report was

issued. At the same time these steps would involve the
separation of the National Research Council's granting
function from the laboratories. Such a separation, of
course, has been proposed several times in the past.
Apart from these considerations, the Senate committee's recommendations also would mean changes in the
legislation respecting the three granting councils, the
National Research Council, the Medical Research Council, and the Canada Council.
A few moments ago I mentioned the three foundations
proposed for the support of what is called "curiosity-oriented basic research". The committee's report makes four
proposals about the guiding principles of these foundations. It says they must emphasize quality rather than
quantity in developing and supporting research. I think
that generally speaking the National Research Council
and the Medical Research Council have recognized the
importance of emphasizing quality rather than quantity.
They support and encourage the development of centres
of excellence by means of negotiated development grants
and group grants. I do not pretend to have any expertise
in these fields, but I did have a very close association as
Minister of National Health and Welfare with both these
bodies, and I can strongly support the statement that they
have-whatever should be done in the future-placed a
great emphasis on quality rather than quantity, and that
the negotiated development of grants, particularly the
medical grants, over the years has been pursued with
great care and, I think, with productive results.
This does not mean that all institutional arrangements
are fully satisfactory. It is well that we should have these
things called to our attention and give them the kind of
examination which all institutions require at some stage
in their history. I doubt if anyone would disagree with the
necessity of continuing examination so that whatever may
be the institution responsible for the support of basic
research, these principles should be followed to develop
excellence in that area.
The report suggests that post-doctoral fellowships continue to be awarded or established for maximum periods
of five years; that grants be directed only to researchers
with demonstrated international quality standards so that
excellence can be more generously rewarded and subjected to less administrative control; and, finally, that the
peer system of reviewing grants be improved where possible to ensure a high degree of impartiality and competence. These are recommendations that have been made
from time to time.
(1450)

Dr. Wilder Penfield, I know, used to insist that when the
number of annual grants by government to institutions
was restricted it prevented their proper planning and the
like. But how to get over the difficulties which a parliamentary system poses, in annual appropriations by Parliament, I do not know.
A number of recommendations have to do with the
manpower situation-our stock of qualified scientists and
engineers. As honourable senators know, the Ministry of
State for Science and Technology, under Mr. Gillespie,
has been given a definite mandate by the government to
initiate surveys of the supply of and the demand for
highly qualified manpower. It is expected that sound esti-

552

SENATE DEBATES

mates of our stock of highly qualified manpower should
be available in late 1974 in a form that can be brought up
to date annually thereafter. In addition, the demand picture will be examined every second year to determine the
qualifications of individuals who eventually fill job vacancies. Together with job vacancy surveys now being done,
this should provide a better idea of the changes in
demand.
This type of information is closely related to several of
the recommendations of the Special Senate Committee on
Science Policy dealing with the research foundations. The
committee has urged that the foundations apply the criterion of social merit to their support, that they avoid
undesirable duplication with work done elsewhere in the
country or abroad, and that they ensure the projects are
related and relevant to the Canadian science scene. They
should also, in the committee's view, reject big science
projects, as they are called, to be carried out with Canadian support alone. It is perhaps important to note that the
committee placed some emphasis on Canada not getting
into big science alone. That does not mean big science
should be out, they argue; it merely means that wider
support than just that of the Canadian government may
be more appropriate.
In some of our relations with other countries, it is suggested that co-operative projects, or joint projects, would
be of benefit to Canada, and to, for example, Japan and
Belgium, with which countries we have exchange of scientific arrangements. This country has an active and growing program of external relations in matters of science
and technology, and it is possible that co-operative efforts
in big science may some day figure as part of the activity
of these international arrangements.
The committee has also proposed that during this
decade the order of priority for government support of
what is called curiosity-oriented basic research should be,
first, the social sciences and the humanities and, secondly,
the life sciences, especially those related to human health.
Both of these areas are generally recognized as deserving
a higher priority than they enjoy at the moment.
Among the tasks now being undertaken by the Ministry
of State for Science and Technology is a review to determine whether a greater proportion of basic research can
be done in the universities. This follows closely the committee's suggestion that basic research activities of government agencies be examined to see if they are justified,
and if so to consider whether some of them could be
advantageously transferred to the universities. In addition, of course, the ministry is examining the criteria
which should guide the support of basic research.
An area in which it is more difficult to make a judgment
is that of the proposal that more of the basic research
activities of the government be concentrated in a national
research academy under institutes of the physical
sciences, the life sciences, and the social sciences. There
may be disadvantages in isolating researchers engaged in
basic research from the department's responsible for
carrying out specific missions. The conduct of applied
research may require that some basic research be
associated with it.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

June 28, 1972

Honourable senators, I have followed in a general way
some of the committee's recommendations, more or less
in sequence.
We come now to another of the major targets proposed,
that research and development activities performed by
the industrial sector be substantially increased, so that by
1980 they represent a maximum of about 60 per cent of
the national R and D effort.
This is a recommendation which has been made in this
form by many bodies. This committee is not the first to
make it. It was made by the Glassco Commission and, as
the committee itself notes, it was made by the Economic
Council and by OECD, although none of these set a specific percentage. These are responsible and thorough
bodies, as is the committee of the Senate, and considerable weight must be attached to their recommendations.
We come now to recommendations aimed at obtaining
the views of the secondary manufacturing industries and
of resource-based and primary manufacturing industries.
The special committee has proposed that the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce organize task forces in
the secondary manufacturing sector, with proper labour
and management representation, to examine problems of
scale and specialization and, within a year, to prepare a
plan to improve the efficiency, the innovative capacity,
and the international competitiveness of individual firms
through mergers or otherwise.
A chairman and small secretariat would be supplied, it
is suggested, by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, who would also be chairman of the special cabinet
committee to receive the task force reports. Chairmen and
secretariats of the task forces would form an office of
industrial reorganization to assist the cabinet committee.
A consideration which comes to mind in this regard is
the extent to which the proposed Competition Act would
affect such arrangements as mergers, even those designed
to improve efficiency, innovative capacity, and international competitiveness. So much for the recommendations
for secondary manufacturing task forces.
Honourable senators, I turn to the proposal for somewhat similar bodies in resource-based and primary manufacturing industries. The special committee recommends
that these be organized by the Minister of Energy, Mines
and Resources. Among their tasks would be an examination of innovative and R and D performance and, again,
they would be expected within a year to prepare a plan to
improve performance so as to economize resources, utilize
wastes more efficiently, reduce costs of production, discover new uses for their products, and further process
these products in Canada for export.
In the field of manpower, the first steps already are
being taken along the lines recommended by the special
committee. For example, the Ministry of State for Science
and Technology is taking a lead in a survey of highly
qualified manpower to determine the numbers and distribution of qualified scientists and engineers. These studies
also will be conducted so as to provide indicators of
qualifications and training needed in the light of government decisions for industrial R and D and innovation in
the 1970s.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

It is useful to have the views of the academic and
industrial sectors about their complementary roles in the
national science, technology and innovation effort. A conference for this purpose, as well as others, is among the
special committee's recommendations. Such a national
conference is envisaged as helping to identify ways and
means for industry and academic sectors to, help each
other, and to help others to accomplish their missions
better, and to devise a possible permanent liaison and
system for co-operation.
0 (1500)

The special committee proposes that the Ministry of
State for Science and Technology also should play a leading part in upgrading management training, through the
formation of a committee composed of representatives
from Canadian university schools of management and the
Canadian Research Management Association. The aim
would be to develop a training program for R and D
managers and a research program on the organization of
R and D activities, and of innovation strategies.
Other areas in which action has been taken include the
important questions of the extent to which research
should be done in-house or contracted out to industry and
the universities. The Ministry over which Mr. Gillespie
presides is reviewing now the criteria against which the
government will be able to judge what research and development programs should be conducted in government
laboratories, and what should be contracted out.
My colleague has said publicly that contracting out
applied research and development to industry has great
appeal to him because it takes place where the economic
benefits can be realized. This, or course, presupposes a
review of in-house R and D programs as proposed by the
special committee.

25312-36

Finally, the committee has proposed that a year from
now a new crown company be created to be called the
Canadian Industrial Laboratories Corporation, with a
strong industrial representation on its board and committees, and a growing industrial contribution in its financing. The committee's intention is that laboratories operated by government departments and agencies which
conduct research and development for secondary and
services industries and for mining and power utilities be
placed under this proposed new crown agency, responsible to the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce. This has very extensive implications and requires
careful study.
Many of the recommendations of the special committee's report have been touched on, more or less lightly,
during these remarks. There are others that are now
being examined and at the appropriate moment, the minister undoubtedly will have more to say about this. The
many questions raised and decisions required will not ail
be dealt with in a few days, weeks, or even, in some cases,
months. The committee, however, has given us much
material for examination and its members, who have
worked very hard and produced a notable series of documents, may be assured that the government's interest in
this matter will be continued.
The Hon. the Speaker: This item is now considered

SENATE ACCOUNTS
FIRST REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON INTERNAL
ECONOMY, BUDGETS AND ADMINISTRATION
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, the Standing
Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration makes its first report as follows:
Your committee to which were referred on 31st
May, 1972, the Clerk's Accounts, being a detailed
statement of his receipts and disbursements for the
fiscal year 1971-72, reports as follows:
Your committee has examined the above statement
and supporting statements and find them to be in
accordance with the estimates submitted by the
Senate and the authority necessary for the purpose.
We have received all the information and explanations which we have required. A letter from the Clerk,
certifying that the accounts were audited by the Auditor General and that the proper authority exists for all
payments made, is attached. Although a detailed
examination of all increases was not made, we would
state that the sums expended appear to be in keeping
with the duties of and the tasks undertaken by the
Senate and its committees, standing and special.
Your committee must again call the attention of the
Senate, as we did in our last year's report, to the
excessive printing costs. The accounts in our opinion
are bearing a disproportionate load of the cost of the
printing, notwithstanding the fact that printing
charges have decreased by $361,391.70 due to reduced
committee activity. The total cost of printing, $591,283.76, is broken down as follows: Debates of the
Senate, $171,656.40; Committees-Standing and Special $329,423.54; Senate Minutes and Journals, $65,592.79; Other Printing, $24,611.03.
All these moneys are paid to the Canadian Government Printing Bureau.
The overall net increase in expenditures compared
to the fiscal year 1970-71 is $539,059.82. This is a result
of additional benefits to senators, staff salaries and
the acquisition of new equipment, furniture and fixtures for the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?

HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
COMMITTEE INSTRUCTED TO STUDY
LABOUR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTES AFFECTING PUBLIC
SERVICES
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, June 20, the
adjourned debate on the motion of honourable Senator

SENATE DEBATES
Haig that the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be instructed to examine and report
upon the efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public services.
Hon. . Campbell Haig: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: If the honourable Senator Haig
speaks now, his speech will have the effect of concluding
the debate on this motion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, we have had a very
interesting discussion on this motion, in which Senators
Buckwold, Forsey, Lawson, Goldenberg and McElman
have taken part. When I introduced this motion on March
7, I referred only to matters coming under federal jurisdiction. Certain senators who have spoken here, or who
have talked to me privately, have indicated that the provincial and municipal authorities have had the same problem. It must be recognized, however, that this house can
deal only with matters coming under federal jurisdiction.
Some senators suggested that a special committee be set
up. I do not quarrel with that idea, but under our rules the
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science is deemed
appropriate to deal with labour relations.
It has been mentioned also that since the introduction of
this motion certain persons have been summoned to this
chamber who are extremely knowledgeable in matters
affecting labour relations. There is no reason why they

could not be included in any committee, whether special
or standing.

Honourable senators, my sole purpose in bringing this
matter to your attention, and in having the different viewpoints expressed, was to emphasize that which has been

indicated by the general thrust of those senators who have
spoken, that is, that a change must be made in labourmanagement relations which affect the innocent public.
Senator Goldenberg indicated that there will be a new
Labour Code. That may be so, but we have not got it yet.
In the meantime, I really wished to bring to the attention
of this chamber these important considerations which do
affect the public. Senator Goldenberg stated, as reported
in Senate Hansardat page 509:

Senator

Haig's motion has produced a useful

debate.
I am very happy to hear that. That was my sole purpose in
bringing this matter forward. I hope the motion will be
passed.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by honourable Senator Haig, seconded by honourable Senator Buckwold, that
the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science be instructed to examine and report upon the
efficiency of existing federal legislation in bringing about
the settlement of labour-management differences and disputes in areas affecting public services.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Yes.
Some Hon. Senators: No.
The Hon. the Speaker: There is uncertainty as to the
opinion. I may have to call in the honourable senators.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

* (1420)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I, with leave of the Senate, just
make one suggestion?
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed that honourable
Senator Flynn speak now?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Even if we adopt the motion now, it is
obvious that the Senate committee will not be able to do
anything. In my opinion the wise thing to do would be to
adopt the motion in principle and agree to reconsider it
when we reconvene, whether in a new Parliament or
otherwise. It is simply a question of procedure that some
of us disagree with, not a question of principle. Therefore,
I suggest that the motion be adopted but that nothing be
done about it until Parliament reconvenes.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not disagree, generally, with what
the Leader of the Opposition has said. During the course
of the debate it was pointed out that there would have to
be modifications in the wording of the resolution to fit,
really, the full situation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And if it could be understood that we
are not bound to the precise wording of this resolutionHon. Mr. Flynn: Nor even the committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Nor even the committee, that is right,
but that we are in agreement on the principle, then I think
with those general conditions we can agree to look into
the situation at some future time. It will not be in the
precise terms of this motion, but we will be willing to
examine the question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I fully agree with the Leader of the
Government. All I wanted to do, as I have explained
several times before, was to have a discussion on this
matter. The method and the wording are immaterial.
Therefore, I respectfully request that the motion be
passed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, I think it can be passed, bearing in
mind the implication of our two observations.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes.
Motion agreed to.

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, it
has been brought to my attention that Order No. 4 on our
Order Paper of yesterday was removed because apparently no one wanted to speak on the matter. The order was as
follows:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Martin, calling the attention of the
Senate to the Convention for the Suppression of
Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague
December 16, 1970, and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil

June 29, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Aviation, done at Montreal September 23, 1971, which
were tabled in the Senate on Monday, 26th June, 1972.
In the meantime I have been informed by Senator
Lawson that, in fact, he would like to speak on this subject. The only way he can do so now is if unanimous
consent is given to reinstate the order. Therefore, I ask for
unanimous consent to have the order reinstated so that
Senator Lawson can speak on it now.
The Hon. the Speaker: Senator McDonald's request has
two aspects to it. In the first place he is asking to have the
inquiry reinstated and in the second place, if I understand
correctly, he is suggesting that we proceed with that inquiry before proceeding with the remaining orders on the
Order Paper. Is my understanding correct?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That is correct, Mr. Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Consent is always given for good purposes, Senator McDonald.
Hon. Mr. Argue: At the end of the session.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Edward M. Lawson: Thank you for your indulgence, honourable senators. My remarks will be brief.
I read with interest the remarks of the honourable
Leader of the Government and I endorse those remarks. I
read also with considerable interest the remarks made
yesterday by the honourable Leader of the Opposition,
Senator Flynn. I support those remarks as well. I think it
is highly necessary that these two conventions be adopted,
and I congratulate the government on the speed with
which they did adopt these two conventions.
It is imperative that at the international level negotiations continue regarding those countries that give leave or
places for people to hide who are involved in air piracy.
But I wonder if we have done enough domestically. Of all
the flights I have made in Canada in recent months, only
on one occasion, and that was this week in Toronto, was
there the type of search made that would have the effect
of discouraging an attempt to hijack the plane. We were
confronted at the airport in Toronto by four members of
the RCMP, two of whom used metal detectors to give us a
thorough frisking, up and down, and inside and outside
our coats. Then we went to a table where we had our hand
baggage examined thoroughly. As I say, so far as I am
concerned this was the first time in Canada where such a
thorough search has taken place.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: I had the same experience last
week.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: It seems to me that on all other
occasions, whether by hand baggage or by other means, I
could have carried arms or weapons or hand grenades or
dynamite on board the plane had I so wished. In the
line-up I heard one passenger complain, somewhat vigorously, about this invasion of his privacy, and I reject that
type of criticism because it seems to me that redirecting
the plane to a destination that I have not contracted for is
an invasion of my privacy, and it seems to me that the
prospect of injury or suffering or anguish for members of
my family or the families of other passengers is an inva-

sion of privacy. I think that not only is there not too much
of this type of thorough examination, but there just is not
enough.
Honourable senators, we must put an end to this other
myth, this romantic attachment to the extortion principle
where large amounts of money are taken, and to this
patently asinine point of view that one hears expressed,
"Oh, well, it is the airlines and they can well afford to pay
out these hundreds of thousands of dollars because they
have all kinds of money." In my view we must bring home
as forcibly as we can the realization that these large
amounts of extorted moneys are not in fact being paid by
the airlines but are being paid by you and by me and by
the other passengers of these planes. We need to put an
end to that kind of romantic idea.
In this connection I should like to address a query to the
honourable Leader of the Government: Would it be possible to have one of our committees, whether it be the
Transport and Communications or one of the other committees, look into this situation, or would it be possible to
have consultation with the Minister of Transport on this
matter? Personally I should like to have the benefit of
hearing from representatives of the Canadian Air Line
Pilots Association. I should like to have the benefit of
hearing from the representatives of the airlines themselves, and I should like to see the wisdom and the experience of honourable senators from this chamber brought
to bear in the deliberations of such a committee to see
what steps could be taken to ensure that we should have,
if necessary, compulsory or mandatory inspection at all
international airports in the country. If this means having
to surrender your hand baggage and have it placed under
lock and key on the airplane, or if it means being subject
to inspection on each trip that you make by plane, I would
not consider that as an invasion of privacy.
Honourable senators, it seems to me to be sheer folly to
have all these conventions and treaties negotiated in an
effort to solve the problem at that level if we still leave
open and vacant the opportunity for anyone to board a
plane armed to the teeth or carrying weapons in hand
baggage. I think it is a sad commentary that an illegal
strike receives such universal praise, and that was an
illegal strike by the airline pilots. It is a sad commentary
that they were forced to take that kind of action to focus
attention on the real problem. I am sure it resulted in a
financial loss to the pilots of millions of dollars. It seems
to me that it would have been better had we had the
benefit of their experience to help determine what procedures should be adopted to ensure that at the very first
stage, when people enter an aircraft, there is no opportunity for hijacking.
* (1430)

Hon. Mr. Laird: Honourable senators, as sponsor in the
Senate of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 1972, which
made it an indictable offence to hijack an aircraft or
endanger the safety of aircraft in flight, and so on, I wish
to draw Senator Lawson's attention to the fact that we
offered to hear representations from the Canadian Air
Line Pilots Association when that bill was before our
committee. They, quite frankly, said no, that they had had
their say before the appropriate committee of the House

SENATE DEBATES

of Commons and they did not wish to appear before our
committee.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: Honourable senators, I would like
to add to the explanation given by Senator Laird. Captain
Simpson, the President of the Canadian Air Line Pilots
Association, of whom Senator Lawson was speaking,
authorized me to tell the Senate committee that they
approved of the legislation as drafted and which we
adopted. They were very happy with it.
Yesterday I flew from Montreal with Captain Simpson-we happened to be on the same plane-and again he
told me that they wanted to thank the Parliament of
Canada for what had been enacted, and that it was very
helpful to them in meetings they were having with pilots
in other countries.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If we are going to deal with the entire
situation respecting Bill C-2 and the problem of hijacking,
I would say that the reason we were invited to pass the bill
without amendment was to prevent a strike by the pilots.
However, it occurred just the same.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am sure we all
share the concern of Senator Lawson. The Minister of

June 29, 1972

Transport has stated in the other place on at least two
occasions that he did not wish to discuss openly at this
stage the details of the security program on which he is
working, but that he would be willing to discuss the
matter with any member of Parliament from either house.
I will arrange such a meeting, if necessary today, for
Senator Lawson or any other honourable member who
might wish to meet with the minister to discuss what is
being contemplated.
The Hon. the Speaker: This inquiry is now considered
debated.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think you mean exhausted.

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, as there is to be
an important meeting of the Standing Committee on
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration when the
Senate rises, I move that the house do now adjourn.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I understand that the preamble is not
part of the motion.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 11 a.m.

REPRESENTATION COMMISSIONER ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-203, to amend the Representation Commissioner
Act.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: With leave, later this day.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Before we consider the request of
the deputy leader, I should like to hear from him or from
the Leader of the Government, as to what the intentions
of the government are with regard to the business before
us today.
Honourable senators will appreciate that some bills are
of less importance than others. Before giving leave, I
should like to know where we are going.
Hon. Paul Martin: There is a motion in the other place
for an adjournment of that house tonight. That motion, of
course, does not affect our decision to stay for as long a
period as we wish to consider whatever bills we now have
before us, or whatever bills might come to us. However, it
has been decided in the other place not to proceed with
that motion at 11 o'clock because of developments in
Montreal, and we will not know about those developments
until some time during the course of the afternoon.
Even if the other place does adjourn today, it is not
impossible, depending on the progress made, for us to
receive the bill to amend the Canada Labour Code, but
that is something I really cannot foresee. I have my
doubts about the progress that will be made on it. I know
that it is hoped to pass the bill. As I told the Leader of the
Opposition earlier this morning, just as soon as I know
about the situation in Montreal I will certainly confer with
him.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Could we defer the question of leave for
the time being, and consider the other problems?
Hon. Mr. Walker: What about the foreign takeovers bill?
Have you any information on that?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I certainly do not think it will come to
us today. I would not preclude its coming next week. If
the other place sits next week to deal with the situation in
Montreal that I mentioned, I suppose they might deal with
other matters as well, but that is for them to decide.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved
by the honourable Senator McDonald, seconded by the
honourable Senator Bourget, that this bill be read a
second time later this day.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: No. This matter is in abeyance. We are
leaving the matter on the understanding that the bill has
been read the first time, and no motion is made for second
reading for the time being.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.
* (1110)

Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, I think the
proposal of the Leader of the Opposition is a good one, in
that when this bill appears again in the Orders of the Day
we can ask for leave at that time to move that it be read
the second time.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, may I say to the
sponsor of the bill that when he requests leave, my support might be conditional on hearing a clear statement
about the time the bill was introduced in the House of
Commons, and the approximate number of sittings of the
House of Commons and of committees of the House of
Commons at which the bill was discussed. I say that in
order to give him an opportunity to obtain the information. That might apply also to any other requests for
leave.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Do you want that information now,
or when we ask for leave?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not now. When you ask for leave.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I say, when leave is requested, my
response to that request might be conditional on having
that information.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Very well.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I want to
be very clear as to the present standing of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: To clarify the matter, let us say that the
motion is for second reading at the next sitting of the
Senate. With leave, we can revert to the motion for second
reading later this day.
Hon. Mr. McDonald moved, with leave, that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for second reading at the
next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
PENSION ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-215, to amend the Pension Act.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Carter: With leave, now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No. Next sitting.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it next sitting, or later today?

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Martin: It will be later today, with leave, when
we come to the bill.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, I wonder if
we could be clear on this? In not asking for leave to
proceed at this time, it is my understanding that we will
have a continuation of this sitting later today, and at that
time we will ask for leave to proceed with this bill.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I would say to the deputy leader that
there is a great difference between the phrases covering
dealing with this bill "at the next sitting" and "at a continuation of this sitting." He may wish to take that into
consideration.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I do not know the technical term to
use for a continuation later this day, but that is what I
have in mind.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, may I put this
clearly? "At the next sitting" would normally mean on
Monday or Tuesday next. That does not prevent any honourable senator later today asking leave to proceed with
second reading at that time, despite the decision to proceed only at the next sitting.
Hon Mr. Martin: That is right.
Hon. Mr. McDonald moved, with leave, that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for second reading at the
next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
FARM CREDIT ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-5, to amend the Farm Credit Act.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Michaud: At the next sitting.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators,
that this bill be dealt with in the same manner as the two
previous bills?

Hon. Mr. Flynn: At the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Michaud moved, with leave, that the bill be

placed on the Orders of the Day for second reading at the
next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

ADULT OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING ACT
BILL TO AMEND-THIRD READING
Hon. Margaret Norrie moved the third reading of Bill
C-195, to amend the Adult Occupational Training Act.
She said: Honourable senators, I just wish to point out
that in committee certain material was asked for that was
not on hand at the particular moment. That information
has now been forwarded to us by Mr. H. John Meyer of
the Manpower Training Branch.
Mr. Meyer writes as follows:
As promised during this morning's committee meeting on Bill C-195, I attach a set of five tables showing
by region the placement and employment of persons
who received skill training under the Adult Occupational Training Act. The tables provide a breakdown
by major course (occupational) group and show a
cumulative summary for a 12-month survey period
ending April-May 1971.
In the columns are given for each major course
group actual numbers and, below it, the percentage
relationship.
Unfortunately, a national aggregation is not available at this time. However, the content of the tables
can be summarized as follows:
Employed Not Employed
Atlantic Region
Quebec Region
Ontario Region
Prairie Region
Pacific Region
Canada

73.1
78.2
67.0
79.6
73.7
74.6

26.9
21.8
33.0

Of those not employed within three months of completion of training approximately 20 per cent did
actively seek work.
The survey results do not yet include information
which shows the relative success in obtaining employment upon completion of training between age
groups, for instance, the age group 20-30 as compared
to the age group 40-50. I regret that this information
cannot be provided.
I have other quite comprehensive material which I
would be happy to provide for your information, honourable senators, but I feel that it is a bit too lengthy to go
into at the moment.

Hon. Paul Yuzyk: Honourable senators, we had a very
useful discussion in committee on the operations of the
manpower training program. In discussing matters with
Mr. Meyer we found out that statistics dealing with the
recent situation in Canada are not available on a nationwide scale. That is regrettable, particularly in view of the
fact that today the manpower program has access to some
of this information, at least, and I know it uses computers.
The information that we have just received has helped to
fill the gap, but it is obvious that it is not the type of
information we really need to understand properly the
operations of this program. Nevertheless, I feel that the
information that we have here, particularly the statistics,
is very useful in helping us to understand the operations
and the problems encountered by this program right
across the country. This information should be made
available to this house and to anyone who may want to
read the Debates of the Senate. Accordingly, I move that
the statistics as appended to this letter be included as an
appendix to the Debates of the Senate of this day.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is this agreed, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(Fortables see Appendix "A",pp. 568-72)
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
DISTRIBUTION OF BILLS-QUESTION
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I rise on a
point of order. We have had a number of bills brought to
us from the House of Commons. I cannot say what position any other senator finds himself in, but for my part I
do not have copies of these bills and I have looked carefully through the bills already provided here. I wonder if we
could have copies of bills distributed as soon as possible
after passage by the House of Commons so as to have
them before we are asked to take them into consideration.
I realize that with an early sitting it may have been difficult to have the bills printed and distributed promptly,
but I should like to know when exactly we are going to
have them.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Copies of the bills are being distributed now.

SENATE DEBATES
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
BILL TO AMEND-THIRD READING
Hon. Hazen Argue moved the third reading of Bill C-204,
to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act.
He said: Honourable senators, before this bill is read the
third time I wish to make a few brief comments. One of
the important sections of this bill gives the Canadian
Wheat Board authority to extend present quotas into the
new crop year for individual producers who have not
been able to deliver their grain because of lack of space at
the local elevators. I think this is an important amendment, and if it is properly and adequately used it will
guarantee every one of the 175,000 producers on the Prairies the right to market their grain to the extent of the
quotas which have been established by the Canadian
Wheat Board.
I shall read a short statement from the evidence of
Chief Commissioner Vogel before the Standing Senate
Committee on Agriculture on Wednesday, June 28. We
were dealing with a situation at my delivery point where
quotas were about to be cancelled, and the Canadian
Wheat Board was making an extraordinary effort to provide additional boxcars so our quotas could be met. I
asked Chief Commissioner Vogel:
My question is that with the passage soon of Bill C-204
and the possibility of extending quotas, et cetera, is it
really the idea of the board to make positive that
every producer does in fact during the current crop
year have the opportunity to deliver his full quota of
the various grades of grain which he may have on
hand?
He replied:
That is certainly our objective, and we will do our
utmost to achieve it. If we cannot achieve it, we will
have to face up to problems that arise at that time.
Perhaps, as you say, if Bill C-204 goes through, this is
one way of achieving it.
It is quite clear from this statement that if there is a lack
of elevator space and for that reason farmers at any given
marketing point are unable to deliver their full quotas by
the end of July, the board will, in fact, extend the quotas
to individual producers to ensure delivery of their grain.
This will indicate to the producers on the Prairies the
extraordinary change in Canadian Wheat Board policy
which guarantees that every producer has an opportunity
to deliver his grain.
On one other occasion, in an emergency situation, the
crop year was extended for individual producers. However, at that time, the grain which was delivered after the
extension date was placed in a future pool, and there was
considerable bickering and criticism.
I think this is an important statement made by the Chief
Commissioner of the Canadian Wheat Board. It is an
important provision of the bill we are now considering.
0 (1130)

Hon. Mr. McDonald: I wonder if I might ask a question
before the honourable senator leaves this portion of his
remarks regarding quotas. I should like to ask him if this
provision to which he just referred also applies to rapeseed? I know the wheat board is not responsible for the

[Hon. Mr. Martin.1

30, 1972
.Ti ne~3,17
June

marketing of rapeseed, but they are responsible for setting the quota. It is my understanding that at the present
time the general quota on rapeseed is 10 bushels per
assigned acre. However, for those within delivering distance of crushing plants and who can deliver to those
plants, it is 20 bushels per acre. It is my information from
the committee study of this bill that there is no hope of the
general quota on rapeseed being increased to 20 bushels
before July 31. I should have asked in committee, but
missed my opportunity, whether those producers who
have not been able to deliver 20 bushels per assigned acre
will have that privilege before there is any new quota,
either under general conditions or the condition of delivery to crushing plants in the west?
Hon. Mr. Argue: I do not believe I am better able to
answer that question than the honourable senator who
posed it. We do not produce rapeseed in my part of the
country. As I understand it, there are two quotas-one of
10 bushels per acre, and one of 20 bushels per acre when
delivered to the crushing plant.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That is right, but those who can
deliver it to the crushing plant must be within a minimum
radius of the plant.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I cannot answer the question, but I
think the principle of equality of opportunity should prevail. The honourable Senator McDonald will agree with
me when I say that the Canadian Wheat Board should
endeavour to be consistent. In accordance with its
endeavour to be consistent in its other policy statements,
all rapeseed producers should be treated equally.
There was a discussion in this chamber and in the
committee regarding penalties for overdelivery of the
quota. The penalty through the courts is increased from a
minimum of $1 to $50. There is also provision, however,
whereby the wheat board itself can deal with an infraction by reducing the delivery opportunities for the
producer.
The minister in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board,
the Honourable Otto Lang, explained the reasoning
behind this provision. He said it was similar to legislation
with respect to motor vehicles, where in the case of an
infraction of the law, such as a parking offence, a small
penalty can be paid and there is no necessity to go
through proceedings in the courts. He stated that the
wheat board itself can deal with overdeliveries by reducing the quota. The representatives of the Canadian Wheat
Board told us that if an overdelivery amounts to just 25
bushels, a small amount of grain, there is no endeavour to
penalize the farmer.
There is a provision in the act, however, whereby the
wheat board can reduce the producer's future deliveries
by the amount of the overdelivery plus an equal additional amount. In other words, the penalty would be double. I
inquired whether the wheat board could penalize the producer by only the amount of the overdelivery. This was
my question:
I should like to ask a question on that point. If a
producer overdelivered by 100 bushels because somebody just made a mistake and the wheat board wished
to take action, can it take action only to the extent of
reducing his future delivery opportunity by 100 bush-

SENATE DEBATES

Tune 30, 1972

1972

els, or do they have to add a further reduction to the
value of another 100 bushels?
The minister replied as follows:
They can certainly take the former kind of action.
They can simply make the reduction you indicated.
Knowing the Canadian Wheat Board and the grain business from a producer's standpoint, if a farmer overdelivered on a particular quota all that would happen in the
vast majority of instances is that there would be a reduction on his next quota of a like amount. In other words,
justice and equity in the quota system would be maintained. I am sure there will be no move by the Canadian
Wheat Board to haul farmers through the courts because
of a small inadvertent overdelivery.
In my opinion, these are very good amendments. I think
they will work well. They will keep the quotas equitable,
and I for one do not expect that producers will be treated
in an unduly harsh manner under this legislation.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I should like to say a word about
the penalties as explained by Senator Argue. After listening closely to his remarks, I am more convinced than ever
that it is wholly wrong to have this matter taken from the
courts and placed in the hands of the Canadian Wheat
Board. It might well be that the penalty in connection with
quotas should be as the honourable senator mentioned,
but we should let the courts deal with it. It is a wholly
wrong principle to put the wheat board in the place of the
courts. Let the courts administer the law, and let the
wheat board deal with the wheat.
Hon. Mr. Argue: The honourable senator knows that if a
farmer wishes to take a case to court, he may do so. That
is his prerogative. If the overdelivery on one quota
amounts to 50 bushels, and the farmer prefers to have the
board reduce his delivery on another quota by a like
amount, it will do so.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
DISTRIBUTION OF BILLS-QUESTION ANSWERED

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators,
before I ask leave to proceed with second reading of Bill
C-203, I should like to answer the question posed by

Senator Grosart this morning with respect to the movement in the other place of the three bills which came to us
today.
Bill C-203, to amend the Representation Commissioner
Act, was introduced in the House of Commons on May 8,
1972. It was not brought forward there until yesterday,
June 29, when the Honourable Allan MacEachen stated:
Mr. Speaker, in the remaining few minutes we could
call a short bill that I have been holding in the wings
for some time.
So the bill was brought forward, given second reading,
referred to the Committee of the Whole and was subsequently given third reading yesterday.
Bill C-215, to amend the Pension Act, was read the first
time in the other place on June 19. Second reading took
one day, June 23. The bill spent one day in the Veterans
Affairs Committee, June 26. The report stage and third
reading took one sitting, that being yesterday.
Bill C-5, to amend the Farm Credit Act, was given first
reading in the House of Commons on February 21, 1972.
Second reading took six days, namely, May 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and
10. The bill then went to the Agriculture Committee for
eight days, May 30, June 1, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20 and 22. The

reporting stage was in two parts, June 27 and 28, and third
reading was given on June 29.
I believe that that is the information Senator Grosart
wanted. Honourable senators will note that we now have
copies of Bills C-5 and C-203 on our desks. Bill C-215 is the
top bill on our files.
Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I would ask for leave to
proceed with second reading of Bill C-203.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I suggest that the question of leave
be discussed with regard to the three bills together, as I
would have some comments to make with respect to all
three.
The Hon. the Speaker: Before we proceed with the
motion for second reading I think we should first deal
with the matter of leave.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: In that case, Mr. Speaker, I wonder
if I could ask at this point for leave for second reading of
Bills C-203, C-215 and C-5?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I thank Senator
McDonald for putting on the record information as to how
long the other place took to deal with these three bills. I
believe that information speaks for itself, and will
explain, in part, the position I think I should take in the
circumstances.
I may add also, with regard to the request for leave, that
the situation in the other place is not entirely clear. The
Prime Minister was to have moved at the beginning of the
sitting this morning that when that house adjourned today
it would stand adjourned until September 28. I understand that this motion will not be put until 4 o'clock.
However, it is not entirely sure that it will be put even at
that time because of certain matters that have been discussed, about which all honourable senators are aware.
I have had a chance to discuss this matter with my
colleagues on this side of the house, and to look at Bills
C-203, C-215 and C-5. The first two are very small bills.
Senator McDonald has indicated that they did not require

SENATE DEBATES

too much time in the other place, and for this reason, and
because they are quite obviously so simple, we are prepared to give leave to proceed with the second reading of
them this afternoon.
Bill C-5, however, is an important piece of legislation. It
required quite lengthy discussion in the other place, and I
do not think it would be fair to the bill or the public, nor
would it be in keeping with our responsibility as senators
to proceed with it this afternoon. I suggest that we proceed with it next Tuesday night.
I suggest next Tuesday night for obvious reasons. First,
it is our usual time of sitting. Secondly, this is supposed to
be a long weekend, tomorrow being Canada Day, Dominion Day or Confederation Day, whatever you prefer to
call it-personally I have no preference.
Monday is a national holiday. Therefore, with a weekend scheduled nationally as a holiday, I think we should
not be called upon to return before next Tuesday, unless
an emergency arises out of the situation we discussed this
morning. That would be good reason for bringing us back
earlier. We could come back on Tuesday night and deal
with Bill C-5 in the normal way, if the house were in
agreement with my suggestion. We on this side of the
house are prepared to give leave to proceed with second
reading of Bill C-203 and Bill C-215.
With regard to third reading, if we are coming back next
Tuesday I would suggest that third reading be given then.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The proposal made by the Leader
of the Opposition is certainly acceptable to me, and I
presume it is acceptable to the majority of honourable
senators. With respect to when we return, it will be noted
that on Notices of Motions this morning no motion about
when we return was moved. That was because of the
uncertainty existing in the other place. I am told there will
be more information between three and four o'clock this
afternoon. Depending on what that information is, a
motion will be moved with respect to when we return,
whether it be Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, or whenever it
is. Before moving that motion it will be my intention to
ask honourable senators for their opinion on when we
ought to return, and at what time. It is much simpler to
get the general agreement of honourable senators and
move a motion accordingly that will suit the majority of
the Senate.
* (1410)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Let us say that unless there is emergency legislation brought in before next Tuesday evening, the
motion today would be that we adjourn until Tuesday
next at 8 o'clock, as usual?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is, of course, subject to the right of
His Honour the Speaker to call the Senate together
earlier.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed
that Bills C-203 and C-215 are placed on the Orders of the
Day for second reading today?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I would like to
add that the arrangement proposed by the Leader of the
Opposition is satisfactory. He himself has envisaged the
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

June 30, 1972

possibility of our return, for emergency reasons, if necessary, before Tuesday evening.
I hope that we will have some indication of that between
four and four-thirty this afternoon. If we do not, then His
Honour the Speaker has the right to call us back, as the
Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, before Tuesday
evening. In such a case honourable senators would, of
course, be informed to that effect.
I should be in a position to say something definite about
this between four and four-thirty this afternoon. I know
that at that very hour the Leader of the Opposition has
another assignment. Therefore, I will communicate with
Senator Choquette, through Senator McDonald, around
that time. I take it that we cannot put a motion for
adj ournment before then.
REPRESENTATION COMMISSIONER ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved the second reading
of Bill C-203, to amend the Representation Commissioner
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, my speech in moving the
second reading of this bill will be very brief-in fact,
almost as short as the preamble His Honour the Speaker
uses in putting the motion. This bill merely authorizes an
increase in the salary of the Representation Commissioner.
As honourable senators know, we have independent
commissions in each province to set the electoral boundaries and deal with other matters respecting federal
constituencies throughout the country. Over all those
commissions there is the Chief, the Representation Commissioner, who is the representative of each provincial
commission. He has been receiving a salary of $27,000 per
annum. The bill proposes that his salary in future be the
same as that of a judge of the Federal Court of Canada,
which is $35,000 a year.
Hon. Paul C. Lafond: Honourable senators, in a previous
capacity, over a period of 25 years or so, I had close
contact with the incumbent of the position we are dealing
with at this time. I said "close contact", and would even
say "close association" if one were to understand "association" in the same way that Senator Grosart has had
contact with him over quite a few years.
Honourable senators, I feel bound to say a few words
and direct your attention to the fact that over the years
Parliament bas been fortunate in having servants such as
Mr. Nelson Castonguay, and his father before him, act in
the same capacity.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lafond: Furthermore, the increase in the
salary paid to Mr. Castonguay is the same as the increase
given to the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada a few years
ago. At this point both positions are at the same level, and
it is entirely logical that this should be done.
Another point I should like to draw to the attention of
honourable senators is that the present Representation
Commissioner is probably the only civil servant in
Canada who has recommended to a committee of the

doubt had to be resolved in favour of the veteran. It also
made provision for exceptional incapacity and multiple
disability. These are cases where a veteran may have two
or three disabilities, and each one would entitle him to a
100 per cent pension.
Bill C-203 also made provision for automatic review of
all previously rejected claims back to World War I including those of widows whose husbands had submitted
claims which were rejected.
All this has greatly increased the workload of the new
pension commission. Far more claims were submitted
than anyone ever expected.
This chamber gave third reading to Bill C-203 on March
18, 1971. It took, perhaps, two or three months to set up
the machinery and put it in motion, and it has now been
working for about a year. During this 12-month period the
new machinery has handled about 60,000 claims for various types of benefits. The Entitlement Board has handled
6,200 claims, which initially had one or more hearings,
and which, after being rejected, were referred to it. In
spite of this, there exists at the present time a backlog of
8,000 cases, and new ones are arriving at the rate of 800
per month. The commissioners have said they can only
deal with around 400 cases a month, which is half the rate
at which they are being received. Of course, this is the
reason for the backlog and why new commissioners are
needed.
It has been estimated that the new administrative body
can deal with 2,400 pension claims per year, which is
about double the number which could be handled under
the old machinery.

and keeping the board which hears the initial claims
sufficiently busy.
I do not think there are any other points arising from
this bill to which I can refer at the moment. If honourable
senators have questions I will do my best to answer them.
Honourable senators, I commend this bill to your
favourable consideration.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I rise
only to support the remarks of Senator Carter, and to tell
him that we wholly approve of this bill. It is obvious that
the need is there because, as he mentioned, there is a
backlog of something over 8,000 applications. They are
running behind at the rate of approximately 400 per
month and, even with the increased number of commissioners, it will take them at least two years to catch up.
The best thing we can do is to pass this bill and help the
veterans as much as possible.
I agree with Senator Carter that there is no need to
refer this bill to committee. Actually, if any honourable
senator wishes to go into the matter further, he can consult the proceedings of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs of the House of Commons, which on Monday,
June 26, considered this bill. I urge the passage of this bill
without further delay.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill be read a
third time?
Hon. Mr. Carter moved that the bill be placed on the
Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

* (1430)

This bill, if it is the wish of the Senate, can be referred
to committee. Personally, I doubt if any good purpose
would be served by referring it to committee. It did go to
committee in the House of Commons and only two points
of any relevance were raised there. One was that if there
is such a large backlog, the number of commissioners
should be increased to 34 rather than 24. The answer to
that is that 34 commissioners would make for a too
unwieldy organization. In the second place, there would
be the problem of training them, which could cause the
quality of decisions to be impaired. The present chairman
and his advisers feel that a total of 24 is just about all they
can handle.
The second question was: Why not appoint seven ad hoc
commissioners, rather than two full-time and five ad hoc
commissioners? The reason is that a total of 24 commissioners will enable three entitlement boards to travel
throughout the country hearing claims at points convenient for veterans. This number will also enable the three
entitlement boards to travel for approximately 40 weeks
of the year, and at the same time allow a sufficient
number of commissioners to remain at headquarters to
process initial claims.
The chairman of the commission pointed out at the
committee hearing that increasing the number of commissioners beyond 24 would not necessarily increase the
output. A great deal depends upon obtaining the services
of a sufficient number of experienced medical advisers,

require us to meet earlier, we will meet on Tuesday evening at 8 p.m.
I wanted to emphasize that we shall be sitting next
week, at the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition,
even though the other place may not be sitting.

improved methods so they can compete in the market
with farmers of other countries.
Secondly, the existing arrangement was inequitable in
many instances where a farmer might be denied an
opportunity to expand his farming operations to include,
say, a son or daughter merely because, at the time the
opportunity arose, the son or daughter had not quite
reached legal age.
With respect to age for qualification for a loan, as senators are aware, the legal age to contract has been reduced
in many provinces. However, at present the legislation
fixes the minimum age for qualification for a loan under
the act at 21 years. The amendments will delete this reference to age of borrowers and allow the corporation to
make a loan to anyone who, under provincial law, is of
legal age to execute a binding contract.
Several changes are being made by these amendments
which will facilitate the ability of the corporation to provide good long-term credit service consistent with farmers' progressively changing needs. For example, the subsection which concludes the purposes for which loans can
be made is being amended so that loans can be made for
any purpose that "will facilitate the efficient operation of
the mortgaged farm." This provides somewhat more
adaptability to this section so that any loans may be made
for any reasonable purpose which will directly assist in
the operation, maintenance or development of the farm
business.
The amendments remove the requirement that Part III
borrowers must obtain approval of the corporation before
qualifying for a farm improvement loan. Experience indicates that this provision is no longer necessary.
A further amendment will allow the corporation to
make a loan although a person other than the borrower
has a right to use the buildings and building site on some
of the farm land being mortgaged. This will make possible
loans in some instances where a retiring farmer and his
wife may wish to stay on in their home but draw out their
investment in the farm land. It will allow the vendors of
farms transferred under the small f arm development plan
to retain the use of their home without interfering with
the purchasers' ability to obtain financing under the act
for the purchase.
At present there is no restriction in the legislation with
respect to making loans to aliens. As the intention of the
legislation is to assist Canadian citizens permanently
domiciled in Canada and those who intend to make their
permanent home in Canada, these amendments will
ensure that loans are made only to such persons.

[Translation]
Those are the main changes which will be incorporated
into the legislation through amendments set out in Bill
C-5. They are all intended to assist the Farm Credit Corporation to give the farmers services which are better
adapted to their ever-increasing needs.
* (2020)

[English]
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I wish
to congratulate Senator Michaud on the very clear and
detailed explanation he gave regarding the contents of
[Hon. Mr. Michaud.]

July 4, 1972

this bill. I do not intend to deal with it in such detail, but I
have a few general comments I wish to make at this time.
As Senator Michaud indicated, Bill C-5 contains a
number of amendments to the Farm Credit Act, which is
now chapter F-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada. Some
time ago the Department of Agriculture put out an
explanatory statement or release concerning this bill,
stressing its desirability and passing over lightly any
anticipated objections to it. That statement lists 11 proposed changes of greater or lesser importance. However, I
think it is fair to say that while objection was taken to
various amendments, only two of the proposed changes
met with strong opposition. These can be found in the
printed proceedings of the House of Commons Standing
Committee on Agriculture. I would like to say here that
this committee certainly made a thorough and detailed
study of the bill and provided ample opportunity for
anyone to appear before it. The committee held eight or
nine sittings altogether.
At the first meeting of that committee, held on May 30
last, the Minister of Agriculture made a concise clear
summary of what he intended the amendments to do. I
wish to quote from this evidence as it summarizes better
than I can the effect of the various amendments. The
minister said, in part:
We want to raise the capitalization of the corporation
so that we will have sufficient funds authorized by
Parliament to carry on and meet the demands of the
corporation for several years. The addition, of course,
is an amount of $10 million to the capitalization which
increases the borrowing capacity of the corporation
by $250 million. This added to the $245 million that
will be unexpended from previous authorization, as of
about March 31, 1972, puts us in a position of having
additional facilities of some $495 million. It is not
possible, at this point, to predict exactly how long that
will meet the requirements but certainly it will be for
several years, probably five, six or eight years. Then,
of course, we want to raise the upper limits from the
maximum now under certain sections of the bill of
$40,000 to $100,000, based on the farm unit rather than
on the legal structure of how the farm is set up,
whether it is a partnership, corporation or otherwise.
There are a number of details with respect to changing wording, for example the purposes of the loan:
that loans will be made only to Canadian citizens or
landed immigrants; that there will be consideration
given to the income and assets of secondary non-farming operations. There is a provision for loans to be
made subject to life interests by a retiring farmer or
his spouse for the farm home and a small parcel of
land surrounding it. The minimum age of borrowers
is being repealed and substituting in practical application at least that anyone who is or above the age of
majority so they can legally enter into a contractual
arrangement will be competent and capable in
making an application for a loan to the corporation.
Honourable senators, at first glance there would not
appear to be anything in that statement which would
arouse strong criticism and objection. Yet, since there has
been such objection, I referred to the release issued by the
department in support of the bill. It stated that the general

July 4, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

objective of the bill is twofold. It is to enhance the ability
of the Farm Credit Corporation to meet demonstrated
long-term needs for the development of viable farm businesses. In addition, it is to provide the corporation with
the powers necessary to carry out such duties or functions
as may be assigned to it in relation to the administration
of other programs.
The need for long-term credit is to be met by means of
the additional capital and borrowing power and raising
the maximum limit of loans to $100,000 to any farmer
alone, jointly with others or in respect of a single farming
enterprise. This amount could only be loaned under the
present act to co-operative associations or others acting
together. To justify this increase the release had this to
say:
The size of individual farm units is increasing
steadily, labour is being replaced by capital, and the
purchasing power of the dollar has decreased in
recent years. Mortgage credit in the amounts and for
the terms required is not available from other sources.
Thus the limits for individual farm operations set in
1964 are now inadequate to meet the needs of many
farmers, particularly those who wish to take advantage of more advanced technology.
In view of the fact that opposition developed to this
proposal, it is interesting to note that the release mentioned that consultations were held with farmers who are
members of the Farm Credit Corporation Appeal Boards
in each province. It stated that the general nature of the
amendments was discussed with the advisory committee
composed of 10 farmers who are representatives of farm
organizations located throughout Canada. It was
anticipated, therefore, that farm organizations would support the bill.
In the light of these expectations it is interesting to learn
of the attitude of the farm organizations. On June 1 last,
representatives of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture appeared before the committee. It was stated that the
federation approved all the amendments, with the exception of the maximum limit on loans of $100,000 for enterprises with more than one operator. The federation supported the increase to a maximum of $100,000 to an
individual operator, but felt it was inadequate in cases
where more than one individual is involved in a single
farming operation. It contended that for partnerships,
family-held corporations and co-operatives, the maximum
should be raised to $250,000. The federation was of the
opinion that larger farm units were necessary in order
that a farmer and one or more of his sons would be able to
own a farming operation which would permit them to live
as the rest of society lives rather than be tied to the
operation for seven days a week and 365 days a year. The
spokesman for the federation mentioned that it would
appear as though the tax legislation would slant farm
operations more and more into larger enterprises for their
own salvation. The federation believed that the $100,000
maximum was adequate for the single operator but could
not be considered so for the partnership, family-held corporation or co-operators. It would seem logical that this
be so.
Then, honourable senators, at a meeting of the committee on June 20, representatives of the National Farmers

Union were present and placed their views on the bill
before the committee.
* (2030)

It is interesting to note that they objected to increasing
the maximum loan limit for a single operator from $40,000
to $100,000. In short, they did not see the need for it, as the
average loan in 1970-71, approved by the corporation, was
under $28,000.
It is also interesting to note the conclusion reached by
the union:
Our conclusion is that the philosophy which motivates
this ceiling increase is centred around a desire on the
part of government to further force enlargement of
farms at the upper level of farm economic scale, an
action which will make it more difficult for farm units
of small or intermediate size to compete for resources
and themselves to become more viable.
Later in their brief they said:
We believe members of this committee are fully cognizant of the effects of proposed amendments to raise
upper limits on FCC loans to $100,000. Your endorsement of proposed amendments to Bill C-5 will signal
your support of policies which advocate the continuing depopulation of rural areas and the sacrifice of
the family farm to technology and economic determinism. It is a position we cannnot endorse because it
lacks a positive direction in protecting the equities of
thousands of our farmers and fails to meet the needs
of young farmers who wish to become established in
farming. Both parties in our view hold higher priorities in farm credit needs than does the class of farmer
seeking the upper limit of $100,000.
Honourable senators, it is interesting to note that while
the two farmer organizations held contrary views on the
loan limit, both were convinced that the legislation would
have the effect of pushing the small farmer out of business, and, of course, the legislation makes this plain.
Loans can be obtained for a farmer to purchase other
farms, even if it means reserving to the vendor a life
interest for himself and his wife in the farm home. Logically it must follow that the number of farms and the
number of farm operators will become fewer, although
perhaps this may be compensated by the fact or theory
that more and more people will be needed to operate the
larger unit, unless machines are used.
It is further interesting to note the different social
philosophies which guide the approach of the two farm
organizations to Bill C-5. We find the National Farmers
Union objecting to clause 1 of the bill, which amends
section 11 of the act. Honourable senators will recall that
this deals with the second purpose of the bill, which is to
provide the corporation with the powers necessary to
carry out such duties or functions as may be assigned to it
in relation to the administration of the programs. They
felt that this was a means whereby public discussion and
debate on the whole question of the small farm adjustment program was being circumvented. Feeling that this
was a means whereby small farmers were being moved
off the land, they asked the committee not to endorse the
clause, and requested that further consideration await a
full discussion with all interested parties on the govern-

SENATE DEBATES

ment's proposal or policy for farm adjustment once such
policy is made known. This would appear to have been a
very reasonable request.
The attitude of the provinces is important in relation to
this bill as there may be duplication of services, and this
should be avoided. Indeed, I take it that their co-operation, while not wholly essential, is desirable if the results
wished for by these amendments are, in fact, to be
obtained. Apparently, negotiations with the provinces to
date have not been very successful. However, I take it
from the statement by Mr. Owen, Chairman of the Farm
Credit Corporation, that negotiations are to continue. In
one part of his address to the committee of the other place
on June 6 he had this to say:
One of the problems in negotiations with the provinces is the question of who is going to administer
what. I think I have indicated there is a feeling that
the counselling service and this sort of thing can well
be handled by the provinces, and that this other, the
financial transaction, could well be handled by the
corporation. There are other items of discussion with
the provinces. What is the criteria you will use to
determine if this fellow who wishes to sell is uneconomic and would be eligible for a grant? This is the
thing that we do not want to pin down in a definite
and detailed way until we have a chance to negotiate
and come to a reasonable agreement with each
province.
Honourable senators, at least two provinces registered
strong objection to clause 1 of the bill. This is evident by
the remarks of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture for
Manitoba at the hearing on June 8 of the Agriculture
Committee of the other place, and as well by the remarks
of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture for Saskatchewan
made before that same committee at a hearing on June 13.
They were definitely opposed to clause 1 and, indeed, I
would infer from their briefs that there is a deep distrust
on the part of these provinces as to the motives of the
federal Department of Agriculture in seeking to amend
section 11 of the Act as to the use it intends to make of the
expanded power of the Farm Credit Corporation.
Honourable senators, it is difficult for one who is not
too well informed on agricultural matters to determine if
the criticisms of this bill are valid, so I will not express
any firm opinion on it. However, I do say that when we
see agricultural people express disapproval of some sections of the bill, and when we see two provinces register
strong objection to parts of it, and we do not appear to
have before us the attitude of the other provinces, then I
say that the Senate Standing Committee on Agriculture
must give the bill thorough study. I realize, of course, that
it would not be possible at this late date to hear representations from all concerned nor to obtain the views of the
provinces. I feel the best thing to do would be for the
committee to delete clause 1 of the bill in order that an
amendment more acceptable to the provinces might be
agreed upon. However, I realize this is not politically
possible. I do suggest that the committee at a future date
might make a study as to the responsibilities and the
relationship between the federal and provincial governments with respect to agricultural policies for Canada.
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald.]

July 4, 1972

[Translation]
Hon. Gildas L. Molgat: Honourable senators, I would
like first to thank Senator Michaud who introduced this
bill tonight. I know it will be especially important for his
own province. However, I would like also to indicate that,
even for a province such as ours, where farm operations
are generally on a larger scale, this bill is very important.
Bringing this legislation up to date and bringing about the
necessary changes on time so that farm credits are quite
realistic is a very important matter for western Canada as
well as for those provinces where, generally, farms are
smaller.

[English]
The Farm Credit Corporation has been one of the great
factors in permitting the intelligent development of
agriculture, certainly in western Canada. The agricultural
marketing problems have been very great and at various
times there have been production problems, because of
the vagaries of weather and so on. Various governments
have taken steps to correct this by means of crop insurance programs. Farm credit is one of the methods by
which we can ensure a sound and sensible agricultural
development.
* (2040)

Before dealing with some of the details of the bill, with
which I agree, I should like to sound a note of caution,
that at times too liberal credit facilities and the opportunity of great amounts of credit can be harmful to farmers as
well. In all of the handling of farm credit assistance, there
should be a very close tie-in with a sound Department of
Agriculture, which is not giving too rosy forecasts of the
future and encouraging farmers to get into debt beyond
their depth. This could in the long run, if improperly
handled, be to the great detriment of agriculture. However, there is no question but that a sound, properly
managed farm credit structure is vital to keep Canadian
agriculture up to date and in a position to produce at a
competitive level.
I will not cover all the items of the bill, but will refer to
just a few of them with which I am particularly concerned. The powers of the corporation are to be expanded. With this I frankly agree. I recognize that there are
great problems here, and there always will be, because of
the joint responsibility between provincial and federal
governments in the realm of agriculture. It seems to me
that too frequently we have had excess duplication of
services to agriculture, and in the long run the fellow who
pays is the farmer himself. Wherever we can reduce
duplication we will be helping farmers to do a better job
on their own.
Some years ago my own province set up a farm credit
corporation in competition with the federal Farm Credit
Corporation of that day. In my view that was a mistake. It
is true that at that time the federal Farm Credit Corporation was not measuring up to the times; it had failed to
change its rules, and so was no longer sufficiently applicable. To me, however, the proper course would have
been to change the federal act, not to set up a competitive
provincial structure, which simply adds to the cost and
creates a duplication of services.

July 4, 19 7 2

SENATE DEBATES

With regard to the expansion of the corporation's
powers, while I recognize the legitimate provincial concerns, I think it is proper to have wide powers, and if
there are further federal developments in this field, for
example the small farms development program, it should
be handled through this agency. The Farm Credit Corporation has built up through the years a very fine body of
personnel who are familiar with the problems across the
country, with land appraisal, land values and the operations of farms. Rather than set up new agencies to handle
new government programs, I think it would be wise to put
them under the one structure.
This, I agree, has to be done in consultation with the
provinces, but if it is a federal endeavour I would prefer
that the federal government handle the operation. I recognize that my own province has made some objections. I
feel, however, that all too frequently the provinces seek
for themselves a political advantage out of federal funds,
and if federal funds are to be expended, I think the
federal government ought to handle it.
With respect to the purpose of the loans, I think the
proposed change is a wise one. The previous act said that
loans could be provided where the expansion was "necessary" to the development of the farm enterprise. The new
wording says "will facilitate." I believe this is sound,
because it must be recognized that as agriculture changes
there may be many other industries in which farm operations will become involved. It can be something as farranging as hunting rights on property; it can be as farranging as the provision of water supply for other purposes to other people. There may be many circumstances
which are not directly related to the farm operation per se
but which will be of benefit to it by the income it provides.
In my view, this is a sensible approach.
With reference to the expansion to secondary non-farm
enterprises, it must be recognized that our farmers will
have to be much more flexible; they must be prepared to
meet sudden changes in demand, sudden changes in consumer wishes; they must be ready to move and adapt, and
the Farm Credit Act must be much more flexible than it
has been in the past. I think the proposals made here
generally aim to provide exactly that.
The Farm Credit Act, which is to be amended by this
bill, was passed in 1959. Since then there have been some
amendments. However, we must be realistic and prepared
in future to make much more frequent changes in this
type of legislation to ensure that it is at all times keeping
up with the realities the producer faces.
This is by no means a gift to agriculture. It is true that
the rate of interest is lower than the general commercial
rates would be, but when one considers the incentives
given today to industry I do not feel for one moment that
this bill is by any means a gift to the agricultural industry.
It is recognition that farming is a vital part of Canadian
production. The assistance provided here is by no means
greater than that provided to other industrial purposes,
but is rather less.
I believe we would be wise to refer this bill to the
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture, where we can
deal with it in detail, and get explanations on various
points from departmental representatives and the minister. In general, I think the bill is a good one, which will
25312-37

provide for a better set of rules for the Farm Credit
Corporation in the future.
Hon. Henry D. Hicks: Honourable senators, perhaps as
the senator from the Annapolis Valley I might express a
slightly different Nova Scotian point of view from that
expressed by the honourable Senator Macdonald from
Cape Breton about the two areas of this bill to which he
had objections, or at least about which he had reservations. The first of these had to do with clause 1, which
extends the powers of the corporation by an amendment
to section 11 of the Farm Credit Act. I take it Senator
Macdonald's reservations about this had to do largely
with his fear that some provinces had not expressed their
opinions, and that there might be areas of duplication
between the federal and provincial governments. This
was also referred to by Senator Molgat.
* (2050)

This is true, perhaps, but I do not think that there is any
question that the federal government has the jurisdiction
that it has enjoyed for many years in this area, and that
the federal government's activities in this area have been
highly significant in the improvement of farms in eastern
Canada, as well as elsewhere in this country.
Honourable senators, I do not think that the government in Ottawa, or the Parliament in Ottawa, ought to
refrain from taking action because there may be some
conflict with some of the provinces. If that were so, surely
our whole process would break down into interminable
delays before anything constructive could be done in
respect to changing any legislation. Therefore I, too, agree
with the changes contemplated by the amendment to section 11 of the Farm Credit Act.
The other subject that Senator Macdonald seemed to
have some reservations about struck me as extremely
interesting, in the two examples he gave of opinions
expressed by various farm organizations before the Committee on Agriculture. This, of course, is the old dilemma
of keeping the small farm as a way of life. It is rather
significant that he himself referred to one of the arguments used in favour of further increasing the ceiling for
joint or multiple ownership enterprises in farming operations beyond $100,000 to as much as $250,000.
The argument used was that these people want to be
able to farm and enjoy the kind of standard of living that
the rest of the people of this country enjoy. He then spoke
about the other farm organization which had opposed the
increase of the ceiling because it would destroy the way of
life of the small farmer.
The farmer cannot have it both ways. We may feel a
very sentimental attachment to the way of life of the small
farmer, but the farmer who lives in that way on into the
twenty-first century is not going to enjoy the standard of
living that the rest of the people, the more progressive
people, of this country enjoy. Therefore, it seems to me
that in this conflict we are right in increasing the ceiling
on farm loans at least to the $100,000 level at this time, and
that we should not delay further because there may be
some reservations and some differences of opinion-as I
am sure there always will be-among various elements of
our farming community.

SENATE DEBATES

By and large, it seems to me that these are good amendments to the Farm Credit Act. I acknowledge the benefit
which this legislation has brought in the years of its operation. Though not a farmer, I practised law for a number
of years in a farming community and became familiar
with and concerned about the problems of farmers, and
particularly the problems of farm credit. I support the bill
before us.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Phillips, debate adjourned.
CANADA LABOUR CODE
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
Hon. H. Carl Goldenberg moved the second reading of
Bill C-183, to amend the Canada Labour Code.
He said: Honourable senators, having been involved in
labour-management relations as mediator and arbitrator
over a period of some 35 years, I feel privileged to move
second reading of the bill to amend the Canada Labour
Code, more particularly Part V thereof entitled "Industrial Relations." I trust that if, in the course of my remarks, I
make reference to views based on personal experience,
honourable senators will bear with me.
Let me remind you at the outset that the Canada
Labour Code applies only to industries within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. These include interprovincial or international rail, road and pipeline transportation,
shipping
and
related
services;
air
transportation; interprovincial or international communication by telephone, telegraph or cable; radio and television broadcasting; and banks.
There are approximately 530,000 employees in the
industries within federal jurisdiction.
The Code does not apply to employees of government
departments, boards and commissions, who are governed
by the Public Service Staff Relations Act, with which we
are not concerned,-at least at this stage.
Federal labour law in Canada has a long history, beginning with the Trade Union Act of 1872, introduced by the
administration of Sir John A. Macdonald, which made
trade unions legal in Canada for the first time. There
followed the Conciliation Act of 1900, which established
the Department of Labour; the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act of 1907, which introduced compulsory conciliation; the Wartime Labour Relations Regulations of
1944, which made collective bargaining compulsory in
defined circumstances; and the Industrial Relations and
Disputes Investigation Act of 1948, which has continued in
force until the present day. This act guaranteed the right
to organize, prohibited certain unfair labour practices,
provided for the certification of bargaining agents, made
collective bargaining compulsory in defined circumstances, provided for compulsory conciliation machinery,
made collective agreements binding and provided for
arbitration of disputes arising from their interpretation,
and prohibited strikes and lockouts except in the case of
disputes over the negotiation of agreements that could not
be resolved with the help of conciliation.
This act-which became Part V of the Canada Labour
Code under the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970-has
remained unchanged since 1948; that is, over a period of
[Hon. Mr. Hicks.]

July 4,1972

25 years. But, as we all know, Canada and the world have
not stood still during this period. There have been vast
changes in industrial development, in technology and
communications. These have necessarily had a great
impact on human relations and, since industrial relations
are human relations, it is essential to adapt the laws
governing them to the changes which have occurred in
society and thus to the times in which we live. To be
effective, law must, as far as possible, reflect the society
which it governs.
The bill before us is therefore a comprehensive revision
of the 1948 act. It is not a measure which has been drafted
in haste. It is the result of a lengthy study by the task
force on labour relations, which reported some three
years ago, and of other recent studies on labour relations.
It also follows many submissions by representatives of
labour and management and consultations with provincial governments.
Originally introduced in the other place as Bill C-253 in
June 1971, it was allowed to lapse, to allow for public
discussion and debate. Re-introduced with amendments
in this session as Bill C-183-the bill before us-it has been
debated at great length in the other place and in its
Committee on Labour, Manpower and Immigration which
in the past months heard many witnesses and received a
great number of submissions. The bill passed second
reading on a recorded vote with only two members in the
House of Commons voting in the negative. It received
third reading on division without a recorded vote. These
are facts which I think the Senate should bear in mind.
* (2100)

While the bill contains more than 100 clauses, I want to
make it clear that by no means does every clause propose
a change in existing law. The vast majority either carry
over an existing provision essentially as it is, with a
change in some cases of wording but not of intent, or they
deal with the same subject matter as the present law but
not necessarily in the same manner because of changes in
structure, drafting style and, in some cases, policy.
In a number of cases, however, the subject matter of the
proposed section is not dealt with in the present law. I
propose to highlight some of the principal additions and
changes. First, there is a new preamble which sets out the
broad objectives of the bill, It recognizes the long tradition in Canada of labour legislation and policy designed to
promote the common well-being through encouraging
free collective bargaining and the constructive settlement
of disputes. It also reflects the fact that an essential
ingredient of our democracy and of free collective bargaining is freedom of association and protection of the
right to organize.
There follows the interpretation section which extends
bargaining rights by broadening the definition of the
word "employee." Under the present act bargaining rights
are available to employees, but the word is defined in
such a way as to exclude managerial and confidential
employees and members of the medical, dental, architectural, engineering and legal professions. As a matter of
legal interpretation, certain other individuals who have
some of the characteristics of employees and who work in
a relationship of economic dependency are also denied
access to bargaining rights. The bill would make bargain-

July 4, 1972
July 4,1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

ing rights available to all professional employees, subject
to a statutory expression of preference for separate bargaining units. We all know that the professional man
today is not necessarily practising privately and earning
his fee in private practice. A very large proportion of
professional men are now employees. This applies particularly to engineers.
The bill also makes such rights available for the first
time to owner-operators of trucks in a position of economic dependency-that is important: a position of economic
dependency-and also to fishermen engaged on a shareof-the-catch basis.
The Labour Relations Board would have discretion to
include in a bargaining unit employees whose duties
include the supervision of other employees, but persons
performing managerial functions and employed in a confidential capacity in matters relating to industrial relations would continue to be excluded from the definition of
employee.
Another definition which is broadened is that of the
word "strike." Taking cognizance of changes in union
practices and tactics, a strike is defined in the bill to
include:
a slowdown of work or other concerted activity on the
part of employees in relation to their work that is
designed to restrict or limit output.
It is clear that this definition covers a wider range of
strike activity than does the present law.
The interpretation section is followed by seven divisions
of the bill. Division I defines the basic rights of employers
and employees to organize. Division II, setting out the
composition and powers of the Canada Labour Relations
Board, proposes major changes which I shall outline
briefly. Under the present act there is a part-time board
consisting of a chairman and not more than eight other
members representative in equal numbers of employers
and employees. The board is concerned mainly with the
determination of bargaining units and the certification of
bargaining agents. It is now proposed that the board be
reconstituted as a full-time independent body comprising
a chairman, a vice-chairman and four members, although
the size of the board could be increased if the need should
arise by the addition of another vice-chairman and up to
four more members. The board would have substantial
new responsibilities relating to provisions in the bill governing unfair practices, individual rights and the effects
of technological change. The board will be able, under
this bill, on application of the employer or the trade union,
as the case may be, to declare a strike or lockout to be
unlawful. Moreover, an order or decision of the board
may be registered in the Federal Court of Canada
whereupon all proceedings may be taken thereon as if the
order or decision were a judgment obtained in that court.
That, too, is new.
The present act identifies as unfair and prohibits certain practices by employers or trade unions. The provisions in question are designed to preclude employer interference with the organization or administration of a trade
union or the operation of the collective bargaining process. Responsibility for adjudication and enforcement of
these provisions rests with the courts. In the amending bill
before us the unfair practice provisions are strengthened
25312-373

and extended in such a way as to offer additional protection for employers and trade unions, and for individual
employees and trade union members. There is no restriction on forms of union security but the individual
employee is protected against loss of employment because
of a suspension or withdrawal of union membership for
any reason other than a failure to pay dues. The discriminatory application of union membership or disciplinary standards is also prohibited.
a (2110)

Responsibility for adjudication of unfair practice complaints would be transferred from the courts .to the
Labour Relations Board. The board would be empowered
to issue prohibitory and compliance orders and to order
reinstatement and payment of compensation for lost pay.
It would not be empowered to award damages in the
ordinary sense or to levy fines. Illegal strikes and lockouts
would remain, as at present, a subject for prosecution in
the courts.
I come now to Division III of the bill which deals with
the acquisition and termination of bargaining rights.
Present legislation makes provision for the determination
of bargaining units and the certification of trade unions
as bargaining agents. To be certified, a union must
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the board, that it has as
members at least a majority of employees in a defined
unit. In making its determinations on this question, the
board has complete discretion as to whether or not it will
order a representation vote, the results of which are determined on the basis of a majority of employees eligible to
vote.
Under the provisions of the bill, a union seeking to
displace an existing bargaining agent would still have to
claim majority support at the time of application. But a
union seeking certification for a unit without a bargaining
agent would be entitled to a representation vote if it could
demonstrate membership support of between 35 and 50
per cent. And the results of a vote would be determined
on the basis of a majority of employees actually voting.
However, under an amendment to the original bill, if the
board determines that less than 35 per cent of the
employees who are eligible to vote have voted, it shall
determine that the representation vote is void.
The bill further provides that the board may make such
arrangements and give such directions as it "considers
necessary for the proper conduct of the representation
vote, including the preparation of ballots, the method of
casting and counting ballots and the custody and sealing
of ballot boxes."
The bill also provides for successor rights to carry over
bargaining rights when unions are merged or a business is
sold, and when an agency of the federal government is
transferred from the public service to become or form
part of a crown corporation covered by the bill.
In the important area of dispute settlement, the bill
would give the Minister of Labour increased flexibility in
the use of techniques to bring about settlements.
At present, when a dispute develops, either party may
seek conciliation assistance from the Minister of Labour.
The minister may appoint a conciliation officer and, if the
officer fails to bring about an agreement, the minister

July 4, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

may appoint a conciliation board comprising a nominee
of each party and an independent chairman. If the board
fails to bring about agreement, it must report its findings
and recommendations to the minister. Strike action
cannot lawfully be taken until seven days have elapsed
from the day on which the report of a board has been
received by the minister.
It is now proposed that the minister be given a wider
choice of dispute settlement instruments. In a particular
dispute, the minister would be authorized to take no
action or to use a conciliation officer, conciliation commissioner, or conciliation board. If he appointed a conciliation officer and the officer was unable to effect settlement, the minister would be authorized to take no further
action, or to appoint either a conciliation commissioner or
a conciliation board. Conciliation commissioners and conciliation boards would have equivalent powers and, if
unable to effect settlements, would be expected to make
reports containing findings and recommendations.
The right to strike or lock out would be established
seven days after exhaustion of the process-that is, seven
days after an indication by the minister of an intention to
take no action or no further action, or after the report of a
conciliation commissioner or board has been received by
the minister.
The minister would also be authorized at any time to
appoint a mediator to assist the parties, but use of this
power would in no way affect timing of the right to strike
or lock out. There is in all this a greater flexibility than is
provided under present law.
While the law has for many years recognized the right to
strike or lock out, Parliament has on six occasions in the
past 25 years intervened in a strike to protect the national
interest. The bill for the first time takes cognizance of the
fact that a strike or lock out affecting the national interest
may occur between the date of the dissolution of Parliament and the holding of a general election when there is
no Parliament. Accordingly, it provides that, if in the
opinion of the Governor in Council a strike or lock out
during such period would adversely affect the national
interest, the Governor in Council may postpone the date
on which such strike or lock out becomes legal until seven
days after the date fixed for the return of the writs following the general election. This has never appeared in our
legislation before.
With respect to the enforcement of collective agreements, the law now provides that every agreement must
contain a provision for final settlement, without stoppage
of work, of all unresolved differences over the interpretation or application of the agreement. This, by the way, has
given me a great deal of work over the last 35 years. The
act, however, is silent on the specific role of the arbitrator.
The bill defines and strengthens the role of the arbitrator, protects his jurisdiction from excessive judicial
review, and provides that his awards be ultimately
enforceable as if they were judgments obtained in the
Federal Court. I may take credit for having recommended
this to the Ontario government some years ago.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is that compulsory arbitration?
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: It is compulsory arbitration of
disputes affecting the interpretation or application of the
[Hon. Mr. Goldenberg.]

agreement during the life of the agreement. The bill further confers upon the arbitrator the capacity to review
remedies and to substitute penalties in disciplinary cases
where specific penalties are not set out in the collective
agreement.
* (2120)

Honourable senators, I have covered some of the major
changes but I have left to the last the part of the bill which
has aroused most discussion. It is entitled "Technological
Change," and is contained in sections 149 to 153 inclusive,
which sections, by the way, have been modified since the
original bill was introduced in the other place. The provisions of this part of the bill are new and I am, therefore,
not surprised that they have aroused a great deal of
opposition. Everything which is new arouses opposition. I
look upon these changes, however, as an effort to adapt
the law to the human requirements of a changing industrial society. In my opinion, this is essential in the interests
of industrial peace.
I have found again and again that a major cause of
current worker unrest-and this goes back for some
years-is insecurity resulting from the fear of displacement because of technological change. Men trained in
particular skills which they expected to use for the rest of
their working lives may find, at an age when it is difficult
for them to be retrained or obtain new employment, that
their skills are no longer required. Let us put ourselves in
that position and try to imagine how we would react. I
find that it is anxiety for job security and fear of unemployment that lie at the root of some of the recent major
industrial conflicts in Canada and the United States, and
that threaten continued serious unrest unless the problem
is dealt with fairly.
To substantiate what I have said, let me read to you the
results of a Gallup Poll of November 17, 1971. The question was: "Here are some of the things labour unions try
to do for their members. Which of them do you think is
the most important at the present time?" The answers
were as follows:
Security of employment
Better working conditions

50 per cent
15 per cent

Higher wages
Better pension plans
Profit sharing
Shorter working hours

Fifty per cent were concerned with security of

Job security thus towers over all other goals for labour
in Canada, as well as in the United States and the United
Kingdom. I have had occasion to study what transpired
there. There is, therefore, a growing realization that
before introducing changes which will displace or otherwise materially affect its workers, it is the responsibility
of management to give adequate advance notice of the
proposed changes; to consult and seek agreement with the
union representing its employees on the best means of
adjusting to the situation, and to provide for retraining or
relocation or compensation for the employees to be dis-

July 4, 1972

placed. This is now provided for in quite a number of
collective agreements, especially on the railways, and, to a
degree, by law. I am proud to say that after the last
national railway strike, as mediator, I drafted the provision protecting the men against the effects of technological change, and that provision has worked well. It means
the railways will not be subject to this technological
change provision because they have a provision in their
contract.
Honourable senators, I have studied this measure carefully from the time it was first introduced, and in relation
to my own experience. The aim of the measure before us
is further to encourage labour and management to deal
with the impact of technological change on employees at
the bargaining table.
Under the present act, a collective agreement is binding
on the parties and may not be reopened for negotiation
during the life of the agreement without joint consent.
There is, therefore, no effective means for dealing with
circumstances in which the assumptions underlying an
agreement are upset by the employer who introduces a
technological change during the term of the agreement
which displaces or otherwise adversely affects many
employees. In other words, in the absence of special provisions, the union, having signed an agreement, is locked in
while the employer is in a position to change the underlying assumptions of the agreement during its term by
introducing a technological change affecting many
employees adversely.
This situation does not make for industrial peace. Since
the union may not legally call a strike during the term of
the agreement, the employees have recourse to wildcat
and other illegal strikes. I may add that this is the case
only in Canada. It is not the case in the United States or in
other western countries where the law does not lock the
union in as in Canada, and where the union retains the
right to strike during the life of a collective agreement.
Ours is an exceptional case and a unique situation which
the bill seeks to correct by encouraging bargaining on the
impact of technological change, and thereby discouraging
strikes. These are the facts of the case which opponents of
this measure have failed or refused to understand. It is
not a measure to encourage strikes, as some have alleged.
It is a measure to discourage strikes.
Generally speaking, the bill does not change the binding
character of a collective agreement. However, it requires
the employer to give the bargaining agent at least 90 days'
notice of any technological change "that is likely to affect
the terms and conditions or security of employment of a
significant number of his employees." Furthermore, in
defined circumstances, a bargaining agent would be
empowered, during the term of an agreement, to negotiate
provisions designed to assist employees in adjusting to the
effects of the technological change with the ultimate right
to strike. There would be no bargaining over the technological change itself. The bargaining would be with
respect to the impact of technological change.
* (2130)

In order to exercise this power under the bill, the union
would have to obtain from the Canada Labour Relations
Board leave to serve notice to bargain. The board would
not grant such leave:

(1) where the employer has given notice of the intended
technological change before the agreement was entered
into;
(2) where the agreement contains provisions whereby the
effects of technological change may be negotiated and
finally settled during the term of the agreement; or
(3) where the agreement contains provisions intended to
assist employees to adjust to the effects of technological
change and the parties specify that the remaining provisions of the bill do not apply; and
(4) where the board is not satisfied that the change in
question is likely to have substantial and adverse effects
on the terms and conditions or security of employment of
a significant number of employees. Finally, these provisions would not apply to existing agreements, but only to
those entered into after the provisions come into force.
These are in summary the basic provisions of the bill
under the heading of "Technological Change." I have
tried to cover them fairly. I do not say that they are
perfect. I am confident that there will be improvements in
due course. For example, I have had occasion to inquire
into the construction industry in various parts of Canada.
I believe that special provisions will have to be enacted
for the construction industry, which differs in many
respects from other branches of industry. I am satisfied,
however, that the bill is fair and reasonable. I am further
satisfied that it will not retard the introduction of technological change, as some have charged.
Honourable senators, we must recognize the fact that
the issue we are dealing with here affects the basic human
desire and need for security. In my opinion, there will be
far more co-operation in the introduction of technological
change if proper consideration is given to the human
factor. Disregard it, and you invite unrest and conflict.
This, I submit, is what the bill before us will help to avoid.
Honourable senators, I do not recommend this bill to
you as a cure-all for the ills of our labour-management
relations system. I have said before in this house, and I
say again, that there is no cure-all. The tensions reflected
by industrial unrest have manifested themselves in all
parts of the globe and nowhere has a solution been found.
We have but to look at the experience of the United States
and the United Kingdom with strikes in the past year.
There is an indefensible strike of longshoremen at the
Port of Montreal now, but remember that the west coast
ports of the United States were closed down for 140 days
recently. We are, therefore, not alone and we will not find
a solution more easily than anyone else.
We should remember that the basic cause of the current
unrest, which is not confined to trade unionists, is that we
are living in a society of rising expectations in which more
and more people, encouraged by mass advertising, want
more and more of the good things of life. I suggest that
more restrictive labour laws will not in themselves put an
end to this growing desire for higher living standards. Nor
will such laws by themselves insure industrial peace.
We have to face the fact that on both sides of the
bargaining table in labour relations are human beings;
that across the table each side faces human interests,
human aspirations, human ambitions and human fears.
Peaceful relations between the parties will therefore

SENATE DEBATES

depend not on laws but on the degree to which they are
willing and able to understand each other and to make the
compromises imposed by the facts which confront them.
This is what labour laws should encourage and facilitate.
I recommend the present bill to this house as offering
an improved legal framework to the end that I have just
mentioned and, at the same time, affirming the proper
role of government as representative of the public interest
in the relationship between the parties.
Hon. Ernest C. Manning: Honourable senators, we are
all indebted to Senator Goldenberg for the very lucid
presentation he has made to the house in discussing the
provisions of the bill that is now before us. I think it is
correct to say that there are very few men in Canada
better qualified to discuss objectively the complicated
problems of labour-management relations than Senator
Goldenberg in the light of the long years of experience he
has had in this field.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Manning: I for one feel that this house is very
fortunate to have the benefit of his experience and judgment when dealing with this type of legislation.
Having said that with the greatest of sincerity, it is with
some regret that I find it difficult to reach the same
conclusion as he with respect to the provisions of this bill
which deal with the matter of technological change. I
recognize, as he bas pointed out, that this legislation is
restricted to those areas of employment which come
under federal jurisdiction and is rather limited for that
reason. It is a fact, however, that when any government in
Canada, especially the national government, adopts a fundamental new principle in a field as important as labourmanagement relations, it sets a precedent that may very
well be copied in other jurisdictions until it becomes general throughout the country as a whole. I would not be so
concerned about the provisions of this bill which apply to
technological change were there any assurance that in the
future they would remain restricted to employment that
comes under federal jurisdiction. I submit that we cannot
assume such will be the case. The bill provides, in the field
of technological change, some entirely new principles in
addition to those which we have had in former labour
legislation.
* (2140)

The most crucial of all these is the provision that by
following certain procedures it will be possible in future
for employees' bargaining agencies to secure the right to
open for renegotiation a collective bargaining agreement
if it is established to the satisfaction of the Canada
Labour Relations Board that technological changes introduced after the agreement came into effect would materially affect the welf are of the employees.
I agree with Senator Goldenberg that as a general rule
job security is the greatest single concern of employees.
That is understandable. I am a firm believer that the
private sector of this country needs a massive infusion of
humanitarian concern. I have stated this publicly on
many occasions. I do not believe it is any longer either
right or possible for private industry to disregard the
concern of its employees in the matter of job security.
Therefore I do not quarrel with the bill's objective in these
[Hon. Mr. Goldenberg.]

July 4, 1972

provisions, but I submit that the method by which the bill
proposes to attain its objectives is unsound and fraught
with some serious adverse effects to the welfare of labour
and management, and the people of Canada as a whole.
In order to stabilize labour-management relations, there
has been a trend in recent years to longer-term collective
bargaining agreements. They range anywhere from one
year or more, and three years is not uncommon. In the
light of the complications encountered in arriving at an
acceptable collective bargaining agreement, do honourable senators think many branches of private industry
will readily introduce technological changes during the
term of an agreement if by so doing it will lead to the
reopening of the agreement and the long complicated
process of trying to arrive at a new agreement, with no
assurance that such an agreement can be reached without
the possibility of costly strikes or lockouts?
That will be the result of having this kind of provision in
Canada's Labour Code. During this particular period of
Canadian history, perhaps more so than at any other time,
one thing we should not impede in any way is technological progress. In saying that, I am not taking the side of
those who think that technology is the end-all of success. I
have a great deal of sympathy for those who argue that
sometimes we have pursued the technological concept to
the place where we have lost sight of environmental conservation and the adverse impact of technology on the
qualify of life. However, I find it ironic that in a period
during which so much concern is expressed in the matter
of environmental conservation, we should propose anything to impede technological progress. If there is one
thing more than any other that can enable us to successfully conserve our environment, it is intelligent technological progress.
Our concern for pollution of the atmosphere, water,
land, and our environment as a whole, will not be solved
by conservationists making emotional speeches or leading
protest marches or parades. There are very few of the
problems associated with the industrial pollution of our
environment, including automobiles, airplanes, and anything else you care to name, that can not be solved by
further research and technological progress.
It is inconsistent to express concern for environmental
conservation on the grounds of humanitarian concern for
the quality of life and, at the same time, consider legislation which will impede technological progress because we
are afraid that without such legislation the quality of life
may be adversely affected in another direction, namely,
the impairment of job security.
I for one do not believe we should accept the view that
placing impediments in the way of technological progress
is the way to attack the problem of job security.
Surely there are ways by which we can ensure that the
interests and welfare of employees are not in the long run
adversely affected, without providing an instrument-as
this bill does-to restrict technological change until those
concerned have worked out in a collective agreement all
the matters about which they are concerned.
If we look at this matter from the standpoint of employment opportunities, many knowledgeable in these matters
have pointed out that in the days ahead Canada as an

Julv4 1972

1972

SENATE DEBATES

July

exporting nation will be faced with the very serious problem of remaining competitive in world markets. A factor
which assists greatly in maintaining a competitive position is the application of technological progress to our
productive processes, and if we do not remain competitive
in world markets, there is likely to be more impairment of
the job security of Canadian employees than any impairment that is likely to result from technological change as
feared by those who have embodied these provisions in
this bill. We have in Canada today a great many programs
for the retraining of technicians and even professionals,
and for upgrading the skills of workers. A great deal of
progress has been made in the field of adult education,
especially in the technical skills. But very few of these
programs have been directly related to an effort to
remove fear in the minds of employees of losing their
employment by reason of technological change.
* (2150)

The criteria we use for qualifying an individual to
obtain assistance in upgrading his skills and abilities are
very rarely related to technological change. It may well be
that this is where we are in error. I would like to see us get
to the point where loss of employment or threat of loss of
employment as a result of technological progress would
become a major qualification entitling a worker to be
generously assisted by the government and industry in
upgrading his skills or acquiring a new skill that would
qualify him for a new position more remunerative and
rewarding than the one he is afraid he might lose.
It is not outside the realm of possibility, by gearing
assistance in upgrading skills and abilities to the danger
of loss of employment through technological progress, to
achieve the goal we are talking about in the provisions of
the bill. But if we did it that way we might well come to
the point where, instead of technological change being
regarded by the worker as something to fear, it would be
regarded as a development that would qualify him for an
opportunity to upgrade his skills and take on a more
remunerative and rewarding position. This would not
only remove the fear of job insecurity presently created
by technological progress but would completely alter the
attitude of employees towards technological progress.
Technological change would become a step leading to the
improvement of their position in industry instead of something to fear because it might take away their job.
I do not want to belabour this matter longer. I express
these concerns which I know are shared by a great many
people across this country. These are not people who want
to see the legitimate concern of labour for job security
treated lightly. They are people who fear that the provisions in this bill concerning technological change are
going to impede technological progress, and, in the long
run, be to the disadvantage of the employee, the employer
and, also, the consumer who benefits when we devise new
technology to produce better goods at less cost.
I hope when this bill is in committee these points will
receive further consideration. I do feel that the bill as
presently drafted, particularly with respect to these sections, is dangerous to the good and welfare of employers
and employees, and the Canadian people as a whole.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
after listening to Senator Goldenberg explain and discuss

Bill C-183 in such a brilliant and knowledgeable manner, I
fear you will consider it presumptuous of me to rise to
participate in the debate for I am no expert on labour
legislation, nor have I had actual experience, as Senator
Goldenberg has, in the field of conciliation.
Senator Manning, in his usual logical and persuasive
manner, has outlined his doubts about the method proposed by this bill to carry out the objectives with which he
is in agreement. I cannot agree with Senator Manning's
arguments. I do not think that this bill will impede technological progress in Canada.
Like all members of this house I am greatly concerned
about the present situation in Canada regarding the difficulties between labour and management. I am also
deeply interested in social questions, and the relations
between people. Perhaps these are sufficient reasons for
me to speak briefly in support of Bill C-183 which, in my
mind, is one of the most significant bills, if not the most
significant, which has been sent to us from the other place
during the present session of Parliament.
It seems inexplicable to me that with the great progress
Canada has made in recent years, especially in the sixties
and seventies, as shown by the increase in our gross
national product and the fact that we have one of the
highest standards of living in the world, the great prosperity of our country is not being shared fairly by the people
of Canada. No one can deny this lack of sharing when we
know that 25 per cent of Canadians, approximately twothirds of whom are not on welfare but comprise the working poor, are existing on incomes below the poverty line
set by the Special Senate Committee on Poverty as well as
the poverty line set by the Economic Council of Canada.
The preamble to Bill C-183 makes it clear that the government desires that support be extended to labour and to
management in their co-operative efforts to continue and
develop good relations and constructive bargaining practices. The preamble to the bill also makes it clear that the
government considers the development of good industrial
relations between these two powerful forces in our society
to be in the best interest of the country, and that such
good relations are necessary if we are going to ensureand I am quoting from the preamble-"a just share of the
fruits of progress to all."
The bill is designed to make it possible for the differences between the rights of owners and employers-that
is the rights of management and the rights of labour to be
clarified and settled without strife, and, more particularly,
that they be settled before such differences lead not only
to strife but to strikes, which we know often result in
violence. In Canada, although we believe in the freedom
of the individual, we also recognize that together with
freedom there must be social responsibility.
In the past there has been little social conscience displayed by business and management which appear to be
motivated entirely by the objective of making money. On
the other hand, the efforts of trade unions to improve
social conditions for their members, who comprise 35 to
40 per cent of the labour force, have often been considered as excessive, and have resulted at times in unnecessary inconvience and hardship to those not involved in the
disputes. For these reasons there has developed among

SENATE DEBATES

the general public a lack of sympathy for either side,
especially when the disputes result in strikes.
O

(2200)

An editorial in the Montreal Gazette of April 12 of this
year illustrates very well the feeling of many people
regarding strikes. Part of it states:
A strike is similar in some respects to war. It may be
just, although a just strike is as hard to define as a
just war. It is a question of causes, objectives and
alternatives.
In no case does a strike settle the question as to who
was right and who was wrong, however these terms
may be understood. Reasonable arguments do not
decide the issue. In a strike, as in war, superior force
and staying power win out.
I would remind honourable senators that it is always the
poorer people who suffer the most on these occasions.
Surely it is possible that in this enlightened country some
better way can be found to settle differences between
labour and management than confrontations that so often
lead to such strikes.
Suggestions have been made that to meet the situation
in which we find ourselves today Canada should change
the system of free collective bargaining under which we
have been living for more severe controls, such as the
labour courts of Australia. The methods used in Australia, and the methods used in Sweden-which is supposed to have very advanced and mature relationships
between labour and management-have been thoroughly
studied by Canada, and it has been decided that free
collective bargaining is the best and most acceptable
method for labour and management to carry on in a
North American country like Canada. However, there
must be some provision to see that opposing parties recognize and observe their social responsibilities.
As Senator Goldenberg told us, the Industrial Relations
and Disputes Investigation Act was originally passed in
1948. Although I believe it has been amended since that
time by following Parliaments, it is practically the same
as when passed in 1948, and has in the past done much to
modify what might, without it, have been more serious
conflict between labour and management.
The present bill will be even more effective in avoiding
such conflict. It provides, as we were told, for the reconstitution of the Canadian Labour Relations Board as a full
time body, and makes provision for industrial inquiry
commissions and a wide range of actions that can be
taken by the minister in regard to the appointing of conciliation officers or a conciliation board. Making use of
skilled and specially trained negotiators in this field
seems to be the ideal way to solve the differences that
arise.
As reference has been made to it, I cannot conclude
without making some reference to the much needed provisions regarding technological change. We know that technological changes must come if Canada is to hold her
present position in world affairs as a producer. We know,
too, that in the past technological changes taking place
unexpectedly, and without prior warning, have caused
great hardship, and have given workers a frightening
sense of insecurity. I have seen this in my own province in
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.]

July 4, 1972

some of the industries in which technological changes
have taken place, and I realize the suffering endured by
workers who did not know what was going to happen to
them in future, or what was going to happen to their
children. I think the provisions of this bill will do a lot to
help deal with this situation. The provisions of the bill,
which was explained to us so well by Senator Goldenberg,
will do much to help many people in the future who are
affected by such changes.
I was interested to read in Hansard of the other place
that in the debate on this bill members from all parties
seemed to support it. As Senator Goldenberg said, only
two voted against it on second reading, and it passed third
reading on division. I trust that this house will give it as
warm a welcome, and do as well by it.
I sincerely hope that through its provisions "the fruits of
progress," to which I have referred as being in the
preamble, which we have reason to hope will continue to
come to Canada in the future, will be more widely shared
by all Canadians than has been the case in the past.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I am aware
of the fact that the chairman of the Standing Senate
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science is very desirous of having this bill given second reading tonight so that
it can go to committee tomorrow. It had been my intention
to speak on the bill tonight. However, it is obviously
impossible for a statement to be made on behalf of the
official Opposition in four minutes. I am sure honourable
senators would agree that we would be derelict in our
duty if we on this side did not express opinions on the bill.
Therefore, having yielded to other honourable senators,
who have now brought our proceedings to three minutes
to ten, since the Senate must adjourn in three minutesHon. Mr. Martin: I am sure we would all agree there is
no requirement that we adjourn then, and that we would
all be very happy to let Senator Grosart speak now if he
wishes.
The Hon. the Speaker: In view of the last remark by the
honourable Senator Grosart, I must remind the Senate
that there is, of course, no time limit in this chamber. I
thought the honourable Senator Grosart meant that
because we had sat for two hours we should now adjourn.
It is in the hands of honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I would plead with Senator Grosart to change his mind. I am quite sure that honourable
senators are very interested in hearing what he has to say
about this bill, and I would hope that he would make his
speech tonight. As he knows, it is proposed to refer this
bill to the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare
and Science. I understand the committee might have to sit
for several hours before we are in a position to report the
bill back to this chamber.
Senator Grosart, as chairman of the steering committee
of the Special Committee on Science Policy, knows that
we have an important meeting with foreign guests starting at five o'clock tomorrow afternoon, which will go on
tomorrow evening. It is too late to delay that discussion,
which I believe is quite important. For that reason, I
would like Senator Grosart to tell us what he has to say
about this bill now. Then we can give it second reading

July 4, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

and refer it to committee for 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning.
* (2210)

Hon. Mr. Groaart: Honourable senators, perhaps I
should say that in yielding I tried very hard to be co-operative in this matter, and if there is any problem I can only
say that one member cannot co-operate alone in the
Senate.
I agree with what has been said about the experience,
the knowledge, and the wisdom of the sponsor of the bill.
He has had a great deal of experience in labour relations,
and has a very distinguished record. I do not think he has
been always right. Perhaps he has been more often right
than wrong; perhaps he has been more successful than
unsuccessful, but no one has a perfect record. In undertaking to defend some of the clauses in this bill this
evening he has, in my estimation, diminished his record a
little bit. The position he has taken is completely untenable in terms of employer-employee relations in Canada. I
am referring specifically to those clauses which he dealt
with at some length, and that Senator Manning dealt with,
clauses 149 to 153 under the heading "Technological
Change."
I have to say to Senator Goldenberg that I think he
would agree, on reflection, that in most of the arguments
he put forward in favour of these clauses he was begging
the question. He talked of humanistic values, the importance of job security, and the Gallup Poll.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: Would the honourable senator
excuse me? May I ask: Does Senator Grosart, as a senator, question the importance of job security?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: If Senator Goldenberg would allow
me to finish my statement, I think he would understand
what I am saying. I am saying that, in raising those issues
in the way he did to support those clauses, he was begging
the question, because the objections to these clauses have
nothing to do with the questions of job security and
human values. He went one step further and said the
opponents of these clauses have failed or refused to
understand the importance of industrial peace in labour
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: I never said that.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I took it down and I am sure that we
can look it up in Hansard tomorrow. If I have misquoted
Senator Goldenberg I will apologize now, but I have some
assurance that he used those exact words, "the opponents
of this bill have failed or refused to understand".
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: "Understand the facts," is what I
said earlier.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: To understand you-except that those
opponents had not been concerned with your speech. I
can assure Senator Goldenberg that those who have
opposed this bill have not opposed it on the grounds that
it will dirninish the potential of industrial peace in
Canada. On the contrary, the opposition to this bill is that
it runs counter to the basic concept of a collective agreement. A collective agreement, as I understand it, is an
agreement whose purpose is to assure, by common consent, a stated certain period of industrial peace.
25312-38

What does this legislation do? This legislation deliberately introduces another opportunity, perhaps even a
provocation, for one side of the collective bargaining
group to disturb industrial peace. It provides an opportunity that does not exist at the present time. For that
reason, I oppose it. That is the reason it has been opposed
by distinguished and learned experts in industrial
relations.
Honourable senators, the preamble to the bill sets forth
this principle:
And Whereas the Parliament of Canada desires to
continue and extend its support to labour and management in their co-operative efforts to develop good
relations and constructive collective bargaining practices, and deems the development of good industrial
relations to be in the best interests of Canada in
ensuring a just share of the fruits of progress to all.
I suggest that the clauses to which the sponsor referred
run counter to that pious hope, that pious endorsement of
the concept of industrial peace.
It is interesting to note that the body responsible for the
bill, the federal government, exempts itself. It is all very
well to impose these conditions on other people but, in two
places in the bill, the federal government, in its role as
employer, is exempted from those provisions.
It will be said that this act comes into force only when a
situation arises, brought about by technological change or
intended or proposed technological change, which will
affect "the terms and conditions or the security of
employment of a significant number of employees." The
fact of the matter is, of course, that this whole cumbersome, bureaucratic burden relating to technological decisions will come into force long before there is any question or suggestion of job security. That is another reason
why I object to it.
What other method could be used? Perhaps that should
be left to the experts. It seems to me very obvious that the
way to solve a problem such as this is to incorporate
whatever requirements are necessary in the original collective agreement.
Interestingly enough, Senator Goldenberg took credit,
and rightly so, for such a solution in the settlement of the
last railway strike. Why not in this bill? Senator Goldenberg said it is working very well, where the whole question of technological change is discussed in the original
negotiations and not left to some sudden change that
comes along, and perhaps a necessary change.
I would instance the utter inadequacy, I would even say
the inanity, of the definition of "technological change" in
clause 149 of the bill. It is provided that in that clause and
clauses 149 to 153, "technological change" means:
(a) the introduction by an employer into his work,
undertaking or business of equipment or material of a
different nature or kind than that previously utilized
by him in the operation of the work, undertaking or
business.
That is one requirement. If an employer introduces new
equipment or material that was not used before in the
operation, that is technological change. Then paragraph
(b) says:

SENATE DEBATES

* (2220)

a change in the manner in which the employer carries
on the work, undertaking or business that is directly
related to the introduction of that equipment or
material.
This we are told is a definition of "technological
change" for the purposes of this act, which the Parliament
of Canada is asked to endorse. I say it is absurd. This
would mean that if an employer found it necessary during
the course of a contract, or during the course of his work,
to seek a new supplier, new material of some kind
because other material was not available, and he had to
change his methods to some degree to cope with that new
material-which is something that happens over and over
again in business-that, by this act, would be technological change. It would be subject to the imposition of this
whole cumbersome business. I ask honourable senators to
read that definition very carefully. I say that anybody
who has the least knowledge of science, technology or
both, or science policy, would say that it is hard to think
of a more absurd definition of technological change than
that found in clause 149, subclause (1), paragraphs (a) and
(b). This kind of looseness of definition is the sort of thing
that, in my view, the Senate should have something to say
about. It may be just bad draftsmanship. It may be another case of casting the net so wide that anybody you want
will be brought in to your bureaucratic cumbersome
procedure; but, whichever it is, I say it is bad legislation.
If it is desirable, as no doubt it is, to have in this act a
definition of technological change, surely somebody
should have looked up the definition in a dictionary or in
some of the current works where there are scores of good
definitions of technological change to be found. This certainly is not one. If it appeared in a paper or in a scientific
work it would be laughed at; and it deserves to be laughed
at, even if it is presented to us in a proposed bill of
Parliament.
Senator Manning, on the positive side, made the very
important point that if there is anything Canada needs
today more than anything else in its economy it is incentives to technological change. Here we have a horrendous
piece of disincentive to technological change.
I am aware that Senator Goldenberg said, "Oh, no. I
don't believe that this in any way is going to retard technological change." Surely he was not serious.
Honourable senators, I will not go step-by-step through
the cumbersome load imposed by this act. I will not take
the time tonight, but I can assure senators it is a cumbersome load. It says, in effect, that two situations can arise
after collective agreement has been reached by both sides,
signed, sealed and delivered. For the moment I will not
deal with the prior exceptions concerning what could
happen in the original collective bargaining agreement,
but if technological change is proposed during the lifetime
of the agreement, two situations can arise. The employer
can give notice to the bargaining agent on the other side. I
might say I am surprised to find that the bill seems to
assume there is only one bargaining agent because it
seems always to refer to the bargaining agent on the one
side. At any rate, if he gives notice, the trade union can
take certain steps. The effect of those, without any decision by anybody, is to determine that the proposed tech[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

nological change comes under the act whether or not it
would affect the job security of anybody. Before any
decision is taken the whole intent of technological change
is held up and cannot be proceeded with. If the employer
does not give notice, almost the same thing happens.
As I read the act there can be no doubt that the effect of
clauses 149 to 153 is to stop, immediately, any proposal of
technological change, defined as widely as it is in clause
149, subclause (1), paragraphs (a) and (b). I say this is an
absurd disincentive to technological change at a time
when we need technological change more than perhaps
any other major innovation in our economic policy.
I want to refer again for a moment to one or two of the
points made by Senator Goldenberg. I should like to say
to him that so far as I am aware the opponents of the
clauses in the bill are not opposed to job security. Surely it
must be clear that employers have every bit as much
interest in job security as employees. It has been said, of
course, that the private enterprise system works at times
in a manner that separates people from their jobs. Senator Manning said that we have made provision for this
situation. We accept it as inevitable.
We have, of course, an unemployment insurance
scheme. It is regrettable that at one point not very long
ago-I think the date was December 31 last year-690,000
Canadians were receiving unemployment insurance. The
very fact that we have unemployment insurance surely
indicates that separation from jobs at times is inevitable
for some part of the population.
I know Senator Goldenberg will say that he was referring to an employee who has spent many years of his life
in one job and now finds that that job is redundant.
Admittedly, that is a real problem. But I would say to
Senator Goldenberg, to anybody who really believes that
this bill is going to do what Senator Goldenberg thinks it
is going to do, that surely the important thing in the long
run is the totality of jobs that the Canadian economy
provides in relation to the totality of the labour force.
Surely it is axiomatic that if we are to reach full employment, whatever that may be-3 per cent or 4 per cent
unemployment-we must have more and more incentives
to technological change, and, as Senator Manning bas
said, much better provision than we now have in the
Unemployment Insurance Act, in Adult Re-trainingwhich bas been a colossal failure for the reasons given by
Senator Manning and, indeed, for other reasons. Surely
we must have a better answer than to say, "Let us stop
technological change; let us impede it; let us provide, for
the first time in our history, disincentives to technological
change!"
* (2230)

I have and I always have had the utmost sympathy for
the position of organized labour in insisting on its rights
under collective bargaining. In Canada we have, I believe,
established a distinguished record, one that despite a few
minor differences here and there is comparable with the
best in the world, and I am not excluding the Scandinavian countries when I say that. And we have achieved this
by enshrining, on both sides, the sanctity of the concept of
a bargain, for that is the word-it is a "collective bargain"-"a collective agreement."

July 4, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, I suggest that this is a retrograde
step, that this legislation in these clauses is regressive
inasmuch as it turns back the clock on a great, successful
and mutually beneficial innovation in the field of management-labour relations. Let me say again that in taking this
position I am not for one moment forgetting the importance of the human factor. If I believed for one moment
that this legislation would improve by and large the job
security, the human values, of workers in Canada and
their families, I would support it. But, honourable senators, I oppose it because I believe that in its over-all effect
it is going to do a lot more harm than good.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators, it had been
my intention to move the adjournment of this debate, but
in view of the remarks made by the chairman of the
committee to which it is proposed to send this bill as to the
desirability of giving it second reading this evening, I shall
defer my comments until third reading, although at this
stage I may say that in general I support the bill.
Hon. H. Carl Goldenberg: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I must inform the Senate that if
the honourable Senator Goldenberg speaks now his
speech will have the effect of closing the debate on second
reading.
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: Honourable senators, I have no
intention of delivering another long speech at this hour.
However, I should like to make one or two comments on
some of the points raised by my friend Senator Grosart.
He began by suggesting that this bill provides an opportunity for one side to disturb industrial peace-and I think
I am quoting him correctly-and he ended up by referring
to "interference with the sanctity of the contract." But my
question to Senator Grosart is this: Who is interfering
with the sanctity of the contract? If the employer and the
union have signed an agreement and, let us say, six
months later the employer introduces a technological
change which results in 50 per cent of the employees
being displaced and having their classifications changed
and so on, who is changing the agreement? Who is interfering with the sanctity of the agreement? It is the
employer who is changing the underlying assumptions of
the agreement when it was signed.

25312-381

This is a point I tried to make and this is what I said is a
part of the facts that have been disregarded. Let us look
at it in its proper light.
Senator Grosart also said that this will just retard
change and prevent change. I mentioned the railways and
the agreement between the railways and their employees,
not that I wanted credit for having negotiated that but
because there you have the largest single employer under
federal jurisdiction, and certainly the agreement which
protects the employees against the effects of technological
change has not retarded technological change on the railways, and you have but to see the large reduction in
employment on the railways as proof of that.
I could cite other examples. I have been involved in
recent years in quite a number of disputes where I traced
the strike or the dispute to fear of displacement because
of technological change. This bill does not propose bargaining over technological change. I think I made that
quite clear. It is bargaining to allow the employees to
adjust to the effects of technological change. They are
entitled to something. When we expropriate property for
public improvement we compensate the property owner,
and if the worker has to be displaced in the interest of
progress, then he is entitled to some form of protection
and this is what this bill envisages.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: I move that it be referred to the

Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Honourable senators, may I just
add one word here. First of all I want to thank Senator
Grosart for having agreed to speak tonight, and also
Senator Macdonald for having agreed to postpone his
speech. Furthermore, I should like to give notice to members of the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science that the committee will meet tomorrow
morning at 10 o'clock.
Motion agreed to.

FARM CREDIT ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of honourable Senator Michaud, for

the second reading of Bill C-5, to amend the Farm Credit
Act.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: Honourable senators, first of
all I should like to thank honourable Senator Michaud for
his introduction of this bill. After listening to his remarks
on the farm situation in Kent County in New Brunswick I
think it appropriate that Senator Michaud introduced this
measure. Perhaps, Senator Michaud, you have not
achieved all the results you would have liked to by your
inquiry, but at least you have made the government aware
of the farming situation in Kent County.
One aspect of your introduction that I appreciated was
the fact you did not claim that the present bill to amend
the Farm Credit Act would provide a solution for the
problems you outlined. Both of us know that the present
bill is not going to create a line-up at the Farm Credit
Corporation offices across Canada. In fact, I doubt if it
will create even a ripple of interest in the farming community of Canada. I say that, honourable senators,
because I have looked into a few of the statistics concerning the farming industry in Canada.
If I may have your indulgence for a few moments
before I actually consider the proposed amendments to
the act, I should like to point out to the Senate, and to the
people of Canada, generally, that most of us in this country are completely unaware of the rather sad state of
affairs that exists in the agricultural industry.
* (1410)

When you drive past a painted farmhouse with a nice
fence around it, it is easy to think that the farmer there is
making money and that all is well within the confines of
that farm. But in this connection I should like to quote a
few figures from the agricultural division of Statistics
Canada. Naturally I shall start with my own province
where in 1970 the income in thousands of dollars was
$13,822. This was reduced to $6,602 in 1971, representing a
drop in farm income of over 50 per cent. And this is
despite grandiose plans and the development plan by
which farm income is supposed to double between 1969
and 1976. In this instance in one year they managed to
bring about a decrease in farm income of over 50 per cent.
Therefore, they have their work cut out for them in the
next few years.
In Nova Scotia, a neighbouring province, the farm
income dropped, again in thousands of dollars, from
$23,000 to $17,000. That again is a very serious drop.
In New Brunswick where the people are very industrious and hard-working, in 1970 farm income was $17,118
and in 1971 it was $10,570.
The Province of Quebec fared a little better inasmuch
as they only dropped from approximately $195,000 to
$181,000.
Ontario, which we normally consider to be the most
progressive and profitable province, dropped from $402,000 to $324,000. As I have said, these figures are all in
thousands of dollars.

July 5, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

The prairie provinces are up, but the bulletin admits
that a great deal of the increase in the prairie provinces
has been due to the fact that they have received advance
payments. The only province showing a real increase is
British Columbia.
Honourable senators, in addition to that I should like to
refer you to a question asked in the other place and the
answer provided by the government. The question
referred to the income declared by farmers in various
areas. I am sorry that Senator Croll, the Chairman of the
Special Senate Committee on Poverty, is not here. I am
sure he has seen and studied this question.
Quebec farmers filed around 30,000 returns, and 8,862,
approximately 25 per cent, reported a taxable income of
$2,000 or less. Ontario farmers filed 70,558 returns, and
26,600 reported a taxable income of less than $2,000. Perhaps people in the east think the wheat farmer in the west
is making a profit. If any of you have that opinion you are
in for a shock. In the west, 160,000 farmers filed income
tax returns and more than 50 per cent reported a taxable
income of less than $2,000. I am ashamed to give the
figures for the Atlantic provinces. They are even more
drastic. If honourable senators are interested, they can
look them up themselves.
Sometimes we tend to overlook changes in the farming
community. The report of the royal commission inquiring
into the costs of farm machinery indicates that over the
last 20 years farm machinery costs have increased 85 per
cent while the return to the farmer has increased only 3
per cent. We also tend to think that by putting thousands
of acres together in one farm we have created an economic unit. Dr. Barber says in this report that when you reach
a certain point there is no longer an economic advantage
in the larger farm unit.
Farmers, like many other Canadian citizens, have complained about freight rate increases. It is impossible to go
into the statistics on the various aspects of freight rate
increases, but I wish to point out that it is the farmer and
not the consumer who pays the increased freight rate. In
my province over the last two years the farmers have
suffered about a 12 per cent increase in freight rates.
* (1420)

Honourable senators, if by this time I have not convinced you that the farm economy is in a very serious
state, let me quote the status of the loans from the Farm
Credit Corporation. In 1969-70, 87 per cent of Farm Credit
Corporation loans to farmers were in arrears. In 1970-71,
this statistic was 83.9 per cent. In other words, more than
eight out of ten farmers who have a loan from the Farm
Credit Corporation are in arrears.
Honourable senators, there is no prouder group in
Canada than our farmers. I do not think any of you who
know a farming community and farmers can point to one
farmer who is proud to be in arrears. I offer these facts to
illustrate that the agricultural situation in Canada is serious and we need action. Later on in my remarks I will
attempt to make the point that this bill, while containing
many favourable aspects, is deficient in many others. We
need a new policy to meet the needs of the farmers.
Let us for a moment consider the average farmer. First
of all, it is rather a surprise to discover that he is 60 years

of age and at that age still owes $3,000 to $4,000 on an
original loan of $20,000. We can readily picture the average farmer. He has risen early in the morning and put in
four or five hours of work before receiving his mail at 9 or
10 o'clock, when he takes a break to read it. In it he
receives a notice from the Farm Credit Corporation
informing him that he is in arrears and they are threatening foreclosure. He is one of eight farmers out of ten in
this position.
Honourable senators, I will not allow the noise from the
left to disturb me; I never listen to that. I know who will
follow me, so I will have the opportunity to reciprocate.
Anyway, the farmer has received this notice of foreclosure. Naturally that is depressing, to sit in the farm kitchen reading such a communication while talking with his
good wife who has worked with him for years at farm
labour. They discuss the crop failures due to weather and
also the years when they were able to produce a good crop
but obtained low prices because of overproduction. He
recalls the struggle to educate their children and send
them to a better life. He sits there feeling rather depressed
after his 40 years of hard work. Then, with the typical
optimism of the farmer he turns to his wife and says, "Ah
well, things aren't so bad. You know, if I were 40 instead
of 60, Bud Olson would loan me $100,000." I do not think
that solves one problem in agriculture.
I move now to the amendments in the bill. The first
deletes the word "necessary" and substitutes the words
"will facilitate." I cannot get excited about this amendment. I still think that appraisers will look at the situation
and say, "You can make a profit on this operation or you
cannot." To me, it does not matter one hoot if the bill says
"necessary" or "will facilitate," and I do not think the
average Canadian farmer cares about this amendment.
The second amendment makes it possible for a farmer
to borrow up to $100,000. Before I move on to the problems created by this, I should like to refer briefly to
interest rates. In the last couple of years farmers have
paid as high as 81 per cent as compared with the former
standard interest rate of 5 per cent.
It is fine to give various excuses and statistics to Parliament, if one wishes, but if honourable senators really
believe that the legislation is correct in this regard they
should go out and try to explain it to the farmer. They
should try to convince him that he is better off paying 81
per cent than 5 per cent. The farmer knows that it will
affect the selling price of his farm. I do not accept it, and I
do not think that many farmers will accept it.
Let us consider the case of an individual who has borrowed the maximum of $100,000. Before we do so, perhaps I should point out that last year the Farm Credit
Corporation granted 4,100 loans averaging $28,000 each. I
do not find myself getting excited about the possibility of
farmers being able to borrow up to $100,000. Farmers are
too practical to borrow more than they need. Depending
on the fluctuation in interest rates, the individual has to
come up with $7,500 to $8,500 a year on the interest and
approximately $5,000 on the principle. If the $100,000 loan
is amortized over 20 years, right away he is up to at least
$12,500 in annual payrnents. He then has his fertilizer, his
help, machinery, and basic herd. And now that he has
expanded and taken in additional acreage he must turn

SENATE DEBATES

around and buy production quotas-various governments
in their wisdom have put on production quotas-in order
to support his $100,000 loan. This is a discouraging picture. If anyone asked me for advice in this situation I
would tell him to walk away from it, to join a union and
go on strike and draw unemployment insurance.
* (1430)

There is also an amendment eliminating the reference
to 21 years as the minimum age for qualification for a
loan under the act. I have no real quarrel with this amendment. Most of our provinces have reduced the age of
majority to 18. However, I do quarrel with the fact that
the act eliminates anyone over the age of 45. If I recall
correctly, the act does not even state that a person can
apply before the age of 45; it states that he cannot be 45
when the loan is approved by the Farm Credit Corporation. In other words, he can apply at 43 years of age, but if
the application is under investigation for two years he
then gets told, "Sorry, old boy, since applying for the loan
you have become 45 and therefore you are not eligible for
the maximum amount under the Class 3 loans." I find it
rather ridiculous that an inexperienced 18-year-old can
borrow the maximum while a 45-year-old with a number
of years of work and investment experience behind him is
eliminated. I feel this is one aspect that our committee
should consider, because it is going to produce some
problems.
Let us take as an example an actual case that is well
known to me. A certain farmer runs a fairly large farming
operation. His oldest son has finished high school and will
be entering agricultural college this fall to study for his
bachelor of science in agriculture. By the time he obtains
his degree he will be 22 years of age. Following behind
him are the second and third sons, and by the time they
graduate with a bachelor of science degree in agriculture
they will no longer be able to form a farm corporation and
apply for the maximum loan of $100,000. By then the
father will be over 45 years of age. Does anyone familiar
with agriculture know of any farmer who has retired at
45?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I know lots of them who went
broke before then.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I myself have had difficulty in avoiding going broke before 45, but I have managed to overcome it.
Hon. Mr. Argue: The first step to becoming a millionaire
is said to be going broke.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I can understand the attitude of the
Farm Credit Corporation. They take 45 as the age limit, so
with 20 years' amortization the loan is repaid by age 65.
Surely we can come to some compromise so that the
individual can borrow on a reduced scale. I assume this
bill will go to a committee, and this is one thing I would
like the committee to consider.
I now come to the proposed amendments to which I
have serious objections. The Farm Credit Corporation, as
explained by the Minister of Agriculture before the committee in the other place, will become a federal agency to
administer, in conjunction with provincial agencies, a misnamed program called the Small Farm Development
Agency. In my own province I have had experience with a
[Hon. Mr. Phillips.]

July 5, 1972

similar situation. In fact, the amendments proposed in
this bill are political plagiarism; they are taken directly
from this document entitled "A Development Plan for
Prince Edward Island." The terms and conditions are
identical. The only difference is that this program was
designed to reduce the number of farmers from 6,600 to
2,500, yet it is called a program to save small farms.
In Prince Edward Island the program was a planned
failure and has been exactly that. I can drive through the
province and see farms each of which once supported a
farm family-although admittedly they did not go to
Florida in the winter, but they existed and had a certain
security on that small farm-where there is now a huge
government sign saying, "This land is now owned by the
Prince Edward Island Land Development Corporation."
What was once prosperous farm land is now growing
bushes.
Honourable senators, I had planned to go into greater
detail, but perhaps it would be better if I postponed my
further comments until the committee meets tomorrow
morning. I will point out briefly certain similarities. A
farmer who has reached a certain age and wishes to sell
his farm may sell it to the development corporation.
* (1440)

Senator Martin, if you wish to be on this side, would you
please pay attention? If not, would you go back to your
own side, please?
An Hon. Senator: The two leaders are conferring.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I do not
know if this is a true interpretation, but I hear one voice. I
am sure all honourable senators would like to follow what
the honourable senator has said.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I said that if the honourable Senator
Martin would like to join us, we would be delighted to
have him, but I still believe he belongs to his own side.
Honourable senators, I was mentioning that the farmer
who bas reached a certain age can sell his farm and retain
the right to live in the house during his lifetime, or during
the lifetime of his spouse. He must maintain the farm
home in repair and he cannot leave it for longer than a
week without permission. There are various other conditions of the sale.
Our own farmers do not like this situation. They do not
like buying a farm without obtaining the building. After
all, the buildings were part of the purchase price of the
land development corporation.
There are two other points I would mention briefly. One
is the fact that if the farmer is younger and wishes to sell
his farm, the development corporation will buy the farm
outright, provided he can show that he has other employment and will not be on welfare. With today's unemployment situation, this is really a difficult thing for anyone to
do.
Honourable senators, the second and last point, in
regard to the so-called small farms development, is the
fact that the farmer may rent the land rather than buy it.
He can rent the farm for up to five years. The agreement
is renewable but, including the interest rate and the local
taxes, the rental is 10 per cent of the purchase price. The
farmer is not stupid when it comes to a $5 bill in the

moderate indeed. They point out that the original appraisal still applies, if the second mortgage or additional credit
is asked for within five years. They further point out, as I
am sure Senator Phillips knows, that if a farmer who has
a low interest rate mortgage from the Farm Credit Corporation applies for and receives additional credit, he still
retains the benefit of the initial low-interest rate because
the new rate is a blend of the old rate and the current rate
which has the effect of giving to the farmer the benefit of
a rate which is lower than the present or prevailing rate.
So, in fact, the farmer does not lose the advantage of the
low interest rate on his old loan.
I agree that interest rates for farmers obtaining credit
from the Farm Credit Corporation have often been rather
high in relation to the productive capacity of their farms
and the ability of the farmers to repay their mortgages,
but the fact is that the rate bas been set in relation to the
prime rate of interest paid by the Government of Canada.
I believe it is 1 per cent above this prime rate. In other
words, the farmers pay the penalty of high interest rates
when interest rates are high, but they achieve lower rates,
of course, when interest rates are down.
It has been pointed out that in years gone by farmers
who obtained loans frorn the Farm Credit Corporation
sometimes paid interest rates as high as 8î per cent.
Recently, however, interest rates have been coming down
and today they are at 7 per cent, which is certainly a much
better situation than prevailed a couple of years ago.
Last night Senator Macdonald suggested that the farm
organizations were really highly critical of this legislation.
He quoted quite accurately a statement by the National
Farmers Union in which it would appear to be opposed to
this kind of legislation. The Canadian Federation of
Agriculture wanted loans in certain instances to farmers
farming on a co-operative basis to come up to one-quarter
of a million dollars. But I would point out that even in the
light of all these criticisms, Bill C-5 passed the other place
on second reading and again on third reading with unanimous support of members from all parts of the bouse. It
would seem to me that if the rather violent criticism of the
National Farmers Union had had any great appeal, certainly the NDP would have gone along with their criticism
and voted against it.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You should know.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Of course I know. I read Hansard.I
know the point that my friend is making, and I tell him I
was never a member of the NDP.
Anyway, honourable senators, I have read their
remarks. The Conservative Party moved an amendment
asking for lower interest rates for young people when the
loans are supervised, and the NDP amended that motion
to ask for lower interest rates for young people-period. I
am not persuaded that if the Farm Credit Corporation
wished to apply a lower interest rate on certain loans, that
that lower interest rate should depend upon the age of a
farmer. I do not know what is so sacrosanct about age,
and if a young farmer of 21 years of age wants to farm, or
if a man of 45 years of age who is a small farmer wants to
increase his holding by a small amount, then you will have
to do a lot of talking to persuade me that the man who is
45 should not have just as low an interest rate as the
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

July 5, 1972

young man of 21 starting out as a farmer. Personally, I
should like to see an amendment to the Farm Credit
Corporation which would be a change of policy and provide lower interest rates on perhaps the first $30,000 or
$40,000 as an incentive to small farmers to increase their
holdings and stay on the land, just as it would be an
incentive to a young person to buy a small farm.
As I read the trends in our nation today, one great
trend, of course, is for technological change, technological
development and huge corporation-sized farms. But there
is another trend which shows the desire of people to go
out from the big cities to farms and small holdings. I think
we are a little ridiculous in this country if we follow
policies that encourage the consolidation of farms so that
they become very large farm units-in fact almost to the
extent of being factories-thus causing thousands to leave
the land and go to the big cities where they hope eventually to become millionaires so that one day they can buy a
place in the country to get away from the smog, the
turmoil and the trouble of big cities. There should be a
section in the legislation which would provide for lower
rates of interest to act as an incentive to farmers to
expand small holdings, as well as to make improvements.
There should also be loans to enable people to get away
from the confusion of the cities and enjoy the rural life
and the amenities of living in the country.
I also agree with those who have pointed out just how
hard farmers work. I am appalled by the number of
people I run into who think that farmers, no matter where
they live, are in such a favourable position that they work
short days, short weeks, short periods of the year, and
that they have long, long periods of leisure. If I may
introduce a personal element into this discussion, I telephoned a farmer the other night in Saskatchewan who
happens to rent a piece of land from me. It was 10 o'clock
their time, and I spoke to his wife. I asked if Eli was home
and she replied that he was in from the field but that he
had just gone out to the west quarter to check the cattle.
She said, "If you want to talk to him, you had better call
close to midnight or about five o'clock in the morning."
Honourable senators, the farmers have not reduced
their working week; they have expanded their holdings.
They have acquired more land and have expanded into
cattle production. In the vast majority of cases they are
working just as long a day as they can. They are working
to their maximum capacity and receiving a small net
income in return. But difficult as the farm situation is and
difficult as it bas been, there is a turn taking place. I
believe we are on the upgrade now and things are improving. Things are certainly improving on the Prairies. Beef
production is improving and the price of beef is going up.
I have in my hand the latest statistics on farm cash
income, those of January of this year, put out by Statistics
Canada. The report says:
Preliminary estimates indicated that during January 1972, farmers' total cash receipts from farming
operations in all provinces except Newfoundland
totalled $327.4 million, 10.9% more than the $296.1
million realized during the same period of 1971.
I would think that this increase of 10 per cent or more will
be carried through, and I certainly hope that this improving condition continues for a long time.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

We were told this afternoon, if I understood correctly,
that about 80 per cent of the mortgages held by the Farm
Credit Corporation are in arrears. But I have read the
annual report and I have read other statements which
lead me to believe that the situation is exactly the opposite, namely, that 80 per cent or so are in fact in good
standing. The annual report of the Farm Credit Corporation, 1971-72, page 10, under the heading "Repayments by
Borrowers," states:
At the end of the fiscal year, 84.6 per cent of all
mortgage accounts were in good standing compared
to 83.9 per cent a year earlier.
While the farmers during this period have been going
through very, very difficult circumstances, I think it is a
tribute to them and to the kind of credit provided by the
Farm Credit Corporation that more than 80 per cent are
in fact in good standing and have no arrears. Of those
whose accounts were not in good standing and who were
in arrears at that time, I would think the vast majority will
recover their position and get their loans back in good
standing and be able to carry on a successful operation.
* (1510)

On page 6 of the annual report it indicates the corporation has about 69,000 borrowers. How many foreclosures
have there been in the year under review, and how many
properties have reverted to the Farm Credit Corporation?
The report indicates that 37 have reverted. I think this is
an excellent record. Out of a total of 69,000 mortgages
only 37 properties reverted to the Farm Credit Corporation. The fact is that this bas been, and continues to be, a
very successful operation.
Senator Phillips gave a long argumentHon. Mr. Phillips: It was only 45 minutes. That is not
long.
Hon. Mr. Argue: He made a comprehensive argument
against the section of the act which, under certain circumstances, prevents loans being made to farmers who are
over 45 years of age. As I understand the act-and I think
I am accurate in my understanding-this refers to Part III
which concerns supervised loans.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: If you had been listening to me
instead of talking to your seatmate you would have understood what I said.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I was doing the best I could. I was out
of the chamber at one point, and you may have covered
this while I was out. In any event, the complaint was that
under Part III farmers over 45 years of age could not
receive loans. These are supervised loans where it is considered the farmer's equity is less than the average equity
for loans. This is a special category for special circumstances. Out of 69,000 loans, 3,905 were under Part III. A
small proportion of the total number of loans fell under
Part III which bas an age limitation.
I think there is a measure of good judgment in saying
that if farmers wish to get a loan when their assets are not
considered adequate, there should be some supervision. I
agree that the provision regarding the age limitation
might be removed. They could consider the farmer on the
merits of his particular case and remove the age limitation. In any event, there are less than 4,000 farmers who

593
593

have obtained loans under this specialized part of the act
out of a total of 69,000 who have obtained loans under the
act.
It has been said there should not be an amendment to
the Farm Credit Act to expand the powers of the Farm
Credit Corporation, allowing it to undertake other duties.
Of course, the other duties likely refer to the small farms
development program. There is a feeling in certain quarters that the development of small farms legislation of this
kind should be undertaken only after there is agreement
with the provinces and that this concept should be administered by the provinces. I am pleased that the government has put this amendment into the legislation. I feel
that as a federal nation, as a federal Parliament which has
joint responsibility with the provinces in the field of
agriculture, there should be a federal presence. I hope the
federal government goes forward with the Farm Credit
Corporation and administers a small farms program, and
that all provincial governments will support it. We have
had national acts administered on the prairies which have
been highly successful, such as the PFRA and the PFAA.
I see no objection to the federal government putting up
the money and, having obtained prior agreement, operating it as a federal program in all parts of this country.
I think Jimmy Gardiner was right when the federal
government administered the PFAA. I think the Conservative Party was wrong with regard to the administration by the provinces of crop insurance. What happens is
that the provincial government sets up a so-called provincial crop insurance board.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Do you recall how you voted on that
legislation?
Hon. Mr. Argue: I voted for it. I would not vote against
anything which might have some good effect so, of course,
I was for the legislation. I think that a federal crop insurance act could have been administered by a federal body
in all of the provinces. However, instead of this, we have
provincial crop insurance bodies. In Saskatchewan there
is a crop insurance board. Most people in Saskatchewan
think it is solely an instrument of the provincial government. Most citizens do not realize that while the administrative costs are shared equally by the provincial and
federal governments, the federal government puts up the
real money and pays 25 per cent of the premium costs
over the years. The provincial government receives credit
for the act while basically the federal government supplies the money. I think that when the federal government
supplies the bulk of the money under a scheme which it is
hoped will be available all across the nation, there are
valid arguments for doing it on a national basis and not
on a provincial basis.
In Saskatchewan there has been a change in administration and the new government bas announced it is going
to be very aggressive in selling crop insurance policies in
the province. They have established new districts and
have brought in new personnel, and it is a nice political
pork barrel. They bring in their organizers and put them
on boards, and give them jobs promoting crop insurance
in Saskatchewan. The bulk of the money comes from
Ottawa, but it is a provincial instrument, and it is used as
a political instrument by the provincial government.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Phillips: I am sorry to interrupt Senator Argue
but he will appreciate that my province is a long way from
his, and I am not familiar with these details. However,
does not the farmer pay a form of insurance premium,
and does this not bring it into provincial jurisdiction?
Hon. Mr. Argue: The farmer pays 75 per cent of the
premium cost and the federal government pays 25 per
cent, and the provincial and federal governments share
the administrative costs.
The new administration in Saskatchewan has a committee which goes around the province studying crop insurance. There has been an indication that it might be
desired to bring in compulsory crop insurance in Saskatchewan. This may or may not be a good thing; I would
have my doubts. I would hesitate to support such a compulsory program without first being convinced that it is
really necessary. If compulsory crop insurance is introduced and works out well, of course, it will assist the
political fortunes of the provincial government. The
reason it would be successful is that the taxpayers of
Canada from one coast to the other, through the federal
Treasury, would pay a large part of the cost of providing
such crop insurance, and make it possible for the provincial government to undertake the scheme. I would think
there are even greater dangers in such a program being
adopted than the one I have already mentioned.
* (1520)

I am pleased that Bill C-5 contains an amendment, to be
found at page 2, reading as follows:
Section 16 of the said Act is amended by adding
thereto, immediately after paragraph (b) thereof, the
following paragraph:
"(.1) every loan made under this Act shall be made,
(i) in the case of an individual, only to a Canadian
citizen or to a landed immigrant within the meaning
of the Immigration Act..."
This means that the funds are available to a Canadian
citizen or a landed immigrant.
In the Province of Saskatchewan, however, at the 1972
session of the legislature Bill No. 115, entitled an Act
respecting the Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Lands
in Saskatchewan, was introduced. It defines a non-resident in clause 2, as follows:
(d) "non-resident person" means:
(i) an individual who is not domiciled in
Saskatchewan.
The bill provides that in order to farm in the Province of
Saskatchewan one must be a resident of the province. A
non-resident who wishes to farm in Saskatchewan has
one year in which to dispose of his land. If I leave my
farm to my sonHon. Mr. McDonald: May I ask a question? Is it not true
that not only must you be a resident of the province to
farm in Saskatchewan, but you must also be a resident in
order to own land?
Hon. Mr. Argue: That is the whole point. This really has
nothing to do with the farming as such but with the
ownership. A non-resident of Saskatchewan cannot own
farm land there.
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

July 5, 1972

If I leave my farm to my son Greg, and he continues to
work in Ottawa and to live, as he does, in the Province of
Quebec, he has one year in which to return to Saskatchewan or he must dispose of the farm. In my opinion that is
vicious, hideous legislation. It is un-Canadian and just as
separatist as any legislation can be. I think this is a vile
and vicious piece of legislation. Are we to turn over the
administration of the federal small farms development
program to a province that brings in such restrictive land
ownership legislation?
Not only was this bill presented in the legislature, but a
land bank act was introduced. This is an act under which
the provincial government will purchase land and lease it
to farmers on a long-term basis for sufficient cash rental
to cover the interest rate applied to the purchase price of
the land plus taxes. It was thought in Saskatchewan that
the federal government might come forward soon with its
small farms development program, perhaps even administered by the Farin Credit Corporation as a national act.
In view of this it was decided that they would rush in
quickly with their land bank act, which provides for the
provincial government to handle the development of land,
purchasing and leasing it. Then, to make the net even
wider, they announced that in order to own and farm land
in Saskatchewan it will be necessary to be a resident of
the province.
In terms of doing a job in the development of farms in
Saskatchewan-even if one agreed, which I do not, with
their land bank development program-there is such a
small sum of money involved, namely $10 million, that it is
almost frivolous. If a farm costs $40,000, that $10 million
would purchase only 250 farms. Such a number out of a
total of 75,000 farms would take 300 years or thereabouts
before the cycle would be completed once. Well, no one
wants them to complete the cycle once. In my opinion,
however, 250 farms purchased in one year for the land
bank development program in relation to 75,000 existing
units means that it is a quite frivolous program.
Therefore, in the interests of Canadians, in the interests
of a national plan, and in the interests of ensuring that
there is a federal presence when the federal government
provides the funds, I am pleased that this amendment is
provided in Bill C-5. I hope the present Minister of
Agriculture will stick to his guns and administer his own
small farm adjustment progran.
If the federal government, with its small farm development program, goes into Saskatchewan and does the kind
of job I think it should and will do, the land bank development program will fade away. It will be seen to be what it
really is, a very tiny effort based on a false premise, and,
coupled with their Bill 115, that it constitutes a vicious
attack against the rights and privileges of CanadiansHon. Mr. McDonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Argue: -who happen to have been Saskatchewan residents at one time and who now at any rate own
land in that province.
I agree that certain amendments could be introduced
which would improve this type of legislation. I am confident that in the future amendments will be made to
improve it but, as Senator Michaud has so ably demonstrated in his presentation to this house, this is good

legislation and should command the full support of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: May I direct a question to the honourable senator who just finished his remarks. Will he please
tell me whether he is in favour of federal-provincial cooperation, or opposed to it?
An Hon. Senator: Both.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I am in favour of federal-provincial
co-operation, but I am not in favour of every province
having a veto over action which the federal government
has a constitutional right to take.
Hon. Hervé J. Michaud: Honourable senators* (1530)

The Hon. the Speaker: I must remind honourable senators that if Senator Michaud speaks now, his speech will
have the effect of closing the debate on second reading.
Hon. Mr. Michaud: I have listened with keen interest to
the very pertinent remarks made during the debate on
this bill, and I hope that everyone concerned will make it
a point to present their views before the Standing Senate
Committee on Agriculture when it meets. If the bill
receives second reading, it is my intention to move that it
be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Michaud, bill referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Notice of Motion for Adjournment:
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, I
move, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule
45(1)(g), that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until tomorrow, July 6, 1972, at eleven o'clock
in the forenoon.
Honourable senators, it is my understanding that a bill
dealing with certain labour problems in the Province of
Quebec has been given first reading in the other place,
and that second reading will commence at approximately
4.30 this afternoon.
It is most difficult to predict what course the bill will
follow in the other place. I can recall similar circumstances when legislation of this type passed very rapidly
through the House of Commons, but on other occasions it
has taken an extended period of time. However, in case
the legislation should receive rapid approval in the other
place, it seems to me, after discussing the matter with
several honourable senators, that we would be wise to
meet at eleven o'clock tomorrow. If the bill does not reach
us by eleven o'clock, we can proceed with whatever items
are on the Order Paper, and then adjourn until our regular hour of two o'clock.
In view of the fact that it is desired to commence the
summer recess as early as possible, it seems to me that the
majority of senators would prefer to deal with the bill as

soon as they can. That is the reason why I have moved
that we meet tomorrow morning at eleven o'clock rather
than at 2 p.m.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I ask the Deputy Leader of the
Government if an agreement has been reached in the
other place to sit tonight?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I have been told that there has been
an agreement, but I do not know whether that is true.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If there is no agreement to sit tonightHon. Mr. Martin: That matter has not yet been discussed. I think it will be discussed some time between 4.30
and six o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We would like to co-operate with the
Leader of the Government in this respect. I was merely
trying to be helpful and practical in the circumstances. It
seems to me that if no decision has been reached in the
other place to sit tonight, we may be returning at eleven
o'clock tomorrow morning for nothing. That is why at one
time I indicated to the Leader of the Government that
perhaps we could adjourn during pleasure until six
o'clock to see what progress had been made in the other
place.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: May I direct a question to the Deputy
Leader of the Government? Bill C-5 has been referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture. At what
time will that committee meet and is it necessary to seek
leave for the committee to meet while the Senate is
sitting?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It was my original understanding
that Bill C-5 would be considered by the Standing Senate
Committee on Agriculture at ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I am sorry that the information I gave to the Leader
of the Opposition was not as recent as that given by the
Leader of the Government. I can see some justification in
the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that we
meet later today. I intended to speak to the chairman of
the committee to see whether it would be possible for the
committee to meet at nine o'clock tomorrow morning
rather than at ten, in the hope that it could complete its
study of the bill by the time the Senate sits at eleven
o'clock.
However, I am in the hands of the Senate. I have no
objection to meeting later today, at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning, or whenever the majority of honourable
senators might wish, in order that we might accomplish
the most.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: May I suggest that the Leader of the
Government ask permission for the committee to meet
while the Senate is sitting. I am sure that in view of these
unusual circumstances the request would be granted. If
we find that the bill reaches this house while the committee is sitting, the committee can adjourn and resume at a
later hour. I do not share my friend's optimism that by
eleven o'clock tomorrow morning we will have received
the legislation from the other place.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Liberals are always more optimistic than are Conservatives.
Hon. Mr. Phillipa: But look at what your optimism has
done to the country.

CANADA LABOUR CODE
BILL TO AMEND-THIRD READING
Hon. Paul Martin moved the third reading of Bill C-183,
to amend the Canada Labour Code.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, any
legislation dealing with the relationship between labour
and management is, of course, of particular interest at
this time when there appears to be so much unrest in this
field. Every day we hear of strikes of one kind or another
and very often now they are by people such as school
teachers, hospital workers, policemen and the like, who
normally resolve their difficulties without a work stoppage. Certainly when strikes occur which affect the public
at large by causing inconvenience, hardship and irritation, then the whole system of collective bargaining is
called into question. There is speculation that the system
has broken down and is no longer adequate for its purpose. And this attitude, while understandable, is not, I
think, a fair assessment of all the factors involved. It is
not enough to deplore the actions of longshoremen,
freight handlers or hydro workers and the like when they
go on strike, and to condemn the whole system of collective bargaining as a means of settling disputes. No system
can be perfect and no doubt sometimes strikes occur
when they should not. However, I think it is most important, especially at the present time, that we keep a sense of
proportion. We should not lose sight of the fact that thousands of collective agreements are entered into as a routine matter without any publicity and, indeed, no one but
the parties involved hear about them. It is, I think, a fact
which must be accepted that such ordinary agreements
and pleasant relationships between labour and management have no news value, while disputes and disagree-

ments do have news value and are given wide publicity. It
seems to me that the pattern, as it were, has changed. I
have not seen any statistics to prove it but my impression
is that there are very few strikes now in industrial plants
or in mining and steelwork and that type of industry.
* (1110)

The likelihood of strikes occurring seems to be in the
industries which provide a service, and it is these strikes
which annoy and exasperate the public as a whole. The
point I am trying to make is that when the public appear
to lose patience with labour unions and demand some
kind of governmental control over them, we should not, as
I mentioned, lose our sense of proportion. It should then
be remembered that while the system of collective bargaining as it has developed over the years is not a perfect
system in so far as maintaining industrial peace is concerned, it is the best system yet devised under our democratic way of life which has a reasonable chance of bringing about equitable settlements of disputes between
management and labour.
Honourable senators, the controversial part of Bill
C-183 is comprised of those sections dealing with technological change. The problem, of course, is to encourage
technological change so that Canadian industries can
compete in both the domestic and foreign markets and at
the same time minimize any adverse effect of such change
on the workers in those industries. Certainly such changes
are bound to take place; indeed, they must. So the problem resolves itself into what protection can be given to the
workers directly affected. Sections 149 and 153 of the bill
attempt to do this in a small way. Obviously workers
cannot be given complete job security, and everyone realizes that. The bill does not claim to do more than to be
helpful to the comparatively small number of workers in
industries under federal jurisdiction who do not now have
the protection the bill will provide, but it should be an
example, an incentive, an encouragement for provincial
jurisdictions to pass similar legislation. While I feel that
this bill is good legislation I hope too much will not be
expected of it.
I do not regard its proposals for technological change as
being a radical departure from the present practice, or a
spectacular breakthrough in management-labour relations. Rather I think it is but a logical, orderly and reasonable development of a process which has been going on
for a long time. It is that process which slowly over the
years has been giving some protection to workers against
the ruthless play of economic forces. This development or
evaluation began many years ago when labour unions
ceased to be classed as unlawful assemblies. I hope that
this process will continue.
If I might digress for a moment, I wonder what would
have been the result if at the beginning of the industrial
revolution the labourers themselves had been considered
to be the first and most important factor in the production
of goods. I suppose they were not because in these days
and for a long time afterwards the supply of capital was

SENATE DEBATES

much less than the supply of labour. Those who possessed
capital were able to choose where they would use it, while
the man who possessed nothing but his labour had no
choice. His family had to eat. So it is my conviction,
honourable senators, that but for an accident or chance of
history the situation might well have been reversed, and
human beings, the men and women who make up the
labour force, would have been regarded as the first and
most important factor in our economic system, and capital and management as a secondary force which over the
years would have been seeking to redress the balance.
However, fate decreed otherwise, and it has been the
human element which has had to strive and fight for a
measure of justice so they could enjoy, at least to a minor
extent, what the preamble calls the fruits of progress.
The amendments dealing with technological change
have not been pulled out of the air. They are in response
to an insistent demand by members of the labour force
for more job security, and it is interesting to note that this
strong and insistent desire for such security is not confined to any one sector of the labour force. True it is more
evident in industrial plants and other industries which are
subject to sudden and quick technological change, yet the
same kind of security is being demanded by those in what
are known as the professional services, such as university
professors, school teachers, and the like.
We must ask ourselves why there is now this strong and
insistent demand for job security? Certainly, as it has
been pointed out, a person who has spent many years at
one job, and who is very skillful at it, needs and deserves
all the protection which can be given to him if that job is
abolished. If retraining can help, let him have the best we
can offer. If early retirement with a pension is the answer,
let him have it. But it should also be recognized that if a
person has given most of his working years to an industry,
then that industry has a moral obligation to care for him,
at least in part, if his job is abolished, and the government
alone should not have to bear the full responsibility. We
should recognize not only that there is a strong and insistent demand for job security at the present time, but recognize and acknowledge also the reasons for it.
Many of us remember the great depression of the thirties. It was, I believe, the suffering and hardship brought
on by that economic depression which was responsible for
the great demand for security which resulted in our social
security program. The hardship, the suffering and the
distress of that time was fundamentally the result of lack
of employment, and as the employment picture became
brighter during and after the war the demand for job
security receded. It is strong again, and I believe it is
strong because of the fear of unemployment, the fear of a
man that he will not be able to provide for his family. I
believe the high level of unemployment, which prevents
the reabsorption of displaced workers into the labour
force, is one of the reasons, and perhaps the main reason,
for so much labour unrest at the present time.
Honourable senators, as I believe the amendments contained in the bill will be helpful to those who may lose
employment through technological change, and will not
be harmful to management and industry, I support the
bill. However, it will not cure or even alleviate the major
cause of labour unrest. It is my profound conviction that
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald.]

July 6, 1972

the great cause of labour unrest is the fear of unemployment. Remove that fear and there will be, I believe, a long
period of industrial peace and harmonious relations
between labour and management, and the public. I feel it
is our first and primary duty to try to remove that fear by
providing employment.

Hon. Edward M. Lawson: Honourable senators, I think
that I too will deal with the question of technological
change, but before doing so it might be well to examine
some of the very critical areas dealt with by this legislation that have been somewhat overlooked, as far as I can
determine, by those who have preceded me in this debate.
The question was raised in the committee yesterdayand I believe there has been concern expressed in the
other place in this regard-as to why we need a preamble
to a bill dealing with labour relations. I was present at a
meeting between representatives of labour throughout
Canada and the cabinet. Concern was expressed at that
meeting that nowhere in any existing labour legislation
was there any acknowledgment of the existence of labour,
or of its being here to stay. There are companies and
industries across Canada who do not accept the philosophy that labour is here to stay. They are waiting for that
magic morning when they can wake up and find that the
trade union no longer exists. Strong representation was
made by labour at that meeting that such a preamble be
contained in labour legislation, and that the principle of
labour and management having constructive labour relations should be acknowledged.
There are a number of other changes. One, in particular, deals with the somewhat overlooked blight on a
number of industries, particularly the trucking industry,
both interprovincial and federal. There is now provision
for independent contractors or lease operators to be certified. Many people feel that that is not really a very important point, but perhaps they should be made aware of just
how important it really is. There are literally hundreds
and hundreds of lease operators or individual operators
operating in the transportation industry across Canada.
Unfortunately, heretofore they were not covered under
any legislation whatsoever. Without denigrating the free
enterprise system, many of these lease operators were
gypsters of the worst form. It was not unusual to find that
they were driving 15, 18 or 20 hours a day, and when they
became too tired to carry on they would take pep pills or
wide-awake pills or no-doze pills so that they could continue to operate on the highways. It should give you little
comfort to know that the huge semi-trailer or tractor
trailer coming down the highway may be driven by a lease
operator or an owner-operator, half awake or half asleep
and filled with pep pills so that he can operate, with no
regulation or control on the number of hours he may
work, and no supervision as to the condition of his vehicle. No regulations prior to the Canada Labour (Safety)
Code governed this type of individual whatsoever.
I do not suggest that this is a cure-all, but if it makes
provision for lease operators to be certified and governed
by collective agreement, and-perhaps even more important from the legitimate operator's point of view-to be
made to compete fairly in that they have to meet certain

July 6, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

minimum standards, I think it will be a large step
forward.
Another very important area that perhaps has been
overlooked is the make-up of a full-time Canada Labour
Relations Board. Prior to this there was a representative
board that met monthly or, if necessary, more often. It
was not unusual for cases coming before the federal
board, where there was any technical objection, to be set
over for a month and then another month, and so on
through the whole procedure. Nor was it unusual, in my
experience, to have cases where the anniversary would
arrive and still no decision from the Canada Labour Relations Board. This is not intended to be a criticism of the
people who make up the board, but a criticism of the type
of board.
Surely in 1972, with all the rapid changes taking place,
there is a desperate need for a competent full-time board,
meeting on a full-time basis, to deal with the many real
and demanding problems that require a speedy decision.
The proposal for a full-time board is a major
improvement.
Another section that should be examined very carefully,
because it has been talked about in this chamber before,
is that which provides for certification of councils of
unions. On the face of it it does not seem a very significant
point. Perhaps the best example under federal jurisdiction is the airlines industry and the problems that have
occurred there in the past months and years. There have
been strikes of technicians, of controllers, of this group
and that group. In my view, this is an area where legislation could do a public service. It does not make sense to
me that one union in the airline industry can make a
settlement, whether it is the pilots or another group, and
go back to work, and a week or a month later another
small union strikes the industry, closes it down and then
settles that, and a week, a month, or six months later still
another small union strikes the industry and closes it
down. This provision for councils of trade unions, which
may be utilized by those unions to meet together jointly or
be certified collectively, with one set of negotiations so
that the industry would be either totally operative or
totally closed down, is a step in the right direction. It will
minimize some of the confusing aspects that presently
exist in labour relations.
Another change that is somewhat significant, and of
which I have heard considerable criticism across the
country, is the proposal for 35 per cent of the employees
to petition for a representation election. I have heard
many criticisms, some of which have been made to me
personally, that it is somewhat undemocratic for 35 per
cent to decide whether there will be a union in a particular plant or industry.
I think those who make that criticism do not understand
the legislation or its application. The 35 per cent rule is
merely proof of interest. If between 35 and 50 per cent of
the employees of any given concern display proof of interest in having a trade union represent them, they may
petition for an election, and an election will be held. Union
representation will require a majority of those voting, and
not less than 35 per cent of the employees must vote on
the petition for certification.

It is really very similar to what exists under the TaftHartley legislation in the United States. It is very necessary legislation, because too often a union will make an
application to be certified, and by the time it goes through
the lengthy process of a part-time board, and all the other
factors involved, particularly if there is any resistance by
the company, the whole unit is lost, and the rights of the
workers under the legislation are totally lost to them. This
makes provision for a speedy determination, with a
majority of the workers deciding whether to be represented or unrepresented. I think that is an important improvement in the legislation.
Another provision deals with the right of the board to
review questions, in particular, questions of seniority,
when company mergers take place. In the age of the
conglomerate, mergers, and the putting together of companies, too often company A takes over company B. The
employees are all now employees of company A, and the
original employees there-and often it is the employees
who are more guilty than the company involved-say to
the group joining them from company B, "You will all go
to the bottom of the seniority list." Even though they may
have had five, 10 or 25 years' service with the company
taken over, they find themselves on the bottom of the list.
Fortunately, a number of cases that have been decided
in the courts now hold that where such a merger takes
place there must be an integration of the seniority; there
must be a dovetailing of the seniority so that there will be
fairness. An employee with 20 years' service with company B would now have 20 years' service with company A.
This is a very necessary rule in many cases to protect the
employees from their fellow employees.
I am most anxious to see that section in the legislation
adopted, because there is a current case under federal
jurisdiction that has been decided to the contrary. To
digress for a moment, it involves the Post Office, which is
under federal jursidiction, where the Post Office has
taken over private contractors. Employees who have
worked delivering mail for 10, 15, 20 or 25 years, driving
little red trucks while employees of the contractor, have
now been taken over by the federal government. They are
still driving little red trucks, except that now they are
owned by the Post Office.
* (1130)

They have lost all their seniority. They now start with
the federal government as civil servants, having lost all of
their seniority and everything that flows from that. Most
important, together with the seniority and the job security
that flows from that, there are provisions in regard to
additional holidays for 10, 15, or 20 years' service, and
now the men who have spent most of their working lives
in that work will start back at the bottom and try to
rebuild most of their service. It would certainly be my
hope that the federal government, in adopting this legislation, will see that in the other section of the federal government the same principle will be applied. I think that is
important.
Honourable senators, one of the breeding grounds of
discontent is where seniority is being eroded. When things
like this happen, whatever excuses may be given, when
there is no provision for the federal government or the
Treasury Board to grant additional benefit or grant sen-

SENATE DEBATES

iority, they become main contributing factors to this feeling of unrest in relation to the loss of security.
I think it is fair to reveal my own interest. I function, as
honourable senators know, in a full-time capacity in the
labour movement. I function with the philosophy in my
organization that everything must be done in the negotiations in order to effect a contract or settlement.
My personal philosophy is that when a strike takes
place it is really no more than a public declaration that, on
either side, we are not intelligent enough, or reasonable
enough, or fair enough, or mature enough to find a solution. When a strike or lockout takes place it is really a
public declaration of that failure.
I have been involved personally in many industry settlements this year. Contrary to all the unrest across the
country, which I freely acknowledge, in my own organization we have been successful in making not less than six
industry-wide settlements without any work stoppage. It
is based on the philosophy that everything must be done
to effect a settlement, and a large amount of consideration
must be given to the question of job security.
Our best example is in the dairy industry of British
Columbia, where we settled the industry contract there a
few weeks ago. That makes 53 years of collective bargaining in that industry through that union, without a single
day lost as a result of a strike or lockout.
It seems to me that if I had to describe how that came
about, I would have to say it has simply been through
good aggressive top management on one side, and a similar type of worker representation on the other. Those two
parties were primarily concerned for the employee, for
the industry, and for the community they serve. In that
industry we have gone through technological change,
automation, and merger, yet we have been 53 years without losing a single day of work. There are many examples
like this in industry throughout the country, and we do
not spend much time in talking about them. Nor should
we do so. It seems to me that it is fair that we spend our
time talking about areas where conflict does exist.
Honourable senators, although the question has been
dealt with at some length, it may be timely for me to make
a few comments on technological change. A question has
been raised about the definition of "technological change"
in the legislation, and it has been said it is too broad. I
cannot agree with that; if anything, it is not broad enough.
It seems to me that we should simply say that if anything happens in industry that would result in the displacement of large numbers of employees, or a majority
of the work force, some instant remedy must be found.
Until this time there has been no provision, other than
that negotiated directly between trade unions involved
and the industries involved.
It should not be overlooked that the legislation would
apply only to the organized companies and organized
trade unions and that the unorganized work force, which
is the large bulk of the work force, being almost 70 per
cent of the total, will not have the protection of this
legislation. I think the important principle has to be, if a
situation is going to develop where workers are going to
be replaced and no remedy bas been negotiated between
the parties, that there must be some very speedy decision[Hon. Mr. Lawson.]

July 6, 1972

making process available to those workers. I think it is
fair to state that in 1972 there is no point in talking about
denying this remedy to the workers involved, because if
large numbers of workers are displaced arbitrarily or
unilaterally by an employer or a particular industry, legislation or no, and if there is not a speedy remedy available,
those workers will indulge in the sort of self-remedy
which we are now witnessing in Montreal. They will
simply lay down their tools and close the operation until
some fair measure has been applied.
It cannot be the type of shotgun approach where we say,
"Well, we are going to retrain them all." We went through
that process of retraining large numbers of workers
before. We took labourers who had been laid off and
retrained them as iron workers. There were no jobs for
the iron workers, and so all we succeeded in doing was to
increase the educational level of the unemployed. We did
not put anybody to work.
We also have to examine the psychological factors
involved in respect of people who may be laid off or
unemployed in eastern Canada, because they may just not
be prepared to move to Ontario, western Canada, or anywhere else to find employment.
These are the kinds of things that have to be considered.
But, more specifically, in the provision of the legislation
there must be a broad definition. There has to be an easy
remedy, by which applications can be made for a determination. From my own experience I am satisfied, whatever
type of grievance may arise-whether it is one in respect
of technological change or some other type of grievancethat it is a rare occasion that a strike takes place solely
because of economic issues, because of the question of
wage increases. In most cases in my experience it has
been the lack of job security and a rather callous attitude-or perhaps careless attitude, would be a better
description-on the part of the employer or industry
resulting in long-service employees having their employment terminated without anyone even bothering to check
or to care. Away they go. Grievances are left unsettled.
Very small grievances are allowed to fester and ferment,
and by the time contract time arrives the workers have
saved up all their grievances collectively, and these little
irritations are the ingredients of a major confrontation
and a major strike.
That is why many times you wonder why, in spite of a
very generous offer of wage increases and fringe benefits,
you still do not get a settlement. That is why you find
many times trade union officers recommending settlements and the members rejecting the recommendations.
And many times it is because nowhere in the proposal is
there any provision for punishing the so-and-so personnel
officer or manager who did not take care of the worker's
grievance at the time it was very real and important to
him.
These are major contributing factors. I agree with Senator Macdonald that the question of unemployment is of
very real concern, but if you are also concerned about
searching for the major cause of the unrest that is taking
place all across Canada today you must look at many of
the psychological factors that are involved in the minds of
employees-in other words, grievances, real or imagined.
I know you must look at these because in my own experi-

July 6, 1972
July 6, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

ence I have found that 95 per cent of our employees are
concerned about going to work, and doing a good day's
work for a good day's pay with a reasonable assurance
that they are going to be able to go to work tomorrow, the
next day, the next month, and the next year, and to spend
their working life in that particular occupation or industry. But when workers work under a contract, or sign a
collective agreement, then, aside from the conditions in
the contract with respect to wages, welfare provisions, the
hours of work, overtime, and so on, the one real expectation they have-and I have heard it a thousand times
when preparing for contract negotiations-is a guarantee,
real, implied or understood, that if they have signed the
contract for two years or three years, fhen all things
presently existing in the contract, including their jobs, will
be honoured for the full life of the contract.
Consequently, when a change takes place proposing the
automation of a plant, you have a sudden wave of fear
going right through the company or industry, with the
employees trying to find ways and means of reacting.
Some of them react very badly by closing the operation
down. The fears, if unfortunately they are not resolved
and resolved fairly, manifest themselves into a demand.
The employees say, "Well, if we are not going to be here
for our working lives, if we are only going to be here for a
short time, then by heavens, we are going to make the
employer pay, and pay dearly, for what few short work
years we have with this company." Then you have the
demand for larger and larger increases because there is
no need to talk about loyalty or job security or long
service, because they are nonexistent things.
* (1140)

Everybody thinks of technological change as having
some major scientific involvement that is going to revolutionize the industry. But it does not come about quite like
that. Sometimes it does, but as often as not it comes about
by little things.
I know, for example, in our own industry we have
glass-lined milk tanks whereby you can have milk coming
from the cow through the process to the tank, and never
touched by human hands; then to the delivery, to the
completion, to the bottling, and finally to the home. We
would then have drivers with glass-lined milk tanks driving 2,000 or 5,000 gallons down the highway, and being
paid one rate for delivering this and then being paid a
lower rate for bringing the tank back empty, because you
cannot fill it with anything else.
Then somebody designed a 5,000-gallon plastic bag, so
away went the glass-lined milk tank. Now you take the
5,000-gallon plastic bag and the same process applies. You
put it inside a large 40-foot dry freight box, and the driver
delivers the milk, and then puts the huge plastic bag,
which now weighs 600 pounds, in the corner, and brings
25 tons of dry freight back. In this way his productivity is
increased 100 per cent but rarely does he receive any
additional remuneration for it. So he feels that something
is wrong. This might not be something that is tremendously technological, but it is a change in the system and the
driver says, "I am now giving 100 per cent more productivity to my employer, so what is my reward? What do I
receive?"

In the canning industry that we are involved with they
have a tomato picker. At first they found that this very
fancy, expensive, mechanical equipment would pick
tomatoes but would damage them, and because of this it
was not used. But then some scientists developed a tomato
with a tougher skin-much like some politicians. They
have found now, as a result of a different hybridizing of
the tomato, that the machine will work. As a consequence,
the stoop labour has been eliminated. The machine picks
the tomatoes and packs them on to refrigerated trucks,
and they are delivered from California to Vancouver the
same day, and dozens of workers have been replaced.
Then there is the matter of interprovincial transportation with sleeper-cabs. They can drive so many miles
under the regulations, so they plan a trip that can be done
within a ten-hour day. Then they set up terminals, and go
into sleeper-cab operations. Then another trailer is put on
the back with the result that they have now what they call
trains because there are three trailers. These are looked
after by two men. If I may digress for a moment, other
problems are developing here because with the demand
on the part of women for equal rights we are having some
difficulty in this industry in working out the sleeper-cab
team arrangements.
Honourable senators, there are these major changes,
and the whole industry and the whole system can be
revolutionized. Many people can be displaced and it really
does not involve a major technological change-it is
simply a larger piece of equipment.
Premier Bennett likes to talk about his visionary dam
projects, and I am sure that in almost every province
where such projects exist a dump truck is a dump truck.
But where previously such a machine handled ten tons,
the belly-dump type handles a hundred tons. So productivity is increased tenfold. But is it fair to say that the
employee should expect a tenfold increase in his wages?
He may get 10 per cent, but he does not get the 1,000 per
cent that he honestly believes he is entitled to by virtue of
the increase in productivity. I say to many of our groups
who are involved, "You are not entitled to the full benefit
of that. Surely the object of technological change and
automation is to improve procedures, to make products
available at a more competitive price, to benefit the consumer, to benefit the country, and to benefit the economy
as a whole. You are entitled to your share, but surely just
a fair share of that." These are some of the things that are
involved in technological change.
But various things can happen and immediately they
happen there must be a speedy remedy available, and that
is why I think it is good to have in this legislation a
provision for a hearing before a tribunal that can make a
decision. I think it is extremely important that this should
be available, not only for the decisions that that board
may make but for the fact that that vehicle is there. In my
view many industries and many unions will be
encouraged to make their own settlements, because one
thing that the employers and the labour unions realize
very quickly is that they are better in their own hands
than they are in the hands of any private or government
agency making decisions for them. That is one thing that
they are quick to agree upon, so I think it will encourage
such provisions in collective agreements. It should not be

SENATE DEBATES

overlooked that in many provincial jurisdictions such
provisions do exist for technological change. Severance
pay formulas already exist, and such a provision will
encourage more of them.
The one thing I am concerned about is the penalty
provision. I thought in our discussion yesterday Senator
Grosart made a valid point about this provision, and the
technicians who were at the committee hearing with the
minister left the impression that the penalty provisions
would not necessarily be imposed, that they would simply
issue an order to come. I think that is something that will
be very quickly tested the first time an industry has to go
before that panel because it has not met the requirements
of the legislation. You are going to find more and more
trade unions exercising the prerogative, and applying the
penalty section. It would be expected, if they were found
guilty of having failed to comply with the legislation, that
it would be an offence under the act and they would
expect to be prosecuted, and it would be expected that the
prosecution would be successful. If that should not be the
case then that section of the legislation, and virtually the
whole provision about technological change, will go down
the drain.
I am uncertain whether this is a good or a bad thing, but
all across the country when there is a violation of the
legislation by a trade union there is never any hesitation
to prosecute it, but there is perhaps a bad habit on the
part of industry, if the dispute is settled, to abandon the
prosecution, so the question is never positively resolved
and penalties, that would have a deterrent effect and
make the trade union aware of its responsibilities under
the legislation, are never imposed. This is a mistake, and I
am sure all my friends in the labour movement will want
to lynch me for saying this. I think it is a mistake on the
part of industry, having initiated the prosecution, not to
see it through to a conclusion, to determine the rights and
wrongs of it, to use it as a deterrent and to have penalties
imposed if penalties are deserved.
On the other side of that coin, it now appears that where
there are infractions by industry the trade unions are not
going to be so generous. They are not going to withdraw
their prosecutions; they are going to press them. They are
going to go to the courts, and the use of that method may
very well replace the incidence of strike action. This constant rush to the courts by trade unions may lead us in the
direction of labour courts, and perhaps that is a question
we need to examine as time goes on.
Honourable senators, I want to say that the legislation
as a whole, taking into account the changes that have
taken place and the changes that are proposed, in the way
it meets some of the complaints of those of us who have
had to work under it, is such that I think no reasonable,
fair-minded, enlightened employer has anything to fear
from technological change provisions. If he is sincerely
interested in working with his employees there are provisions whereby he can make his own arrangements. There
are provisions for him to give notice, and there are many
provisions and avenues available for him to work out the
situation. Surely no technological change in any industry
can be successful without the co-operation and consent of
the employees. No fair-minded, reasonable employer has
anything to fear from this section of the legislation.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, the best
information we have from the House of Commons would
indicate that we should adjourn this house now to reassemble at the call of the bell at approximately five o'clock.
There is a possibility that at that time we will have before
us Bill C-230, to provide for the resumption of the operation of the ports of Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec.
If it is not here by then, I feel certain it will be by eight
o'clock. In any event, at five o'clock we will probably
receive the report of the Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture on Bill C-5, to amend the Farm Credit Act,
and perhaps we could give the bill third reading at that
time.
Honourable senators, I think it would be wise, in view of
the approaching summer recess, to keep up with our work
at all times.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Would Senator McDonald indicate
whether Bill C-230 will be the last piece of legislation to
come to us before the summer recess?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Perhaps I should deal with this. I am
going to a meeting very shortly and I can assure my
honourable friend, without violating my collective cabinet
responsibility, that I will bear in mind what I know is his
wish and that of all of us.
While I am on my feet I would like to say that I know
how the Leader of the Opposition felt when His Honour
the Speaker pro tem asked Senator John M. Macdonald to
take the chair. It meant removing a very valuable member
from Senator Flynn's warrior group. I am sure all of us,
regardless of where we sit in this house, are very pleased
to see Senator Macdonald in the chair.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We on this side of the house are also
very happy to see Senator Macdonald in the chair. However, we would not have allowed this to happen had it not
been for a rule of this house which permits His Honour
the Speaker, or someone acting in his place, to leave the
chair so that he can fight, if necessary.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I would not want Senator Flynn to
regard the Speaker's gesture in asking Senator Macdonald to take the chair as in any way being an indication
of things to come.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

not take every precaution. Also, there is the possibility of
royal assent late tonight. I do not think that will occur for
the simple reason that it would mean the bill would be
proclaimed tomorrow, the day after receiving royal
assent. This would mean that at 12:01 a. m. it would be
possible for an indictable offence to be laid against
anyone who did not comply with the act. For that reason I
have great doubt as to whether there will be royal assent
tonight, but there has been some discussion that it may be
a desirable thing to do. In that event, I wonder if it would

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Do you mean for the purpose of giving
royal assent tonight to Bill C-230?
M. Martin: Yes. I have just received a notice from the
leader of the house in the other place that he would like to
discuss this matter further.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I cannot see what we would gain, but if
this is the wish of the leader let us say we will adjourn
during pleasure to reassemble at nine o'clock. The other

be fair for us to deal with the bill in one hour, even if we
are all in agreement to pass it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I fully agree. I readily agree that we
should wait until tomorrow. It is just this business of royal
assent that disturbs me. I suggest, therefore, that we

ST. LAWRENCE PORTS OPERATIONS BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
informed the Senate that a message had been received
from the House of Commons with Bill C-230, to provide
for the resumption of the operation of the ports of Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Macdonald):
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the
second time?
Hon. Mr. Martin: With leave, now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I have no objection to giving leave, but I
am wondering what the present position is. Do I understand that the other place has adjourned? It was the
understanding that they would adjourn right after passing this bill?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am sorry, I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Without royal assent?
[Hon. Mr. Martin]

July 6, 1972

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I learn from the officials, who are
nodding to me, that they have not adjourned.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Are they proceeding with the other
bills?
Hon. Mr. Martin: That was the intention.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Leave is granted.
Hon. Paul Martin moved, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding Rule 44(l)(f), that the bill be read the
second time now.
He said: Honourable senators, as you all know, the
purpose of the bill before us has been the subject of much
public discussion in one of the Houses of Parliament and
in the country. It is to provide for the resumption of
operations at the ports of Montreal, Trois-Rivières and
Quebec.
The dispute concerns the International Longshoremen's
Association, which represents some 3,200 longshoremen
employed at the ports of Montreal, Trois-Rivières and
Quebec, and the Maritime Employers Association, which
represents some 51 shipping and stevedoring companies
operating in and out of those ports.
On April 19 of this year collective agreements were
made, after exhaustive efforts by the Department of
Labour, for a period extending to the end of 1974. On May
16, a work stoppage began. The issue at stake was whether or not management had the right to break up longshore
gangs prior to the introduction of a computer dispatch
system which was to be inaugurated in September. Management took the initiative of breaking up a gang working
on a hatch, and ordered some members of the gang to
work in a shed. The union contended that management
did not have this right until the introduction of the computer dispatch system.
Immediate instructions were given to the Department of
Labour's Montreal mediators to meet with the parties and
urge that they refer the matter to arbitration as provided
in the collective agreement, but both sides refused to take
that step. On May 30 the Maritime Employers Association
announced that it had suspended the longshoremen. For
some weeks the parties refused to go to arbitration in
spite of all efforts urging them not only to follow their
collective agreement but to obey the provisions of the
federal labour legislation which requires all disputes concerning the meaning or violation of collective agreements
to be submitted to final and binding arbitration without
strike or lockout action.
My colleague, the Minister of Labour, informed both
parties on the 19th of last month that, unless advised by
return telegram that either party was ready to proceed to
arbitration involved in the violation of their collective
agreement, an industrial inquiry commission would be
appointed to investigate the dispute, provided that the
employers terminated the suspension of the longshoremen and provided that the longshoremen returned to
work. The Minister of Labour also indicated that he stood
ready to meet the representatives of the parties in Ottawa
at the earliest possible date to discuss such arrangements.
On June 20 and 21 the Minister of Labour and his
officials met with both parties in Ottawa to discuss the

July 6, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

dispute and the usefulness of appointing an industrial
inquiry commissioner. Subsequent to the minister's meetings with the parties in Ottawa on June 22, the Maritime
Employers Association advised that it had now decided to
initiate arbitration and formally requested Judge Alan
Gold, the first arbitrator named in the agreement, to arbitrate the issues in dispute. The union, however, refused to
participate in the arbitration hearings which commenced
on June 27 last. Union officers with counsel made an
appearance at the arbitration hearings which were held
on June 29 only for the purpose, they pointed out, of
arguing that the issues in dispute could not be arbitrated.
The arbitrator dealt with the four issues that had been
submitted to him by the Maritime Employers Association
and he concluded as follows:
(1) Insofar as article 501-I is concerned, it is evident
that there was a dispute between the parties concerning the interpretation and the application of the collective agreement. Under the circumstances, the men
were obliged to continue working in accordance with
the order given by management. Their failure to do so
is a breach of this clause.
(2) Insofar as article 501-J is concerned, it is equally
clear that once these orders were given the President
and the business agents of the Union had no right to
hinder or stop the progress of the work nor to interfere with the exercise of the company's rights to determine and to direct methods of procedures of
operation.
In intervening as they did and in taking the men off
the job, the Union, its President and its business
agents clearly breached the provisions of this clause.
(3) Insofar as article 6 is concerned, it is clear that the
partial and total work stoppages that resulted were in
direct contravention and breach of this clause and
contrary to law.
(4) Article 911, the issue at the root of this dispute, is in
a sense irrelevant in view of the larger issues involved,
for even if the union were right in its pretentionwhich I do not believe-it was wrong to act as it did. It
should have had recourse to the grievance procedure,
the accepted method of dispute settlement under the
collective agreement and the law.
The fact is, however, that on the merits of the question the Union is wrong. If there is ambiguity between
article 3 of the old agreement and article 911 of the
new it is readily dispelled by the clear terms of the
Memorandum of April 3rd, 1972.
Under the proper construction of the new agreement and the Memorandum I must conclude that
management's stand was correct. Whatever the practice may have been before, it is clear that under the
new regime (including the transitional period awaiting
the installation of the computer) the practice was to be
changed.
In the result, I find that at all times material article
911 was in effect and the construction put upon its
terms by management was in conformity with the
agreement between the parties and that the orders
given to the workers as a result were lawful and
should have been obeyed.

Following the release of the arbitrator's report, from
which I have just quoted, the International Longshoremen's Association decided that they would not accept the
arbitrator's award.
On June 30 last the minister dispatched the deputy
minister, Mr. Bernard Wilson, and the Assistant Deputy
Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr. W. P. Kelly, to Montreal to arrange meetings with the Maritime Employers
Association and the International Longshoremen's Association, and, if possible, to mediate conditions that would
enable the ports to be reopened.
The key issues apparent in a return to work were: The
lifting of the suspension of the employees by the employers; agreement by the union and the employees to accept
the arbitrator's awards and return to work, and the calling back to work of the employees as and when work
became available. Of course, the most important item had
to do with the job security provisions of the collective
agreement.
* (2130)

Officials of the department conducted intensive mediation over the holiday weekend and when it was evident
the parties could not reach agreement they submitted a
detailed proposal recommending the conditions which
should prevail to bring about lifting of the suspensions
and a return to work. The recommendations were to be
submitted to union meetings on July 4, and the Maritime
Employers Association was to consider the proposal the
same day. I do not think I need outline what these proposals were because they have been given considerable
public attention.
On July 5 the Maritime Employers Association
informed the Minister of Labour that they would accept
the proposals of the mediators. On the same day, however, the Montreal local of the ILA rejected clause 3 of the
proposals dealing with job security-and this relates to
the provision contained in clause 7 of the bill-and,
although the Trois-Rivières and Quebec locals accepted
the proposals, they did so with the proviso, also stipulated
by the Montreal local, that legal proceedings initiated by
the employers be dropped.
The question of legal consequences had not formed part
of the mediators' proposals.
Accordingly, work has not recommenced at the ports in
question, and the Minister of Labour in consequence
introduced Bill C-230 in the other place yesterday. The
purpose of this bill now before the Senate is to express
public concern at the economic hardship created by the
closure of the St. Lawrence River ports, and to ensure the
reopening of these ports without further delay.
The bill requires that the Maritime Employers Association resume operations at Montreal, Trois-Rivières, and
Quebec as soon as this bill comes into force. It also
requires that the Longshoremen's Association direct its
members to return to work forthwith.
Specifically the bill requires that union officers inform
their members that any strike declaration, authorization,
or direction previously given is invalid. All union officers
must also comply with any order or request for the dispatch of longshoremen.

SENATE DEBATES

The bill stipulates that all longshoremen coming under
the terms of the collective agreement must, when
required, return to their duties. Union officials are
enjoined from impeding or preventing longshoremen
from returning to work.
The bill prohibits further strikes or lockouts under the
terms of the collective agreement.
Clause 7 of the bill provides for the suspension of the
job security plan in the collective agreement, subject to
the decision of an arbitrator at an unspecified future date.
The arbitrator may decide when the job security plan
should come into effect, and he may modify the terms of
that plan, which must necessarily be the case in that the
fixing of a new date will alter the plan as drawn up in the
collective agreement. The government has not asked Parliament to fix this date. The government does not wish to
involve Parliament directly in one of the issues in dispute.
Furthermore, we are not in possession of the economic
factors involved. The establishment of a date is a very
complicated matter and the Minister of Labour decided
and recommended that it would be wiser to leave that for
the decision of the arbitrator after he has heard all the
evidence and has considered the merits of the case.
The job security plan in the collective agreement provides, as honourable senators know, for 37 guaranteed
weeks of pay to the longshoremen, regardless of whether
or not they are working. The difficulty arises in the case
of men reporting to work for whom there is no work at
this time. Under such circumstances, the employer is not
in a position to honour the guarantee in the collective
agreement.
The bill also provides, under the terms of clause 8, that
the Minister of Labour may in the future refer matters in
dispute to arbitration in the event that the parties fail to
do so within a reasonable time.
Finally, the bill requires that work recommence at
St. Lawrence ports on the day after enactment. The

Although no specific penalty is attached to failure to
observe the terms of this legislation, I would point out to
honourable senators that under the terms of the Criminal
Code, failure to observe the provisions of a statute of the
Parliament of Canada carries with it a penalty of imprisonment of two years or fines in lieu thereof. It is, however,
to be supposed that the will of Parliament, formally
expressed in statute, will be respected and will meet with
full compliance.
Honourable senators, these, in general, are the terms of
this bill which I commend to the house. If it is desired that
the bill should, after debate on second reading has taken
place, be sent to the Standing Senate Committee on
Health, Welfare and Science, there will of course be no
objection. I commend this bill to the house, This is the
sixth time in Canadian history that legislation involving
an action by Parliament in respect of a labour dispute has
been introduced. We all recognize that it is a serious
matter, but we are also confident of the necessity of
protecting the public interest.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

July 6, 1972

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I think you will
agree with me it is most difficult to completely digest
legislation which was introduced only yesterday in the
other place. We do not know enough about this bill to
permit us to assess its implications. Since it is quite obvious this bill cannot receive royal assent this evening, and
since, I am sure, it would be our desire to refer it to
committee-at least this is my desire--to enable honourable senators to put questions to the Minister of Labour, I
move that we adjourn until tomorrow morning. If the
Leader of the Government agrees, I suggest we adjourn
until 10.30 a.m. This will give us time to study what was
said about this bill in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Before I move the adjournment of the
debate and resume my seat I want to leave no doubt in the
minds of honourable senators that we on this side of the
house are willing to do everything within our power to
provide for the speedy resumption of operations in the
ports of Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec. We support
the objective of the bill, but we think there are some
matters which should be put on record in connection with
this kind of legislation.
I assume from discussions I have had with my colleagues on this side of the house, and from the discussion
I had with the Leader of the Government, there will likely
be no speeches other than mine on second reading. I am
not trying to prevent any honourable senator from speaking. I am just suggesting that if such is the case the bill
could probably go to committee around 11 or 11.30 tomorrow morning. It would then be ready for third reading,
and royal assent tomorrow afternoon.
* (2140)

If my forecast and assessment are correct, honourable
senators, I move the postponement of the debate until
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I take it that you would prefer to leave
the other items on the Order Paper until tomorrow
morning.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think it was already decided that they
should stand.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, in my opinion
the arrangement suggested by the Leader of the Opposition is satisfactory. If any honourable senator has views
on the matter, of course, he is free to express them. If
there are no other comments to be made respecting the
procedure to be followed in connection with this bill, I
shall move the adjournment of the house until tomorrow
morning at 10.30.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I ask, before we adjourn, if the
Leader of the Government has information pertaining to
other legislation that may come to us?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The House of Commons will adjourn
tomorrow at 5 o'clock, subject only to obtaining royal
assent to this bill. If the bill is ready for royal assent, then
that house will adjourn at 5 o'clock. In the meantime they
will resume discussion of the family allowances measure.
If that is completed they will continue with the foreign
takeovers bill. They have greater optimism over there
than I have with respect to these two measures.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate adjourned.

(See p. 603)
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD
REPORT OF STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE PRESENTED BY
HON. HAZEN ARGUE

Ottawa, July 6, 1972
The Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture, to
which was referred the Report of the Canadian Wheat
Board for the crop year ended July 31, 1971, tabled in
the Senate on Tuesday, 25th April, 1972, has in obedience to the order of reference of June 26th, 1972, examined the said Report and reports as follows:
Your committee has learned with satisfaction that
exports of Canadian grain during the current crop year
ending July 31st will reach an all time record of approximately 800 million bushels, exceeding last year's
previous record of 706 million bushels. The settling of
the current labour strikes at St. Lawrence ports would
increase the exports during the current crop year, but
sales are firm and the 800 million bushel export figure
will in all events be reached by July 31st or shortly
thereafter. Your committee further notes the confidence
of the board that there will be another increase in exports in the 1972-73 crop year establishing still another
record breaking year.
It has learned that the two thousand hopper cars that
will be placed in service in the transport of grain will
add about ten per cent to the current railroad grain
handling capacity and should assist the Canadian Wheat
Board in reaching its high 1972-73 export goals.
The committee bas noted that the Canadian Wheat
Board is very much aware that current world market
prices for wheat are low and the board supports, as

soon as it is practical, the establishment of an effective
international grains agreement. The most important
single event that would firm world prices would be increased world purchases of wheat to the extent necessary to reduce the current large wheat surplus in the
United States.
The Canadian Wheat Board reported that the unload
of box cars at Thunder Bay is now in excess of 1800
box cars per day, up from the 1200 box cars per day
that a few years ago was considered a practical maximum.
Great difficulties in winter transportation through the
Rocky Mountains were experienced during the current crop
year. West coast unloads in recent months have steadily
increased and are now in excess of 800 box cars per day,
up from the previously regarded maximum of 600 cars
per day. It is desirable to take action to assure that this
high rate of unload is maintained and in fact increased.
To this end the board believes that certain construction
by railroads to protect transportation through the mountains from snow slides and rock slides is required.
Also there is need for an increase of from 20,000,000
to 30,000,000 bushels in grain storage capacity on the
west coast which would provide available grain for an
additional 15 to 30 days in the event of interruption in
the delivery of grain from the railroads. A further study
at a later date, by the committee, of railway transportation and west coast facilities may be useful.

FARM CREDIT ACT

BILL TO AMEND-THIRD READING
Hon. Hervé J. Michaud moved the third reading of Bill
C-5, to amend the Farm Credit Act.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.
ST. LAWRENCE PORTS OPERATIONS BILL

SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of honourable Senator Martin for
second reading of Bill C-230, to provide for the resumption of the operation of the ports of Montreal, TroisRivières and Quebec.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, as I said last
night when I moved the postponement of the debate, I and
those around me on this side of the house are in full
agreement with the purpose of this bill, which is to provide for the resumption of operations at the ports of
Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec. The facts of the
situation giving rise to this legislation are not in dispute,
generally speaking, and they were put on the record by
the Leader of the Government yesterday as they had been
put on the record of the other place by the Minister of
Labour earlier yesterday.
We have here a situation where an illegal strike began
on May 16 last, over 50 days ago. That strike is causing
and has caused a great deal of damage to the Canadian
economy. That strike is causing and has caused tremendous losses to many people, including the longshoremen
themselves. There is no question whatever but that this
strike must end, and end now. It simply cannot be allowed
to continue. That the government should act, there is
absolutely no doubt; that the government should have
acted earlier, there is equally no doubt. The situation has
deteriorated over the last 15 days. I suggest to honourable
senators that it is due more to the inaction of government
than to any other factor.
a (1040)

As I have said, the facts are not contested-at least the
fact that we are dealing with an illegal strike. This was
obvious from the beginning and was confirmed by the
findings of the arbitrator, Judge Gold, in his judgment
from which the Leader of the Government read a portion
yesterday. What I wish to put on record, and which, unless
I am mistaken, was not quoted by the Leader of the
Government, is the conclusion of the judgment of Judge
Gold which reads as follows:
For the foregoing reasons the grievance herein is
hereby maintained-à toutes fins que de droit-and I
hereby find and declare:
25312-39

(1) That the union and its members have violated the
provisons of article 501-I of the collective agreement;
(2) That the union, its president, Mr. Jean-Marc StOnge, and its business agents, Messrs. Claude Guay,
Theodore Beaudin and Jean-Baptiste Tremblay, have
violated article 501-J of the said agreement;
(3) That the strike by the union and its members is
illegal, constituting work stoppages in violation of
article 6 of the agreement and contrary to law;
(4) That the construction placed by management
upon article 911 of the agreement was correct and that
the orders given in consequence were lawful and
should have been obeyed by the employees concerned.
The judgment, as honourable senators know, was rendered on June 29, which is only a week ago.
If the union had complied with the collective agreement
and acted in conformity with the Canada Labour Code,
and submitted its grievance to the arbitrator immediately,
and had not ordered the men to stop work, this decision
could have been rendered some time in May and the strike
could have been avoided. But in any event, as I say,
instead of observing the collective agreement, and instead
of abiding by the law of the country, the union decided on
a work stoppage.
The other facts which followed and which have given
some ground for criticism in the other place of management's attitude in this conflict, I think are, even if correct-which I do not accept-merely consequential upon
this very fact that at the beginning there was a violation of
the collective agreement and of the law as it now exists.
The question is: What does the government or the Minister of Labour expect from this special legislation? I have
studied Bill C-230 and can really find nothing in it which
is not already provided in the Canada Labour Code or
which could not be dealt with under ordinary civil law. It
was obvious from the beginning that the strike was illegal
because, as I mentioned, the collective agreement contained a clause providing that no strike would take place
during the duration of the agreement, and that all grievances or disputes as to its interpretation would be submitted to binding arbitration. This was in accordance with
the provisions of section 125 of the Canada Labour Code,
which I shall quote:
(1) Every collective agreement shall contain a provision for final settlement without stoppage of work, by
arbitration or otherwise, of all differences between
the parties to or persons bound by the agreement or
on whose behalf it was entered into, concerning its
meaning or violation.
That is very clear. Paragraphs 2 and 3 provide as follows:
(2) Where a collective agreement does not contain a
provision as required by this section, the Board shall,
upon application of either party to the agreement, by
order, prescribe a provision for such purpose and a
provision so prescribed shall be deemed to be a term
of the collective agreement and binding on the parties
to and all persons bound by the agreement and all

SENATE DEBATES

persons on whose behalf the agreement was entered
into.
(3) Every party to and every person bound by the
agreement, and every person on whose behalf the
agreement was entered into, shall comply with the
provision for final settlement contained in the agreement and give effect thereto.
That is section 125 of the Canada Labour Code, and I
put it on the record in order to establish, even if there had
been no provision contained in the collective agreement,
that the code requires that no strike should take place,
and that all disputes pertaining to the interpretation or
implementation of the collective agreement should be
dealt with through compulsory arbitration. Therefore, we
are not only faced with a private contract between the
union and management, but are governed by a public
rule, which is to be found in the Canada Labour Code.
For this dispute was not a private dispute. It was a public
problem right from the beginning, the origins of which, as
I said, go back more than 50 days.
* (1050)

Of course, the management had recourse to the courts,
and we all know that injunctions were granted, one by the
Superior Court of Quebec ordering the men back to work.
It is quite obvious that the injunctions were based on the
provisions of the Canada Labour Code. Those injunctions
were not obeyed. They were not respected by either the
union leaders or members. Under the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec, if one does not obey an injunction or
order of the court, one is in contempt of the court. Section
51 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows. I
hope that I have the latest text, but I shall read what I
have:
Except where otherwise provided, anyone who is
guilty of contempt of court is liable to a fine not
exceeding five thousand dollars or to imprisonment
for a period not exceeding one year.
Imprisonment for refusal to obey any process or
order may be repeatedly inflicted until the person
condemned obeys.
That means that every day, from the day the injunction is
granted, the court may pronounce a sentence of a fine not
exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year, and it applies not only to the union leaders
but to every member of the union who refuses to go back
to work.
What does Bill C-230 provide? Clause 2 is an interpretation clause and need not be discussed. Clause 3 says:
Forthwith upon the coming into force of this Act,
each employer shall resume longshoring and related
operations at the ports of Montreal, Trois-Rivières
and Quebec.
As we know, this clause is not necessary because the
employers have always been ready to resume longshoring
and related operations.
Clause 4 says:
(1) Each person who was an officer of a union on
May 16, 1972 and each person who is an officer of a
union on the coming into force of this Act shall forthwith give notice to the members of the union of which
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

he was or is an officer, who are ordinarily employed
in longshoring or related operations at any of the
ports of Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec that any
declaration, authorization or direction to go on strike
declared, authorized or given before the coming into
force of this Act is invalid.
This is the case under the Canada Labour Code whether
or not it is included in this bill.
Section 128(1) of the Canada Labour Code reads as
follows:
Except in respect of a dispute that is subject to the
provisions of subsection (2),
(a) no employer bound by or who is a party to a
collective agreement shall declare or cause a lockout
with respect to any employee bound by the collective
agreement or on whose behalf the collective agreement was entered into, and
(b) during the term of the collective agreement no
employee bound by a collective agreement or on
whose behalf a collective agreement has been entered
into shall go on strike and no bargaining agent that is
a party to the agreement shall declare or authorize a
strike of any such employee.
That is the only part of section 128 that is applicable in
this instance. Section 128(2) does not apply, so I shall not
read it. Clause 4, therefore, merely repeats what is already
set out under the Canada Labour Code.
Clause 5(1) states:
Every person who is ordinarily employed in longshoring or related operations at any of the ports of
Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec and who is
bound by a collective agreement to which this Act
applies shall, when so required, return to the duties of
his employment.
Why say that? They are already so required by section 128
of the Canada Labour Code to which I just referred. Why
say "when so required" when they are already required?
They have been required to return to work from the time
the strike first began. Under the law, this has been an
illegal strike right from the beginning. Why should we say
that they shall return to work when so required? They are
already required, and have been so required from the
beginning.
Clause 5(2) states:
No officer of a union shall in any manner impede or
prevent or attempt to impede or prevent any person to
whom subsection (1) applies from complying with that
subsection.
Section 128 of the Code does not mention an officer of a
union, but section 147(4) provides:
Every officer or representative of a trade union who
contrary to this Part authorizes or participates in the
taking of a strike vote of employees or declares or
authorizes a strike contrary to this Part is guilty of an
offence and liable upon summary conviction to a fine
not exceeding three hundred dollars.
I suggest to you, honourable senators, that clause 5 does
not add anything to the law.

July 7, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

Clause 6 of Bill C-230 reads:
During the term of the collective agreements to
which this Act applies,
(a) no employer shall declare or cause a lockout;
(b) no person who is an officer of a union shall declare
or authorize a strike; and
(c) no person who is ordinarily employed in longshoring or related operations at any of the ports of Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec and who is bound by
a collective agreement to which this Act applies shall
participate in a strike.
This clause merely repeats what is already provided in the
sections of the Canada Labour Code which I have already
read.
I come now to clause 7 of the bill. There is something
special in this clause. It reads as follows:
(1) The collective agreements to which this Act
applies continue to be binding in accordance with
their termsThat is obvious.
-except that the job security plans set out therein and
all provisions that relate to or affect the operation of
those plans, to the extent that they relate to or affect
the operation of those plans, are of no effect until
such date as is specified in an award made by an
arbitrator pursuant to subsection (2).
* (1100)

(2) An arbitrator selected or chosen as provided in
the collective agreements to which this Act applies is
hereby empowered, on the application of an employer, a union or the Minister of Labour, to make an
award
(a) fixing the date on which the job security plans set
out in the collective agreements to which this Act
applies and all provisions that relate to or affect the
operation of those plans, shall come into effect; and
(b) making such modifications to those plans and
those provisions as in his opinion are required to give
effect thereto on and after the date fixed by him.
This is, of course, a problem that has been created by the
strike, and especially by the length of the strike. The
problem is really private, not public; it is only incidental
and consequential. I agree that possibly we are helping to
clear the air in order to solve a difficult situation by
providing for an adjustment of the job security plans
included in the collective agreement and which, because
of the strike, are impossible to implement at this time,
since the funds have not been provided by the contributions of the employees because of their work stoppage.
I would go so far as to suggest that this is outside the
competence of Parliament. It is really the problem of the
parties themselves. We are saying, "Well, in view of the
fact that you will have this problem, we are going to
provide for an arbitrator who will try to adjust this plan
to the circumstances that have been created by the length
of the strike." In any event, I suggest to you, honourable
senators, that if we had only this problem to deal with it
did not justify the passage of special legislation by
Parliament.

Clause 8 is also to some extent related to the problem of
the plans. It provides:
The Minister of Labour may refer any matter in
dispute between an employer and a union to an arbitrator selected or chosen as provided in the collective
agreement to which this Act applies where the
employer or the union could have so referred the
matter but failed to do so in a time that, in the opinion
of the Minister, was reasonable having regard to the
nature of the dispute.
As I say, this is related to the problem of job security, but
it is wider in the sense that if a party to the collective
agreement has a grievance and does not refer it to arbitration, the minister may do so. It seems to me to be childish.
We here have a case in which the union and the longshoremen thought they had a grievance. I am not too sure
they thought they had a good grievance, but they thought
they had a grievance, and they did not go to the arbitrator
as provided in the collective agreement but decided rather
to go on strike. It was their own business. Now it is said
that the minister may refer the matter to an arbitrator.
I do not know what clause 8 will accomplish. If it is as
successful as the last attempt-when the matter was
referred to Judge Gold for decision, and his decision was
completely disregarded and ignored by the union and its
members-I do not see what it really can accomplish. It is
already provided in the legislation that if you have agreements you go to an arbitrator, and you do not go on strike.
Honourable senators, I am coming now to the last
clause, which reads simply:
This Act shall come into force on the day immediately
following the day it is assented to and expires on the
termination date of the collective agreements to which
this Act applies or on such earlier day as may be fixed
by proclamation.
Of course, this is simply an operative provision. It means
that the act will come into force probably tomorrow, and
that it will apply during the period of the collective agreement. It will be remembered that these collective agreements were signed on March 30 last for a period of three
years. But these collective agreements were governed, and
were to be governed for their duration, by the Canada
Labour Code. If I am correct in stating that this bill adds
nothing to, and changes nothing in, the Labour Code then,
whether you say this in clause 9 or not is completely
immaterial.
I have been trying really to find out what we are
attempting to achieve. Of course, the argument may be
made that, although the bill does not provide any specific
penalty, the minister has indicated that he is counting on
the application of section 115 of the Criminal Code, which
provides:
Every one who, without lawful excuse, contravenes an
Act of the Parliament of Canada by wilfully doing
anything that it forbids or by wilfully omitting to do
anything that it requires to be done is, unless some
penalty or punishment is expressly provided by law,
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.
Section 646 of the Code gives an option to the judge to
impose a fine in lieu of the imprisonment provided here.

SENATE DEBATES

I say to you, honourable senators, that I am not too sure
that the application of this section will do anything. At
this point we are concerned with the criminal law. It will
be noticed that the people will have to be "wilfully doing"
something, or will have to be "wilfully omitting" to do
something. That "wilfully" will have to be proven. Therefore, the intent will have to be proven before this legislation can be applied.
Should a new dispute occur after the union and the
longshoremen, let us say, have resumed their operations
and have obeyed this law or the Labour Code, whatever
they decide, the question arises as to whether it will be
considered as something coming under the Labour Code
or as something coming under this special legislation.
Section 147 of the Labour Code provides penalties for
contravention of its provisions. I think at this point I
should quote section 147 of the Labour Code in order to
make my point clear. I have already read section 147(4)
but in order to make the context complete I will read the
whole section:
* (1110)

(1) Every employer who declares or causes a lockout
contrary to this Part is guilty of an offence and liable
upon summary conviction to a fine not exceeding two
hundred and fifty dollars for each day that the lockout exists.
(2) Every person acting on behalf of an employer
who declares or causes a lockout contrary to this Part
is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding three hundred dollars.
(3) Every trade union that declares or authorizes a
strike contrary to this Part is guilty of an offence and
liable upon summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred and fifty dollars for each day that the
strike exists.
(4) Every officer or representative of a trade union
who contrary to this Part authorizes or participates in
the taking of a strike vote of employees or declares or
authorizes a strike contrary to this Part is guilty of an
offence and liable upon summary conviction to a fine
not exceeding three hundred dollars.
You will notice that subsection (4) provides for a fine
not exceeding $300 a day for every officer or representative of the union. If you calculate that over the 50 days
that the strike has lasted you can see that if the court were
to impose the maximum penalty provided in section
147(4), each officer of the union, if found guilty, would,
under this provision, be liable to a fine of $15,000 up to the
present time-$300 per day for 50 days. Nor is it necessary
to prove the intent as is the case in the Criminal Code. The
fine is simply there.
So I ask: What is going to happen after the resumption
of the work if disputes of another kind arise? Will we go
by section 147 of the Labour Code, or will we go by
section 115 of the Criminal Code?
I come now to another point. This strike has lasted for
over 50 days despite the fact that the Labour Code has in
it all the provisions necessary to enable the minister to do
something about the strike. As I have said already, we
were not faced here with a strike of a private nature
because, first of all, provisions of a public act were violat[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

July 7, 1972

ed, and, second, it was obvious from the beginning that
that kind of strike would soon hurt the public. In fact, it
was so obvious that I cannot understand why the Minister
of Labour, when he saw these obvious contraventions and
violations of the Labour Code, did not after a few days
simply warn the union officers involved and the longshoremen that he would resort to the enforcement of the
act by prosecuting them under section 147.
If after one week the minister had adopted that attitude,
or taken that strong position, the dispute might well have
been resolved. Naturally, I would not expect him to
invoke the measure without a fair warning. I realize that
you cannot deal with problems of that kind on the basis of
saying one day that you are going to lay charges the next
day. There must be a period of warning. That is only fair.
Nevertheless, I cannot see why the minister has never
done anything when there bas been such an obvious violation of the law and when, in fact, remedies for such
violations actually exist in the Labour Code. Admittedly,
they may not be very efficient, but they are just as efficient, I suggest, as those that could be resorted to after the
passage of Bill C-230. This measure adds nothing to the
law-nothing at ail.
The fact is that the Labour Code bas been violated and
has not been enforced, and now the government, through
the Minister of Labour, is asking us to make a new law by
which to tell the union and the longshoremen to please
obey the law. In other words, here we are passing a law
ordering people to obey the law. That is the position in
which the government finds itself today. I have never seen
anything more stupid in the 15 years that I have been in
Parliament. I have never before heard of legislation enacted to order people to observe existing legislation.
If what the government wanted was merely a moral
declaration to persuade the longshoremen to stop their
illegal strike, obviously it would have been quite easy to
have Parliament declare: Stop disobeying the law and go
back to work. We could do that, if that is what is wanted.
If that is what this bill means, that is all right. In fact, that
is why we are going to vote for it. We are saying to the
longshoremen, "We are begging you to go back to work
because you are acting in contravention of the present
law, which we are repeating in case you did not understand it in the first instance." That, apparently, is what we
are doing. We look a little bit silly, but if it achieves the
objective, well, I am willing to look silly. But we do look
silly, don't we? That is the position in which we find
ourselves.
Honourable senators, I hope I have not kept you too
long, although I have kept you longer than I intended.
Perhaps I have quoted too many texts, but I thought it
was important to put these facts on record. By way of
concluding my remarks, I should like now to make one or
two further observations.
In my opinion, something that is far more important
than providing special legislation to deal with special
cases is to have some permanent machinery provided in
the Labour Code. I feel the government should seriously
consider amending the Labour Code to provide such permanent machinery to deal with situations of the kind we
have been faced with in the last 50 days. It may be that the
Labour Code does not at the moment have the tools to be

July 7, 1972

SENATE DEBATES

truly efficient, but the unfortunate fact is that Bill C-230 is
not going to add anything to it anyway.
This strike is an illegal strike, but there are strikes
which are legal, and the fact is that it is not only illegal
strikes that can hurt the public. Illegal and legal strikes
can have equally bad results, but so long as a strike
remains a private fight, so long as the public is not directly affected, then I can understand that the Minister of
Labour would like to wash his hands of it and say, "Well,
it is not my problem." That is precisely what he has been
doing for the past eight weeks, but in this case not only
was the strike not legal, it was not private. It was an illegal
strike which hurt the public. Finally, the minister introduced Bill C-230 in an attempt to solve the problem, but
the fact remains that this bill is meaningless and, in my
view, permanent machinery should be placed in the
Canada Labour Code to cope with such situations as they
arise, and to cope with strikes which hurt the public,
whether legal or illegal. Perhaps there could be something
in the nature of a cooling-off period as is provided in the
Taft-Hartley law or in the Quebec Labour Code. Sometimes that works; sometimes it does not. At any rate, that
could be one measure employed.
* (1120)

Such a machinery could be reinforced by penalties
which would provide, for instance, for the decertification
of a union or even of an association of employers. It could
provide for heavy fines in the case of lockout on the part
of employers, although this is a situation which arises less
frequently. But, as I say, it could provide for the decertification of a union or for the placing of a union under
trusteeship.
In my view these tools should be embodied in the
Labour Code and thus serve as a warning to the parties
concerned that the minister and the government would
eventually resort to such measures, the consequences of
which would really be meaningful to the parties.
Honourable senators will remember that some years
ago we dealt with a strike on the west coast by placing the
union under trusteeship and in this manner solved the
problems created by the situation. But that, too, involved
a special act of Parliament because the tool did not exist
to cope with situations like that. We must keep in mind
that such a situation could develop while Parliament is
dissolved and two months or two and half months or even
three months could elapse before Parliament could be
reconvened. What would be done in the meantime? While
keeping in mind the precautions required to protect adequately the rights of the unions, the rights of the employers and the rights of the workers, the government should
nevertheless equip itself to cope with strikes whether legal
or illegal when they injure the public interest. This is the
type of situation we are faced with today.
I am not convinced that the bill we are asked to pass
today achieves anything in principle. In practice it seems
to me that once Parliament has unanimously indicated
that it wants this strike to end, and that it wants a resumption of stevedoring operations at the ports of Montreal,
Trois-Rivières and Quebec, then the union, the officers of
the union, the longshoremen and, of course, the employers
should not hesitate to obey the law. Whether or not they
obey this particular act of Parliament, I beg the Leader of
25312-40

the Government to consider the silly position in which we
find ourselves today, and the difficult position in which
the government could find itself tomorrow through not
having proper machinery to enable it to curb or even
avert work stoppages or strikes, whether legal or illegal,
when they hurt the public interest.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker pro tem: I must remind honourable senators that if the honourable Senator Martin
speaks now, his speech will have the effect of closing the
debate on second reading.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, it is not my
intention to endeavour-assuming I were able to do so-to
reply to the points made by the Leader of the Opposition.
He has pointed out that there are certain inadequecies in
the existing law; he has emphasized that those things
which we seek to do through this bill are already covered
in other acts passed by the Parliament of Canada. Whether or not one fully agrees with the conclusions he has
reached, there can be no doubt that his statement of the
existing law and the effects of this particular bill are
generally as he has stated them to be. It should be
recalled, however, that the Labour Code is an act which
does not apply to a particular situation, and no one knows
that better than the Leader of the Opposition. I do not
state the obvious merely for that purpose, but simply to
indicate that the raison d'être for the action which we are
called upon to take was itself emphasized by the Leader
of the Opposition in his able speech when he said he
intended to vote for this bill because it was a declaration
by the Parliament of Canada regarding a situation that
has had the serious economic consequences which we all
know.
Honourable senators, the Labour Code is addressed to
all labour disputes that come within the competence of
the Parliament of Canada, but we are acting now in the
rare circumstances faced by Parliament on five other
occasions. One of those situations was experienced by the
Leader of the Opposition when he was a member of the
government headed by Mr. Diefenbaker, and he will no
doubt recall the difficult circumstances surrounding that
particular situation. I can myself recall at least two other
situations in which the Parliament of Canada was called
upon to deal, not with a general labour-management problem in the country but with a particular dispute, as we are
now dealing with a particular dispute in this bill. I would
think that if there was any doubt-and I am not suggesting for a moment that the Leader of the Opposition
thought that in the final analysis there was any doubtabout the action we are now taking, it is set aside by the
fact that in the other place all the political parties, even
though they disagreed on some points, were unanimous
that this action had to be taken by the Parliament of
Canada.
The Leader of the Opposition complains about tardiness of action; he says that the Minister of Labour should
have acted earlier. Well, honourable senators, I am going
to propose that this bill go to committee so that we can
hear the Minister of Labour on this point, and undoubtedly he will be able to deal with the argument made by the
Leader of the Opposition in greater detail and with more

.Tilv 7 1972

SENATE DEBATES
persuasiveness than I. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition, who has had a great deal of legal experience, is well
aware that in situations involving the actions of hundreds
of human beings it is not always possible to deal with such
situations strictly according to the letter of the law or,
indeed, to the letter of regulations that are intended a
priori to deal with situations.
* (1130)

No one likes to interfere in the process of collective
bargaining. It is for this reason that Parliament has rarely
acted in the unique situation which confronts us at the
moment. Parliament does not want to interfere with the
process of collective bargaining and, indeed, in this instance we are not. This is, perhaps, the one case in which
Parliament has acted where there has been no interference with the process of collective bargaining as was the
case in at least four of the other instances where Parliament acted.
I believe that the law has been broken and the Canada
Labour Code has not been respected. The principle of the
collective agreement between the longshoremen and the
Maritime Employers Association has been violated and,
thereby, those who have violated the act have brought this
within the mischief of the punitive arrangements available under the law or under that agreement.
While all that is so, I am sure that it will be found on
questioning that the Department of Labour, anxious to
see if it could not bring about a settlement, at least in the
stage between the middle of May and the present time,
and having assessed the full situation, acted as wisely and
as constructively in the circumstances as I believe it was
possible to act. Now, the Leader of the Opposition does
not agree with me and I understand his argument. He has
made it effectively. I can only say that having listened to
the Minister of Labour in cabinet, and having listened to
him in private discussions, I am persuaded that the course
which he and his officers followed throughout the situation has been a wise one, and that the course we are now
taking becomes necessary for the simple reason that it
had finally reached the stage where hope of settlement by
any other process was out of the question.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Do you have to wait that long on
every occasion?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I wish the problems were as simple as
the question suggests. It is all very well for my dear
friend, Senator Choquette, to ask this, sitting in the confort of his particular situation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Do you want to change places?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that if I sat over there and he sat over here I would
likely find objection to the course that the government in
which he would be a distinguished member might be
taking, although I suspect that he would not have the
same argument for defence which I think in the circumstances is the case here today.
Clause 7 of this bill makes this particular legislative step
of the Parliament of Canada essential. It deals with the
problem of job security, rendered by the establishment of
a fund which would enable longshoremen, in the event of
unemployment, to obtain a guaranteed income for a
period of time. Because of the employment situation[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

1972

July

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You mean because of the strike.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -which arises as a result of the strike,
the fund has been put in jeopardy. This provision of the
bill, which gives an arbitrator the opportunity to determine when the job security provision in the contract
should be resumed, is a vital one and is necessary for the
men themselves and for the preservation of the principle.
I am sure that this was a very important consideration in
the minds of those longshoremen who admittedly have
violated the law, and a very important consideration in
their persistence in doing so.
In any event, no one likes to deal with this kind of
legislation. We prefer to allow the parties to a dispute to
work out their own arrangements. However, as the
Leader of the Opposition implied, public interest is
involved here. The government, whether or not it has
acted as quickly as Senator Flynn would like, has acted.
And because it has now acted there can be, in my judgment, no doubt about the desirability from a national
standpoint of our supporting this bill as the Leader of the
Opposition indicated his intention to do.
I believe there is nothing further that I wish to add. Just
as quickly as we get second reading we can go to committee. The Minister of Labour and his officials will be there,
and I am sure they will be prepared to deal with these
questions, some of which were ably underlined by the
Leader of the Opposition in his remarks a few moments
ago.

THE SENATE
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I rise on a
question of privilege affecting the whole Senate.
Yesterday in the other place the Prime Minister moved
the following motion:
That when the House adjourns following the third
reading and passing of Bills C-170 and C-201, or, at the
ordinary time of daily adjournment on Friday, July 7,
1972, as the case may be, it shall stand adjourned until
a time to be fixed by Mr. Speaker, at the request of the
Government, when the House may meet for the purpose of the giving of Royal Assent to any bills that
have not been given Royal Assent;
That motion was amended to read:
That when the House adjourns at the ordinary time
of daily adjournment on Friday, July 7, 1972, provided
that Royal Assent has been given to Bill C-230Of course, that will be done later this day, but as I read
that motion it means that if the Senate were to receive
Bills C-170 and C-201, or either one of them, the House of
Commons would not meet to consider any amendments
the Senate might make to those bills, but would only meet
to give royal assent to them. In other words, that motion
assumes either that the Senate will merely rubber-stamp
those bills or that, to give it the most generous interpretation possible, if the Senate does make any amendments to
those bills the House of Commons will only consider those
amendments when it returns in the fall.
I am quite sure that the person who drafted that motion
for the Prime Minister must have worked it that way
inadvertently, but I think I should point out that as it
reads now the motion is an insult to the Senate.

ance record compares very favourably with the day-today attendance in the other place.
I understand that the House of Commons is presently
dealing with another bill. Should that bill pass in that
place before their adjournment at approximately 4.30
p.m.-because of royal assent-then, of course, we will
have to deal with it next week. Here I am indicating once
again the likelihood of our having to sit next week. I have
already indicated my own personal preferences, but I had
better not go on doing that in view of my responsibility as
a member of the government. I shall not be here myself at
4.30 because of royal assent and the requirement that I be
elsewhere, but I should like to take this occasion to say
that if that legislation should pass in the other place, then
I know there will be a large representation of senators
here whenever we meet next week, whether on Monday or
any other day.
I should also like to draw to the attention of the public,
as I did last week and as Senator Flynn has already done,
that should this legislation pass and should we be meeting
next week, then in ail probability we shall be meeting
when the House of Commons itself will not be sitting.

THE SENATE
TRIBUTES TO HIS HONOUR THE SPEAKER
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, before I go to
join the Deputy Governor General prior to his coming in
the Senate chamber for the royal assent, and as we are
not likely now to have to come back before September,
and as one cannot really foresee the events of the next few
months, and bearing in mind the precedent that was
observed in the House of Commons this morning when
tribute was paid to Mr. Speaker Lamoureux, I should like
to say how much we all regret the absence of Mr. Speaker
Deschatelets because of his accident. But I should like,
notwithstanding that, to say how much all of us in the
Senate appreciate the way that he bas, since the spring of
1968, presided over the affairs in this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Speaker Deschatelets has been a distinguished Speaker, full of integrity and impartiality,
imperturbable in the decisions that he had to make. He is
a gentleman of the highest order. Those who have served
with him in government know him to be a man of great
character, and we value his friendship. And, so, when he
comes to read these words in Hansard I am sure that he
will know that I speak not only for myself, or for those of
us on the government side, but for all.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We respect his contribution and are
grateful for the manner in which he bas helped to direct
our affairs.
[Translation]
I feel I should thank the Speaker of the Senate for his
good services and offices during his term of office. Senator Deschatelets bas always proved worthy of his post,
full of integrity and always impartial. As I said when he
took his oath of office, Senator Deschatelets is a great
Canadian, most worthy of the office of Speaker of the
Senate.

Hon. Mr. Denis: It is not over yet.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I heard Senator Denis say it is not over
yet. Of course it is not over, and I do not wish this session
to end but I have no control over the way it will end or
how it will endHon. Mr. McDonald: Or when.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Or when. But I do not wish it to end
without taking the opportunity of paying this tribute to
our Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I should like to say to the Acting
Leader of the Opposition how much we appreciate the
co-operation we have had from the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues. I am grateful to them for that.
I wish to thank the Hansard reporters, and the pages,
both boys and girls. I believe that the Senate is the first
institution of its kind to introduce girl pages into a deliberative assembly. The credit for that goes to Senator
Fergusson. I wish also to thank all of the cleaning staff,

and everyone who works for the Senate, for their loyalty
to it.
As we bring to an end this session of the Senate and
after much effort, I think we can say, notwithstanding
what others may think, that the Senate does perform a
useful service in the parliamentary life of our country.

Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I am very
proud indeed to join with my good friend, the Leader of
the Government, in praising the high qualities of our
Speaker, Senator Deschatelets. He has discharged his
obligations with dignity in this chamber, overseas, in the
United States, and everywhere in Canada outside this
chamber. I recall that in 1958-on January 31 to be
exact-when I was appointed to the Senate the Speaker
was Senator Marc Drouin, who presided with as much
dignity as the Speaker pro tem, Senator J. M. Macdonald.
Each time Senator Marc Drouin was absent I was called
upon to replace him. On one occasion he went to Brussels-I think it was in 1959-for a period of supposedly
one week. He sent me a wire saying: "Lionel, keep up the
good work; I know you will do it better than I would." I
met Senator Haig at the elevator and said, "Senator Haig,
I hear that Marc Drouin will not be absent one week, but
three weeks." He replied, "What do we care; that little
French senator from Ottawa East is doing a good job."
Hon. Mr. Martin: He made a mistake in the use of the
word "little."
a (1640)

Hon. Mr. Choquette: I knew then that it was a genuine
and sincere compliment, because he was expressing it to
someone whom he did not happen to recognize at the
time.
As the leader has said, we extend our best wishes to our
present Speaker. I cannot say that I hope he will occupy
the chair after the next election, but I can say that he is
well liked. He has discharged his obligations with dignity,
and let us hope that whoever might succeed him will
discharge his duties with as much dignity and affability as
Senator Deschatelets has shown during his tenure.
[Translation]

Hon. Azellus Denis: Allow me to add a few words to tell
you that I think we have forgotten those who substituted
for honourable Senator Deschatelets-that is, honourable
Senator Maurice Bourget, and our present Speaker, Senator Macdonald, who although he has filled this office for
the first time, has acted like a master and expert. I congratulate him on behalf of all of us. I hope he will be going
fishing, but I do not want him to come back and tell us
that he missed the biggest fish.
If you stay home, I hope you will help your wife and
children paint, and mow the lawn, and that your wife will
be able to tell us, "When I was taking the garbage out, he
was holding my arm."
May all have a nice holiday!

THE LATE SENATOR LÉON MÉTHOT

TRIBUTES
[Translation]
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, if the Senate
takes a holiday from time to time, as it should, it is a
truism that death never takes any.
On August 6 last, our colleague the Honourable Léon
Méthot died at his home in Baie Jolie, a suburb of TroisRivières, his small birthplace to which he was deeply
devoted.
As we all know, his health had been noticeably failing
for a few years, especially since the death in January last
of his wife, his constant companion on whom he had
always greatly relied.
Senator Méthot was a member of the first group of
senators appointed by the Right Honourable John Diefenbaker. That was in October 1957. Our colleague therefore
sat with us almost fifteen years, as long as his health
allowed him to do so. He was very active in the Senate and
on various committees, and in particular as a member of
the Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
His appointment to the Senate crowned a brilliant
career with the Quebec Bar into whose ranks he was
admitted in 1919. While practising law, Léon Méthot
showed a special interest in federal politics. I believe I am
right in saying that he took part in every election campaign in the last fifty years, that he attended as a delegate
all the conventions of the party from that held in Winnipeg at which R. B. Bennett was elected in 1929, and that
on two occasions he was a candidate for the riding of
Trois-Rivières.
His five children, two boys and three girls, who are all
personal friends, lose a beloved father.
His funeral in the Trois-Rivières cathedral which was
attended by a great number of relatives and friends bears
testimony to the love and esteern which our colleague
enjoyed.
On behalf of the official Opposition, I wish to assure the
family of Senator Méthot of our deep sympathy.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, it is with much
regret that we learned, last month, of the death of our
friend and colleague, Senator Méthot.
One of our most faithful colleagues, he has always supported his party and extended, I am sure, to his leader in
this chamber, the honourable Leader of the Opposition,
his sober and constant co-operation. Senator Méthot was

a passionate supporter of his party. He was appointed to
the Senate almost 15 years ago. The Leader of the Opposition has, today, paid tribute to his career in the legal
profession and detailed Senator Méthot's contribution to
politics in Canada and particularly in Trois-Rivières,
during the last 50 years.
There is very little I could add after so many tributes.
Senator Méthot was a man of great distinction and, as
everyone knows, a man of integrity. He will be mourned
by all his fellow citizens and his colleagues in the Senate.
On behalf of honourable senators and in my own name,
I wish to express our deep feeling of regret and extend to
his children, to members of his family as well as to the
Leader of the Opposition, our most sincere condolences.

972SENATE DEBATES

WEST COAST PORTS OPERATIONS BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-231, to provide for the resumption and continuation
of longshoring and grain handling operations and operations related to longshoring or grain handling at ports on
the west coast of Canada.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING
the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
The Hon.
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, with leave of
the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 44(1)(f), I move that
this bill be read the second time now.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it
agreed?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There is no objection.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, in rising to propose second reading of this bill, I am sure that we all
recognize that we meet today under extraordinary circumstances. It is rare for Parliament to be assembled in
emergency session. It follows, therefore, that the decision
to seek the recall of Parliament was precipitated by the
most pressing of circumstances.
The interruption of operations at docks on the west
coast has created an emergency situation in Canada and a
serious situation in our grain markets abroad. Because of
these special circumstances the government decided that
the economic hardship to Canada of a prolongation of the
strike was such as to warrant prompt remedial action by
Parliament.
We are all sensitive of, and sympathetic to, the right of
unions and employers to exercise their legal rights
through the collective bargaining process. But the situation on the west coast is one in which the economic stakes
are so great that the work stoppage constitutes a threat to
the national interest.
It is important that our Asian customers, most notably
the Soviet Union, China, and Japan, do not lose confidence in our ability to fill their orders for our products. If
they do so, they will be inclined, naturally, to seek more
secure sources of supply elsewhere. As a matter of fact,
we are already 30 million bushels behind schedule in our
shipments because of the existing situation on the west
coast. As matters stand, shipping this backlog is going to
be a backbreaking and expensive task. However, if we
permit the situation to drag on longer the task of catching
up will become insurmountable.
Our ability to provide our customers with wheat and
other grains, potash, lumber and manufactured products,
such as are shipped regularly from the west coast, plays a
not insignificant role in our foreign policy and particularly in the objectives of our foreign policy. This is what the
Prime Minister meant when before Parliament was
recalled he observed, "This Government does not intend
to permit the benefit gained by all Canadians from its

international efforts to be dissipated by a prolonged closing of the ports."
The importance of trade in the development of bilateral
relations with foreign countries is a well-worn, but
nonetheless a valid, theme. I would suggest, therefore,
that although the situation on the west coast presents
primarily a grave economic threat it also jeopardizes to
some degree our interest in certain aspects of international affairs.
I would like to explain the circumstances which gave
rise to the situation on the west coast. Put briefly the
problem is twofold, involving separate disputes affecting
both the normal functioning of the docks as well as that of
grain handling. The last collective agreement made
between the British Columbia Maritime Employers' Association, which represents some 61 companies, and the
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's
Union representing 3,300 men, expired on July 31 this
year. The agreement covered longshoring operations at
Vancouver, New Westminster, Chemainus, Port Alberni,
Victoria and Prince Rupert. The Department of Labour
has been assisting in negotiations for a new agreement
since early in June. Direct negotiations had taken place
between the parties on five separate occasions since May,
but no agreement had been reached by June 7, when the
union requested the appointment of a conciliation officer.
Two officials of the Department of Labour stationed on
the west coast were appointed as a result of this request,
but they were unsuccessful in securing an agreement.
These officers recommended in their report that a conciliation board should be appointed.
The conciliation board which the Minister of Labour
appointed on July 24 was chaired by Dr. Noel Hall. This
board met with the parties on at least three occasions, late
in July, reporting to the minister on July 31. The unanimous report stated that the board could serve no useful
purpose because the union was not inclined to support
third party efforts, insisting instead on the continuation of
direct talks with the employers.
Under the provisions of the Canada Labour Code, the
parties were legally entitled to conduct respectively a
strike or a lockout commencing at midnight on Monday,
August 7. On August 6 the port of Vancouver was closed
as the result of a separate dispute involving the dispatch
of longshoremen.
0 (1410)

The Department of Labour, at the level of Assistant
Deputy Minister, again sought, at the instance of the minister, to avert a stoppage of work, and Dr. Hall, as Chairman of the conciliation board, renewed his efforts. These
efforts encompassed attempts to secure union agreement
to load the grain on a voluntary and temporary basis
through the National Harbours Board. The union had
agreed to this procedure in 1969, but now it desired a
permanent collective agreement, either with the board or
another agency of the government, an agreement which
would replace their previous contract with the British
Columbia Maritime Employers' Association.
The ramifications of this suggestion were far-reaching
and their implications would have required a thorough
and extended review, which could not possibly have been
undertaken in the time available. It was, therefore, not

SENATE DEBATES
possible for the government to accept this suggestion put
forward by the union.
On August 10 and 11, the membership of the union was
polled, the results of which authorized the union executive
to take strike action. The efforts of the Department of
Labour being to no avail, the other west coast ports were
struck on August 23. The next day the Minister of Labour
met with the parties in Vancouver. No negotiations were
then in progress. However, he did persuade them to
reopen talks the next day. The parties, however, made it
clear that they did not wish the assistance of the minister's department at these talks. Regrettably, no early
agreement was forthcoming. In view of this, and because
the national interest was involved, the government decided earlier this week that parliamentary action was essential. It was the only other option open to the government. I
think that there has been universal approval of the government's decision to seek the recall of Parliament.
The other problem involves the handling of grain by
five companies in Vancouver. In this case the most recent
collective agreement expired at the end of November last
year.
Honourable senators, the bill before us provides in Part
I that longshoring operations shall be recommenced the
day after enactment of this bill and that the parties shall
continue their bargaining in an effort to reach agreement.
The agreement which expired on July 31 is extended to
December 31 of this year, or until such time as the parties
agree to a new contract, whichever is the earlier.
Part II of the bill applies similar terms to the grain
handling situation. However, these terms are only to
become effective on proclamation, and it is hoped that
this will not prove to be necessary.
This is so because since the expiration of the grain
handlers' agreement negotiations and conciliation board
procedures have been actively pursued. The conciliation
report was presented to the minister on August 16, and,
although a strike or lockout could have legally commenced at midnight on August 23, the union accepted the
report, subject to certain clarifications; and the employers, although opposed to the recommendations, have not
yet resorted to a lockout. We earnestly hope that the
parties can reach an agreement very soon. However, it is
essential that we safeguard the situation. For this reason,
Part II of the bill has been included, but we trust that its
proclamation will not prove to be necessary.
Part III of the bill provides for mediation procedures
under both Parts I and II. Mediation under Part II of the
bill will not, of course, become necessary unless Part II is
proclaimed.
The mediation procedures set forth in the bill provide
that the Governor in Council may appoint a mediator to
conduct mediation during that period of time during
which Part I, and if necessary Part II, is in force; that is to
say, until December 31 of this year. The mediator will
report under the terms of the bill to the Minister of
Labour as to the progress he is achieving. The mediator
will have all the powers conferred on a conciliation board
by sections 139 and 140 of the Canada Labour Code.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

_September 1, 1972

Since the introduction of this bill in the other place, the
government has accepted an amendment to clause 7,
which relates to Part I, by adding the following subclause:
Notwithstanding section 5, the terms and conditions
of any collective agreement entered into in amendment or revision of the collective agreement to which
this Part applies shall, unless the parties thereto
otherwise agree, have effect on and from August 1,
1972.
This is providing for retroactivity in respect of matters
that may be agreed on as a result of the negotiations
which will take place between now and December 31 next.
It may well be that the parties themselves will, as a result
of these negotiations, agree to see that benefits and rights
and the terms of agreement entered into will be retroactive, and that they will be part of the agreement itself. In
other words, the government proposes that a new collective agreement between the employers and the union shall
take effect as from the expiration of the last collective
agreement.
The bill will come into force on the day immediately
following its enactment.
As I said at the beginning, no one likes to resort to these
measures. The national interest, however, must come
first. Our national interest is involved. Therefore, the government had to interfere, through this measure, with the
normal collective bargaining process, and I have no hesitation, for these reasons, in commending the bill to the
Senate.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I hope that
this is truly the last day of this Twenty-eighth Parliament.
We thought it would be some time last April, when we
were pushed into adopting amendments to the old age
pension legislation under the threat that the senior citizens of this country would not receive the $10 retroactive
payment provided in the bill if it were not passed before a
certain date. We thought there would be dissolution of
Parliament during the Easter recess. Then on July 7 last,
when we had to pass legislation to provide for the reopening of the Quebec ports of Montreal, Three Rivers and
Quebec, we were sure that the adjournment to October of
this year was simply to provide time for the government
to make up its mind and decide when the people of this
country would pass judgment on the administration that
we have had since 1968.
a (1420)

Now we are back, but not for an emergency session. We
are here to deal with a matter of urgency, but this is a
resumption of the present session. I must correct the
government leader in this respect-although it is really
only a technical error. We are back, although some three
or four days ago the Prime Minister was saying something
like, "I am not going to interfere. The government is not
going to interfere. The government should not do anything. There is nothing serious or important enough, in
the situation on the west coast, to justify recalling
Parliament."
That was the position taken recently by the Prime Minister. It was also the position taken by the Minister of
Labour. It is really ironic to compare the situation in
which we find ourselves today with the one in which we
found ourselves when we adjourned on July 7 until Octo-

SeDtember 1. 1972

ber 3, fully expecting that the next time we met it would
be as part of the Twenty-ninth Parliament.
As I said, I hope that this is the last day of this Parliament. I hope a great change will be evident in the new
Parliament when it convenes. It is obvious that there will
be some change here in the Senate chamber, but I hope
that it will be not only on the walls, that not only will the
paintings be refreshed but that there will be new faces,
that there will be a change of sides.
The country is entirely fed up with the way this government is handling the business of the country. It is forever
trying to defend simultaneously both sides of the same
question. This is a fact, and it is obvious. The Leader of
the Government himself has just said, "We do not like to
intervene, but we have to do so." Well, if you have to, you
should enjoy doing it; if it is your duty, you should not be
afraid to do it. Why hide? What is the matter with this
government? It is always presenting us with bills, saying
"We do not like to do this, but we have to do it." Come
clean, and tell us frankly where you stand in these
matters.
Last July this government presented us with a bill inviting the people to obey the law. This was something I had
never seen before. That was an illegal strike which the
government had allowed to continue for over 50 days, if
my memory serves me correctly. At that time the government would not apply the Canada Labour Code. It had
some instruments to deal with the situation, but it would
not use them. Now we have this legal strike and after
three weeks, and just a few days after telling us it was not
a matter for reconvening Parliament, the government tells
us it should have acted before. In fact, this is what the
government leader said, that it should have acted before.
He tells us now that the damage to the economy is extensive. In other words, he admits that the government is
guilty of having acted too late, of being late in bringing in
this legislation.
I think we can all agree that it was quite obvious some
time ago that, if the west coast ports were closed, it would
do a lot of damage to the credit of Canada, especially in
the grain trade. That was very obvious. But when did the
government discover that? Not two days ago; not three
days ago, or four days ago. Surely the government must
have known this when the strike started some three weeks
ago. But the government said, "Oh, no, we don't want to
intervene. We should not intervene, because the strike is
legal."
Now, realizing that it is cornered by economic factors,
the government has to act. But the government's action is
also motivated by an electoral factor as well. Quite obviously the government cannot dissolve Parliament and call
an election with a strike of this type on its hands. Perhaps
it thought it could make political hay by recalling Parliament just one day before the British Columbia election.
Even so, it was late again in that instance. That is obvious
because the Liberal Party in British Columbia, although it
maintained its position in the legislature, lost in the popular vote. In any event, I think that influencing the British
Columbia election was only secondary in the mind of the
Prime Minister. What the government or the Prime Minister had foremost in mind was the coming federal election.

DEBATES62

621

There is no machinery in the Canadian legislative process for dealing with a situation of the kind facing us now.
There should be, but there is not.
It is rather amusing to recall that in the last days before
we adjourned on July 7 we passed some amendments to
the Canada Labour Code by which we tried to provide
some machinery to deal with emergencies arising after
the dissolution of Parliament. The "machinery" I am
referring to is contained in sections 179 and following of
Bill C-183. That machinery would not, in my opinion, be
adequate to deal with the present situation. However,
even if it were, the fact of the matter is that Bill C-183 has
not yet been proclaimed. Why? The government asked
Parliament to adopt this legislation, but when Parliament
approved the legislation the government did not proclaim
it. Why? I am not saying that in the present case the
provisions in Bill C-183 would be of any use. It is too
complicated for me to give an opinion on the spot. After
all, we were given Bill C-231 only yesterday. So I am not
going to argue the adequacy or inadequacy of the provisions of Bill C-183. But it appears to me that they would
be inadequate in the present circumstances. Of course, for
all I know, I may be wrong, but it certainly seems to me to
be a strange thing that the government would have legislation passed by Parliament and then not proclaim it, and,
by so delaying, be faced with serious problems. It may
well be that tomorrow we will be faced with another
problem, another strike. I am not referring to the problem
we are dealing with today, because we will be through
with that shortly, but in two weeks' time, for example,
there may still be another strike. I am thinking, for
instance, of the postal employees.
In these amendments to the Canada Labour Code in Bill
C-183, clause 180 provides:
180. (1) No employer shall declare or cause a lockout
and no trade union shall declare or authorize a strike
unless ...
(c) the Minister has
(i) received a notice .. . or
(d) seven days have elapsed from the date on which
the Minister
(i) notified the parties of his intention not to appoint
a conciliation officer or conciliation commissioner
or to establish a conciliation board under subsection
164(1),
(ii) notified the parties of his intention not to appoint
a conciliation commissioner or to establish a conciliation board under section 166, or
(iii) received the report of a conciliation commissioner or conciliation board pursuant to section 168.
0

(1430)

Therefore, the beginning of a strike could be delayed
until after the minister had appointed a conciliation commissioner or a conciliation board, and had received the
resulting report. What is interesting with respect to the
point I have just made is that section 181 makes it possible
for the minister to deal with a problem of that type if it
should arise after Parliament had been dissolved. This
section reads as follows:

SENATE DEBATES

181.(1) Where
(a) a strike or lockout that would not be prohibited by
this Part may occur during a period commencing on
the date of a dissolution of Parliament and ending on
the date fixed for the return to the writs at the general
election of members to serve in the House of Commons next following that dissolution of Parliament,
and
(b) the strike or lockout would, in the opinion of the
Governor in Council, adversely affect the national
interest if it occurred,
the Governor in Council may, at any time during the
period referred to in paragraph (a), order that the
period of seven days referred to in paragraph 180
(1)(d) shall elapse upon the expiration of the seventh
day following the end of the period referred to in
paragraph (a).
That is seven days after the return of the writs.
Therefore, honourable senators, we have here the
machinery to provide for the declaration of a strike to be
illegal between the date that Parliament is dissolved and
the date seven days after the return of the writs.
Of course, this does not apply if the strike should start
before dissolution of Parliament, and that is where I find
fault with this legislation now that I have considered it in
the light of the present problem. That also is why I suggested that this is not a solution. But there is a partial
solution which the government apparently is afraid to use.
I say that because this act received royal assent on July 7,
and it has not yet been proclaimed. If it had been proclaimed on July 7 it could have been used to deal with a
problem of the type we are facing at this time, or might
face during dissolution. I cannot understand why the government hesitated, and continues to hesitate. It has
recalled Parliament, but it wants to avoid the responsibility of making a decision which may be contrary to the
principle which it has always defended by saying, "We are
in favour of free labour bargaining and free negotiations,
and we don't want to intervene because the right to strike
is sacred," and so on and so forth. The right to strike is
sacred, but my experience in Parliament has always been
that when this right hurts the public interest, then the
government has no choice but to act, as it is doing in the
present situation, by bringing in legislation to deal with
the particular problem or to set out general guidelines
which would certainly help the parties in dispute to know
where they are going and what they may be faced with.
All honourable senators are aware of the reaction of
both parties involved in the situation on the west coast.
They just do not understand what happened or why.
Nobody warned them that the government was prepared
to recall Parliament. They were negotiating in good faith,
and in the hope of being able to settle this dispute. The
Minister of Labour told them that the government could
not afford to have the negotiations delayed more than,
say, a week. Then he came back to Ottawa and made a
report, and just two days after the Prime Minister had
said that the government was not going to intervene in the
matter he changed his mind, made an about-face, recalled
Parliament, and said, "We are going to settle the strike
with special legislation." In my view, in acting as it has the
government has shown lack of courage, and is indulging
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

September 1, 1972

in mere opportunism. In fact it resembles very much the
situation with which we were faced last July.
Nevertheless, honourable senators, we are going to support the bill. We are going to vote for it on second reading,
and we are not even going to ask to have it referred to
committee because there is no point in doing so. It is
necessary to end this strike as soon as possible, so it is
desirable that this bill should receive royal assent today,
thus giving the Prime Minister a chance to dissolve Parliament tonight before eight o'clock. Apparently that is the
deadline in view of the situation facing the Chief Electoral
Officer if an election is to be called for October 30. I do
not think it matters whether the election is held on October 30 or November 6. What matters is that the Canadian
public is entirely fed up with this hesitation on the part of
the government, its difficulty in deciding on an election
date. The people of Canada are also fed up with the way
the government deals with such serious matters as the one
covered by this special bill, and other special bills such as
the one passed last July.
Having said that, honourable senators, I do not need to
go into the details of the bill since it is a very simple piece
of legislation. It simply tells management and labour to
resume operations until December 31. By that time, of
course, we shall have a new Parliament, and if the problem has not been solved at that time it will be up to this
government, if it is returned to power, to present another
special bill. But if there is a new government in power and
if the problem is still there, then I hope that new government will have a new approach to such situations, an
approach that will be to the benefit of the people of
Canada.
Hon. Edward C. Lawson: Honourable senators, I shall
be brief in my remarks. At the outset I feel I must reveal
what on the surface might appear to be a conflict of
interest.
Recently there has been some speculation in the press
concerning the merger of some trade unions with the
trade union I represent outside this chamber, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. One of the mergers
about which there has been speculation involves the
National Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union,
which I notice is mentioned on page 2 of the bill. The
other suggested merger with my union is that of the
International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal,
Soft Drink and Distillery Workers of America, which
represents the grain workers. That is why I say that at the
outset I must reveal what appears to be an apparent
conflict of interest, while assuring honourable senators
that it is extremely tempting for me to hide behind this
apparent conflict of interest and to disqualify myself from
taking any position on this legislation. But these mergers
are tentative and a long way down the road, so that any
position I take today will in no way be influenced by any
relationship that may or may not be formed in the future.

I think it is with extreme caution that this type of
legislation should be introduced. In British Columbia we
have had legislation of this type for some time which gives
to the government and, as a matter of fact, to the cabinet
the right to send workers back to work, to end legal
strikes without any basis for appeal, even if there is a

SeDtember 1. 1972
Sentember 1. 1972

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

concern for the public interest. For many years the workers of British Columbia have strived to replace this legislation, to have it changed, to have it abolished, and they
have been consistently unsuccessful in achieving that.
That, along with other factors, seemed to force the decision on the people of British Columbia to decide that if
you could not change the legislation you would have to
change the government, and they decided to do that the
other day.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I mention this merely as an object
lesson as to why we should be very cautious about the use
of this type of legislation. I can tell you that it is rather
ironic for an Independent B.C. boy to be standing at the
seat of the former Social Credit Premier of Alberta (Hon.
Mr. Manning).
If legislation such as this is to be adopted, it must be
adopted with extreme caution. It seems to me' there is a
need for some basic criteria to be applied. We should be
asking ourselves: Is it in the national interest? Is it causing an economie hardship on the people directly involved?
Is it causing economic hardship on the communities
where this is happening, the communities supplied
through the port of Vancouver? Also we need to ask
ourselves: Is it causing economic hardship in other provinces? Is it causing any kind of threat or economic hardship on the nation as a whole? I think we have to ask
ourselves: Will the continuance of this dispute affect the
nation's reputation in world trade, our ability to deliver on
contractual commitments? If we fail to honour these commitments and carry out the supplies, can our competitors
make deliveries? Are there other competitors? If we
examine all of these matters, and if the majority or all of
the answers are in the affirmative, then it really leaves no
choice but to come forward with this kind of legislation.
It is not an easy thing for me, as a trade unionist totally
committed to free collective bargaining, and the right to
free collective bargaining, the right to proceed without
outside intervention, to have to come here and deal with a
bill such as this. I am close to the situation, I know it and I
understand it. I know the views of many of the longshoremen involved. I know the views of the many hundreds of
grain workers who have become unemployed as a result
of it. I know the views of many of the communities in
British Columbia that are directly affected. I know the
views of the other provinces which are affected. The
combination of all that evidence compels me to come here
today and join in supporting the legislation. I will vote in
the affirmative.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. H. McDonald: Honourable senators, I do not rise
to enter into the discussion on the particulars of this bill,
but after listening to Senator Lawson I want to say that I,
for one, would be highly delighted if we had more leaders
in labour unions and management with his understanding. If that were so, this would be a better country for all
of us to live in.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Senator Lawson has expressed the
attitude of many people in British Columbia concernin'g
this particular strike, and I think it is only fitting for

someone from the Prairies to express the appreciation of
the Prairie farmer for the action that Parliament is taking
here today.
As Senator Martin indicated in his remarks, we are
about 30 million bushels short in our deliveries to date
through the port of Vancouver. Thirty million bushels is a
tremendous amount of grain, especially when you are
striving to reach an export target of at least 800 million
bushels over the crop year. It is most difficult to pick up
these lost deliveries. I can assure the bouse that all citizens in the Prairie provinces are delighted to see Parliament take the action it is taking today, to see that one of
the main exports of this nation is to be made available to
the import markets of the world. I want to express
appreciation on behalf of the Prairie people for the action
of the government, and the support which Parliament has
given it. I do not know whether we can meet all the
requests of Senator Flynn, but perhaps we will have the
opportunity to make that decision even sooner than he
thinks.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: With leave, now.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Thank you. I bow to the Leader of the
Opposition.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Leader of the
OppositionSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Your Honour, I have no objection if the
record shows that the Leader of the Opposition gives
leave to proceed, but I would not move third reading of
the bill.
The Hon. the Speaker: Since we are about to come to the
end of the session, I might say to the Leader of the
Opposition that I have called his bluff.
It is moved by the honourable Senator Martin, seconded
by the honourable Senator McDonald, that this bill be
now read the third time. Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that he had
received the following communication:

Sir,

I have the honour to inform you that the Honourable Emmett M. Hall, Puisne Judge of the Supreme

Court of Canada, in his capacity as Deputy Governor
General, will proceed to the Senate Chamber at 4.45
p.m. today, the lst day of September, for the purpose
of giving Royal Assent to a Bill and proroguing the
Fourth Session of the Twenty-eighth Parliament of
Canada.
I have the Honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
André Garneau
Colonel
Administrative Secretary
to the Governor General.
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, before moving
that the Senate adjourn during pleasure, I should like to
remind His Honour the Speaker that when we concluded
our sittings in July, the Leader of the Opposition and I
and other senators expressed in his absence our appreciation for the dignified and capable manner in which he has
presided over our affairs. I simply wish to call his attention to that fact.
[Translation]
All of us appreciate the manner in which you have
presided over the Senate.
[English]
Honourable senators, I wish to observe to the Leader of
the Opposition that I do not know when we will return. He
has given the Government some advice today, of which I
will inform the Prime Minister. It could be that the Prime
Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have been
thinking along the same lines. I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: For once.
Hon. Mr. Martin: In any event, I wish to remark to the
Leader of the Opposition that I hope that during the next
two months he will comport himself as a good Leader of
the Opposition in the Senate. I say this, of course, facetiously. I wish Senator Flynn and all senators a happy
period in the next several months.
Honourable senators, I move that we adjourn to await
the call of the bell at some time between four o'clock and
a quarter to five.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I speak to the motion?
An Hon. Senator: With leave.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is not a motion to adjourn the
Senate but to adjourn until later this day, and it is
debatable.
[Translation]
I should merely like to add a few words as regards the
Speaker. We too wish to congratulate him on the fashion
in which he presided over the debates of the Senate.
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

There is a touch of nostalgia in speaking of this as if it
were the last day on which you sit in this chair. Still, it
would seem to be so this time. The same feelings were
expressed in previous circumstances but, today, it seems
clear that the die is cast. Be that as it may, we will keep
the very best recollection of the way in which you fulfilled
your duties, and we will see you helping over there, and
more probably on this side, the Leader of the Opposition
of the day. I do not know whether it will be Senator
Martin, because I can hardly see him as Leader of the
Opposition.
I saw him in the opposition at the other place-that was
another matter-where he spoke to us about soya beans
and other matters of which he knew nothing, but he spoke
which such glibness and confidence that it was really a
pleasure to listen to him.
But, in any event, I obviously accept the suggestion
made by the Leader of the Government that I continue as
Leader of the Opposition until the new parliament is
convened. I have no choice in the matter. I hope that it
will be someone else-and I say this with kindness and
without bitterness-who will occupy the seat that he now
has, because he has certainly deserved a rest after working so hard in support of such bad causes.
[English]
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I should
like to express my appreciation and thanks to both leaders, who have spoken on your behalf. However, I must
inform you immediately that the speeches they delivered
on July 7 when, unfortunately, I had a leg in a cast, are
already framed in my office.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 4.30 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
