OFFICIAL REPORT

THE SENATE
Tuesday, January 8, 1957
OPENING OF FIFTH SESSION
PARLIAMENT

TWENTY-SECOND
Parliament

having

been

summoned

by

Proclamation of the Governor General to meet
this day for the dispatch of business:
The Senate met at 2.15 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
COMMUNICATION FROM GOVERNOR
GENERAL'S SECRETARY
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I have received the following communication:
GOVERNMENT HOUSE
Ottawa
December 20, 1956
Sir,
I have the honour to inform you that His
Excellency the Governor General will arrive at the
main entrance of the Houses of Parliament at 2.30
p.m., on Tuesday the 8th January, 1957, and, when
it has been signified that all is in readiness, will
proceed to the Senate Chamber to open formally
the Fifth Session of the Twenty-Second Parliament
of Canada.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Lionel Massey,
Secretary to the Governor General
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa.

The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At 2.30 p.m. His Excellency the Governor
General proceeded to the Senate chamber
and took his seat upon the Throne. His
Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and,
that House being come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the Fifth
Session of the Twenty-Second Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
It is again a pleasure for me to greet you
as you resume your parliamentary duties in
this New Year.
82719-1

The international scene continues to be
characterized by instability in the Middle
East and in Eastern Europe.
My ministers remain convinced of the need
to maintain the basic unity of the Commonwealth and the reality of the Western
Alliance, to contribute effectively to the
supervision of the cessation of hostilities
between Israel and Egypt under the authority
of the United Nations and to the achievement
of a lasting settlement of Middle East
problems.
Visits to Canada in the last few weeks by
the Prime Ministers of Ceylon and India have
been conducive to a renewed strengthening
of the bonds which unite the peoples of the
Commonwealth in their constant aim to
co-operate in the pursuit of peace, liberty
and progress.
An encouraging advance is being made, as
evidenced by the latest Ministerial Meeting
of the Council, in the development of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the
non-military as well as in the military field.
My ministers remain strongly convinced of
the need to maintain the North Atlantic
Treaty as the keystone of the defence of the
Western nations.
In the Middle East Canadian servicemen,
as part of the United Nations Emergency
Force proposed by Canada at the General
Assembly of the United Nations, are performing valuable tasks in the interest of world
peace.
The United Nations has served to focus
world opinion on the brutal repression of the
heroic Hungarian people in their endeavour
to throw off the yoke of Soviet imperialism.
The vast humanitarian problems that have
arisen as a result of Soviet intervention
require the joint efforts of many countries.
Through the United Nations, the Red Cross,
and in co-operation with the Government of
Austria, this country is playing its part in
relieving suffering and resettling the refugees.
The entrance into Canada of Hungarian
refugees has been greatly facilitated and free
transportation provided from Austria to new
homes in this country. Already thousands of
these Hungarians have been welcomed to
Canada and we look forward to receiving
thousands more during the winter and spring.

SENATE

There are also substantially increasing numbers of immigrants from the British Isles
arranging to proceed to Canada this year.
Recent events have confirmed my ministers'
belief in the importance of seeking solutions
to international problems through the United
Nations and of upholding by all practical
and constructive means the principles of the
United Nations Charter. My ministers also
believe, however, that while making every
effort to achieve these long-term goals, the
Western nations must remain strong and
united in their defences and in their diplomacy in order that aggressive action against
them will be prevented and international
tension can be lessened.
Excellent progress is being made in our
national economie development. Expansion
is evident in every part of Canada. Rapid
strides are being made in opening up and
utilizing our natural resources and in our
industrial and urban growth. Employment
has reached unprecedented levels.
Once
again we have been blessed with good crops.
External trade was considerably greater
last year than during any previous year.
Canadians in almost every part of the
country have been enjoying the benefits of
this invigorating economic climate.
Indeed our economic expansion has been
so rapid that it has put a serious strain upon
the supply of various types of labour and
materials needed for the many projects
which are being put in hand. The corresponding competition to borrow savings to
finance all these projects has brought about
an increase in interest rates. Increases in
the volume of money and credit have had
to be carefully limited in order to check
inflationary tendencies and the financial
policies of my Government have also been
directed to counteract these same tendencies.
In the last few days a serious industrial
dispute has led to a stoppage of work on one
of the major railways of Canada despite the
use of the normal processes of conciliation.
Special efforts have been made and are continuing to be made by my ministers to
assist the parties to reach an agreed
settlement.
The preliminary report of the Royal
Commission on Economic Prospects has been
received and will shortly be laid before you.
You will be asked to approve a measure
for the establishment of a Canada Council
for the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences,
in order to give a new impetus to the development of Canadian scholarship and culture.
In this measure you will be asked to approve
an endowment for the council so that it may
discharge its functions with the greatest possible sense of responsibility.

Because it is important that our universities should be able to keep pace with the
increasing demands to be made upon them by
the increasing number of young Canadians,
you will be asked to approve a further grant
of money to the Canada Council to be distributed by it for the purpose of assisting
Canadian universities in some of their necessary construction projects. You will also be
asked to approve the doubling of the annual
grants to universities, and the payment of
these funds to the National Conference of
Canadian Universities for division by it
among the recognized institutions of higher
learning.
A measure will be placed before you for
the purpose of renewing on a revised and
increased basis the federal program of grants
to provincial governments in aid of technical and vocational training.
It is proposed to recommend in the Senate
the establishment of a committee to consider
what should be done to make better use of
land for agriculture and thus to contribute
more effectively to the improvement of agricultural production and the incomes of those
engaged in it.
An amendment extending the scope of the
Municipal Grants Act will be laid before
you to authorize the payment of grants in
lieu of taxes on federal property in all
municipalities where such property receives
the normal municipal services.
An amendment to the Merchant Seamen
Compensation Act will be presented making
appropriate improvements in the scale of
benefits to disabled seamen and the dependants of deceased seamen.
You will be asked to consider legislation
for the implementation of a North Pacifie
Fur Seal Convention.
An amendment to the Sockeye Salmon
Convention Act to include pink salmon in
this international agreement will also be
laid before you.
You will be asked to consider a revision of
the law controlling narcotic drugs in the
light of the report of the Senate committee
on the use of narcoties in Canada.
A bill will be introduced for the purpose of
continuing the Canadian Wheat Board as the
sole marketing agency for western wheat,
oats and barley.
A measure wil be laid before you to provide
for the division of the National Museum of
Canada into two museums to be known as
the Canadian Museum of Natural History and
the Canadian Museum of Human History.
A revision of the Federal District
Commission Act will be presented for your
consideration.
Amendments of detail to a number of other
acts will also be introduced.

JANUARY 8, 1957

Members of the house of Commons,
You will be asked to appropriate the funds
required to maintain the services and payments provided under the authority of
Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,

The House of Commons withdrew.
His Excellency the Governor General was
pleased to retire.
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.

Hon.

Arthur

W.

Roebuck:

Honourable

senators, I would hike to cail attention to
sornething which has been going on for a
long time and which I think should be corrected. I have been a member of this house
since 1945, and on every occasion when we
have had an opening of Parliament the
representative of the Crown has been obliged
to commence his speech while there was an
unseernly row at the rear of the chamber.
The Black Rod in his unequalled musical
tones caîls "'Order", and that notice cornes to
those who sit on the floor of the house, but
it does not reach the persons behind the bar;
and so the row continues, more hike a Donnybrook Fair than the august decorurn o! the
Senate of Canada.
I suppose that unless sornebody brings this
to the attention of the proper authorities it
wilh continue indefinitehy. Nothing very much

SENATE
is required to be done. If the officers of the
house would even echo the call for order
I think it would suffice. The persons in the
lobby do not desire to be disorderly or
uncomplimentary to Her Majesty's representative; they simply do not know that
the proceedings are under way, and so the
noise continues, making it almost impossible
to hear what is being said and requiring the
representative of the Crown to speak at the
.op of his voice to be heard at all.
If it meets with the approval of my fellow
members I suggest that steps be taken-I
do not care what they are, so long as they
achieve results-to assure that a proper decorum is observed in this house when the
Governor General commences the Speech
from the Throne. I think all that is required
is to have the officers out in the hall listen
until the Black Rod calls for order, and then
repeat the call so that the people there may
have notice that the proceedings are about
to begin. They will then quieten down as
rapidly as we do in the chamber. This is
a small matter, but, as I have said, I suppose
somebody must bring it to the attention of
the authorities or it will go on indefinitely.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I concur in the remarks made by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck). If we could accomplish what
he has suggested, it would add to the dignity
of the Senate and of Parliament as a whole.
Most of the noise, however, comes from outside the house.
In years gone by this point has often been
raised. I recall that when I was Deputy
Speaker of the House of Commons we tried
to influence honourable members to keep
silence when coming to the bar of the Senate.
But members congregating here for the opening of a session are somewhat like school
boys coming back after a summer recess:
they get together and exchange greetings.
Although entirely in accord with the remarks
made by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity, I cherish very little hope that
an effective remedy could be found to cure
the evil which he has brought to our
attention.
A few other points of a similar nature
could also be properly discussed. For instance, we invite ladies and gentlemen to
attend the opening of Parliament. Some of
them are seated on the floor of the Senate,
others in the lobby behind the bar. When
the members of the House of Commons congregate, they stand in front of the people
sitting in the lobby, so that these people do
not see or hear what is going on. When this
building was designed it was intended to
instal galleries along the sides of this chamber

where war paintings now hang. The galleries
have remained unfinished. If they were now
provided on both sides, as is done in other
chambers, there would be convenient accommodation for distinguished visitors who come
here at our invitation. Our guests should
never be seated behind the standing members
of the House of Commons.
Honourable senators, this year we shall
celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the
start of construction of this building, for
the building was begun in 1917, although
it was not opened until 1920. I would suggest that our Standing Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds take up the question
of whether galleries could be provided as
contemplated in the original plan. If this
were done, people could be seated there and
honourable members of the House of
Commons would have more room.
Perhaps we could draw the attention of
the Honourable the Speaker of the House
of Commons to the matter complained of.
When honourable members of that house
come over here to attend His Excellency
the Governor General or his deputy, they
should show respect to the representative
of the Crown by keeping silence or holding
their peace until the Speech from the Throne
is finished.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I am afraid I disagree both with the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and the honourable senator from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien). I should be
very sorry to see the members of the House
of Commons remain completely silent from
the moment that they came to this chamber.
I think it is a good thing that they talk, and
I will tell you why. It is a tradition that we
inherit from the British House of Commons,
a tradition which the members of that house
have for many years cherished very carefully,
that they did not need to listen to the royal
speech if they did not want to, and that they
had the right to converse among themselves
behind the bar if they so wished. That is
the reason it is done; and, as one who rather
likes to think that our old traditions are kept
up, I should be very sorry to have any such
rule made as is suggested by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I said nothing about the
members of the House of Commons. It may
be that they have the right to make all the
noise they like. I referred only to those
visitors who stand behind the bar and behind
the members of the House of Commons and
are unaware when proceedings have commenced. I ask only that they be notified

JANUARY 9, 1957
just as the Speech from the Throne is about
to begin, not that anybody should hit them
with a club. I suggest no change in the rules,
but merely that the word "Order" be uttered
loud enough and often enough and by enough
people that these visitors shall hear it.
Hon. Nancy Hodges: Perhaps we could
overcome the present difficulty by having a
little more noise in this house than outside.
I suggest that a loud speaker be placed near
the Speaker's chair so that nobody can fail
to hear His Excellency the Governor General
or His Honour the Speaker.
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: The honourable senator who has just spoken has taken
the words out of my mouth. Yesterday I was
sitting at the far end of the chamber and I
could not hear a solitary syllable of His
Excellency the Governor General's Speech;
and this, not only because members from the

Commons were conversing, but because sound
in this chamber does not carry well. So I
suggest that a loud speaker be installed. I
have noticed time and again that people who
stand behind the bar cannot hear the Governor General, and you cannot keep people from
talking if they are unable to hear what is
going on.
Hon. W. D. Euler: It seems to me that it
should at least be possible for those who are
gathered in this chamber to hear what is
being read by His Excellency the Governor
General. If it is thought quite proper that
there should be all sorts of disturbance at the
far end, so that we cannot hear, we should
dispense, I suggest, with the reading of the
Speech and simply have it printed in Hansard,
where we could read it the next day.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

APPENDIX "A"

(See p. 4)
REPORT OF PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARIAN
To the Honourable the Speaker of the Senate:
The Parliamentary Librarian has the
honour to submit his report for the year 1956.
The Library was officially reopened on
June 19, 1956, by His Excellency the Governor General of Canada, the Right Honourable Vincent Massey, in the presence of
Senators and Members of Parliament. A full
report of the ceremony will be found in
appendices to the Debates of both Houses.
Senators and Members, as represented in the
Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament, inspected the restored library and
expressed agreement with the Minister of
Public Works who stated that "the architects
and contractors had maintained the integrity
of design and the ideas which were in the
minds of the original architects and builders".
Members of the staff who had occupied
temporary quarters in the House of Commons
Reading Room, the Supreme Court building,
and the Canadian Bank Note building for
more than three years were able to move
back to the Library in the summer and fal
months.
We have to this date brought back to the
Library all the official publications of the
Canadian and Provincial Governments, and
of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth
countries, as well as those of the United
Nations Organization and affiliated agencies.
In addition more than 70,000 reclassified
books, all our bound periodicals except newspapers, and our complete law collection are
now in this building. Our bound newspapers

are now available only from the Supreme
Court building, but microfilm copies of 30
important newspapers can be seen in a
special room of the Library. However, much
of our collection is still in the Supreme Court
building. A large number of books is still in
dead storage in the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics building. All these will be carefully arranged in the next few months, and a
decision will then be made as to which should
be kept and which sent to the National
Library.
The enlarged cataloguing staff have this
year recatalogued 24,139 volumes, which
brings to 72,259 the total to date.
During the same period our staff have
answered 2,516 reference questions, and have
circulated 8,335 volumes. No statistics are
kept of the circulation of newspapers and
magazines from the House of Commons Reading Room.
On October 13, 1956, the General Librarian,
Mr. Felix Desrochers, retired. Mr. Desrochers had served the Library faithfully for over
twenty-three years and will be greatly
missed.
Under the provision of the Library of
Parliament Act as amended by Chapter 35 of
the Statutes of Canada 1955, Mr. Guy Sylvestre, Assistant Librarian, was appointed
Associate Parliamentary Librarian, by the
Governor General in Council.
Respectfully submitted,
F. A. HARDY,
Parliamentary Librarian

(Whereupon the gathering sang O Canada.)
Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr.
Speaker of the House of Commons, ladies
and gentlemen: We are assembled here to do
honour to the memory of a great Canadian,
the Right Honourable Sir Robert Borden, a
former Prime Minister of Canada. We, and

just west of the West Block on Parliament
Hill. For seasonal reasons the continuing

JANUARY 9, 1957
(Translation):
Hon. L. René Beaudoin (Speaker of the
House of Commons): Mr. Prime Minister, the
Honourable the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered
here this afternoon to honour the memory of
a Canadian who was Prime Minister of our
country and who, in the course of a long and
remarkable political career, rendered outstanding services: Sir Robert Laird Borden.
A few moments ago, in the presence of the
present Right Honourable Prime Minister, and
of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Henry
Borden, Q.C., a nephew of Sir Robert Borden,
unveiled a monument erected on Parliament
Hill to remind future generations of our past
glories and of the debt of gratitude which we
owe to the builders of this nation.
We are therefore witnessing one of those
great parliamentary occasions. The leaders
of all parties unite in paying a nation's tribute to Sir Robert Laird Borden.
(Text):
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson (Speaker of
the Senate):
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour
to present the Prime Minister of Canada.
Right Hon. Louis S. St. Laurent (Prime
Minister): Mr. Co-chairman,
Mr. Chief
Justice, Mr. Borden, ladies and gentlemen:
Just before we begin the heavy schedule of
another session of Parliament, it is fitting
that we should pause to pay tribute to one
of the great figures in Canadian history, Sir
Robert Borden.
I wish to congratulate Miss Frances Loring
on the striking likeness and the excellent
workmanship of the statue which Mr. Henry
Borden unveiled a few minutes ago. She
has expressed for the permanent records
of our nation in a fashion more eloquent than
words many of the fine characteristics of that
distinguished statesman.
The Right Honourable Sir Robert Borden
was born over one hundred years ago in the
small rural community of Grand Pré, Nova
Scotia, the native province of three of
Canada's Prime Ministers. He is remembered
particularly by us as Canada's Prime
Minister during the First World War.
Much has been written about Canada's
role in the first world war and no doubt
much will be written in the future. This
was one of the most critical periods of
Canadian history. Much progress has been
made since Confederation in the development of a strong and united nation, but the
national fabric has never faced such a severe
test and none could tell if it could withstand
the strains imposed upon it.
82719-21

Canadians were fortunate in those trying
years to have as their leader a man of
unquestionable integrity, a high sense of
duty, a thoroughly trained mind and an
exceptional capacity for unremitting hard
work. Whatever opinions might be advanced
on the policies which he pursued, his
personal qualities and particularly his
honesty and sincerity of purpose in seeking
to serve his country well were outstanding.
Under Sir Robert Borden's leadership
Canada made a contribution to the first
world war which won the praise and admiration of ber allies. In addition to his leadership at home, Sir Robert played an active
role in the Imperial War Cabinet in London.
He strove throughout the war to ensure
that Canada should have a voice in the
formulation of allied policy rather than limit
her role to supplying men and material.
With a wide and statesmanlike view of this
country's capacities and ber future, he
sought to encourage his fellow citizens to
accept their new and inevitable responsibilities.
In 1919 Sir Robert Borden was our chief
plenipotentiary delegate at the Peace Conference in Paris, and in 1920 he signed the
Treaty of Versailles as the representative of
Canada on terms of equality with the
representatives of the other allied nations.
In the same year Canada was admitted as an
original member of the League of Nations.
Another of Sir Robert's accomplishments
at about the same time was to secure for
Canada the right to have a minister plenipotentiary in Washington accredited by the
King and appointed on the advice of the Canadian Cabinet. Such an appointment, however,
was only made several years later. Sir
Robert also suggested at the Imperial War
Conference of 1918 that Canada should decide
its own constitutional questions. This, as
you know, was accomplished in the last
few years.
In his book, "Canada in the Commonwealth", published after his retirement, he
welcomed the definition of the relations of
Great Britain and the dominion contained
in the Balfour report as "autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in
status, in no way subordinate one to another
in any respect of their domestic or external
affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as
members of the British Commonwealth of
nations."
"The dominions having sought and gained
the status of nationhood", Sir Robert wrote,
"they cannot recede from assumption of its
responsibilities." And in the last lines of
his book Sir Robert Borden expressed his

SENATE
hope that this freedom within the unity of
the Commonwealth was "an earnest of what
may yet be accomplished in an ever wider
sphere. The league of the Commonwealth
:nay serve as an exemplar to the League of
Nations."
(Translation):
Sir Robert devoted himself to his work
with such energy that even his own vast
physical resources proved unequal to the task.
He was obliged to retire in 1920. Fortunately,
he soon recovered his good health, a fact
which enabled him to continue his active life
for a number of years afterwards. I had the
pleasure of hearing him in 1929 when he
spoke before the Canadian Bar Association in
Quebec City. I well remember him and the
words he spoke on that occasion. During
the war it was believed in certain quarters
that he did not understand those Canadians
belonging to the French-speaking group, and
that he had no real sympathy for them. It
is perhaps for that reason that be availed
himself of that opportunity to speak of the
very origin of Canadian history in the heart
of the province of Quebec, in that city which
he called the "founding city" of Canada.
When he had finished speaking, be had removed any doubts we may have had about
his real sympathy for French-speaking Canadians. May I be allowed to quote the last
sentences of his speech:
(Text):
On the whole there bas been an honourable and
wholesome co-operation of the two races in the
upbuilding of Canadian institutions and in the
development of the heritage with which Providence
has endowed the Canadian nation. The pioneer
races are and they always will be distinctive but
in their origins they are much nearer to each other
than either seems to imagine. It is desirable to
emphasize their points of sympathy and contact
rather than their divergences of temperament and
outlook.

(Translation):
Those words were spoken by Sir Robert
Borden more than a quarter of a century ago.
Since then, our policy both internal and external, has undergone great changes. Perhaps
he would not approve of them all. I am sure
however that he would agree with us that
we have gone a long way on the road to
national maturity and unity.

One of Sir Robert's oldest friends and perhaps his closest collaborator, who had hoped
to be here on this occasion but who is prevented by illness from being present, has
written me the following letter:
360 Bay Street, Toronto
January 3, 1957
My dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I feel grateful for your invitation to be present
at the coming Sir Robert Borden memorial event
(January 8) but am resolutely forbidden to leave
the house by my doctor. I have, therefore, prepared a very short statement of acknowledgment
and regret.
This I hope you will read to the
assembled people.
There has been nothing in the past that I had to
shrink from which I regretted like I do this failure
to take my part.
I sincerely appreciate the invitation and am grateful to you personally.
Sincerely yours,
Arthur Meighen.
This

is

the statement

enclosed

with Mr.

Meighen's letter.
It is with extreme remorse that I find myself ill
and quite unable to attend the proceedings on
Parliament Hill which are to do honour to Sir
Robert Borden.
In his lifetime, Sir Robert Borden had friends
unnumbered in all parts of Canada, but none, I
sincerely submit, more devoted and tireless than
myself and this relationship continued until the
hour of his death.
To have survived until this event takes place will
add much to my feelings of gratitude and satisfaction, and one cannot be wrong in indulging
an inward assurance that the waves of goodwill
generated here, the richer sense of unity and
common purpose inspired, the pride we all have
in those who have toiled nobly and passed on, that
all these flaming truths will keep us resolutely on
our course.
Arthur Meighen.

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson (Speaker of
the Senate): Ladies and gentlemen, may I
present Mr. Henry Borden, nephew of Sir
Robert Borden and one of the most outstanding Canadian figures in the business and
professional life of Canada.

Mr. Henry Borden, Q.C.: Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Speaker of
the House of Commons, Mr. Prime Minister,
Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished guests, ladies
and gentlemen: This is indeed a historic occasion and I wish, Mr. Prime Minister, to thank
you sincerely for doing me the great honour
and giving me the unforgettable privilege of
unveiling this statue of Sir Robert Borden.
(Text):
I have no hesitation in saying that I dearly
In the years since his death we have loved Sir
Robert and my life has been enmore accurate and a
learned to have a
riched by the deep affection and kindliness
deeper appreciation of a great Canadian
statesman. And I am sure that all Canadians which he bestowed on me.
The statue, in the design and completion of
who gaze upon the statue which has been
unveiled today will recall with respect his which you, sir, have taken such a genuine
sincerity of purpose and his selfiess devotion personal interest, will serve to keep fresh in
to his country.
the minds of future generations the memory

JANUARY 9, 1957
of a distinguished Canadian statesman, of
whom you have just spoken in such complimentary terms.
On behaif of Sir Robert's relatives and
friends I wish to join in the Prime Minister's
congratulations to Miss Loring, and to thank
you, Mr. Prime Minister, and through you
the citizens of Canada, for causing this
wonderful memorjal to be created on Parliament Hill. Thank vou very much indeed.
Hon. L. René Beaudoin (Speaker of the
House of Commons>: Ladies and gentlemen,
the honourable the Leader of the Opposition,
Mr. John Diefenbaker, Q.C., M.P., will now
speak.
Mr. John G. Diefenbaker (Leader of the
Opposition): Joint Chairmen, Mr. Prime
Minister, distinguished guests, ladies and
gentlemen: First I want to join with Mr.
Borden in thanking the Prime Minister for
the generous terms in which he referred to
the service to Canada of Sir Robert Borden.
This is in keeping with the traditions of our
public service. While we may disagree in
matters of policy each of us must, under our
democratic system, realize that it is only in a
community of counsel that the best for Canada
will be achieved.
I think it is most fitting that we, on this
occasion, honour one of Canada's greatest
statesmen. As I listened to the Prime Minister
review the constitutional development of this
country I thought it was a magnificent tribute
from one constitutional lawyer, regardîng the
constitutional development of this country,
in giving approval to the contribution made
by another. After ail, there is that bond of
union amongst members of the legal profession wherein the greatness of a contribution
is at ail times recognized by one's fellows.
It is of interest to know, too, that out of
the eleven Prime Ministers of Canada, seven
were members of the legal profession, ail
making their contribution toward the building of this country into the ideal of us ail.
Mention was made of the reaction to the
attitude of Sir Robert Borden and the stand
hie took at the Peace Conference. It was he
who insîsted, following the sacrifices of the
war, that Canada be recognized as an autonomous nation within the family of British
nations, and insisted on the rîght to sign
the treaty of Versailles and join as a signatory of the League of Nations pact whereby
Canada adopted responsibilities that heretofore had not been regarded as a necessary
incident of our membership in the Commonwealth.
After ail, we judge men and women first on
the basis of those who served with them.
This morning I found a quotation in Lloyd

George's memoirs which sets forth the attitude that was taken by Lloyd George to this
man who bas been honoured today in the
unveiling o! this statue. Lloyd George said
of hlm this:
Canada was represented (at the imperlal. conference of 1917 by Sir Robert Borden who wa& the
very quintessence of comrmon sense. Always carçk.

well balanced, a man of co-operating temper,
invariably subordinatlng self to the common cause,
lie was a sagactous and helpful counsellor, neyer
forgettlng that bis fIrst duty was to the people of
the great dominion lie represented, but also reaUizlng
that an insistent and obstructive partlcularismn
would destroy any hope of achieving success In the
common task.
While it was Sir John A. Macdonald and
Sir George Etienne Cartier who joined
together the two great races and foundedCanada, and who had still a greater contribution to make in the years to follow, it was:
Sir Robert Borden and those who served,
with hlm who were able to achieve that unitr

and that international status which many
had dreamed of 50 years before. It was only
achieved in the light of the sacrifices of the
war.
We recognize, too, as you said, Mr. Prime
Minister, the contribution of the two races to
this country. With Parliament opening today
it is well to remember that in 1921 Sir Robert
Borden, on the occasion of the gift o! the
Speaker's chair from Westminster to the
House o! Commons, said this:
The parliamentary institutions which we hold as
o.. riglit and not; of grace were won by a common
ancestry snd through graduai evolution and
development during the past five or six centuries.
The man wlio summoned the flrst gatbering that
might lie regarded as the forerunner of the Commons bouse of Pariainent of Great Britain as that
of Canada was a Frencbmnan, bora In France.
Thus we can look back with satisfaction upon the
fact that Saxon and Norman flve or six hundred
years ago stood side by side In the assertion of
liberties that are ours today.

I think on this occasion it is well to recail
tose words, as this monument has been
unveiled. I think ail Of US will agree that
bis monument will be tangible evidence o!
his statesmanship; his living monument the
establishment of the principle of equality
among the free nations within the Commonwealth and Empire as he saw it, and his
contribution to fashioning for Canada that
role which she is playing s0 magnificently
today. 0f him it may indeed be said that
"be builded better than he knew."1
Hon. L. René Beaudoin (Speaker of the
House of Commions): Ladies and gentlemen,
the Honourable the Leader of the C.C.F. party,
Mr. M. J. Coldwell, will now speak.
Mr. M. J. Coidwell (Leader of the C.C.F.
Party): Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Chie! Justice,
distinguisbed guests, ladies and gentlemen: 1
think it is fitting that we have gathered here

SENATE
today to honour the memory of a great
Canadian. There are times in the lives of
nations when it is well to look back and
remember famous men. Sir Robert Borden
was a famous and a great man. As we have
heard today he was one of the architects,
indeed in many respects the principal architect, of the place which Canada now has in
the world of today.
Sir Robert Borden, at Versailles, insisted on
the recognition of Canada as a nation. Sir
Robert Borden was, in that respect, one of
those who placed the British Commonwealth
in its new phase. His services to this country
and to the Commonwealth deserve the recognition that bas been given to him today.
I am very happy indeed that I am one of
those who, though not sharing the fundamental principles of the party he represented,
can speak on behalf of those who, while
disagreeing with him in some of his policies,
none the less recognize fully that in his day
and in his generation he played a great part
in leading this country through difficult times
and in laying the foundations of the Canada
which we know today.
I am very happy indeed to have had this
opportunity of being present and participating
in this great event.
Hon. L. René Beaudoin (Speaker of the
House of Commons): Ladies and gentlemen,
the honourable the Leader of the Social
Credit party, Mr. Solon Low, will now speak
to you.
Mr. Solon E. Low (Leader of the Social
Credit Party): Messrs. Co-chairmen, Mr.
Prime Minister, distinguished guests, ladies
and gentlemen: I feel greatly honoured
to have this privilege of participating in an
event which was designed to enable us to pay
tribute to a great Canadian statesman. I
shall not multiply words nor repeat the things
that have already been said, though I am
convinced that some of them might be worthy
of repetition for the sake of emphasis. Suffice
it to say that I concur most heartily in all
those things which have been said of Sir
Robert Borden, as well as of the artist who
executed the statue that has been unveiled
today.
As people in the days ahead look upon the
likeness of Sir Robert that is now on the
grounds of Parliament, they will doubtless

be moved to study the life and accomplishments of this great Canadian. If they do,
I am sure that they will discover something which will give them considerable
encouragement.
Sir Robert was born in humble circumstances, and through his own effort and determination to work hard he reached one of the
highest positions within the ability of the
Canadian people to bestow on any man. He
accomplished this without benefit of family
fortune or prestige of great family power. It
will occur to all who will read and learn
about this Canadian that what Sir Robert
accomplished many another Canadian can also
accomplish if he is prepared to devote himself unceasingly and with complete honesty
of purpose to his task. We may differ with
many of the views that were held by Sir
Robert Borden. We may be critical even of
some of the things he did, but anybody who
took the trouble to study his life and the
motives that activated him in his public
service must agree that he did have complete
honesty of purpose and an integrity that can
stand as an example to all who are called
to serve their country. It is fitting, therefore,
that an occasion of this kind be used to remind
ourselves that Providence has always raised
up good men to meet the needs of the particular time in which they lived.
I am sure that Sir Robert was one of those,
and furthermore if our nation continues in
humility to seek after things of righteousness
we will always be blessed with the kind of
men who can give us the leadership we need
for the particular circumstances of those
times.
May I say in conclusion that I honour the
memory of Sir Robert Borden for all the
reasons that have been mentioned here today,
and in addition for the fact that he had a
thoroughly disciplined mind, which he applied
with singleness of purpose to the development
of Canada and the British Empire. Of Sir
Robert it can truly be said that he served his
country well.
Hon. L. René Beaudoin (Speaker of the
House of Commons): Ladies and gentlemen,
I ask you now to rise and sing "God Save the
Queen."
(Whereupon the gathering sang God Save
the Queen.)

Thursday, January 10. 1957
The Senate met at 3 p.rn., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers.
Routine proceedings.
DIVORCE
PETITIONS

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented a

number of petitions for divorce.
He said: Honourable senators, I have flot
actually counted these petitions, but there
are about 280 here.
REPORTS 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
have several reports to present from the
Committee on Divorce, and perhaps I might
make some comments now. Already some 293
petitions have been filed. There are, however,
418 open files. By that I mean that that
number of actions has been instituted to the
extent of publication of notice in the Canada
Gazette.
Publication of such notice is
required of every applicant to Parliament; for
a Bill of Divorce. Then when the application
is received a file is opened and the proceedings are under way. As I have said, 418 such
files are being prepared for this session, and
honourable senators will be interested to
know that 161 files have already been processed to the point where the cases are set
down for hearing.
The committee held its first meeting this
morning and completed the necessary organizational work at this stage. I have the honour
to report that the members; once again
expressed sufficient confidence in their chairman to re-elect him.
Hon. Sonators: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: This was duly appreciated by the recipient of that honour.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And by honourable
senators generally.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Thank you.
The committee was also pleased to welcorne two additions to its membership in
the persons of Senator Isnor and Senator
Taylor (Westmorland) who will replace the
late Senators Ross and Stevenson, both of
whoma were faithful in their attendance and
valuable members of the committee.
We
have already expressed our regret in that

regard, but there is no reason why we should

not record it again while welcoming their
successors.
I have not the exact figures, but approximately 20 to 25 cases are contested. As honourable senators know, often contested cases
are difficult and take a long time to hear.
The last date for the filing of-new petitions;
will be February 18, six weeks'from the date
of the opening of Parliament.
In the 1956 session there were 435 petitions.
The actual number of those cases heard and
recommended was 356, and 9 were rejected;
14 were withdrawn, and 56 which had not
been completed were transferred to the
present session.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I now wish to present
the committee's first report:
1. Your cominittee recommend that their quorum
be reduced to three members for ail purposes,
inciuding the taking of evidence upon oath by the
committee or any subcommittee as to the matters
set forth in petitions for bis
of divorce.

The quorum is the same as in former years,
and has applied to the committee and subcommittees ever since we adopted the present
form of organization.
2. Your committee also recommend that leave be
given them to ait during ail adjournments of the
Senate, and also during sittings of the Senate.

I hope the occasions when it is necessary
to sit during adjournments will be few.
3. Your comrnittee
further
recommend that
authority be granted for the appointment of as
many subcommittees as deemed necessary by the
committee for the purpose of hearing and inquiring
into such petitions for divorce as may be referred
to them by the Commjttee on Divorce. The subcommittee in each case to report their finding to
the main committee.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be considered?
Han. Mr. Raebuck: With leave, I move that
it be adopted now.
The motion was agreed to.
PETITIONS SERVED AND ADVERTISED FOR
LAST SESSION

Hon. Mr. Roebuck:

Honourable senators
will recaîl that the special session of Parliament which opened on November 26, 1956
and sat four days was continued until January 8, 1957. The practice in filing a petition
for divorce is to request that it be heard at
the next session of Parliament. Your coinmitee therefore submits the following as its
second report:
Inasmuch as petitions for bills of divorce were not
deait with at the speciai session of Parliament held

SENATE
in the years 1956 and 1957, the committee recommends that petitions served and advertised for the
last session of Parliament be deemed and taken to
have complied with the Rules of the Senate for the
present session.

NEW SENATORS INTRODUCED
The Hon. the Speaker having informed the
Senate that there were senators without,
waiting to be introduced:
The following newly-summoned senators
were severally introduced; presented Her
Majesty's writs of summons, which were read
by the Clerk Assistant; took the legally
prescribed oath, which was administered by
the Clerk, and were seated:
Hon. Sydney John Smith, of Kamloops,
British Columbia, introduced between Hon.
Mr. Macdonald and Hon. Mrs. Hodges.
Hon. William Albert Boucher, of Prince
Albert, Saskatchewan, introduced between
Hon. Mr. Macdonald and Hon. Mr. Crerar.
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that each of the two newly-summoned senators named above had made and subscribed
the declaration of qualification required by
the British North America Act, 1867, in the
presence of the Clerk of the Senate, the Commissioner appointed to receive and witness the
said declaration.
WELCOME TO NEW SENATORS
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
a little more than a year ago we greeted the
senators who, at that time, had for the first
time taken their seats in this chamber. On
this occasion I feel that I cannot do better
than to repeat, at least in essence, what I
then said:
On behalf of the Senate of Canada, we
extend the most cordial welcome to those
who have now taken their seats in this
chamber. You will find here, honourable
senators, a pleasant atmosphere far transcending any sharp differences of opinion that may
from time to time arise in the consideration
of legislation. You will at times be surprised
at the expedition with which legislation is
disposed of, until you appreciate the fact that
the Senate embraces in its membership men
and women of wide experience accustomed to
assess quickly the import of what comes
before them. There has always existed, and
will exist in the future, ample opportunity

for greater utilization of the undoubted
talents and experiences possessed by members
of this bouse over and above that required
in the consideration of what comes regularly
before them. You, with the great prestige
and experience hitherto gained in your
respective spheres of endeavour, are in a
position to add materially in this respect.
We welcome you, and wish you well.
HON. J. J. DUFFUS
ABSENCE DURING TWO SESSIONS REFERRED
TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I have the honour to present to the Senate
the following report from the Clerk of the
Senate
The Honourable Wishart MeL. Robertson, P.C.,
Speaker of the Senate of Canada,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Sir,
In compliance with Rule 104 of the Senate, I
have the honour to report that on looking over
the record of attendance at the sittings of the
Senate by members thereof, I find that the
Honourable Joseph James Duffus, one of the members for the Province of Ontario, has not appeared
in his seat during any one of said sittings throughout the whole of the last two sessions of Parliament.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
J. F. MacNeill,
Clerk of the Senate.

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to rise on a question of

privilege on the point that has been raised
in the report just read? This goes to show
that when a rule is made one is not always
aware of how it will operate. I understand
that under the Rules of the Senate if an
honourable senator does not attend for two
sessions he has to resign; but let me point
out that one of the sessions referred to in
this report lasted four days only. Yet that
counts as a session, short though it was.
Hon. Mr. Howard: We did not have a session of four days. Parliament sat for four
days and then adjourned for more than a
month.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My information is that
Parliament sat for only four days. And I
remember that some years ago a session of
Parliament was opened and closed within half
an hour. That also was considered a session.
I bring up the point to show how a rule of
this kind can operate against an honourable
senator. I hope that note of the point I raise
will be taken by the honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I should point out that we are bound in this

JANUARY 15, 1957
instance by the British North America Act,
which provides, in section 31, as follows:
The place of a senator shall become vacant
in any of the following cases:

(1) If for two consecutive sessions of the Parliament he fails to give his attendance in the Senate;
That is the Constitution, and we are bound
by it. If it were a rule of the Senate this
body could change it, but it is much more
difficult to change the Constitution.
May I say to the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that I am
sure each one of us feels very badly, just as
he does, that we are required by the Constitution to follow the procedure that we are
following tonight. It brings a great sorrow
to me personally to have to do so, because I
entered Parliament on the same day as Senator Duffus. However, we are bound by the
Constitution.

As to the length of the last session, I would
point out that it opened on the 26th of
November, and after a number of sitting
days, it was adjourned and continued to be
in existence until the 8th day of January
of this year. Although there were not many
sitting days, the session did last considerably
longer than a month.
In any event, we are bound by the British
North America Act and the Rules of the
Senate. Therefore, with leave of the Senate
I move:
That the Clerk's report relative to the absence
of the Honourable Joseph James Duffus during
two consecutive sessions of Parliament be referred
to the Committee appointed to consider the Orders
and Customs of the Senate and Privileges of
Parliament: the Committee to meet in this chamber
at a quarter of three o'clock in the afternoon of
Thursday next.

The motion was agreed to.

CANADA'S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSION TABLED

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I beg leave to table copies in English and in
French of the preliminary report of the Royal
Commission on Canada's Economic Prospects,

dated December, 1956. I believe a copy of
this report has been distributed to each member of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) please instruct the appropriate official
to furnish additional copies of this report to
honourable senators? I should like very
much to use one or two more copies and I
have none available.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I shail endeavour to
obtain a number of additional copies for
honourable senators.
PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS WAR
VETERANS' ASSOCIATION-REFUND
OF FEES
Hon. Mr. Golding moved:
That the parliamentary fees paid upon a proposed bill at the third session of the TwentySecond Parliament, to incorporate Canadian
National Railways War Veterans' Association, be
refunded to James C. Neilson, of Stratford. Ontario,
solicitor for petitioners, less printing and translation costs.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like

to give a brief explanation of this motion.
In July, 1955, a petition was filed in the
Senate in this matter and certain fees were
paid. In August of 1956 a communication
was received from the solicitor for the petitioners stating that at a meeting of the Canadian National Railway War Veterans' Association a resolution was passed directing that
no further action be taken with respect to
the private bill. No action was taken by the
Senate at all, and consequently the associa-

tion, through its solicitor, is requesting that
the parliamentary fees paid upon the proposed bill be refunded, less printing and
translation costs.
The motion was agreed to.

Act to amend the Currency, Mint and Exchange Fund Act.
The bill was read the first time.

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-

DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
His Excellency the Governor Generals

SENATE
Speech at the opening of the Fifth Session
of the Twenty-Second Parliament.
Hon. Henri C. Bois moved:
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey, Member of the Order of the Companions
of Honour, Governor General and Commander-inChief of Canada. May it please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled,
beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your
Excellency for the gracious Speech which Your
Excellency has addressed to both bouses of
Parliament.

He said: Honourable senators, first of all I
wish to thank you for your hearty welcome
and spontaneous display of friendship shown
to me when I first came into this chamber.
I shall address the house in French, for
honourable senators will easily realize that
I feel much more at home when speaking in
my mother tongue.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, the speech from the
throne contains the following paragraph:
It is proposed to recommend in the Senate the
establishment of a committee to consider what
should be done to make better use of land for
agriculture and thus to contribute more effectively
to the improvement of agricultural production and
the incomes of those engaged in it.

The governments have always taken an
interest in Canadian agriculture, but it is
the first time that such a definite proposal is
made to consider the agricultural future of
Eastern Canada.
Here and there in Canada, and particularly
in the East, there are districts where the
land, which was not very fertile initially or
which has become exhausted through agricultural abuses, cannot give a reasonable income
to its owners. This is nothing new. There
have always been lands which, after having
been cleared, were found incapable of producing a satisfactory income. During the war
and post-war period, they were rather profitable but when came the time for making
adjustments, operating costs were often greater
than the income produced. The explanation
is evident when one considers what has taken
place between 1946 and 1951 especially, and
again between 1951 and 1956.
After the war, agricultural production in
the world was 5 per cent below its pre-war
position, although the world's population had
increased by about 10 per cent. Europe,
North Africa and Soviet Russia's agricultural
production had dropped from a third to a
quarter, but North America's had increased
by one third. During the six to eight years
which followed the return of peace, the demand for foodstuffs was therefore very heavy.

The financial help given by the Allies, and
by the United States in particular, allowed
devastated countries to purchase essential
food. So that Canada's agricultural exports
were very high. About 30 per cent of the
grain produced in our country and 13 per
cent of our total agricultural production was
sold overseas.
But from 1950-51 on, the rehabilitation of
farming in the devastated countries allowed
them to become self-sufficient and by 1950
their pre-war level was reached, while four
years later it was exceeded by 10 per cent.
And every year since 1951 our exports first
became stabilized and then began to fall.
Agricultural prices also suffered. Thus, while
in 1946-47 our cheese exports amounted to
59 per cent of production, in 1954-55 they
were only 9 per cent.
Evaporated milk
dropped from 12 per cent in 1946-47 to 2 per
cent in 1954-55; beef, from 9 per cent to 5
per cent over the same period; pork, from
28 per cent to 8 per cent; eggs from 19 per
cent to 2 per cent. On the whole, grain excluded, our exports dropped from 13 to 5
per cent in 1954-55, as compared with 1946-47.
Grain followed an inverse trend, exports having increased from 29 per cent in 1946-47 to
38 per cent in 1955-56, but in the case of our
other important products, exports fell.
Domestic demand, notwithstanding the
population's natural increase and its increase
through immigration, could not absorb our
increasing agricultural production. Farmers,
attracted by the 1946-51 level of prices endeavoured to increase production but as in
the case of plants and animals agricultural
production follows a biological cycle, their
attempts to increase production for the most
part bore their fruit at a time when our
markets' absorbing capacity was decreasing.
And the farmers whose farms were expensive
to operate were drawn towards industrial or
other employment which offered them better
incomes because after the war, industry, after
hesitating for a while, also launched a large
development program. So much so that from
June, 1951 to June, 1956, the number of
people employed in agriculture fell from
997,000 to 804,000, a reduction of 19 per cent;
the number of farms dropped from 612,000
to 544,000 and the number of farmers' sons
and daughters working on the farm decreased
from 273,000 to 167,000, or by 39 per cent.
Because of these various reductions in
farm labour, the production of those who
remained on the farm increased over the
1951-56 five-year period by about 30 per
cent. It would therefore seem that from the

JANUARY 15, 1957
end of the war to the 1950's there were too
many people producing foodstuffs, because
the disappearance of our export markets
coincided with the rapid spread and increasingly generalized use of modern agricultural machinery.
In other words, the
farmers' productivity had greatly increased.
During the last few months, prices seem
to have become stabilized. For the first
time in about four or five years, domestic
consumption has practically absorbed our
butter production. And many economists
believe that the demand for agricultural
products will increase each year by 2 to 3
per cent. Our farmer's productive capacity
can easily keep pace with that increase. On
the whole, the agricultural picture is improving and there seems no reason to fear the sort
of exodus which has been going on over
the last ten years. We may even have to
import certain products, like beef, for
instance.
Agriculturists
should become
increasingly efficient; they should produce
more per hour of work.
If in twenty years' time our population is
to reach 25 million, our per capita production should increase by about 75 per cent
over what it has been these last few years.
This means that our farm acreage should
increase by about 20 to 25 per cent, our livestock by about 50 per cent and the production capacity of agricultural machinery by
about 40 per cent. These figures are based
on constant dollars.
I recognize that these are cold figures.
They are the result of tabulations prepared
by agricultural economists, in particular by
Mr. E. C. Hope who submitted them to a
meeting of the British Columbia Agricultural
Federation, held in November, in Chilliwack.
Mr. Hope's figures are very much the same
as those reached by our economists working on the same problem. Needless to say
they apply to the whole country. Ever since
the appointment of a Senate committee has
been mentioned, most people seem concerned
with the agricultural land of Eastern Canada,
located, I believe, in the district which lies
between the Appalachians to the south and
the Laurentian foot-hills to the north, or in
the outskirts of the Canadian shield. I cannot even in a cursory manner, review the
conditions existing in certain parts of the
province of Ontario or the Maritime
provinces. I shall limit myself to the conditions existing in a wide area of the province
of Quebec, because I am more familiar with
that province and with the agricultural conditions prevailing in some of its parts.
The 1951 census indicates that there are in
Quebec, in round figures, 134,000 farms
averaging 125 acres each. But 41.9 per cent
of these farms are made up of woodlots, tim-

21

ber lands, marshes or stoney land. The
productivity of this farm land is negligible,
except in the case of timber land, wood lots
and maple bushes. Therefore, this leaves
an average of only 72.5 acres, in round
figures, from which a reasonable income can
be expected.
But the same 1951 census indicates that
there were at that time 23,857 farms of less
than 70 acres. A 70-acre farm can support
its owner if it is intensively cultivated and
particularly if it is used to produce fruit,
vegetables, etc. But it is dairy farming and
its side lines which is the most popular agricultural operation. In order that a farmer
and his family may have an average yearly
net income of, let us say $1,800, it takes
about 50 head of cattle-and that means 25
to 30 milking cows, the remainder being
heifers of two or three years old and calvesand about 150 acres of cultivated land on
a well-kept farm. Otherwise, capital investments are not in full use. In 1951, the
average Canadian farm was worth $10,517,
distributed as follows: farm buildings and
land, $6,305; machinery and equipment, $1,678;
livestock, $2,534; that is 61, 16 and 24 per
cent respectively of the farm's total value.
This is evidently out of proportion. A large
part of such investment is only indirectly
productive, such as machinery and equipment, buildings, etc. Farm buildings ordinarily represent about $3,000. Even if the
land were considered as directly productive,
the total capital investment produces very
little because of the reduced acreage under
cultivation,-72 or 73 acres,-unless, I repeat,
the farmer goes in for extensive livestock or
vegetable production. But this rarely happens.
And where do we find these rather poor
lands which are better suited to forestry than
agriculture? Of ancient geological origin,
they are located on rugged terrain; therefore,
they suffer from leaching and usually the
acid soil requires, to become productive, a
great deal of fertilizers and soil amendments.
They are found in the foot-hills of the two
mountain ranges which cross the province,
the Alleghanies to the south and the Laurentians to the north. Operation of these farms
raises the greatest problems and calls for the
ingenuity and knowledge of the best agriculturists. Because of the restricted area of
arable land and poor yields, the owners of
these farms can count on very little income
and cannot, therefore, enjoy a standard of
living comparable to that of a semi-skilled
labourer.
Some families, of course, leave excellent
farmlands, but most of those who leave the
farm come from the poorer districts. A sound
agricultural policy should therefore aim at
returning to the forest the lands suitable for

SENATE
the production of timber. The forest-farm
plan, or forestry establishment, should allow
the occupant to enjoy the benefits of modern
life. But in carrying out these plans, it should
be remembered that many of these parishes,
already organized as regards municipality,
school and church, are often burdened with
debts. Something should be done to see that
they honour their obligations, unless we could
some day discover a type of production suited
to such lands. This has happened in the past;
barren sandy lands, around Joliette for instance, farms which once sold for $1,000 or
$2,000, when turned over to the production
of flue-cured tobacco, became prosperous
farms, whose value increased tenfold.
I look forward to the time when the committee mentioned in the speech from the
throne will consider this problem and, following the best agricultural technique and
drawing upon the latest findings of agricultural sciences, will suggest solutions that are
fair to every one. The people who live in
these sections of our agricultural domain are
able to work and willing to learn. The occupant of a farm rarely refuses to co-operate
when a method of work or system of operation is suggested to him which lies within
his financial means and which might enable
him to obtain a reasonable income.
There is no point in leaving things in their
present condition. Men and lands deteriorate.
Let us not assume too hastily that the operators are not competent because the land is
unproductive.
The agricultural policies of a country
usually form part of the general program.
It is obvious that the general program and
the agricultural policies are based on the
economic, social or philosophical concepts. I
shall not discuss the concepts on which
national policies may be based and all those
which may influence agricultural policies. I
must point out, however, that we must strive,
in all fields of human endeavour, to achieve
just
development-with
the harmonious
results-of our natural and human resources.
Whether or not the eastern section of the
country should rely on industry first of all,
and on agriculture in the second place is
unimportant. It is a well-known fact that
industry should depend on agriculture and
give it some support. And agriculture policies
can only be based on research and on an
analysis of the situation in the light of the
most advanced knowledge. Only in this way
can a field of endeavour be examined, understood and policies adapted thereto.
Research must not be limited to the
economic aspect of agriculture; it must also
take into account its social and national
features. Undoubtedly, production must take

care of the market requirements. Furthermore, the best techniques must be introduced
and generalized by all available means. But
at the same time, it is important that the type
of farmers found in the east and throughout
the country be retained on the farm, for they
are land owners and heads of the ideal
families, those who earn their daily bread by
pooling their efforts.
However, quick results must not be
expected. Agriculture is a time-consuming
industry. It is governed by its own laws
which frequently are rigid, inflexible. It is a
biological process. It follows that true agricultural policies must be long term ones.
They must provide for orderly management
and wise spending.
In 1953, Canadians bought $3,750,000,000
worth of foodstuffs; food worth $400,000,000
It
was imported frorn foreign countries.
seems to me that if our farmers received the
attention, the care and the consideration
which they deserve, they could supply a part
of these $400,000,000 worth of imports. However, we must not delude ourselves in regard
to the possibility of supplying the whole
domestic market. It is obvious that agriculture in the east and elsewhere must be placed
on a competitive basis and properly directed.
Therefore. I am very happy to find that at
long last the agricultural problems of eastern Canada-inasmuch as the work of the
committee will bear on this aspect of the
problems-will be given attention by the
Government of Canada. It must be realized
by all that agriculture like any other activity
must depend on research, a study of the
markets and education.

Hon. Mr. Smith: -it is a pleasant duty
and a great honour for me to second the
motion to adopt the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. I must admit that
when I received the invitation to do so I
was nearly overcome with surprise and joy.
There was a considerable mixture of fear
there too-fear that I would not do credit to
the high office to which I had been appointed until I had become acquainted with
the atmosphere and surroundings of this
place.
However, I am not a total stranger to some

lot of comfort. I am very glad to find myself

of British Columbia when I had the honour
of representing the provincial riding of Kam-

loops. I was very fortunate and honoured
that Senator Hodges was available to escort
me on my first entry into this chamber. I
also feel very happy at finding myself in the
company of Senator Farris and Senator
McKeen-both of whom, like myself, are
graduates of the British Columbia Legislative
Assembly-and the other British Columbia
senators, Senator Turgeon and Senator Reid,
whom I am proud to number among my personal friends. As for those honourable senators whom I have not previously known, their
warm welcome has brought me great comfort
and relief from the fear which I experienced
at first. I am sure I will find here an understanding and tolerance that will help me to
make this new era in my life very much
worth while.
Let me say, honourable senators, that it
will be my lifelong objective to justify my
appointment to this upper house by maintaining the high standard of dignity of the
Senate and to bring honour and credit to
this body, as well as to the beautiful and
bountiful region which I represent, the Interior of British Columbia.
As time goes on I hope to be able to make
a worthy contribution to many of the discussions of this house on various subjects of
public interest, but at this time I propose
to content myself with dealing very briefiy
with only two or three matters that are of
particular interest to me at present.
First, I will deal with one of the newer
subjects of public interest, the Gordon Economic Commission report, with particular
reference to one of its recommendations. We
have heard and read many comments on
some of the highlights of that report, but I
have yet to hear any comment on the particular recommendation which has to do with
the raising of licence and other fees borne by
motorists and truckers. Having a long experience in the automotive field, I know that
there are many friends of mine across Canada
who will be anxiously waiting to see if I
am going to do my stuff as they consider it
should be done. In all seriousness, I do think
that that particular item in the report is
worthy of very careful consideration. I am
not unmindful that the Gordon Economic
Commission was composed of a group of outstanding Canadian specialists who spent many
months in the study of the details that went
into that report, and it is not entirely fair to
jump to hasty conclusions and judge the
report hurriedly, but I do feel that a great
many Canadians have little or no idea of the
substantial contribution already being made
to the public purse by the motorists and
truckers of this country. They have been an
easy mark; it has been an easy matter to col-

lect taxes from them. The motorists and
truckers pay a very large proportion of taxes
collected at every level of government-the
municipal, the provincial and the federal.
According to the latest figures available we
find that the provinces of Canada, on two
items alone, those of registration and gasoline taxes, collect a total of about $350 million
yearly. And then, in the federal field, the
excise tax and the sales tax collections
amount to another $175 million annually. To
this must be added the federal sales tax on
gasoline and other petroleum products. So
that Canadian motorists and truckers are contributing in the provincial and federal fields
alone a sum in excess of $600 million in taxes
per annum. That is a terrific amount of
money. It is not so many years ago that the
total federal budget did not exceed that
figure.
In recent years there has been a tremendous
change in the use of the automobile. Not long
ago it was classed with jewellery and perfumes as a luxury. In recent months it has
been established that well over 80 per cent
of the mileage done by passenger cars in
Canada is on essential work, and certainly
100 per cent of truck mileage is in the same
category. So there has been a very great
change from the time when the automobile
may and could have been regarded as a
luxury, to this day, when it fills so important
an economic need in the whole scheme of
things.
I would suggest that before there is any
thought of increasing the tax burden on
motorists and truckers, careful consideration
should be given to a better distribution of
the tax load. Other fields of taxation may be
found wherein collections would be just as
easy as from the people who constitute the
motorists of this country.
There is another matter on which I should
like to touch, although I hesitate to do so in
the presence of the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). He had
not arrived in the city, or I had not seen
him, when I decided to say something on this
subject. I am looking forward to hearing a
lot more about it from him. I am intrigued
with what has been accomplished by those
with whom the honourable senator from New
Westminster and our Minister of Fisheries
have been associated in consummating very
recently what has been called the "Pink
Salmon Treaty". This measure is of tremendous importance to the fishing industry,
which, again, plays a great part in the general
economy of the Pacific coast province.
For several years Canadian fishermen and
the industry on the Pacific coast considered
that there should be an international agreement with the United States for the conserva-

SENATE
tien and management of the important pink
salmon runs of the Juan de Fuca-Fraser
River area. The successful operations of the
International Pacifie Salmon Fisheries Commission in rehabilitating the sockeye salmon
runs of the area gave reason and impetus te
the views of the Canadian industry.

I repeat that I shall be very glad to hear
further concerning this from the honourable
senator from New Westminster, because it is
an item of very great importance on the
Pacific.

So far, honourable senators, I have discussed matters which have largely to do

THE LATE EARL OF ATHLONE
TRIBUTE TO MEMORY OF FORMER
GOVERNOR GENERAL
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before proceeding with the business of
the day, I wish to draw to the attention of
honourable senators the sad news which
we heard a few hours ago, that the Earl
of Athlone had passed away.
Honourable
senators will recall that the Earl of Athlone
was Governor General of Canada from 1940
until 1946, during the war. Both he and
Princess Alice did not spare themselves in
any way whatsoever in the service of Canada
during those tragic and very difficult years.
It is ýinteresting to note that in 1914 the
Earl of Athlone was designated to the office
of Governor General of Canada. However,
in that year the First World War broke out,
and instead of coming to Canada he served
throughout that war on the battlefields of
France and Flanders.
The passing of the Earl of Athlone will be
deeply mourned in Canada and throughout
the Commonwealth. By way of tribute to his
memory, and as a mark of our deepest sympathy with Princess Alice, as well as of
respect for our beloved Queen and all the
members of the royal family, I would suggest,
with the concurrence of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig),
whom I have consulted in this matter, that
we rise at this time and stand briefly in
silence.

again last year, I thought there should be a
reduction in such expenditures. I had a note
on my memo pad to speak to that effect today,
but on thinking the matter over last night
and this morning I came to the realization
that our world is not any more settled than
it was five or ten years ago. I think the world
is in a turmoil which is not understandable
to any of us, and, that we smaller nations
have to do our best to be ready if a crisis
occurs. As the honourable member from
Kamloops (Hon. Mr. Smith) mentioned yesterday, people from Hungary, who have come
to all our cities, towns and villages, are
telling us what they have suffered in their
native country. Their sufferings have been
absolutely unbelievable. Students at their
schools and universities were so inoculated
with the idea of freedom that they would
stand up, fight and face sure death when
they rebelled against the government of their
country. I am persuaded that under similar
circumstances our boys and girls would do
exactly the same; I have that confidence in
them. For that reason, we must be prepared
to stand for freedom wherever it exists. In
my home city of Winnipeg-and I am not
boasting about Winnipeg, for perhaps we
have not done so well as some other cities,
but we have done a bit, in spite of certain
difficulties such as a very cold climate; and
it requires a good deal of preparation to take
care of people, especially at this time of the
year-in Winnipeg our people are as one in
their determination that the refugees from
Hungary will not only receive temporary
accommodation but will have a chance to
earn a living here. This is not because they
are Hungarians-for we would do the same
for British, French or any other refugees in
these circumstances-but because they are
heroic people, who were prepared to die in
order to demonstrate to the world that the
Russians could not crush freedom. Therefore,
honourable senators, I am not going to press
for a decrease in our war expenditures.
I should like to deal next with the great
Middle East problem. Late in last November
we had a special session of Parliament, which
I call the Suez session, at which this matter
was fully discussed. However, recent statements by the President of the United States
and politicians in that country indicate to
me that the difficulties in the Middle East are
far from solved, -and that something will have
to be done to meet them. I am not in a position to suggest what part we in Canada can
take in the solution. I do congratulate our
Government upon what it has done by way
of suggesting a temporary solution of the
problem. But we should realize, as did Britain
and France, and as the United States now
realizes, that the day must come when the

people of the Western world will give to the
people of the Middle East some guarantee of
their freedom of life in that area.
I am not at all sure that Nasser's idea of
using the United Nations to further his own
purpose was a good one. Certainly I was disappointed in the United Nations when it
passed a resolution condemning Britain and
France for doing certain things, but failed
to take similar action against Russia for the
things it did. True, the U.N. has said it could
not do anything in that respect. In any event,
the fact is that nothing was done, and the
Middle East situation is far from settled.
I believe, honourable senators, that the
people of Canada are of the opinion that we
have a certain responsibility for the peace
of the world. While we are not a large
nation, we are an important one, and we
cherish strong ideals about freedom and
proper dealings between peoples and nations.
A small nation like ours has more opportunity
to help in the solution of international problems than we sometimes realize. It is our
duty, therefore, as members of the Senate
of Canada, to help put forward the cause in
which we believe. I hope that no party to
which I belong or have anything to do with
will ever use the international situation for
its own gain, or for anything but the benefit
of Canada and the world as a whole.
I should like to turn next to the more
homely subject of inflation. An editorial in
the Winnipeg Free Press of January 9 with
respect to the Speech from the Throne contained this sentence:
First-and

negatively-it

lacked

any

ringing

declaration about the need to combat inflationary
pressures.
What are the facts of the case with respect
to inflation? Up to 1949 the cost of living
index was calculated on the basis that 1935-39
equalled 100. On that basis the index in 1949
had risen to 160.8. In that year the Government, rightly or wrongly-and I think
wrongly-cut the basis for the index back to
100 as of that time. Our present index
stands at 120.4. If the index were calculated
on the original basis that the period 1935-39
equalled 100, it would today stand at 193.4.
In other words, it would now take $1.93 to
buy goods that could be bought in 1939 for $1.
That is straight inflation.
The Government has taken some steps to
meet that situation by trying to control the
interest rate on borrowed money. It bas
raised the discount rate of the Bank of Canada, first on an arbitrary basis, and now
according to a formula which bas been
adopted. The banks and loan companies have
followed this system. Consequently, we have
to pay a higher rate of interest on the money

JANUARY 16, 1957
we borrow. For instance, the Province of
Manitoba pays 5j per cent on money it could
have borrowed two years ago for 3j per cent.
The Province of Ontario is also paying 5j
per cent; the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario pays 5t per cent; and various
companies are paying as high as 5a per cent
on $100 bonds discounted at $98. In other
words, the cost of money has practically
doubled in the past three or four years.
One hears it said that there will be a good
deal of building done in Canada this year.
That is simply not so, because capital is not
available. The money will go for other purposes, which will yield a more profitable
return.
I would like to say something here about
the effect of inflation on our trade, for this
is the real economic problem facing the people
of Canada. Some people tell us that the
Government is taking over the control of
money; that other countries are investing
large sums here and things will turn out ail
right. That philosophy has been preached for
the past two years, but the inflationary trend
continues. I intend to give some figures which
will indicate the effect of the inflationary
climb on the production of our goods and
their sale in world markets.
Let me discuss briefly our deficit in trade
with other countries. In a speech I made in
the first session last year I complained about
this unbalanced trade picture. My friend
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) pointed out that huge sums of
money were being invested in Canada and
suggested this was compensation for the trade
deficit. But let us look at the trade picture as
of the end of November, 1956. The figures
for the first eleven months of 1956 indicate
that our imports from the United States
exceeded our exports to it by $1,225 million.
And on world markets, during the same
period, we bought $880 million more in goods
than we sold.
Now, it is all very well to say that a vast
amount of money is coming into Canada, but
let me point out that a lot of it is being used
to buy oil which is shipped back to the
United States and sold at a profit there. It is
to the benefit of that country to spend money
here to buy our natural resources. On the
other hand, we are unable to sell our manufactured goods to the United States, because
our costs are too high. Whether the costs
are high because of interest rates, capital
profits or for some other reason, I do not
intend to diiscuss this afternoon; the important point is that because of high costs of
production our goods can'not compete in the
United States market. I have given the
figures for the first eleven months of 1956,

and I am sure the month of December would
show an even worse result.
A situation similar to that between Canada
and the United States exists between Canada
and other trading countries of the world.
Whatever the cause may be, we are not
faci'g up to it. But I point out that no
country has ever been able to live for long
under those conditions. A country which
allows its trade deficit to persist will eventually be wiped out. Great Britain, for instance,
is in economie trouble today because of her
trade deficit. I am reminded of the fellow
who when he was earning $5 a day and
spending $4, was rich; but when he was
earning $5 and spending $6, he was poor. As
long as we are spending more than we make
we are going to be poor. That is just the
situation in which we find ourselves.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question?
What makes this country so
prosperous?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no prosperity in
Canada today.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is there not?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just a minute now. There
is prosperity in the sense of a money prosperity on paper. For instance, I noticed in a
newspaper the other day that some of the
stock of a prominent Canadian insurance
company was sold to United States interests
for $1,975 a share.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: A very lucky man.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not mention any
names. A lot of the shareholders did that.
Now, people in the United States are sending their money over here because they
think they can invest it in this country,
maybe on account ofHon. Mr. Hugessen: Our prosperity.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. Maybe because there
is a capital gains tax over there and we have
no such tax in this country. We do not know
why they are doing it. But the point is this,
that we cannot go on pursuing our present
policy and win out; we cannot continue to
sell less goods to the world than we buy and
then borrow money to make up the deficit.
That cannot be done by an individual or a
family, and it cannot be done by a nation.
You cannot cite me one case where that
course was followed and did not end in
bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Admitting there exists
the danger that he is so eloquently describing at the moment, which I myself do not
admit, what suggestion has he to offer for
curing the trouble?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, honourable senators,
I feel like answering that question in the way
that the Leader of the Opposition in the other
house answered another question a few days
ago, by saying that that is not my problem,
that it is the Government's problem. I am
telling you that the problem exists and that
the Government had better solve it.
In the years between 1930 and 1935, when
I was a member of the Manitoba Legislature,
the fellows would say to me: "Well, Haig,
wheat is away down to 50 cents a bushel,
and men are unemployed. What are you
going to do about it?" I asked them, "What
would you advise?" They replied: "That is
not our problem; that is your problem, for
you are running the Government of this
country. But when we get in we will show
you."
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The Government may not
think the danger exists. They may have
different views about it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe that is so, but I
think they do realize the danger. I think
they know there is trouble or they would
not be making such frantic efforts through
the Bank of Canada and other institutions
to control inflation. I have in my hand one
of the principal Liberal papers published in
Canada-the Winnipeg Free Press-and it
points out that in the Speech from the Throne
inflation was not recognized as a problem in
this country and no recommendations were
made on how to deal with it. Up to date
the Government have not dealt with it at all.
They are not selling our wheat. They are
doing a lot of talking about the wheat we
are selling, but on the 1st of October there
were in storage in this country 825 million
bushels of wheat, a two- or three-years'
supply.
Honourable members, the people of Canada, except those in Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta, think that we in the west are
always talking about wheat. Well, grainwheat, oats, barley and flax-is our staple
product, and it is our hope to realize on that
product. Now, it is bad enough to have to
go through the vicissitudes of drought conditions, too much rain, a grasshopper plague
or what have you, but when we have the
crop -cut and stored in the granary and then
find we cannot sell it, I say to you that a
real problem exists. Men and women come
into my office and say: "Mr. Haig, we owe

going to do about it? Are you going to put
us out on the road?" Well, honourable senators, I have not done that yet and I don't

suppose I will ever do it, nor that anybody
else will do it. But there is no end to this
problem.
I say that our country is in a very bad

wrongly-wrongly, I think-is giving its
wheat away. That country sold 400 million
bushels of wheat to India and took rupees in
payment, then turned around and lent the
rupees back to India to build roads and
bridges. Well, it will never get that money
back; in fact, it doesn't expect to, but it has
got rid of the grain stored in its elevators,
granaries, boats and other places. We cannot do that, so we have to deal with our
surpluses in a different way. These things
are piling up. You do not need to take my
word for it. You can ask any merchant who
is trying to sell his goods, and he will admit
to you that he is having difficulties in meeting
the competition of Germany and Japan and
other countries on world markets. He will
tell you that Russia now realizes that the
better way to take a country is not by guns
and cannon but by trade, and that she is
pursuing that formula. But we are not in a
position where we can do that. It may be
that our labour is too expensive. It may be
that our taxation is too great.

every time that it got a chance to do so. The
company bought its mine from the man who
discovered it, and pays a royalty to the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan on the
mineral produced. In the course of its operations the company makes a profit, but onehalf of that profit is taken away as a corporation tax by the dominion Government, in

Hon. Mr. Euler: We get a credit of 20 per

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. But that is not 100
per cent. The federal Government has given

nothing to justify this exaction. It is one
form of taxation which. contributes to putting
Up costs. It cannot be otherwise. If I were

do; 1 would immediately try to add enough

the cost of the article is increased.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: These are corporation
taxes after profits.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is shareholders' money
which has made ail this profit. Why should
they flot have it? I arn quite willing to be
taxed on the personal profits I have claimed
from my investment.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: But a company is a
person.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it is flot. A company
is composed of its shareholders and nobody
else. It is their money which. makes the
profit possible. It was the fellows who put
money into the Hudson Bay Mining and
Smelting Company who made possible its
success.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is rny friend suggesting
that the tax on corporation profits should be
wiped out?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I arn quite willing that
corporation profits shall be taxed, but the
proceeds, the whole 100 per cent, should be
returned to the owners of the stock.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Personaliy, I would like
that arrangement very much.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me go a littie further
into the history of this mining company. How
did it start? A man named Whitney came
up from New York and decided to purchase
what is now the company's property. But
when the ore was tested it was found that the
gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc could not
be separated fromn the dross, and that there
was no known formula of separation. When
hie was at Winnipeg he told us that to build a
pilot plant and discover a way to make the
refining perfect would cost about a million
dollars. He wanted members of the Legisiature to put up sorne of this money. Well, we
were flot very rich; members of legisiatures
seldomn are; they are just "getting by". Mr.
Whitney suggested that the members should
raise a few hundred thousand dollars in the
forrn of $1,500 bonds. It was pointed out
that if a formula could not be found the
investors would lose their money. However
rnost of the members finally agreed to subscribe $1,000 or $1,500, and these subscriptions, with those of others who put up similar
arnounts, provided the million dollars that
was needed. Each member put up what he

could afford, in the light of Mr. Whitney's
staternent that, while a subscriptîon of $1,500
provîded for a bond and 100 shares of stock,
hie did not know whether it was worth anything, and that certainly, if a formula could
not be found, it was worth nothing. Some of
the serious boys in the Legislature would not
gîve anything, but a number of us foolish
fellows, feeling that the enterprise would be
of benefit both to Manitoba and Saskatchewan, provided what funds we could. So the
pilot plant was buiît, and a formula was discovered. Subsequently stock was sold and
money borrowed ýail over Canada and the
United States; in ail, $20 million was raised
to pay for machinery and get the enterprise
going. Ever since that time the cornpany has
paid six per cent on our investment. Today
my 100 shares are worth about $8,000.
But now, who cornes along? In walks the
Governent and says, "Aha, Haig, we will
tax you on the income you are getting." I
say: "Ail right; that is fair; if I arn making
more than the other fellow 1 should pay a
bigger tax. But already the Government has
taken hall the company's profits. It is rny
$1,000 and the other fellow's $1,500 which
made the profit possible; nobody else contributed to the cornpany's success. Why, then,
should the Clovernrnent take haîf the comnpany's profits away?" The honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has said
that one-fifth of the tax is repaid to us. But
what about the other four-fifths?
That prînciple of double taxation, to which
I strongly object, affects the entîre structure
of our national industry. Ask any rnanufacturer you choose, and if hie tells you the
truth he will admit that hie tries to add to
the price of his product enough to regain
some of the loss hie suffers through this f orm
of taxation.
I wish now to talk briefiy on one or two
other matters. First, I thank the Government
for having raised the money grants to the
unîversities of Canada. The increase of the
grant from fifty cents to one dollar per head
of the population is reaily a fine service to
the nation.
One or two other comments I arn about to
make may sound rather pohitical, but they are
not really so, because I do not have to stand
for re-election. A universîty education rnay
mean nothing to sorne, but to the great
majority of our people it is extremely valuable. I can bring to mind boys and girls who
went to sehool in my home province of Manitoba and who, by reason of the education
they received at college, have been able to
occupy very prominent positions in this and
other countries. I thank Providence for the

There is just one little hitch to this whole

plan. I have a great respect for our French-

speaking friends of Quebec, who are just as
good Canadians as those of us whose native
language is English. French Canadians love

limited it to eastern Canada. I admit that
we have no bad lands in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta or British Columbia. Perish the thought!

Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But somobody from Mani-

toba might say to me: "Well, I-laig, wore you
asleep when that resolution went through?
Were you out of town? Didn't you know

JANUARY 16, 1957
that around the lakes in northern Manitoba
we have sorne pretty poor land that might
be used for other purposes than farrning?
When they approved the resolution, dealing
with agricuitural lands in the east, why
didn't you let them know that we might like
to have a similar investigation carried out
with respect to western Canada?"
As I say, I arn pleased that the Senate
will be asked to estabiish this commnittee, for
we have experienced men and women here
who can and will deal with this problem
without political prejudice. But I think the
inquiry should include ail of Canada, so that
the whole country may benefit from the coinmittee's work.
At a recent party convention a resolution
was introduced to reformn the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Were you at the
convention?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I certainly was, and I must
say that I didn't agree with the resolution
at ail. You hear ail sorts of suggestions
everywhere about reforming the Senate. I
told the people attending that politicai convention-an'd I would say the sarne to all
people who talk about reforming the Senate
-that they shouid read the history of parliamentary debates up to and following Confederation. I arn convinced that there neyer
would have been a Confederation of Canada
had there flot been provision for establishment of the Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is no doubt about
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no doubt at al
that the Maritime provinces wouid flot have
joined Confederation. I remember that on
one occasion His Honour the Speaker (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) when hie was a private rnember in this chamber, said that Nova Scotians
long feit pretty bitter about Confederation.
Well, I arn sure that without the establishment of the Senate Nova Scotia would never
have entered Confederation.
Han. Mr. Bouffard: There is no question
about that.
Han. Mr. Haig: It is recorded that some'body asked Georges Etienne Cartier what hie
thought about Quebec joining Confederation
and hie replied that Quebec understood and
expected to have equal representation with
Ontario in the Senate. As the four western
provinces were adrnitted to. Confederation
they were told quite candidly that their territorial division, despite its size, would be
entitled to only 24 seriators. In 1949, when
Newfoundland joined Confederation, the representation of the eastern provinces in the
82719-3

Senate was increased from 24 to 30. Those
provinces have only 33 members in the House
of Commons. Ontario has 85 representatives
in the House of Commons but only 24 in the
Senate. Confederation would neyer have
corne into existence without a Senate having
equal representation fromn Quebec, the Maritimnes and Ontario. Had I been a Maritimer
I arn positive that, considering rny own nature, I would have advised against joining
Confederation unless we were given equal
representation with the other territorial divisions. I would have done the saine had I
been a Quebecer as Cartier did.
Some people think that the Senate should
discuss and debate subjects just as the
House of Commons does. That is not the
purpose of the Senate. For sorne years
prior to Confederation, members of the
Legisiative Council, as the Upper House was
then called, were elected.
The situation
had becorne so, bad by 1864 that, when considering the constitution of the Senate, the
delegates to the Quebec Con! erence voted
unanimously for abolition of the elective
system and substitution of a purely nominative body. History records that Brown said,
"Appointed or nothing", and Macdonald
agreed.
Honourable senators, if in two,
sessions, say, the House of Commons sent
legisiation over to us and we refused it, and
if finally the Governrnent decided to, go to
the country on the issue and the people overwhelmingly supported the legisiation, we
would realize that we must accept the
voice o! the people. Some one once asked
Macdonald why every senator was obliged
to own property worth $4,000. Macdonald
replied: "Some day Canada rnay have a
government that wants to take ail our
property away !rom us. Do you think those
old boys there who have $4,000 worth o!
property will let them take it away? Not
if I know thern!"
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think Macdonald was
correct. Honourable senators, I would like
the boys and girls o! this country, and older
people as well, to read the history of Confederation in the Confederation Debates
and see what the purpose o! the Senate was.
Let me give one instance o! its use!ulness.
I think it was tin the year 1920 that Sir
Robert Borden, when hie was Prime Minister
o! Canada, brought into the House o! Commons a bil to repeal the Crowsnest Pass
agreernent. That was really a statute on the
books, not an agreernent, fixing the rates on
grain and grain products between Winnipeg
and Fort William, and between Winnipeg
and the coast; it governed the Canadian
Pacific Railway, but the other lines had to

SENATE
fall in line or they would not get the business. The bill to repeal the agreement passed
in the House of Commons, and then came to
the Senate. The Honourable Robert Watson,
from Manitoba, was one of the chief members of the Opposition in the Senate at that
time, and Sir James Lougheed, from Alberta,
was Leader of the Government. The great
majority of senators in those days were
and they, supported by
Conservatives,
Liberal senators, postponed the legislation
for a period of I think, three years, by which
time things had changed. The agreement is
still on the statute boks, and by it the farmers
of the three western wheat provinces are
saved a minimum of $24 million a year. Perhaps you will say that the railroad should
have that money, but a contract was made.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The saving is $50 million a year now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend says $50 million.
A representative of the C.P.R. has stated
that it is $19 million a year, but my figure is
$24 million a year. I do not know that we
deserve that figure as payment, but we do
not get it anyway. If, as my friend says,
the saving is $50 million a year, we should
strike at once and get more of that money,
for we are entitled to it.
I urge honourable senators themselves to
read the history of Confederation in its relation to the Senate. I am not a bit afraid
of a public discussion on this issue. The late
Senator Léger, of New Brunswick, told me
in 1927, when there was a conference of all
the provinces here, that at that time some
member of the Government brought up the
question of changing the constitution of the
Senate, but the provinces unanimously said
no. I think the same answer would be given
today. On the part of the people there is an
overriding hope that if some matter does not
receive fair consideration in the interests of
the people, the Senate is a place where redress
will be made.
Honourable senators, I have spoken longer
than I should have done, and perhaps I have
gone a little far afield. I will conclude by
urging again that the Leader of the Government push legislation through this house so
that it will reach the House of Commons
in plenty of time before prorogation. Those

of us here, if we are alive after the election
will come back, but some members of Commons will not. I hope that during the coming
year conditions will improve in our country
for all its people, including senators.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
debate was adjourned.
LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT
REPORT

OF

LIBRARIAN

ADOPTED

Hon. F. W. Gershaw moved that the report
of the Parliamentary Librarian for the year
1956, which was presented by the Honourable
the Speaker on January 9, be adopted.
He said: Honourable senators, a report on
the Library of Parliament is presented annually to the Senate. The present report, which
is signed by Mr. F. A. Hardy, Parliamentary
Librarian, outlines some of the activities during 1956. On June 19 of last year His
Excellency the Governor General, amidst
appropriate ceremonies, officially reopened the
Library, which had had to be largely rebuilt
because of damage by fire. For more than
three years members of the staff had occupied
temporary quarters in the Reading Room of
the House of Commons, the Supreme Court
building, and the Canadian Bank Note Company building. Recent official publications
of the Government of Canada, the provincial
Governments, and of the United Kingdom
and Commonwealth countries, as well as of
the United Nations Organization and affiliated
agencies, are now all housed uin the Library.
Considerable cataloguing of books, which had
been in storage, has been done, and within
the next few months, when these books have
been carefully arranged, a decision will bo
made as to which ones should be kept and
which should be sent to the National Library.
During the year the General Librarian, Mr.
Felix Desrochers, retired, after 23 years of
faithful service; and, under the Library of
Parliament Act, Mr. Guy Sylvestre, Assistant
Librarian, was appointed Associate Parliamentary Librarian, by the Governor General
in Council.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

DIVORCE
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's reports Nos. 5 to 12, dealing
with petitions for divorce, and moved that
the said reports be taken into consideration
at the next sitting.
The motion was agreed to, on division.
DIVORCE RULES
AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Roebuck presented the committee's report No. 13, recommending amendments to the standing rules relating to
divorce, and moved that the said report be
taken into consideration at the next sitting.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not propose to attempt a review of this particular
report today, but I do think that some explanation of how it originated is due to my
fellow senators.
It proposes a series of amendments to the
Senate rules on divorce. There are two main
propositions contained in this report. One is
that an applicant for divorce shall be required to name the co-respondent; and the
other is that a respondent when pleading
opposition to the petition shall be required
to give a short, concise statement of the
facts upon which he or she relies. There
are, of course, some details connected with
those two proposals traced out in extenso in
the report; and the report recommends some
other changes of a more or less inconsequential nature.
Honourable senators will have an opportunity to look over this report during the
recess between today and Tuesday, when I
shall move for concurrence, but I think I
should make clear at this time how it is
that the matter arises.
On the 31st of May last, referring to our
rules for dealing with divorce cases, I made
the following statement in this chamber:
I have not been at all satisfied, honourable
senators, with the state of the rules under which
we hear these cases. I have here the original
rules.
They were remodelled as long ago as
1906, and were adopted during the session of that
year. That is half a century ago.

82719-31

Then I detailed the very few and inconsequential changes that had been made in the
rules, and I said:
Those are ail the changes which have taken place
in the rules in the last half century, and it is
accordingly not to be thought that they are
up-to-date and streamlined according to moder
procedure. The pleading which comes before us,
as a result of the lack of demand on our part,
is often atrocious. In our form appear the words"on divers occasions"; and time and again therer
comes before us a husband charging a wife, or a
wife charging a husband, with having committed
adultery "on divers occasions".
In other words,
so far as the pleading is concerned, the whole
life of the respondent is put in review, because
adultery is charged at some time and some place,
with some person unnamed. That is not according to modern pleading, and one could not get
away with it in any other court.
By practice, though not by our rules, the petitioner must state particulars when they are demanded. But as this requirement does not appear
in the rules, a lawyer who does not know thepractice may come to Parliament at a great disadvantage in answer to such a pleading.
The
position of the petitioner may be even worseThe petitioner cannot demand particulars from
the respondent, and all manner of defences may
be put forward. For instance, there may be a
denial of the charges, or there may be an allegation of connivance, collusion, or condonation. The
respondent may allege that the parties have lived
together, or have forgiven each other; or that
the petitioner bas been guilty of such cruelty as
disentitles him or her to the relief claimed. It
seems to me that our rules should require from
the respondent, when the petition is opposed, a
short, concise statement of the facts upon which
he or she relies and which be or she intends to
prove, so that the petitioner shall have notice
of what he or she must meet. Similarly, the
petitioner should be required to give to the
respondent a concise statement of the facts upon
which he or she relies.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Would my friend mind
telling us what document he is reading
from?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am reading from
Hansard certain remarks I made in introducing this subject on May 31, 1956.
I 'then referred to "the more debatable
question as to whether the petitioner should
be required to name the co-respondent,"
and went on to say:
There is no such obligation at the present time.
There are two sides to this question. What appeals
to me is that if a husband charges his wife with
adultery with some person, the least he can do is
to tell her, if he knows, who that person is; or
vice versa, if the wife charges the husband and
she knows the narne of the person with whom she
alleges adultery bas been committed, her husband
is entitled to know who the accused person is
said to be as well as when and where the adultery
was committed. The committee, too, in my opinion,
is entitled to this information. Further, the corespondent so named should be served with notice
of the proceedings. I imagine that sometimes a
person so charged would like to come before the
committee and say, "The allegation is false; the
story is concocted; I have had no improper relations whatever with the respondent". Under the
present rules, the narnes of alleged co-respondents
are frequently mentioned in the evidence, but as

these persons have no knowledge of what is going

and then if there were good reason to adjourn
the matter we could do so. Of course, I
appreciate the need for dealing with this
expeditiously.

During my remarks an honourable senator

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bois, seconded by Hon. Mr. Smith, for an Address
in reply thereto.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators,Hon. Senaf ors: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -my first words must
surely be words of congratulation to the two
new senators who moved and seconded the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne.
The mover (Hon. Mr. Bois) spoke in the
French language, his mother tongue. Some
honourable senators were fortunate enough to
be able to follow his entfre remarks; some of
us could follow them to a consîderable extent; and other honourable senators, who do
not speak French at ail, are now able to
read in Hansard the English translation of
his speech. I would like to say a few words
of congratulation to our honourable colleagué
in French.
(Translation):
May I be allowed to congratulate you on
your excellent speech. It is always a rather
difficuit task, even for an experienced parliamentarian, to open the debate on the Addres p
in reply to the Speech from the Throne, but
our new colleague spoke with both ease and
eloquence. It is probably because he waà
discussing a subject which is close to, his
heart and with which he is very well
acquainted. He has rendered great service,
especially to the farmers of Quebec. We
sincerely hope that he will long remain i
our midst to serve the people of Canada.
(Text):
The motion for the Address was secondedT
by the new senator fromn British Columbia
(Hon. Mr. Smith), a former member of the
Legislature of his province. During his remarks he named some other senators who
were once members of that house. I arn
impressed by the fact that all the senators
from British Columbia have served in either
the Legislature of that province or the
House of Commons. Senator Hodges is a
former Speaker of the Legislature. Senator
Farris was for some years the provincial
Attorney General and Minister of Labour.
Senator McKeen was a member of the Legislature for several years. Senator Turgeon
was for a number of years a member (if
the Legislature of Alberta, and later on
represented a British Columbia constituency
in the House of Commons for a considerable
time. Senator Reid was not only a member
of the House of Commons during a lengthy
period, but served as Parliamentary Assistant to three ministers: the Minister of
National Revenue, the Minister of Fisheries
and the Minister of National Health and
Welf are. I do not think any other province
can dlaim the distinction of having as its
representatives in the Senate men and women
who have had the lengthy legisiative experience that the senators from British
Columbia have had.

SENATE
The seconder of the motion is familiar with
parliamentary rules and procedure. He spoke
freely and eloquently, and did not rely on a
written text. We look forward to many
interesting addresses from both the mover

and the seconder.

I say to the seconder, as I

said in French to the mover, that I trust he
will be with us for many years to comre.

I should like to take this opportunity of
congratulating the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).

Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I refer not only to
his address of yesterday, which we all
enjoyed very much, but more especially to
an occasion during the convention of a great
national party which was held in Ottawa
last December. During that meeting the
question of the reform of the Senate came
up, and the Leader of the Opposition was
quick to respond and to defend this house.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That was a courageous stand for hirn to take. I am informed
that, had the hour not been so late, his
eloquent remarks would have prompted
others to take a similar stand in defence of
the Senate. I am sure that in congratulating
him I speak for all honourable senators.
In the course of his address yesterday the
Leader of the Opposition suggested that this
house should deal with the legislation on its
Order Paper as rapidly as possible, consistently with most careful consideration, in
order not to hold up the work of the House
of Commons. Well, honourable senators, I
do not think this house has ever held up the
work of the other house. For some reason
or other, which my honourable friends may
know of, the members of the other house
take much longer in their consideration of
legislation than we do. I am not criticizing
them for doing so; in fact we would expect
them to do so. They are elected by the
people, and their constituents want to hear
what each member has to say about the
matters under consideration.
However, instead of our holding up the
work of the House of Commons, it has been
the other way around during the time that I
have been in the Senate: we have waited for
the House of Commons to pass along legislation to us. I do not think conditions will be
different this session, especially as it is in an
election year. I say "in an election year"
because the honourable Leader of the Opposition informed us yesterday that there would
be an election this summer. In fact, he
seems to know the date of the election. He
has always said that he holds the Prime
Minister in the very highest regard and

esteem, and when he spoke with such conviction I began to think that the Prime Minister had given him the date of the election a
little prior to the public announcement. Let
me say this: I know that with the co-operation
we will receive from the Leader of the
Opposition this session, as we have in the
past the legislation on our Order Paper will
be dealt with in good time and there will not
be any delay on the part of this house.
Honourable senators have noticed that there
is considerable work ahead of us this year,
but the Order Paper is not entirely reliable
in so far as notice of work is concerned. A
few minutes ago we were discussing a change
in the rules relating to divorce. Now, the
Order Paper gives no idea of the amount of
work which is before the Divorce Committee.
A tremendous undertaking devolves upon

the
chairman informed us the other day that
already 293 petitions have been filed, and that
notice of 418 petitions has been published in
the Canada Gazette. This means that the
committee must between now and . . . What
was the date the Leader of the Opposition
gave for the election?
Hon. Mr. Haig: June 17.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And Parliament would
be dissolved, I think he saidHon. Mr. Haig: Between the 7th and 10th
of April.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: So between now and
the 10th of April this committee must deal
with 418 applications for divorce. But I have
no doubt, and I am sure the house has no
doubt, that the committee can cope with this
vast amount of work. It has done as much in
as short a period in the past. The committee
is an excellent one, and I wish I had the time
to refer to its members individually.
In glancing over the roster the other day I
noticed there was missing one name which

had appeared there for 23 years, the name of
the Honourable Senator Aseltine. Throughout that long period he served this house as
a member of the Divorce Committee, and I
believe for 10 years he was its chairman.
Hon. Senaors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I want at this time
to express to him our appreciation of the
faithful service which he gave. And I am
sure I express the sentiment of the present
chairman and members of the committee in
voicing the hope that after he has had a
rest this year he will want to come back next
year. I know they would warmly welcome
him.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.

JANUARY 17, 1957
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In reading over the
membership list I also noticed that there are
two new members. One is a new member
of this house, and the other is the honourable
senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr.
Isnor). I am told that be bas agreed to
serve on this committee, that his name was
not put on the list without his consent. I
want to assure him that I appreciate, as I
know all members of this bouse do, the fact
that he is prepared to give his time to this
very necessary work, especially when he is
so busily engaged in so many other activities
of this bouse.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I was more interested in the Speech from
the Throne this session than at any other
time since I have been a member of the
Senate. I notice that on this occasion, for
the first time in my memory, the Senate was
mentioned twice in the Speech from the
Throne, and both times in connection with
very important legislation.
I will read one of the paragraphs in which
the Senate is mentioned:
You will be asked to consider a revision of the
law controlling narcotic drugs in the light of the
report of the Senate committee on the use of
narcotics in Canada.
Honourable senators, I feel that this house,
and more especially the chairman and members of that committee, rendered a splendid
service to the country in making an inquiry
into the very difficult problem of the narcotic
drug traffic in Canada. As we know, the committee spent a long time on the matter, heard
evidence not only at Ottawa but at other
points, and studied the evidence thoroughly
before making a report. Its report has not
been pigeon-holed; on the contrary, it is the
basis of the Narcotic Control Bill, which was
introduced in the Senate last week.
May I read from the Speech from the
Throne the other paragraph in which the
Senate is mentioned:
It is proposed to recommend in the Senate the
establishment of a committee to consider. what
should be done to make better use of land for
agriculture and thus to contribute more effectively
to the improvement of agricultural production and
the incomes of those engaged in it.

The Leader of the Opposition suggested
yesterday that the inquiry would be confined
to eastern Canada. I do not see any such
limitation in that paragraph in the Speech
from the Throne. It is possible that the
committee will feel it is desirable to make
inquiry in eastern Canada first, since we
already have on the statute books an act
known as the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation
Act, under the provisions of which considerable land. I understand, has been improved

and reclaimed in order to bring about a
better production of crops in the west.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, that is true.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Those who are
familiar with the workings of that act will
be able to render considerable assistance to
this committee when it is set up. I would
like to assure the Leader of the Opposition
now that, so far as I am concerned, I will
surely recommend that some members of this
bouse from western Canada should serve on
that committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There are in this
house a number of members especially wellqualified to serve on this committee. Some
of them have been here a number of years,
and several who have recently joined us can
be termed specialists in agriculture. Probably three of them will qualify as farmers.
For instance, from the west there is Senator
Boucher. And from central Canada there is
Senator Bois, Doctor of Agricultural Science,
who is President and General Manager of
the executive council of the Co-operative
Federation of Quebec. I know, from his
speech of last Tuesday, that he has taken a
great interest in the subject which will be
considered when this committee is set up.
The third new senator whom I have in mind
is Senator Taylor, from New Brunswick. At
one time he was Minister of Agriculture for
that province; indeed, my honourable friend
the senator from Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald)
remarked to me the other day that our new
colleague was the best Minister of Agriculture the Maritime provinces had ever known.
I told him I would accept that statement with
one reservation, and that was with respect to
the senator from Kings himself, who was
formerly Minister of Agriculture of Nova
Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: And a good one.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I cite these names
merely to indicate that there are in the
Senate men well quahified to carry out this
important work.
While I am mentioning the Maritime provinces may I also refer very briefly to the
Gordon report. I do not intend to discuss
that report today; but I have been quite concerned with what I have heard and read in
the press with regard to the findings of the
commission, more particularly as they relate
to the Maritime provinces and, specifically, to
Nova Scotia. I do not gather from the report
that the commission recommended a wholesale removal of people from the Maritimes
to other parts of Canada. I do not think that

SENATE
conclusion can be read into the report. As I
read it, there is a suggestion that if some
people in these provinces feel inclined to
migrate to other parts of Canada they should
receive some assistance for that purpose, but
it is not recommended that an effort should
be made to move the very wonderful people
of these great provinces to other parts of

Canada. I say, "wonderful people" advisedly,
because I know of the contribution which
they have made to Church and State, to
industry, commerce, education and law
throughout the country. Permit me to mention a few names.
In matters of State one thinks immediately
of such stalwarts as Howe and Tilley; of
former Prime Ministers of Canada, Sir John
Thompson, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir Robert
Borden and the Right Honourable R. B.
Bennett, later Viscount Bennett. We call to
mind also men with whom many of us have
been personally familiar: Ilsley, Ralston,
Angus L. Macdonald, and a host of other
brilliant men who have given leadership in
state affairs.
In reference to the Church, one thinks of
such men as former President Falconer of the
University of Toronto, Archbishop MacNeill,
Cardinal McGuigan, and others, with whom
I have been personally acquainted, including
the MacKinnon family, many of whom served
the Church in my province.
In finance, one recalls such bankers as
Spinney and Inman; the former, President
of the Royal Bank; the latter, President of
the Bank of Nova Scotia.
In commerce and industry these provinces
have produced men like Lord Beaverbrook,
Sir James Dunn, Cyrus Eaton, Isaac Killam
and "Larry" Forsyth.
In the field of education, university heads
right across this country have come from
the Maritimes. I need refer only to Sidney
Smith, of the University of Toronto; Dr.
Norman M. Mackenzie, of the University of
British Columbia; A. W. Trueman, former
head of the University of Manitoba; Dr. H.
M. Tory, who founded Carleton College, and
Dr. Max. MacOldrum, its first Principal; and
also C. J. Mackenzie, with whom many of us
are personally acquainted, and who until
recently was head of the National Research
Council.
In the domain of law I would like to
mention Sir Louis Davis and Judge Ritchie,
both former Chief Justices of Canada.
I could go on at length, but I do not intend
'to do so. I think, however, I should not
leave the subject without referring to some
of our own colleagues. I will not allude to
those still residing in New Brunswick; but

natives of that province who now represent
in this chamber other parts of Canada include Senator Farris and Senator Turgeon;
and we all recall the late Dr. King, who was
at one time a Speaker of this House and before that a Minister of the Crown in the
federal Government, as well as in the Government of British Columbia; also, from Prince
Edward Island, the late Senator Ross, who
May I name one
passed away recently.
other who has risen to great distinction and
is, happily, with us: I refer to our own
distinguished Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
a native of the Maritime provinces.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
referred yesterday to university grants and
said he was very pleased that the sum
per capita has been increased from fifty cents
to one dollar. But he did not mention the
Canada Council, which was referred to in
the Speech from the Throne. The Prime
Minister, in speaking about the establishment
of this body, said that the sum of $50 million
would be set aside for university construction across Canada. That money will be
over and above the grants to which the
Leader of the Opposition referred.
I think it is a fine thing that Canada is
making this provision for education, for
there is a real danger that in the development of a new country, such as ours, we may
emphasize the development of natural
resources and industry, forgetting in the
rush of our ýtimes to pay proper attention
to cultural development. I am sure that
everyone in this chamber supports the action
being taken by the Government to provide
for the better education of our people, which
is concerned wi.th more than the material
side of life.
The Leader of the Opposition stated that
one province had not indicated its acceptance of these grants; and that it undoubtedly
feels the dominion Government, in making
them, would encroach upon provincial rights
as set out in the British North America Act,
and thereby undermine the preservation of

their ancient culture.

I am glad my honour-

able friend does not share that view, and

I am sure there are not many here who do.
The presidents of many Canadian universities do not; and one of these is Dr. Sidney
Smith, President of the University of
Toronto, which I attended. He feels that
Mr. St. Laurent has no desire to encroach
upon the rights of any province. I should
like to read what Dr. Smith said when he

JANUARY 17, 1957
presented Mr. St. Laurent at the Conference
of Canadian Universities held at Ottawa in
November:
It is characteristie of Mr. St. Laurent that at
such an anxious period he finds the time to hobnob with educationists. Wars and rumours of war
bring the idea of grim survival to the forefront
of our minds, but he does not lose sight of the
further question: Survival for what? Never has
there been a Prime Minister of Canada who
has apprehended so well the essence of higher
education.
Later he went on to say:
The aid that his Government has extended to
the Canadian universities bas been given without
a hint of a tendency of a suggestion of a suspicion
of a trend towards a desire to undermine their
academic freedom.

Honourable senators, there are a few other
subjects which I should like to discuss. One
of them is the happy economie condition in
which Canada finds itself. During the past
year our gross national production reached
a new level of $29j billion. This reflects
expansion in every phase of Canadian life.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
referred to our foreign trade. Well, there
has been an unparalleled expansion in our
foreign trade, and during 1956 the value of
our merchandise exports reached the figure
of $4.85 billion, which was 12 per cent
higher than in 1955.
The Leader of the Opposition also made
reference to the sale of wheat. I should like
to point out that our larger wheat shipments
this year accounted for more than one-third
of the increase in the value of our merchandise exports. As a matter of fact, our
wheat shipments in 1956 were higher than
they have been since the big year of 1952, in
spite of the American give-away or surplus
disposal program. However, I shall deal with
that later in more detail. All I wish to say
now is that we had a high exportation of

wheat this year.
Among other noteworthy developments in
our foreign trade was the export of crude
petroleum products, which in 1956 exceeded
the 1955 figure by $100 million, which was a
fourfold increase over the preceding year;
and our foreign sale of iron ore increased
over the previous year from $100 million to
$160 million.
In nearly every item of
primary production-newsprint, copper, chemicals, aircraft and others-there have been
increases on our export side. The only exception was lumber, in which there was a
decline because of lower sales in both the

United Kingdom and the United States. I
mention this exception so that honourable
senators will realize I am not dealing solely
with the good side of the picture. Where
we have had a decline I do not hesitate to
bring it to your attention.
82719-4

Much has been said, particularly by the
Leader of the Opposition, of our unfavourable
balance of trade with the United States. Well,
I do not like having an adverse trade balance
with that country, but we must remember
that Canada is still under development. My
honourable friend said that this adverse trade
balance was due to the fact that our costs
were too high. I would ask honourable senators if our costs are really higher than those
in the United States. The real reason for our
present adverse balance of trade with the
United States is that we are bringing in
capital goods from that country for the development of our natural resources, and when
that development is fully under way our
exports will soon catch up. For the most
part these imports have consisted of machinery and equipment, of steel and other
industrial materials that we cannot produce
here. I emphasize that the adverse trade
balance is not due to the fact that our costs
are too high.
The Leader of the Opposition made some
reference to the failure of the Government
to provide for complete disposal of the wheat
surplus in the west. I have pointed out. already that our improved wheat sales have
accounted for a large portion of the upswing
in our export position during the past year.
If I may be permitted to elaborate a little
on this feature, I should like to give some
figures to prove our achievements in this
regard. Our western friends will find these
figures of great interest.
During the period of the crop year of
1955-56 from August 1, 1955 to January 4,
1956, the marketings of all grains amounted
to 167.4 million bushels. During the same
period of this crop year they happened to be
251.7 million bushels, an increase of 94.3 million bushels over the period of a year ago.
During the first nine months of 1956 producers in the Prairie provinces received from
grain $526 million, an increase of more than
$150 million over the same period in 1955. It
is likely that the farm income for 1956 from
the sale of grain in the Prairie provinces
will have exceeded those of 1955 by over $200
million.
Honourable senators, those are staggering
amounts; I have no doubt that they are
correct.
The Leader of the Opposition referred to
the danger of inflation in Canada. I can
assure him that the threat of inflation also
gives me great concern, as it must many other
honourable members of this house. The current economic boom in this country, with its
continued new highs, which I have already
mentioned, has brought with it, of course,
many very serious problems, not the least of

SENATE
which, as the Leader of the Opposition stated,
is the trend toward inflation.
In 1956 Canada's gross national product
reached over $29.5 billion, which is, of course,
an all-time high, and roughly 11 per cent
above that of the previous year. This condition has predisposed Canadians toward an
overall rate of spending which places quite a
strain on our economy.
I am happy to say that unemployment has
reached a very low level, and although the
supply of industrial materials is greater than
ever before, there are shortages here and
there, particularly in respect of capital goods
and construction. These demands on our industrial materials, of course, are due to the
very high level of capital expenditure in this
country. Heavy investment is taking place
right across the nation in our resource industries, in manufacturing and service industries,
and in provincial, municipal, and other capital projects. Indeed, it is estimated that the
total capital expenditure in 1956 in Canada
will be about $7.5 billion, or a quarter greater
than in 1955. This rate of investment is even
higher in Canada on a per capita basis than
in the United States; in fact, I would say it
is higher than in any other country in the
world. The federal Government, in recognizing this problem, has endeavoured to keep
down its expenditures on goods and services
in the past year to the level of 1955 so as not
to put too great a strain on the total supply
of capital goods or services available, but notwithstanding this, the rate of spending continues to increase. I feel that if these
inflationary tendencies are not checked in
some way the situation could be one that
might snowball into enormous proportions
and have terrible consequences for many
years to come. When inflation gets out of
hand, before long complete disaster follows.
We have seen that happen in so many countries in the world. At first, everybody seems
to have lots of money, but when inflation
comes who is hit first? It is the working
man, the poor man, who is first affected, for
lie finds that his money has little purchasing
value. Others, who have money, are also
affected, for they find that their money will
not buy goods. The result is that, in effect,
no one has money of any value.
Honourable senators, I do not think that
is likely to happen in Canada, but we have
seen it happen in other countries and surely
we should be on guard. The Leader of the
Opposition has given his warning, and I
give my warning, too. In his address to
Congress on the state of the Union, the
other day, the President of the United States
expressed the same warning, stating that the
greatest threat to the United States was

inflation. The Chairman and Presldent of
the Royal Bank of Canada, Mr. James Muir,
in his address at the annual meeting of the
shareholders, gave a similar warning.
Honourable senators, as I have said, I do
not feel this is going to happen in Canada.
J am very optimistic about Canada. After
having seen what has taken place in other
countries, I think we are too sensible to allow
such a condition to develop here, and we are
guarding against it. The Leader of the Opposition said we should be doing more to guard
against it, but lie made no proposal. I think
it was the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) who asked him what he
proposed. I know that the steps that are
now being taken in Canada appear to affect
some citizens more than others. But restrictions at any time are bound to vary in their
application on the citizens of the country.
At all events, let me assure you that our
Government is doing its best to find the
most effective way of handling the problem
of inflation.
But the Government alone
cannot solve our difficulties.
As the
President of the United States said the other
day, a government must have the support of
labour, of industry and everyone else in
the country to meet and withstand the tide
of inflation.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
delay you long. As I said earlier, I am an
optimist. One feature of the Gordon report
which appealed strongly to me was the rosy
picture it painted of the future prospects of
Canada and of the opportunities which await
the youth of this growing country. We may
disagree with some of the matters contained
in the report, but I am sure the note of
hopefulness appeals to us all. We believe in
our country; we know it is the greatest
country in the world. But the privilege of
living in this promising land carries with it
responsibilities. It is our duty, honourable
senators, to do our part to guide Canada in
the course it should follow. I emphasize, that
is a job not only for the Government. but
for every Canadian citizen who has national
pride and feels he has a responsibility to
do his part in the best interests of Canada.
I am sure all honourable senators, irrespective
of party affiliation, have as their one great
aim the serving of Canada to the best of their
ability, to the end that it will remain the
best and happiest country in the years that
lie ahead.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Would the honourable
leader permit a question? He made reference to the dire things that could happen if
we suffered a full dose of inflation. Well,
we all remember what happened in Germany

JANUARY 17, 1957
in the years preceding the Second World
War. I have tried for a long time ta flnd
someone who cauld tell me what would have
happened in that country had a good leader,
instead of Hitler, corne into power. Certainly Germany had gone the full course in
inflation, yet it was able to build Up an
immense war machine that came very nearly
defeating the rest of the free world, and at
the same time it made vast irnprovements in
buildings, roads and other public works.
May I say that I personally ar n ot frightened of inflation.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: What is your question?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn quite aware
that inflation cannot destroy our natural resources, but it can cause them ta remain
undeveloped for many years.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The resources of Germany did nat remain undeveloped because
af inflation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But inflation could
prevent aur resaurces from being f ully developed and leave us with an insufficient

82719--4,

supply of food. Certaînly unrestricted inflation would end in destroying our monetary
systern. Then we would have ta start ail
over again, without capital and with aur
developrnental processes; set back for generatians ta corne.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, January 17, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bois,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops), for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in rising to take part in the debate on the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, I wish at the outset to
commend most sincerely the speeches made
by the mover and the seconder of the Address.
I do not usually do this, but on the present
occasion I feel I should. It is true that
I did not follow the remarks of the mover
(Hon. Mr. Bois) when he was addressing the
house in French, but I made it a point to
read the English translation and I want to
tell him that in my opinion it was an excellent speech, particularly from the point of
view of agriculture. The honourable senator
went into a great deal of detail and I would
commend the information to any honourable
senator who wishes to take the time to read
it. It would be worth while for anyone's
future reference.

Also I am sure I express the sentiment of
the whole house when I say that the seconder,
the new senator from Kamloops (Hon. Mr.
Smith), made a splendid impression. He
relied on his own spoken remarks, for he
had no written speech before him, and in
my opinion this is all to the good. May I
say to him, in all kindliness, that it was
nice of him to make references to me, but
he had no need to apologize for doing so.
I enjoyed his remarks on the proposed "Pink
Salmon Treaty" very much, and I can assure
him that he will hear lots about that subject
before this session is over, for I expect to
make quite a lengthy speech on the salmon
industry and the dangers facing us in British
Columbia from the great financial concerns
out there which would like to grab or steal
the last heritages we have left. I am particularly glad to welcome the honourable
senator to the group of supporters of the
salmon fisheries, because in that part of
the country where he lives, or just beyond
it, the people, if I guess aright, are more
interested in industry than in salmon. Sometimes I have occasion to go up through that
part of the country, and I speak to many
people in the separate localities, and they
say, "Oh, we are not interested in salmon, we

JANUARY 22, 1957

are interested in industry". That is thç
reason why I deeply appreciate the splendid
support the honourable senator from Kamloops indicated when he spoke the other
evening.
Honourable senators, I wish to say something which cannot be too often repeated
to the people of British Columbia, namely,
that even if the Columbia River is developed
and the Fraser is left alone, there will stili
be a danger to the people of the interior that
some aluminum industry might grab the
block of power. 1 doubt if the big Alcan
Company, which was given one of our greatest
heritages and will eventually develop close
to 2 million horsepower, will ever provide
employmnent for more than 10,000 men. When
one considers that just over one million horsepower is developed at the present time in
the whole of British Columbia, providing
employment for about 750,000 men and
women, the danger is evident if the great
block of power which can be developed at
the proposed Mica dam in British Columbia
is given away or purchased for power purposes in the production of aluminum. It
would nlot resuit in the large number of
jobs that some people seem to envisage.
I wish now to deal with one or two matters
outlined in the Speech from the Throne.
As one who has had considerable municipal
experience I arn very glad indeed to hear of
the proposed extra grants to the municipalities. However, in view of the heavy expenditures by the municipalities, owing to
the building of bouses within their boundaries, I suggest that the Government should
consider loans at 2 per cent for the construction of sewers and public works. Su'ch
liquidating loans would, I think, be of great
assistance to the muncipalities, and would
not increase the inflationary trend that we
hear so much about.
I arn pleased to see that the Government
is recognizing the universities by giving
grants for extra buildings and for otýher purposes. However, I would appeal for special
federal aid for the University of British
Columbia to assist in the teaching of fishery
biologists. As one who has had something
to do with the engaging of biologists of high
calibre, may I say that we in British
Columbia find ourselves bandicapped because of lack of funds for this purpose. The
federal Government, I know, sometimes
gives special grants for the furthering of
certain branches of education, and I think
this is a specialty which merits some assistan-ce. For the most part we have te go to
the United States to secure experienced and
high-callbre biologists who specialize in
fisheries. Just before I left home recently
I was speaking to the President of the University of British Columbia, who intimazed,

to me that much could be attained in this
field if some further financial assistance was
f orthcoming.
My next suggestion may give rise to a
smile among honourable senators. We have
all noted the proposed measure for the
establishment of a Canada Council for the
Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. While
I arn all li faveur of such an endeavour, I
hope it does nlot contemplate producing any
more Elvis Presleys. I neyer realized that I
was s0 far out of date until I saw this artist
on a C.B.C. television production. Heaven
help us if that is the way our generation is
going. Nothing more need be said.
At this time when we are giving s0 much
attention to our young people, in an age
when the woodshed bas been banished, when
our boys and girls are being kept at school
up to the ages of 18 and 19, when many
boys of 14 years demand a car of their own
and we ail are lin some danger of losing the
use of our legs, I suggest that consideration
be given to the establishment of an organized
system for the training of athietes such as
has been set up in Australia. The success
of that country ini this respect was brought
to our attention particularly during the
recent Olympie games. The plan there is to
train athietes from. 10 years of age upwards
on a mass production scale. Honourable
senators will recaîl that at the recent games
Australian at-hletes of 14 years of age stood
up well against grown men. The results of
the ýgames s-howed that Australia ranked
third, being surpassed only by the two
iargest countries, the United States and
Russia.
Now that we are giving s0 much thought
to our teenagers and the problem of juvenile
delinquency, and when the threat of the
Soviet hangs over us, let us not forget that
in Russia, while a great deal of attention is
being given to education, the people are
working f ar harder-they have to-than
those in this country. When we talk of the
Gordon Commission report and glow with
pride over the prospect that as time goes on
we will work shorter hours, have more money
and enjoy greater luxuries, let us not forget
that there are certain factors that *can interfere with and eclipse that prospect. I believe that a serious plan for training athletes
in this country would not only bring health
to our youth, but would do much to safeguard our nation and keep it virile.
As some honourable senators know, in
1955 1 had the pleasure and privilege of
visiting my native land after an absence of
45 years. One thing partlcularly struck mne
and I am passing it along. My wife and I
visited the Aberdeen fish market, because I
arn interested in the handling of fish. Neyer
in my life had I seen so many sea-gulls,

SENATE
either flying around or walking on top of the
thousands of boxes of fish. One of the attendants said to me, "Do you know, sir, that
when the last great strike took place
hundreds of sea-gulls died, because they did
not know how to get food for themselves."
He explained that from the time the gulls

were born they came to these boxes and
were fed, but when the strike took place,
there being no fish, all the young gulls died,
for they had lost the knowledge of how to
obtain food by their own efforts. The thought
occurred to me that perhaps that could happen to people also in some countries. We
might lose the art of walking, we might lose
the knowledge of how to maintain our way of
life and not be able to fend for ourselves.
Honourable senators, we have been hearing
a great deal about the Hungarian refugees
and I want to say a word regarding them.
I note that the United Nations bas been
appealing to Hungary, or to the Soviet, to
allow observers to go into Budapest to see
conditions for themselves and speak to the
people. I think that they do not need to
wait for permission to go there to find out
information; they can learn all they want to
know from the refugees who have come over
here. Whether or not the time is opportune
for a delegation from the United Nations to
go to Budapest I do not know, but the latest
decree issued by the Soviet in regard to that
city would lead one to doubt that anyone
there would dare to speak freely. By that
decree persons who speak freely are punishable by death. If any committee or individual did go to Budapest to obtain information, I cannot imagine the people there
coming forward and speaking openly and
freely. I am not now referring to those who
have been taking advantage of things or those
who are said to have run out of the country,
but I am thinking of the people who took part
in the revolution, who risked their lives to
fight the Russians. Let a committee travel
through Canada or the United States, and in
my opinion they will get a much fuller and
more honest story than would be obtainable
in Budapest.
I am very glad that we have not had
trouble with Hungarian refugees such as
other countries seem to be having. I note that
the United States has run into some difficulties during the recent migration, and a bill
has been introduced in Congress to curb the
influx. There has been trouble also in some
of the refugee camps in France. We indeed
have been very fortunate so far in this
respect.
I hope I will not be accused of saying this
just because of blood ties, but I trust the
Canadian Government will be as liberal with
the English, Irish, Welsh and Scots who want
to come over here as it has been with the

Hungarians. I may be wrong, but statements
made by many refugees indicate that they do
not intend to settle down here, but are resting
temporarily in this safe and generous country
and later will go back to their own native
land where their relatives still are. I would
not blame them if they did. But many people
in the Old Country sec a warning, a writing
on the wall, so to speak, and of their own
choice want to come to Canada. Considering
the history of the British people and what
they have done to defend democracy, and in
view of what is being done for these refugees
from Hungary, I hope we will deal just as
kindly and generously with the great numbers
who want to come here from the Old Country.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Such a policy would do
the Old Country good, for there are far too
many people in Britain now for it to feed.
Also it certainly would be all to the good for
us if we generously helped quite a number
of British people to move to this country.
As to the British-French-Israeli-Egyptian
affair over the Suez Canal, I doubt if the
complete story will be revealed for some time,
if ever. Apart from all the condemnations of
the actions of Britain and France, one thing
stands out clearly above all others: but for
the action taken by Britain and France the
United Nations might never have acted.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think that is clearly
evident to all.
The first question we should ask ourselves
in viewing the situation there is: Was there
a plot by Russia with Nasser not only to
make war or annihilate Israel but also to
drive the British and French out of the Suez
zone? In other words, was there a plot to
take over the Middle East? I am net going
to quote at length, but the headlines in the
newspaper I hold in my hand tell the story:
"Russ Arms Plot Bared by Britain". The
article that follows reads in part:
The magnitude

of the Russian plot to take over

The build up of Russian arms in
over the past year was totalled

Hon. Mr. Quinn: What newspaper are you
quoting from?

Hon. Mr. Reid: The Vancouver Province,
of Tuesday, November 13, 1956. Outlined in
the article is the number of planes, tanks,
rifles and other things that had reached
Egypt and Syria from the Soviet. I do not
think anyone is going to deny the facts. That
makes the picture, to me at least, very clear
indeed.
In the opinion of many people outside of
Great Britain-yes, of many people in the

JANUARY 22, 1957
United States and in this country too-intervention by France and Britain was due first
of all to the impotence of the United Nations,
and, secondly, to the great indecision or indecisions of the United States, and the policy of
that country, not to British policy.
It is to be noted that former United States
Minister Cafferty had a lot to do with installing the Nasser regime; and further it has
been revealed that the United States
promised to supply oil to Britain and France
if they would yield unconditionally to Nasser.
I will not read all the material I have here,
but there are one or two passages which
I think I should put on record. It is headed:
"We Bury Our Friends" and it has been
printed in the Washington Post, the New
York Herald Tribune, and the New York
Times. It states:
We-

That is, the United States.
-pilloried
our major allies for taking military
measures to halt Moscow's domination of Egypt and
through Egypt of the whole Middle East. We
of Nasser, which so
prevented the downfal
obviously would have been a boon to peace. We
helped cancel out the military advantage gained
by Anglo-French initiative, undermined the prestige
and authority of these two nations and lent our
weight in the crippling of their economic vitality.
Yet now we concede in effect that the prospect
of Soviet hegemony over the Middle East is terrifying enough to justify unilateral employment of
Western power. Having deepened the vacuum Into
which Soviet influence now flows more alarmingly
than before, we add insult to injury by claiming
for ourselves alone-

That is, the United States.
-the right to act what we denied to England and
France.
How paradoxical can one government
become without losing the respect of foes along with
the confidence of friends? . . . Having almost
mortally wounded our best friends, we seem to be
preparing to bury them.
True, there is a face-saving clause. It is asserted
that the United States, unlike Britain and France,
will use force only with the "consent" of the'
nations endangered by Soviet aggression. But this
is palpably diplomatic double-talk. Soviet aggresSion is most unlikely to take the form of overt
military attack. The Kremlin bas found infiltration and subversion-of the order now on display
in Syria-more to its taste and its talents. . . .
It was to forestall the covert, non-violent and
more deadly sort of aggression that London and
Paris acted in November, only to be slapped down
and deeply weakened for their daring. Now the
United States, which led the condemnation proceedings while Nasser cheered and Moscow jeered,
declares that it will do what Britain and France
did, if and when necessary.

I shall have one or two things to say
regarding the Soviets. Although I did not
attend the special session in the fall, I was
particularly pleased with the strong statement of the honourable senator from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Molson) about keeping the
Russians out of this country, and I compliment him on it. I have said many such
things about Russia and her rulers. I
noticed that the other evening a member of
Parliament complaiined that he was still

49

getting literature from the Soviet Embassy.
If any honourable members are receiving
this material and want to get rid of it, I will
tell them how they can do so. You will
remember that at the regular session last
year I put a question on the Order Paper
as to whether our Embassy in Moscow had
the right to do what is being done by the
Soviet Embassy in Ottawa in the matter of
Immediately my
distributing literature.
question was drawn to the attention of Soviet
officials-which was next day-they eut me
off their mailing list, and I have received
nothing since. I asked a friend, "Are you still
getting some of this propaganda, as I call it,
from the Soviet?" He said, "Oh, yes". I
remarked, "Well, if you don't want it, just
do as I do, and act as they act." Why
should we not do so? I think we have been
a nation of fools to put out the red mat for
them in this country. We did so in my city.
I refused to attend any of the official funeBoth
tions tendered to these visitors.
delegations which came out there had the
same story. The delegation representing the
fishing industry were going to buy fishing
boats from us: later, when two men from
Moscow toured our lumber camps, they
announced that they proposed to buy Canadian machinery for lumbering. Neither
delegation had the intention of buying anything. Since they went home not a word has
been heard from them by either the builders
of fishing boats or the manufacturers of
machinery.
I wonder when our people are going to
wake up. Of course the Soviet wants peace,
though many may not believe it. In my
opinion she will not launch a war so long
as she is gaining so much by the methods
she is pursuing, and by which she is now
penetrating the Middle East. No one can
tell just what is going to happen there.
It will take two minutes or so, honourable
senators, to read what I believe is a salutary
message both for members of the Senate
and for the people of Canada generally. This
is from an article by Bruce Hutchison, one
of Canada's ablest writers, published in the
FinancialPost. It states in part:

NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Calvert C. Prati: Honourable senators, I wish to give notice of the following
inquiry of the Governrment:
Have plans been prepared for the building of an
airstrip at Wabana, Newfoundland, and, if so,
when does the Department of Transport propose
to proceed with the work?

Because the need for serving the industrial
community of Wabana, with its population
of over ten thousand, and particularly because of the ice blockades which sometimes

isolate Bell Island, Conception Bay, it is
generally regarded that the provision of an
airstrip there as auxiliary to the adjacent
airport at Torbay is a required public service of great necessity, and I wish this house
to be informed

of what progress may

be

anticipated in this connection.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I shall endeavour to
get any information I can.
Hon. Mr. Prati: Thank you.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session

SENATE

and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bois, seconded by
Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops), for an Address
in reply thereto.
Hon. W. Ruperi Davies: Honourable senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: -this speech is going to
be an ordeal for me, but I trust not for you.
I never get to my feet to speak to the menbers of this distinguished chamber without
calling to mind an occasion when I approached
a distinguished Conservative statesman and
asked him if he would come to an opening
meeting of a group of newspapermen at the
Chateau Laurier. He replied that he would
come on one condition-that he not be asked
to make a speech. I said, "Surely you do
not mind making a speech," as he confessed
"I am scared stiff every time I get to my
feet."
Well, honourable senators, there are a good
many here who are not scared stiff of making
a speech, and I am glad we have such members in this chamber.
I once had an editor working for me who
in his younger days had a fine singing voice.
He liked the sound of his voice so much that
when he lost his ability to sing he took up
public speaking, and went about the country
giving addresses. I thought this was a rather
good idea, especially when I found out that
he received $25 for speaking at a luncheon
and $50 for a dinner engagement.
We have all heard many fine orators. I
recall the late Sir George W. Ross, who at
one time was Leader of the Government in
this chamber. When he spoke in public he
had a man stand at the back of the hall with
a handkerchief in his hand, which he used
as a signal to indicate to Senator Ross whether
he was speaking too loudly or too softly. I
sometimes think that would not be a bad
practice to follow in this chamber today. The
Right Honourable A. J. Balfour, who was
Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1902 to
1905, could sit and listen to his Government
being scarified by the Liberal Opposition,
with his head back, his arms folded and his
eyes closed as if in prayer. When the
Opposition concluded he would get to his feet,
and without a single note, proceed for about
an hour to tear the Opposition to pieces.
Mr. Lloyd George was a great orator in
his day. The story is told of an occasion when
he and Lord Birkenhead were attending
a dinner, at which Lloyd George was unexpectedly called on to speak. Having no
notes, he reached over and took Lord Birkenhead's notes, which were lying on the
table in front of his lordship, and spoke

from them. I once had the privilege of
hearing Lloyd George address ten thousand
of his Welsh compatriots. He had what the
Welsh call the "hwyl"-I only wish I had it.
With his power of oratory he had those
people almost tearing up the seats, and when
he was finished they stood up and sang the
Welsh national anthem at the top of their
voices.
I had an old uncle whom the more dignified
members of the family referred to as a
character, and whom younger members sometimes referred to as an old card. In the
days when our honourable Leader in this
bouse (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was a young
boy going to public school in Brantford, my
old uncle used to try to break the windows
of the Liberal hall in that city, acclaiming
the virtues of Gladstonian Liberalism. Nobody paid a great deal of attention to him,
because the elections in Brantford were not
fought over Gladstone and his policies. I
once asked him to speak to a young people's
group in the Congregational Church, now
I believe the Presbyterian Church. He consented to come. I can see him now as he
came in wearing an old frock coat, a heavy
watch chain and a frayed pair of pants,
for he cared little about dress. He commenced to speak at 8.30 in the evening on
"The decline and fall of the Roman Empire,"
and at 11.10 p.m. I had to tiptoe up to the
platform and tell him what time it was
and that the people wanted to go home.
Afterwards he chided me for having interrupted him in his train of thought.
Before I start talking about the Speech
from the Throne I want to add my congratulations to those already expressed to the
mover and seconder of the Address, the new
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Bois),
and the new senator frorn Kamloops (Hon.
Mr. Smith), on the excellent speeches they
made. These honourable members are a
decided acquisition by this chamber.
Whenever I hear new senators make their
first speeches in this chamber I do wish that
more people would come to the Senate and
observe what goes on. I am sick and tired
of criticisms of the Senate. A number of
new senators were appointed last year and
four more this year, everyone of them an
experienced and outstanding citizen of this
country, able to give practical expression to
valuable ideas. Yet it has become a custom
on the part of some people to poke fun constantly at the Senate. Many of these critics
do not know anything about the Senate. How
many members of the Parliamentary Press
Gallery ever come to listen to what is said
here? Most of then rely on Hansard and
Canadian Press dispatches for information as
to what we are doing.

JANUARY 23. 1957
Hon. Mr. Farris: Are flot the newspaper
owners to blame?
Hon. Mr. Davies: They probably are. I
wili tell my honourable friend something.
Last year there had been some criticism of
the Press Gallery, and during the debate on
Senator Croll's proposais for pen-al reform
I defended the Press Gallery very strongly.
Then, dealing with some penitentîary regulations suggested by the honourable gentleman
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl), I
said 1 disagreed with them. Weil, despite
rny defence of the Press Gallery, not one
Toronto or Ottawa newspaper even mentioned that I spoke, and the Can-adian Press
misreported me, saying that I strongly backed
the very things which I opposed. Even our
own paper in Peterborough said that I agreed
with Senator Croil, and the article was published under a large heading.
I want now to speak of some features of
the Speech from the Throne.
First of ail there is the problem of Hungarian refugees, mentioned in paragraph 8
of the Speech. We ail hope that those who
have corne here wiii be heartily welcomed
and that they wiil contribute to the development of this country; but, honourable senators, we must flot shut our eyes to the tact
that the bringing inl of these refugees after
a more or less cursory medical examination,
and paying for their transportation over
here, is flot unanimously approved by Canadians. I read quite a number of daîly newspapers every day-that is my job-and 1
notice that there have been a great many
letters in the papers compiaining particularly
about the lack of a thorough medical
examination, and also quite a few about the
free transportation. The question has been
asked time and again in letters: "If we can
do this for Hungarian refugees, why can
we not do something of the same kind for
British immigrants? Why can't we bring over
more British immigrants and pay their way
too?"
As honourable senators know, until recently
immigration from the Old Country-which,
as somne others do, I like to refer to as the
"mother country"ý-bad tallen off. This was
not througb any f ault of the immigration
officiais, who were doing their best, but because at the time there was in Britain almost
tull employment at very good wages. The
pay of agricultural workers over there is set
by the Government. In 1939 the Weisb agricultural worker received 30 shillings a week
and a cottage rent free. Today hie receives 7
pounds 10 shillings a week, with a cottage,
for a working day of eight hours, plus time
and a haîf for Sundays. So the farm labour
situation bas changed. Much the same bas

happened in other businesses: everywhere in
industry wages have gone up considerably.
Thus the people over there are contented.
Their costs of living, largely because of moderate rents, are low. Very good council
bouses, put up partly at the expense of the
Government and partly of the munîcapility,
were and are renting for less than $10 a
week. One cannot duplicate that condition
over here. I arn not sure that I favour assisted
emigration trom Britain to this country. I
have tbe feeling that the man who has saved
his money and accumuiated enough to buy
tickets for bimself and bis family will be
more apt to settie here, with the intention of
being a good Canadian and helping in the
development of this country, than if he relies
largeiy or wbolly on the Government for bis
passage money. Canada, unlike Great Britain,
has no scheme of national bealth insurance,
which many of them miss. If one goes to a
doctor here one bas to pay bis fees. This
condition, and other differences between the
two countries, get "'under the skin" of some
immigrants, and they write letters to, the
newspapers criticising things they find bere.
I was astounded recentiy to read a letter in
one of the Toronto papers in wbich the writer
complained that too many Britishers were
being brougbt over, that they did not make
good citizens and would flot settie down. It
was signed by a Mrs. Jones. I wondered what
part of Wales this woman came from that
she, with a name lîke that, should be offended
at British immigration. Probably she berseif
came here with the benefit of an assisted
passage or somnething of the sort.
However, as I bave remarked, I do not
know whether I f avour assisted passages. My
parents and I came to this country a long
time ago. Today the minimum tare ranges
from $160 to, $185, which, comparatively
speaking, is a lot of money. When I emigrated
to Canada there were three classes-first,
second and third. Naturally I came third. It
will astonisb bonourabie senators to know
that it cost me only $17.60, at the then rate
of excbange, for the ocean voyage and transportation from Quebec to Brantford, where
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald)> resides, and wbich is
65 miles west of Toronto. At today's rate of
exchange the cost of the wbole trip wouid
amount to $10.15.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: In what year was that?
Hon. Mr. Davies: 1894.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I suppose that to get
to Brantford was weli worth the fare.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Indeed it was. Ships in

JANUARY 23, 1957
Government member of the House of Commons, when speaking over the radio about
a week ago, said the prospects for 1957 were
good. Indeed he thought this would be Canada's best year yet. Then the Prime Minister,
when addressing the Canadian Construction
Association banquet at Toronto on Monday
night, said there is going to be a levelling off.
I wish they would get together and make up
their minds as to what will happen, then
get down to brass tacks and see what can be
done about it.
The Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) told us the other day that Canada
sold for cash 150 million dollars' worth more
wheat in 1956 than it did in 1955. That is
very good indeed. Then the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) drew attention
to the fact that we buy more goods from the
United States than we sell to that country.
I do not know whether we can improve that
situation. One of the imports that I know
about is printing machinery-printing presses,
stereotype machines, typesetting machines,
and so on. It is very expensive equipment
and there is none made in this country. If
we want to expand the printing industry and
the newspaper publishing business, we must
have this machinery and we must bring it
in from the United States. Some years ago
an attempt was made to manufacture typesetting machinery at Windsor and, I think,
at Niagara Falls, but it did not work out.
The manufacturers could not make machines
of the required quality and keep up to date
with all the new improvements, as can be
done at Brooklyn, New York, where some of
the biggest printing machinery companies
operate. They have a large market, and that
is where we have to buy.
I should like to quote from the speech made
by the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in the Senate last
Thursday. Dealing with inflation, he said,
as reported on page 42 of Hansard:
I feel that if these inflationary tendencies are not
checked in sone way the situation could be one
that might snowball into enormous proportions and
have terrible consequences for many years to come.

I wish our respected leader had been a
little more specific and told us what the
terrible consequences will be if these inflationary tendencies are not checked.
Then he said:
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
bas given his warning, and I give my warning,
too.

I made this note: "All right, what is to be
done? What is the answer to this? Is it that
we should stop buying and have unemployment, or go on doing as we are doing now?"
Honourable senators, you can tell pretty
well how the public is buying when you see

column after column of advertising in the
big daily newspapers. And the reports of
the large department stores in our various
cities reflect the tremendous increase in their
business last year over that of the preceding
year. This trend is continuing in 1957.
Now, what is the answer? Should we stop
ail this? Will it be dangerous not to stop it?
I should like to ask a further question, but
I do not think anybody will answer it. Does
the Minister of Finance decide these things?
Does it make any difference whether we have
a Conservative Government or a Liberal
Government, or does the Treasury Board, a
group of experts-I am told there are a
hundred of them-sit down and decide what
we shall do and what we shall not do? Or
are the decisions made by the Department of
Finance and by the Cabinet? I do not know,
and I wonder about it. I am sometimes
inclined to think these decisions are made
by the experts who advise the Minister of
Finance. I should like to know what they
think should be done to control inflation.
At Kingston we are going to have a ne*,
Government building costing about $1 million. We need it. Government officiais there
are located in a number of buildings. The
Post Office and Customs House buildings were
erected in 1857, exactly one hundred years
ago. As the need for office space grew,
the basement of one building was used, and
also the attic, but there still is not room
enough. The Income Tax employees were
housed in the Empire Life building. Then the
Empire Life Company expanded and took over
the space, so the Income Tax people moved to
quarters above a store. Later on, Excise
officials took over the space that had been
used by the Income Tax branoh. That kind of
thing has been going on at Kingston for the
last ten or flfteen years. Like most industrial
cities in Ontario, it is suffering from growing
pains. More space has to be found for larger
staffs or they will not be able to operate
efficiently.
Now, if the construction of Government
buildings is not going to be stopped-and
I do not suggest it should be-are we going
to stop the construction of other types of
buildings? Are we to stop people from buying? That is a question I would like to
have answered.
I come now to a more congenial subject,
the creation of a Canada Council for the Arts,
Humanities and Social Sciences. I might say
that the two paragraphs which interest me
most in the Speech from the Throne are
paragraphs 14 and 15. I was very pleased
when I read about the generous treatment
which the Government is proposing in order
to give a new impetus to the development
of Canadian scholarship and culture. As a

SENATE
matter of fact, I was not only pleased but
very delighted. I am sure most Canadians
are pleased with the proposed Canada Council, whose establishment was recommended
by the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences,
popularly known as the Massey Commission.
I think all honourable senators will heartily
endorse the formation of a Canada Council,
which would provide funds for our universities, and other deserving organizations. I
believe all our universities are doing splendid
work. During the past 50 or 60 years I
have lived adjacent to four or five of them
at different times, and I know what they are
doing. For 30 years I have been intimately
associated with the progress of Queen's
University. Queen's has decided that it is
necessary to expand. That university has
had some great principals, namely, Taylor,
Fyfe, and Dr. Wallace, who came to us from
the west, and was, I think, the best principal
we have had since George Munro Grant. I was
very sorry when Dr. Wallace passed away.
Under the present principal, Dr. Mackintosh,
Queen's intends to raise $5 million for expansion, and expects to get a large grant
from the Government through the Canada
Council. I am wondering, however, whether
our present universities should expand, or
if it would not be better to establish a
greater number of smaller universities
throughout the country. Some may disagree
with me. Many young people are not getting
to the universities today; I think the reason
is not only that the fees are high, but that
the cost of living in residence is an obstacle
to students who are obliged to live far away
from home. The Toronto Star of Wednesday,
December 26 last, contained an editorial
under the caption "Brains Neglected", which
referred to a survey of high school students
and said, in part:
The survey studied the careers of 10 students
with an I.Q. of 115 or more who entered seven
Toronto high schools in 1950. A normally bright
youngster has an I.Q. of 100, and 115 or more is
considered "gifted". It was found that of 21 with
an I.Q. of 140 or more, a genius rating. three left
high school before grade 12 to go to work, and only
13 went to university. Of 81 with an I.Q. between
130 and 139, or near genius, 33 left before completing high school and only 30 went to university.

I scarcely need to tell honourable senators
that if we are going to keep pace with certain other countries we shall have to
encourage our young people, particularly the
brilliant ones, to enter the universities, by
scholarships, by living allowances, or by
some other means. I am told by university
authorities that it would be difficult to get
smaller universities staffed. There is great
difficulty in getting staff for universities that

are already established today.
Arthur, I believe, there is a junior college,

but the city would like to have its own
university, and I think it should have one.

about 100 miles from Toronto, and 130 miles
from Kingston. The headquarters of the
General Electric Company are at Peterborough, and I am told that officials of this
company and of others would like to have
a university there. Of course, these institutions cost money, yet I am sure sufficient
money could be raised so that the young
people in smaller districts could have a
better opportunity than at present to continue their education by going to university.
This subject of what I would call "cultural efforts" reminds me of a conversation
between two men in Washington as they
were passing the beautiful Andrew Mellon
Art Gallery. One said to the other, "That
is one of my jobs." His friend asked, "Did
you design it?" "No," replied the other.
"Did you build it?" The reply was, "No,
but I helped to dig the foundations." That is
the way I feel on this subject. On three
different occasions I have stood on my feet
in this chamber and appealed for a small
grant for the Dominion Drama Festival.
That body was just about to fold up when
Calvert's distillery came to the rescue by
offering to donate funds to enable it to carry
on. I was not in favour of the idea, but
others were, and the Festival is now kept
going with Calvert's assistance.
A number of other organizations need
support. In Ottawa for some time we had
the Canadian Repertory Company, which
did every good work at the La Salle Auditorium. Many people in Ottawa put up
money for its support, but the company
eventually folded up. Not long ago the
Crest Theatre started up in Toronto, and
is still doing excellent work, but I am told
it has lost $200,000 so far. In my opinion,
other endeavours, as well as the Dominion
Drama Festival, deserve support, such as
the National Ballet, the Toronto Opera
Festival, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra,
the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the
Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. These are only
a few of the organizations that need support.
Honourable senators, "Man cannot live by

bread alone." If we want Canada to become
great we must feed the souls of men as well
as their bodies. Some of us get joy and inspiration from classical music, such as Beethoven's Emperor Concerto or Dvorak's New
World Symphpny. Others get a kick out of
Elvis Presley,' o whom the honourable member from New Westminster, (Hon. Mr. Reid)
made reference last night. I am not worried

JANUARY 23, 1957
about Elvis Presley; he is a passing phase,
like many others who have preceded him.
Let us not forget that if we were teenagers
and went to see him in a big theatre, where
a man was walking up and down with a sign
marked, "Scream", and everybody else
screamed, we would do the same.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We never fainted in our
young days!
Hon. Mr. Davies: Anyway, such excitement
is not common to the younger generation
alone. Many will remember that at the
Metropolitan Opera House in New York, in
the nineties, after the great tenor singer Jean
de Reszke had finished one of his famous
arias, society ladies often ran forward to the
stage shouting, "Jean, Jean!", and throwing
flowers at his feet. What is the difference between that and an excited crowd pulling at
the pant legs of Elvis Presley?
Honourable senators, the Arts Council in
Great Britain is spending $21 million a year
in support of the arts. I have seen some of
the results, and they have been very good.
I am very glad that we are to have a similar
council in Canada.
Turning now to the proposed Senate committee to consider what should be done to
make better use of land for agriculture, I
was disappointed the other day when, as I
understood, the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) seemed to have forgotten Ontario when suggesting members for the committee. The honourable leader lives in Brantford, the centre of one of the lush farming
districts of Canada. Eastern Ontario is not the
centre of lush farming country; in fact, we
have a rather barren hinterland in places. I
suggest that when drawing up the membership
of this committee the leader should not overlook men like the senator from Leeds (Hon.
Mr. Hardy), who is one of our biggest dairy
farmers, and the senator from Norfolk (Hon.
Mr. Taylor), whom I consider to be a real
down-to-earth farmer. Eastern Canada needs
the attention of this Senate committee. The
situation in eastern Ontario became so bad
that there was established an organization
known as the "Eastern Ontario Soil and Crop
Improvements Association." That body bas
published a progress report, which I have
read. The problem seems to be that we do
not know what to do with a good deal of our
unproductive land. Some of it is suitable for
the growing of trees and some is not. The
main problem in the hinterland of eastern
Ontario is the drainage difficulty, which is
costly to correct, especially over rough land.
I know something about reforestation, having planted more than 50,000 trees, some of
which will mature in my lifetime and some
long after I have gone. It is a well-known

fact that you cannot grow trees on every
kind of soil; it is necessary to experiment
and understand the type of soil before one
can successfully practice reforestation. Today
we have forestry schools, which no doubt
will be able to supply a good deal of
technical data to the committee, and a valuable contribution will be made by its
findings.
I was a little worried when I heard the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) suggest the other day that the
work of this committee would apply to certain provinces only. I took the trouble of
referring again to the Speech from the
Throne, and I now understand that an investigation will be conducted with respect
to poorer land all across Canada. Am I
correct in that understanding?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The reference to be
placed before the committee has not yet
been considered by the Senate, and I am not
prepared to say what it will include.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Honourable Senators, in
conclusion I should like to refer briefly to
the preliminary report of the Gordon Commission and what it has to say about the
Maritime provinces. I was not particularly
worried by the suggestion that in certain
circumstances some people in those provinces
should be moved elsewhere in Canada, because I do not think there is any possibility
of that being done. Some ten years ago I
attended a dinner at which a distinguished
economist predicted that it would not be
long before people in the Prairie provinces
would have to be moved elsewhere because
they could not make a living in that part of
Canada. The Prairie provinces, if you please,
which last year produced 494 million bushels
of wheat! Well, we have not moved any
people from the Prairies, and judging from
the standard of living enjoyed by those I
know, I should say they are doing very well.
I believe the Maritime provinces also will
prosper in years to come.
Perhaps the trouble is that the Gordon
Commission did not hear the right people in
the Maritimes. Of course Maritimers have
a technique of their own when they describe
their circumstances. There is not much wrong
with the economic condition of that part of
the country; it is the way the people of the
area tell about it that is alarming.
I first visited the Martimes some forty
years ago, along with a group of newspapermen who went down there for a good time.
The president of our association lived at
Summerside, Prince Edward Island. On the
opening day of our meeting the Premier of
Nova Scotia addressed us, and he gave us

SENATE
quite a tale of woe. I will not say that I
actually cried in my soup at lunch, but I
very nearly did. He appealed to us to try to
get something done for the Maritimes. After
our meetings our hosts began to entertain
us: They took us to receptions and dinners
at the yacht club, on trips on magnificent
yachts owned by millionaires, and to evening affairs where the ladies wore their
diamonds and other jewels.
I became
bemused.
Well, honourable senators, I think the truth
about the Maritime provinces is that the
people there like their part of Canada so
well they do not want the rest of us to get
on to how good it is, because we might go
down there and crowd them out. I personally do not think there is any cause for
worry about the future of the Maritimes.
I believe there are more millionaires per
square mile in that part of Canada than in
Ontario.
I should like to refer briefly to a news item
which appeared in the Halifax ChronicleHerald about a speech made by my old friend
Bob Rankin. In part it reads:
He told a Kiwanis Club meeting Monday the section of the report dealing with the transport of
Maritimers to other parts of Canada has been
"misinterpreted, misquoted and misunderstood".
He said it would be "a pretty tragic situation" if
residents of the seaside provinces believed the
report held nothing for them. He said the Gordon
report intimated that the Maritimes can develop
their resources to a point where their standard
of living equals that of other provinces if the
necessary ability and incentive is present.

Let us not forget the great tourist attractions of the Maritimes. We have only to
mention the Land of Evangeline and our
ladies all want to go there right away. In
my opinion Brackley Beach in Prince Edward
Island is the finest beach in the world. I
never visit that magnificent spot but I am
reminded of these words of Rupert Brooke in
his poem The Old Vicarage, Grantchester:
But Grantchesterl ah, Grantchesteri
There's peace and holy quiet there.

That was the feeling I had as I sat on
the beach with the late Dr. Wallace of
Queen's University and we thought and
talked about great things.
The Maritimes have an abundance of very
fine hotels. I have travelled widely and
stayed in many hotels, and I consider
some of those in the Maritimes to be unequalled anywhere.
A famous Maritimes attraction is the well
known Magnetic Hill in New Brunswick,
which gives the traveller the illusion that
he is going uphill when he is actually going
down. No doubt many honourable senators
have been fascinated by this interesting
phenomenon.

In short, honourable senators, the Maritimes are such a grand place that I sometimes wonder if I would not have been wiser
to have settled there than in Ontario. Certainly, one unforgettable quality of the people
of that area is their boundless hospitality. If
you are thinking of visiting the east coast,
my advice is to indulge in plenty of sleep
before you go, because you will not likely
get much while there. The Maritimers are
a wonderful, warm-hearted people, and I
hope the future holds for them much more
even than they have had in the past.
Honourable senators, I hope I have not
spoken too long. However, in a multitude of
counsellors there is wisdom. I have said
what I had to say, and I trust you will find
something of value in it. If you have enjoyed
listening to my remarks as much as I have
enjoyed delivering them, we have all had
a good time.
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators,
it gives me much pleasure to join with those
who have preceded me in congratulating the
mover (Hon. Mr. Bois) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Smith) of the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne. The subjects
discussed were interesting and the delivery
eloquent, one in French and the other in
English. Both our official languages were
used, and that is as it should be in this
country of ours. I hope it will not be too
far in the future when every one in Canada
will be bilingual.
May I at this time extend a hearty welcome to the four honourable gentlemen
recently summoned to this chamber.
Honourable senators, it is my intention to
speak for a few moments about the preliminary report of the Gordon Commission.
First may I, on behalf of the Maritime
provinces, thank the honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) for his
high praise of that part of Canada and the
people who live there. Really, I felt so
overcome by all the fine things he said about
us that I wondered whether I would be able
to go on with my own speech.
I think perhaps there has been some misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the
Gordon report in so far as the Maritime
provinces are concerned, and maybe that
phase of it has been too widely publicized.
But as to the suggestions it makes, I am
reminded of the maiden lady of uncertain
age who, though having had no experience
at all with children, attempts to give advice
on the bringing up of children to a mother
who bas successfully reared a large family.
While I have every respect for the opinion
of experts, I sometimes think they miss the
point. They are somewhat like the man
who repeatedly had a flat tire: he kept

JANUARY 23, 1957
patching the inner tube but neglected to
remove from the tire the nail which was
causing all the trouble.

induce our people to remain where they are
instead of encouraging them to move away.
In the earlier days the Atlantic provinces
were prosperous and booming with big
business. Then two things happened: there
was great industrial expansion in New England, and the easy immigration laws of the
United States caused an exodus from the
Maritimes to the industrial areas of New
This Canadians blame, historiEngland.
cally, for the most part, on the call of dollars
and greater opportunity; but a further look
at it, and an answer to the question, "Why
was there greater opportunity in New
England?" bring a very simple answer.
Business and industry in the Maritimes were
on the decline. The answer to a further question: "Why were they in decline when they
had been by modern standards rather booming?" indicates that they could no longer
compete in available markets.
Further tracing our question as to why
they could not compete in available markets brings two answers: First, that the
United States' policy of high tariffs to protect their own infant industries was continued until these industries were grown
and expanded; and, secondly, high freight
rates and high tariffs were foisted on the
Maritimes by the more densely populated
industrial -centres of Upper and Lower Canada,
as they were then called. The latter was
the only factor that Canadians could control,
but they did nothing about it, as far as
protecting the economy of the Maritimes was
concerned. The West at that time, of course,
was not opened.
Without going into the finer details of
freight rates, suffice it to say that an exporter
in the Maritimes had not only to pay a
higher ton-mile rate than comparable shippers
in Ontario and Quebec, but he was also
required to pay deadhead rates on empty
freight cars from the centre of Canada to
the Maritimes for lading. Notwithstanding
that he had adequate raw materials on hand
locally or by sea import and had a cheaper
labour market and plant facilities, he could
not sell at a profit in these Upper Canadian
markets. I have in mind one instance, a
boot and shoe factory in the Maritimes, which
previously to the high freight rates and tariffs
had a large market both in Canada and in
the near -areas of the United States, but
on account of the increased cost of exporting
the company was not able to compete with
other manufacturers of those commodities

and had to close up. However, during the
two World Wars this firm was reactivated
and gave employment to many in the Maritime provinces, but it had to close again when
those war-time markets ceased to exist. We
still have a shoe manufacturing company
in Fredericton, whose shoes are fairly expensive and for people in the upper income
brackets. Its prices are not practical for
the masses, but on account of the top quality
and high price of their product the firm has
been able to carry on. An adjustment of
freight rates would help to a great extent
in solving our industrial problems with regard to exports and imports in the
Maritimes.
I would like to touch briefly on one matter
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne and
that is the proposal to recommend in the
Senate the establishment of a committee to
consider what should be done to make better
ùse of land for agriculture and thus to contribute more effectively to the improvement
of agricultural production and the incomes of
those engaged in it.
Now, honourable senators, I wish to say a
few words about the Island, and I love to
talk about it.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Inman: In our province of Prince
Edward Island we have many, far too many,
vacant farms. There are various reasons
for this. In some cases young people do not
like farming. In a family where there are
no sons, there is no one to carry on once the
elders are gone. Some of the land is run
out and poor for lack of the proper method of
crop rotation. Then the two World Wars contributed largely to farms being left to
deteriorate.
Another big factor causing this condition
in our province and, in fact, in other areas
in the Maritimes, is the high cost involved
today in the operation of a farm-labour
costs, taxes, expensive modern machinery.
This is a mechanized age and the farmer
following behind an old horse and plow is a
sight hardly ever seen anywhere at present.
Nor could a farmer using such obsolete
methods hope to compete with those farming
in a modern way with modern machinery.
If Prince Edward Island is to continue as
an agricultural province, some means must
be found to bring these vacant and unproductive but fertile lands back into production
again. In the small area near where I live in
Prince Edward Island there is plenty of room
for several hundred families on vacant farms,
and I feel that some steps should be taken to
induce people to go back to the farms.
Incentives should be provided such as better

SENATE

assistance to those trying to get started on
farms, interest rates on farm loans should be
reduced, and better markets and transportation should be provided for their products.
I am firmly convinced that the economy of
my province would be greatly enhanced if
one or more processing plants were located
at strategic points. By processing plants I
mean plants for the processing of small
fruits and vegetables.
Now, honourable senators, it may be due
to something in the air over Prince Edward
Island, but it is a fact that we produce the
most flavourful vegetables and fruits in North
America.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

to the Atlantic provinces? The closer we
look at the past in this field of economic
values, the closer we must look at the present,
and ask what the future holds for Canada's
hospitality industry. We need more federal
aid for promotional work. The setting up of
a departmental branch in the provinces
where tourism is big business is a first and
great need; then, wider newspaper, magazine,
radio and television advertising. "See Canada first" is the idea. It is interesting to
note in passing that New Zealand was the
first country in the world to establish
a tourist department. One has been in existence there since the beginning of the
century.

choices, and Canada must now sell to travellers and tourists the idea that she has what
they seek. Also we must create interest in
things to see, especially historic places and
sites.
Speaking of Prince Edward Island, my
native province, I may say that it is a land of
enchantment, offering a delightful climate,
unlimited beautiful beaches, and the finest
bathing to be had north of Florida. It is
becoming an increasingly popular vacation
resort. It is one of the oldest of the Canadian provinces, for its history reaches back
to 1534, when Jacques Cartier landed on its
shores. Here one may find many of the old
traditions and customs inherited from the
hardy pioneers who made this little fertile
Island their home. No part of the Island is
very far from the sea, with wide sandy
beaches and warm salt water. There is also
plenty of good horse-racing in this Kentucky
of Canada for those who enjoy the sport of
kings. Night racing is a favourite entertainment, and the Island is one of the few places
where sulky racing is carried on.
The province is, of course, the cradle of
Confederation, and the small Confederation
chamber is of great historic interest to visitors. The chairs and table and most of the
furniture used by the Fathers of Confederation are still intact in this room.
We also have a national park which is
now a real holiday heaven, but we need
to have it extended. Indeed, all of Prince
Edward Island could well be developed as
a park, and the results, I am sure, would
justify the outlay.
We can offer our visitors the finest deepsea fishing to be found in the Atlantic provinces, for we have the Gulf of St. Lawrence
on the north and Northumberland Strait to
the south.
For beauty of situation and invigorating
air, for boating and swimming, for variety
of fishing and shooting in season, for hospitality and friendliness, Prince Edward Island
cannot be surpassed as a vacationland; and
those in search of peace, rest and health,
recreation or ease will find all of these things
in this scenic million-acre farm, this green
fairyland cradled in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
and so generously endowed by nature. The
federal Government has looked toward the
Maritimes in this respect to some extent, but
it could well take a second look and give
further assistance in building up this growing industry, which is on its way to becoming one of the major industries not only in
Canada's smallest province but in all the
Atlantic provinces.

We have the potentialities for a great
future in the Maritimes. Let us see that
something is done to develop these opportunities.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw, the
debate was adjourned.
DIVORCE
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the reports of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, Nos. 14 to 34, which were presented yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck, Chairman of the committee, moved that the reports be adopted.
The motion was agreed to, on division.
PRIVATE BILL
LIFE UNDERWRITERS ASSOCIATION
CANADA-SECOND READING

OF

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the
second reading of Bill J, an act respecting
The
Life Underwriters
Association of
Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, a very
short explanation will, I think, suffice. The
bill proposes to amend Chapter 104 of the
statutes of 1924 which incorporated The
Life Underwriters Association of Canada. It
is an organization for the benefit of those
engaged in the insurance business. Among
its objects are the following: to promote
the welfare of its members in such manner
as the association may decide; to hold such
examinations on the principles and practice
of life insurance or general educational
attainments as may be found expedient; to
grant certificates of efficiency to its members; to authorize the use by such of its
members as it may designate of the title
and description "Chartered Life Underwriter
of Canada".
This is just an organization of a somewhat
social and educational character for the
benefit of those engaged in this particular
business.
The association had been in existence for
a number of years prior to its incorporation
in 1924, and during those years it acquired
a building on Richmond Street in Toronto,
then valued at something less than $100,000.
However, 1924 is not 1957, and during the
interval the value of that .property has increased very materially. It is doubtful
what the present value of it may be, but it is
probably very much more than $100,000.
In the act of incorporation there appears
this paragraph:
The executive committee may, in the name and
on behalf of the association take, hold, possess and
acquire by purchase, lease, exchange, donation,

SENATE
devise, 0 equest, endowment or otherwise, real or
immovaole property required for the actual use
and occupation of the association, or necessary or
requisite for the carrying out of its objects; and
may sell, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or alienate
such property in any manner whatever.

That, of course, is a power which is given
to nearly all such organizations, to hold
property, not for speculative and mere holding purposes but for their own use.
In the act of incorporation there is also
this paragraph:
The total value of the real property held by or
in trust for the assocation at any one period shall

not exceed one hundred thousand dollars.

There is a further provision in the act
whereby no property acquired by the association and not required for its actual use and
occupation shall be held by the association
for a longer period than ten years after its
acquisition, or after it ceases to be required
for the association's use or occupation. In
such cases the property must be sold within
ten years of its acquisition. This provision
of the act is in no way affected by the
proposed legislation.
The real purpose of the bill before us is
to relieve the association from selling the
building which it has occupied for a great
many years, and which now may well exceed
the monetary limitation of $100,000 allowed
under its act of incorporation. The bill proposes to remove section 12(2) of the act,
which I have just read, and to substitute
therefor the following section:
There shall not be, and shall be deemed not
to have been in the past, any limitation on the
total value of the real property held by or in trust
for the association in accordance with subsection
(1) of this section.

There are many precedents of associations
of this kind being allowed to hold property
of any value so long as it is for their own
use and occupation. Not many such associations are subject to any limitation in this
respect.
If honourable senators give second reading
to this bill I will move that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. I suppose it could go to the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous and
Private Bills instead, but legislation having
to do with insurance usually goes to the
Banking and Commerce Committee and, unless there is any objection or advice on the
point, I propose to move that the bill be
referred to that committee. When it is before the committee various precedents can
be asked for-I could give them now but
they are numerous-of associations of a
character such as this being allowed to hold
property for their own use and occupation
without a specific limitation upon the value
of the property.

In view of the fact that for many years
no further property has been acquired by
this association, and it is not now proposed
to acquire further property but only to continue occupying that property which has been
occupied in the past, I can see no reason
why the association should not be given the
widest possible rights in that regard.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Does the association occupy
the whole of the building?
Hon. Mr. Hoebuck: I know it occupies the
building for its own use and in the same form
that it has occupied it for many years past,
but whether it rents out a portion of it I
cannot say. If that question is important it
can be answered when the bill is in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is there not a limit on the
time during which insurance companies can
hold such property?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I can cite a great many
precedents where that is not so. The restriction seldom applies. Very few acts of incorporation put a limitation on property used
by these associations.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Under
the mortmain laws of Ontario a company of
this character which is not incorporated in
Ontario usually requires what we call a
licence in mortmain. If the value of the property exceeds the amount that the company is
authorized to hold by that licence, there is a
danger of forfeiture. Perhaps information in
that regard applying to the bill before us is
not readily available today, but we might
make an inquiry about that when the bill is
in committee. If forfeiture takes place, then
the company is without its property, which
goes to the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And the company is in

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bois,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops), for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators, -

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: -first of all, I wish to
congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr. Bois) and
the seconder (Hon. Mr. Smith) of the Address
for their excellent speeches. My acquaintance
with the seconder is not of yesterday, and I
am sure that his knowledge of western affairs
will be of great value to this house.
May I also in a very humble way extend
my welcome to the new senators who have
recently come to this chamber. I feel sure
they will enjoy the good fellowship and
friendliness which is evident here, and that
they will appreciate the opportunity which
membership in the Senate gives them to contribute something to the welfare of the
Canadian people.
I suppose it might be regarded as my duty
to say something about western hospitality
and to make some reference to the vast richness of the province of Alberta. Indeed, it is
rich: no less than 450,000 barrels of oil are
taken out of the ground every day, and there
is an estimated reserve of from 14 trillion to
16 trillion cubic feet of gas. Even that does
not tell the whole story, for more is constantly

SENATE
being discovered. I might also say something
about the crags, canyons and waterfalls, and
the breath-taking scenery in such mountain
resorts as Banff, Jasper and Waterton Lakes.
However, on this occasion I will leave those
things aside, and talk briefly about highway
traffic accidents.
Every year 2,500 persons in Canada lose
their lives through highway traffic accidents,
as a result of which friends are saddened and
homes left desolate. On every long weekend
we read in our news columns of some 50 or
more persons having been killed on our highways, and several hundred injured. The injured add to the already congested hospital
accommodation, and many suffer considerable
pain, to say nothing of the expense to themselves. It is interesting to note that 10 per
cent of traffic injuries result in permanent
partial disability.
Traffic accidents are the sixth major cause
of death in Canada today, and it is particularly amazing to learn that they are the most
common cause of death among persons of 28
years of age and younger.
The responsibility for this devastation of
life and limb is failure of material or of personnel. Failure of material involves bad
road conditions, bad weather and poor visibility, mechanical defects of the automobile,
and so on. However, generally speaking, the
present-day automobile is a pretty reliable
machine, and most accidents occur when
weather and road conditions are good. So it
would appear that in the responsibility for
accidents the personal element is the more
important one; and that includes violation of
highway warnings and traffic regulations as
well as the physical or the mental condition
of the driver.
Speeding is the most common cause of
trouble; it is a factor in 30 per cent of the
accidents. There is something peculiar about
speeding because the field of vision is narrowed in direct relationship to the speed of
the car. A person standing still or in a
stopped car has a peripheral vision of about
180 degrees. If lie is going at 40 miles per
hour the field of vision is narrowed to about
70 degrees, and at about 60 miles per hour
it is narrowed to, say, 40 degrees, so lie can
see only what is ahead of him in a narrow
way; and under those conditions if he turns
his head for a split second lie travels a considerable distance without seeing where lie
is going. Then there is such a thing as highspeed hypnosis, which means that a driver
going at a fast rate of speed does not react
as quickly as lie should. As the stopping distance of a car increases in direct ratio to increase in speed, a driver travelling fast and
unable to react promptly in an emergency

may go into a ditch or over an embankment,
or collide with a post or another car.
One driver out of every fourteen involved
in a fatal accident has some physical defect.
He may be suffering from want of sleep after
long hours of driving, or from fatigue due to
emotional disturbances, or it may be that he
has taken too large a dose of the tranquilizing
drugs which are used so commonly at the
present time.
Alcohol also is a cause of impairment, both
of drivers and pedestrians. The fact is that
in about one-quarter of the number of accidents in this class alcohol is one factor. It is
not easy to tell whether a person is impaired
by alcohol or not. There are some tests, such
as smelling a person's breath, or asking him
to walk along a chalk line or to tell the time
to the exact second, but those methods are
not exact. The way to tell is to determine
the percentage of alcohol in the blood. That
is not a very easy thing to do, but at present
some sensitive instruments are being devised
for determining the alcoholic content of the
blood by testing the breath. If the content
is from .05 to .15 per cent a person is perhaps all right, but if it is more than .15 per
cent his judgment is interfered with and he
is liable to react very slowly in case of an
emergency.
There are some people who have a proneness to accidents. The explanation is hard
to find, but it is a fact that some people are
involved in accidents quite often.
It is interesting to observe just how injuries
are caused in a highway accident. If a fasttravelling car strikes an obstruction, the car
stops but its occupants keep on going and,
if not thrown out, are hurled violently against
hard objects in the car. The driver, for
instance, may be flung against the steering
wheel or the dashboard. If he strikes the
steering wheel lie may sustain fractured ribs,
and if thrown against the dashboard he may
receive abdominal injuries, such as rupture
of the liver, spleen or kidneys. His face may
be dashed against the windshield, resulting
in fractures of the facial bones, lacerations
or even unconsciousness.
There is another factor: if a body is going
violently in any direction and is suddenly
stopped, the head keeps going, and this causes
the so-called whiplash injury which we see
quite often. Those who served on the "hanging committee" last year will understand the
mechanism of this. When the head goes
forward, backward or sideways, damage is
caused to the upper vertebrae or discs; a
vital centre can be affected, and instant death
may result from these whiplash injuries.
What we must think about in these cases
is a safety device which will do something

JANUARY 24, 1957
to reduce the mortality and morbidity of
accidents. A safety belt is of value if it is
attached, not particularly to the seat, but to
the frame of the car. It is conceivable that
if there is an upright support from the back
of the front seat it could prevent some whiplash injuries. Possibly a non-rigid dashboard
or a non-rigid steering wheel would be of
advantage too. The medical associations in
Canada are becoming alarmed about the
number of accidents. They feel that there
should be more warnings and more publicity,
and that greater study and thought should
be given to the causes of these accidents and
their results. I believe also that more educational work should be carried on, by
organizations such as the St. John of Jerusalem Ambulance Association, in the principles of first aid, so that help could be given
right on the spot. The position in which a
person is sitting in the car may indicate the
nature of his injuries. If he is sitting crosslegged he is more likely to have a fractured
or dislocated hip. The Canadian Medical
Association has gone so far as to set up a
Traffic Accident Research Foundation, in the
hope that it will contribute something helpful,
and they desire that as much warning as
possible along the lines I have indicated shall
be given.
If I may be pardoned a personal reference:
Medicine Hat, the city I come from, has a
population of 20,000, very narrow streets and
a great number of cars, but there bas not
been a fatal accident there for two or three
years. This result has not come about
merely by itself. A continuous campaign has
been carried on by the newspapers, by the
radio broadcasting office and by police officers
to ensure that traffic regulations are observed.
Unlike what may be seen so oten in Ottawa,
our people do not walk across the street
against a red light. The regulations are
adhered to because the authorities have the
co-operation of the public; and we are proud
of our fatal accident record, which is about
the best in Canada.
Successful preventive action helps to create
happiness in the homes of the people. We all
pray that war, with the loss of human"life it
brings, will never come again: yet our traffic
problems and the violation of traffic rules
cause many fatal and non-fatal accidents,
some of which could be avoided.
The Speech from the Throne proposes that
the Senate establish a committee, composed of
members who are acquainted with agricultural problems, to study what should be done
to make better use of land for agriculture. I
should like to indicate briefly what has been
dahe along this line in the last few years in
western Canada.
82719-5

Back in 1935 the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act was passed, its object belng to
rehabilitate the drought-stricken and soildrifted areas of the west. Amendments to
the act, passed in 1937, 1939 and 1941, greatly
enlarged the scope of activity under the act,
and at the present time the act is administered by a large organization, which includes
a Land Utilization Branch and a Water Development Branch. The administrative headquarters is in Regina with directors' offices
for the Water Development Branch, the Engineering Service Branch and the Community
Pasture Branch. There are also regional
offices in Kamloops and Winnipeg, and about
18 district offices spread throughout the
western provinces.
The first objective under the act was to
rehabilitate people in that great area lying
between the Red River on the east and the
Rocky Mountains on the west, and extending
from northern Saskatchewan to the international boundary, part of which is designated
as the Palliser Triangle. As long ago as 1857
Captain Palliser and some associates, on behalf of the British Government, made an
investigation of that country and marked out
a triangular area that in his opinion was unfit
for human habitation. In this area the rainfall is only from 8 to 16 inches per year, and
what there is of it usually comes at the wrong
time. It was the great buffalo grazing ground
of bygone days.
The soil had been lying there for ages, and
in the early part of this century land-hungry
farmers began to work the land. The Indians
and ranchers in the area claimed that the
farmers turned the soil the wrong way up;
and indeed for many years it seemed they
had. Although there have been some good
crops in the last five years, crop failures
used to be so regular and disastrous that ruin
and despair came to many of the farmers who
settled there.
Under the Land Utilization Branch one
and three-quarter million acres of submarginal lands have been enclosed in community pastures operated as 62 separate
units. Last year pasture was provided for
108,537 head of livestock belonging to 5,632
persons in that region.
This work is
gradually expanding.
The Water Conservation Board has been
interested in establishing small waterdevelopment
schemes,
larger
irrigation
schemes and special projects. There are
thousands of these smaller projects scattered
all over the vast area of the Prairie provinces, and last year alorie 752 of these
projects were completed with P.KR.A.
engineering and financial aid. These consisted of dugouts, stock-watering dams and

SENATE
small irrigation schemes. The farmers have
a personal interest in all this, taking an
active part in and contributing .their own
money toward these individual and farmneighbour projects. The financial assistance
paid out last year was $95,000, which was
about half the construction cost of the
projects.
Last year 33 community projects, each
costing over $5,000 and each benefiting more
than two farmers, were started. Of these,
22 were completed at a cost of $200,000.
Work bas also been carried out on the
larger schemes, and about a million acres
are now under irrigation with a reliable
supply of water coming down from the east
slope of the Rockies to irrigate 3 million
acres altogether, which would represent
about 5 per cent of the cultivated land in the
area.

The greatest benefit of these schemes is
obtained where the land is fertile although
the rainfall is deficient, where the contours
of the land permit easy irrigation, where
there are gentle slopes which do not require
too much grading, and where there is a lot
of sunshine and a long frost-free period.
This area enjoys 122 frost-free days, a period
which permits special crops like peas, corn
and sugar-beets to be grown successfully.
The policy has been to construct the
cheaper projects first. The big St. Mary's
project has been almost completed, toward
the cost of which the federal Government
contributed $10 to $12 million for construction of the main reservoirs and the connecting canals. The province has distributed
the water at a similar cost, at the same time
trying to recover some of the money by
charging water fees.

These irrigation structures and the work of
the P.F.R.A. are justified because of their
permanency.

One hundred years from now

our western oil supplies may be gone, and
gas pockets may be exhausted. The land
may need annual replenishment of its
essential chemicals; but the vast St. Mary's
reservoir, held back by the largest dam in
Canada, will hold sufficient water to irrigate
a half million acres of land. Without irrigation this land produces relatively little.
Eighty acres of it, adequately irrigated, will
give a family a good living, whereas before
irrigation a family would starve on 640
acres, and it took from 30 to 40 acres of grass
to feed one animal. If the land is properly
irrigated a farmer can grow vegetables and
have dairy and poultry products for his
family, and, above all, his family can enjoy
the benefits of community life.
Honourable senators, in the light of the
knowledge gained so far, let us hope that

when this committee on land is set up it
will work out plans that will result in a
higher standard of living and a better social
life for a very worthy class of our Canadian
people.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Camoron, the
debate was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
TRANS MOUNTAIN OIL PIPE LINE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. Stanley S. McKeen moved the second
reading of Bill I, an Act respecting Trans
Mountain Oil Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple bill; its purpose is to subdivide
each of the company's shares without nominal
or par value into five shares without nominal
or par value. The reason for splitting the
shares is this: when the original bill was
introduced there was a strong feeling that the
public of Canada were not given an opportunity to share in the equity of enterprises of
this character, and although the promoters of
this company were quite prepared to put up
all the money required to build the pipe line
they felt it would be a good idea for the
general public to participate to the extent of
approximately one third. At that time shares
were issued for ten dollars each. The selling
price at the present moment is $108 a share.
By subdividing these shares and issuing five
for one a wide distribution will be ensured,
and there will be greater participation by
the general public. That is the only purpose
of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

On motion of Hon. Mr. McKeen, the bill

PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. Paul H. Bouffard moved the second

He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
similar to one which was presented last year,
and its purpose is to amalgamate certain
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Canadian Pacifie Railway Company. The company owns
ail the issued capital stock and bonds of
these subsidiaries, and ail the companies are
operated by Canadian Pacific under long term
leases as part of its system. A similar bill
introduced last year amalgamated 13 comnpanies; the bill now under consideration is
intended to amalgamate 12 companies. The
object is to simplify the corporate organization of Canadian Pacific Railway Company,
and to get away from considerable legal
complications and expenses.

DIVORCE RULES
AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY
COMMVITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the thirteenth report of the Standing Commitee on Divorce.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved that the
report be adopted.
He said: Honourabie senators, this is the
committee's report which, as I stated when
tabling it a week ago, recommends amendment of the Senate Rules on divorce. The
text of the report appears in the Senate
Hansarct and Minutes of the Proceedings of
January 17, and possibly some honourable
senators have studied it in detail. May I
assure ail honourabie members that the proposed amendments were drawn with a very
great deai of care by three outstanding officiais of this house, namely, Mr. J. F. MacNeill, the Cierk, who has had long experience
in these matters; Mr. E. R. Hopkins, our
capable Law Cierk and Pariiamentary
Counsel; and Mr. Harvey Armstrong, Chief
Cherk of Committees. The amendments have
been approved unanimously by the Senate
Divorce Committee, the members of whom,
of course, are very familiar with the working
of the Ruies, and the amendments are now
before the Senate for its consideration. From
what I have iearned, and from the comment
I have heard, the amendments have met with
the approval of those best qualified to pass on
them, that is, lawyers and others familar
with the situation. It seems to me, therefore,
that I can pass over the mere details rather
rapidhy.
As I said on January 17, we are prapaaing
only two major changes ini the Rules. One
is that the respondent who replies ta a petition and seeks ta appose it shail give a short

At this point I will digress to read two
The pertinent portions of the proposed new relevant Rules of Practice of the Supreme
Rule 139 provide:
Court of Ontario:
The petition of an applicant for a bill of divorce
shall be fairly written and signed by the petitioner
and shall include the following particulars in the
order indicated:
(e) the matrimonial offences alleged, these to be
set-out fully and precisely in separate paragraphs
încluding, wherever possible, the name and address
àf every person with whom a matrimonial offence
is alleged to have been committed, and omitting
t'ague allegations 'such as "at divers times and

775. Unless otherwise ordered every person with
whom adultery is alleged to have been committed,
whether such adultery is alleged as the cause of
action or by way of revival of a prior matrimonial
offence which bas been condoned, shall be made
a defendant in the action if living at the date
of the issue of the writ.
776. (1) If the name of any person with whom
adultery is alleged to have been committed is
unknown to the plaintiff at the time of the issue
ot the writ, a Judge, on being satisfied that all

reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain the
name. may grant leave to the plaintiff to issue the
writ without adding such person as a defendant.

0f course, the Committee on Divorce does
flot sit at ail times when the courts are sitting
in the provinces, so it has been thought impracticable to follow the exact form of the
Ontario law. We propose that the Committee
shall be satisfled by affidavit filed, and later
on by personal appearance if necessary.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): May I
be permitted to ask the honourable gentleman
a question at this point? Assuming an affidavit
is filed, is permission actually to be sought
of the committee to proceed without naming
the co-respondent, and must permission be
given before the pleadings are filed?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not before the pleadings are filed, but certainly before the case is
heard. Most of the pleadings will be filed
during the recess, and at the commencement
of the following session these affidavits wili
be reviewed by the Committee or a subcomnmittee of the general Committee, as may be
arranged by the Committee itself; and, where
necessary, if the affidavit is found to be flot
satisfactory, the parties will be notified to
make a personal appearance.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In other
words, if the affidavit is flot satisfactory, then
the party who desires to proceed without
naming the co-respondent would not be able
to have his case heard unless he amended his
pleadings and narned the co-respondent, if in
f act he could do so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is, if the Committee thought the co-respondent should be
named.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: In that case the papers
would have to be served ail over again.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The papers, 50 f ar as
the co-respondent is concerned, would have
to be served. So the litigant had better be
careful how he deals with this matter of
pleading, as careful indeed as he would be
in the courts, because there they slap hirn
down without very much hesitation.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I arn
just a littie bit concerned as to whether the
position has been clarified. The point is this,
that in the event the affidavit evidence is flot;
sufficient and the Committee decides the corespondent should be named, then if the
petitioner is unable to name the co-respondent the case wilI flot be heard.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It will flot be heard
until he makes service on the co-respondent,
or until the Committee is satisfied that this
cannot be done.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But I understand the
Committee will hear counsel for the petitioner.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Committee will
not mereiy consider the affidavit that has
been filed, but counsel for the petitioner will
be permitted to corne before the Committee
and explain the facts set f orth in the affidavit?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. He will be permitted on ail occasions to do so if he wishes
but, if the affidavit is sufficient, obviously
there is no need for bringing counsel to repeat the affidavit. So, as I visualize it, if the
affidavit is ail right we will let the case proceed, but if the affidavit does flot show reasonable cause we will cail counsel for the petitioner before us and allow him to argue and
explain, and he may convince us.
Let me illustrate the situation briefly out
of something that occurred just this morning
during the hearing of a case by the Committee. The co-respondent was flot named
in the petition. He was described as "a person unknown"~, but in the evidence it was
suggested that the co-res.pondent was a wellknown athiete. There we were listening to
evidence, wbich was being reported in shorthand, to be printed inter and to be circulated to 265 members of the Commons, if they
wished to have it, and to ail members of the
Senate, 100 or so, with 25 copies to remain
on record and 10 copies for each for the
partie s-literally hundreds of copies-and the
person who was accused had no knowledge of
the proceedings. He was not there, and, not
having been notifled, he may flot have had
the opportunity of being there. Nov,, that is
a drastic situation. I will tell you what we
did. We ordered that the identity of the corespondent be flot made clear in the evidence,
because it is so unjust to accuse a man as corespondent and give him no chance to defend his reputation. If he is guilty, why
then I suppose it does not matter, but we
have no right to assume guilt on the part of
anyone, and even if he is guiity, I think Brit-.
ish jurisprudence provides that he shall
have a right to defend hîrnself.
Now, honourable senators, I pass on to the
next point. I have already referred to section 3 of Rule 139, which provides for a
concise statement of the material facts upon
which the respondent or co-respondent relies
in answer to the petition. If you will turn
to our present Rules, at page 9, section 139
(5), you wili see tbat the following is all that
is now required:
The copy of the petition served upon the
respondent shail have endorsed thereon, or appended thereto, the following information:

Senate at the Parliament Buildings at Ottawa

the sum of two hundred and ten dollars towards
expenses which may be incurred during the proceedings upon the petition and the bill, and the
disposition of this sum shall be as ordered by the
Senate.

There is no substantial change proposed
here, but I think honourable senators are
entitled to some information which we have
recently obtained. Last year the Committee
passed a resolution as follows:
Resolved, that Mr. H. D. Gilman, Chief Treasury

Officer, Senate, be requested to prepare a report
to be presented to the Senate Committee on Divorce
at the next session of Parliament, showing the
total cost to the Senate of processing an average
divorce petition, i.e., all costs, including printing,
stationery, staff, etc.

In reply, Mr. Gilman presented us with
this statement:
Honourable Senators:
In compliance with the instructions of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, the printing
charges and other relevant items of expense to the
Senate incurred in processing an average divorce
petition, were, for the purpose of obtaining the
nearest figure to current costs, applied to the
petitions for divorce considered by the Committee
during the 3rd session of the 22nd Parliament, 1956.
The costs thus produced, together with their components, are as follows:
Printing ..................................
$171.40
Staff .....................................
61.90
Stationery
(including equipment depreciation) .............................
1.70
Total cost to the Senate of processing an
average divorce petition .............. $235.00

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is some small
change in detail. The clause relating to
translation is left out. But there is no change
in the amount. The phraseology has been
improved; that is about all.
Hon. Mr. Farris: How large was the deficit?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We charge $210 in each
case. Mr. Gilman says that the cost to us
is $235; and that is without taking into consideration the valuable services of honourable senators who are members of the
Committee.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: And sometimes a reduction of fees is granted.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My honourable friend
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) calls
attention to the fact that rather frequently,
when poor people come before us and show
us that they are in financial straits and the
cost is hard for them to bear, we reduce the
fees if requested. These people are usually
women earning small salaries and perhaps
having children to support.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why not increase the
charge to others in order to cover the cost?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think we want
to raise the amount from $210 to $235.

JANUARY 24, 1957
Hon. Mr. Baird: Do not the courts ini
Ontario also operate at a loss?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. The fees in the
provincial courts are much less than here.
We charge more than the courts. I amn not
considering solicitors' charges when I speak
of the expense of processing a petition. The
petitioner may have to pay in addition a
considerable arnount to his lawyer. My impression is that oui fees are about as high as
they reasonably should be, but, if any honourable senator cares to propose an increase, I
have no doubt we will consider the matter
very carefully. At present we have made no
move in that regard.
New Rule 142 inakes no real change in the
existing practice. At the present time the
Cornmittee is supposed to review the pleadings, the advertising and what not, to see that
everything is regular. At the beginning of
each session we pass a resolution transferring
those duties to the Chief Clerk of Committees.
So Rule 142, as rewritten, regularizes to
some extent and confirrns the practice that
has been followed in the Senate Comrnittee
for a very long tirne.
Section 4 of the proposed new Rule 142
reads:
If the circumnstances of the case seemn so to
require, the Committee, before proceeding to hearing and inquiry as hereinafter required, may make
such order as to the Committee seemns requisite
and just for effecting substitutional service by
registered letter or otherwise.

As honourable senators are aware, that
is a proceeding followed by courts alrnost
everywhere; where the defendant cannot
be found, substitutional service is permitted
in proper cases.
Let me illustrate what we do here. A twoman committee composed of the chairman
and a memnber of the Standing Comrnittee on
Divorce-in this instance, although not necessarily so, the honourable senator from HuronGolding)-hears

as the Master of the Court hears interlocutory
applications in court proceedings. This comrnîttee of two makes the necessary orders
of substitutional service. By this proposed
amendment to the Rules we are regularizing
what we have done in the past.
Paragraph 1 of the new Rule 145 wil]

the proceedings for divorce, or adultery on the
oart of the petitioner.

The only change there is the addition of the
words "or a co-respondent".
The new Rule 146 provides that the corespondent may be heard before the committee in person or represented by counsel,
as the respondent has been in the past.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is that
not the -case at the present tirne?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is no rule providing for it. I arn sure that if a co-respondent appeared in person or if counsel appeared
on his behaîf we would neyer refuse a hearing. Now we are making it clear that the corespondent has a right to be heard in person
or represented by counsel.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What have been the rights
of the co-respondent in the courts in this
regard?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I arn sure that a corespondent would be heard in the courts, and
certainiy if a co-respondent is named as a codefendant he rnay be represented by counsel
in the courts.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Is that situation not
covered by the present Rule 152, which
applies to cases flot provided for by the
Rules?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The present Rule 146
provides that the petitioner and respondent
may be heard in person or represented by
counsel, and there would he no harm in
extending this right to the co-respondent.
That is the only change proposed in this
rule.
The amended Rule 147 adds the co-respondent to those who may be heard under oath.
The present Rule provides:
The petitioner and, if the respondent appears, the
respondent, and ail witnesses produced before the
Committee shall be examined upon oath...

We recommend
read:

it should be changed

to

The petitioner,
the respondent and
a corespondent, appearing before the committee, and
ail witnesses produced before the Committee shail

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is that
not conferring a right on a person who might
not otherwise be a party to the proceedings?
I arn not quarrelling with it. I think perhaps
it is a good thing, but that Rule would give
the co-respondent the right to corne in and
give evidence with reference to the matters in
issue.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And it rnakes it perfectly clear. He would be heard in any event,
of course, but it is far better to have his right
set out.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: He would neyer be
refused a hearing anyway.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Never in the wide
world, but still I think we should regularize it.
The proposed new Rule 147(2) will read:

railway fare. I think the proposed Rule is a
little indefinite and may lead to some
difficulty.

Declarations allowed under or required in proof
may be made under the Canada Evidence Act
or in a form valid in the jurisdiction in which
they are made.

Hon. Mr. Farris: I was going to mention
the same thing. Supposing a witness did not
deem the money tendered to him was adequate and refused to appear, then if the
Committee held that the amount was adequate what would the Committee do?

That in no wise changes the present practice, but it does change the existing Rule,
which reads:
Declarations allowed or required in proof, may
be made under the Canada Evidence Act.

Now, it is perfectly obvious that an affidavit
made, say, in Czechoslovakia-and we have
had such affidavits-can hardly be made
under the Canada Evidence Act. It must be
made under the laws of Czechoslovakia.
When we are satisfied that an affidavit is
properly authenticated, we of course receive
it, so the proposed change only confirms and
regularizes a practice that we have been
following.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Would you have to get
proof of the practice in Czechoslovakia?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To a considerable extent we do, for applications sent us from
abroad are usually, but not always, authenticated by the court. We do that when we send
processes abroad. We have the court place its
seal on them, and most of the affidavits, like
the one I referred to fron Czechoslovakia,
come with that kind of certification.
The proposed new Rule 148 will read:
Every witness surnrnoned shall, at the time of
service of the summons upon him, be tendered a
sum of money sufficient to defray his reasonable
expenses for travelling to and from Ottawa and
his reasonable living expenses while in attendance
unon the Committee; and no witness shall be
obliged to attend in obedience to a summons unless
such a tender bas been made to him.

Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Who is going to decide
whether the amount is sufficient or not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If the amount is questioned, then it will be up to the Committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is the reason for the
Rule?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We have had a number
of complaints from witnesses who have been
subpoenaed to attend before the Committee
and who have been given no expense money.
They have been placed in a difficult position,
wondering what to do. So we have added
this clause:
and no witness shall be obliged to attend in
obedience to a summons unless such a tender bas
been made to him.

That should clear up the situation and we
should have no more complaints of that kind.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In the courts the amount
is fixed at so much per diem plus return

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Rule 148, which has
been in existence for a long time now,
provides:
The reasonable expenses of making such service
and the reasonable expenses of every witness for
attending in obedience to such summons shall be
taxed by the Chairman of the Committee.

I suppose the Chairman of the Committee
can go on taxing the expenses.
If it was
thought necessary we could adopt the rules
of the court in this regard, but we are not
changing the situation. The Rule has always
required that reasonable expenses be paid
to the witnesses, and we are not changing
that.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Perhaps
I should not ask this question, but in the
event a witness fails to attend has the Committee power to enforce his attendance, and
is there contempt if he does not appear?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: By way of reply I will
read from Rule 148, which says that:
summonses may be served by any literate person,
or, if se ordered by the Senate or by the Coinittee on Divorce, shall be served by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod or by anyone authorized by him to make such service.

Rule 149 provides:
In case any witness upon whom such summons
has been served refuses to obey the sane, such
witness may by order of the Senate be taken into
custody of the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,
and shall not he liberated from such custody except
by order of the Senate and after payment of the
expenses incurred.

I need scarcely say that in my experience so
far no witness bas been taken into custody
by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): I suppose there bas been no suggestion as to the
place of custody?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Probably the Tower.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think an R.C.M.P.
constable would be called in for the purpose,
would he not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I suppose so. We have
had no trouble in this way so far. We just
want to make it a little clearer that these
legal expenses should be paid before any
other obligation is met.
The change in the forms, as I have already
mentioned, is a purely mechanical act, and if

JANUARY 24, 1957
honourable senators see fit to pass these
amendments to the rules the necessary revisions will be made by the officers of the
Senate.
May I conclude by reading an extract from
a judgment delivered by the Chief Justice of
the High Court division of the Supreme Court
of Ontario:
The courts are not to be used in that way. I
have suspected at times that there was a great
deal of carelessness about these preliminary investigations that must be made before an order goes,
and the plaintiff made an affidavit that she made
every effort, when she had not been to the obvious
source of information.

This has reference to the co-respondent.
Let me assure honourable senators that
very grave carelessness is frequently to be
charged against the solicitors who bring
cases before our committee, in the preparation of cases and in the getting of the necessary, requisite and just information. I think
the proposed changes in the rules will help
the committee, first, to dispense justice,
and, secondly, to give service to those who
come before it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask the honourable
senator who assisted him in drawing these
rules?

82719-6

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I stated in my opening remarks, and also made clear when I
laid this report on the Table in the first
instance, they were drawn by the Clerk of
the Senate, Mr. MacNeill; the Law Clerk,
Mr. Hopkins; and the Chief Clerk of Committees, Mr. Armstrong. I wish to make it clear
that these amendments were drawn by those
gentlemen-I did not draw them.
Hon. Mr. Farris: But they were drafted
with your counsel and advice, I feel sure.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To some small extent.
The work was done in the interim between
last year's main session-not the recent
special session-and the beginning of this
session. Last year we passed a resolution
asking these gentlemen to review the Rules
and to submit a memorandum with respect
to the amendments they proposed. What I
laid on the table a week ago was their report
embodying the amendments, without change
by me or by any other members of the
Committee, either by way of elimination or
addition.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,
January 29, at 8 p.m.

SENATE STATIONERY
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, may I ask what is the price for
embossing notepaper and envelopes of the
Senate, and what would be the price for
printing only "The Senate, Ottawa" on each
piece of paper and each envelope, instead of
having them embossed?
I mean, printing
them without the die, just printing "The
Senate, Ottawa". They could be printed in
red.
Besides that, what stock of embossed paper
has the Senate in reserve? And when I say
paper I mean envelopes as well. I hope that
in the near future the Leader of the Government will be in a position to answer these
questions.
My idea, to make myself clear, is to economize, to save money, instead of wasting
money on embossing. As a matter of fact
there are large firms today which no longer
use embossed stationery, because they find it
a waste of money. Printing our letterheads
and envelopes would result in a big economy.

have gone before to the mover (Hon. Mr.
Bois) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Smith)
of the Address, and to express the hope
that the new members who came to the
Senate this session have found the same
warm welcome that will always be such a
pleasant memory to those of us who were
appointed last year.
I should like, too, in the beginning, to
compliment the Prime Minister and the Government on a number of matters which were
dealt with in the Speech from the Throne.
As an educator, the first of these which
I was deeply gratified to hear about when I
was in India was the establishment of the
Canada Council, with a trust fund of $50
million. This is a gracious and imaginative
development and will have far-reaching
effects on the cultural growth and development of Canada. There is one word I might
have the temerity to say in connection with
the appointment of the Council, and I say
it as a man who has worked with artists
for the last twenty-five years: while I am
sure it is desirable that there be a good
representation from the arts on the Council,
I hope that there will be also a good representation from the business world, for I
can think of no more fruitful partnership
than that of business and the arts. Too
often, acting alone in these matters, neither
does as well as > the two working together.
Also, as an educator, I should like to
express appreciation of the Government's
action or proposals to double the present
per capita grants to the universities. I can
assure you that this will be deeply appreciated. I would also compliment the Government on the establishment of the $50 million
building fund to assist capital developments
of universities. It is particularly gratifying
to know that this money is earmarked for
a program in the humanities. Of course, $50
million is not sufficient, but it is a good
beginning, and if the provinces do equally
well a very fine start will be made.
The promise of increased aid for technical
education is also a move which can have farreaching effects in Canada. One of the great
gaps in our educational program today is the
lack of provision for adequate facilities in
the technical education field. If more provision is made for technical education it will
relieve to some extent the pressure on the
universities.
Honourable senators, at this time I wish
to compliment the honourable senator from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) on the plea
that he made for more, smaller universities
in the course of his address the other day.
I predict that within the next ten or fifteen
years we shall see quite a development of

the village colleges and junior colleges. These
will go a long way in relieving the pressures
which are building up on the older and major
Canadian universities.
Since I am in a complimentary frame of
mind this evening, I also wish to compliment
the Government on the proposed establishment of a Senate committee on land use.
Perhaps I should say that my speech was
prepared before I knew who would be
nominated as members of the committee. The
formation of that committee is one of those
important and fruitful starting points, or
growing points, which can have far-reaching
effects in the development of this country. I
say that as one who served as a member
of the Provincial Committee on the Rehabilitation of the Dry Areas and Crop Insurance
in Alberta. I might add that I wrote the
report of that committee with regard to the
dry areas of southern Alberta. That, again,
is a subject having far-reaching implications,
because the battle for water and for soil
conservation is going to be one of the great
battles of all time between man and nature.
I also wish to express my compliments to
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
the Honourable Mr. Pickersgill, upon the
promptitude with which he acted in meeting
the emergency situation created by the flight
of refugees from Hungary. I think every
Canadian has cause for gratification in the
HowGovernment's very humane action.
ever, I would go one step further and say
first, that I hope our immigration program
will be extended, and, secondly, that a special
effort will be made to bring more people
from Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands.
Honourable senators, I have read and
heard at various times that people have said
the Speech from the Throne at the opening of
this session did not have much in it. Being
a non-political member of Parliament, I do
not know what the politician's reaction would
be, but the reaction of an educator is that in
so far as education in Canada is concerned,
the Speech frorm the Throne was one of the
most productive and fruitful ever delivered
since Confederation.
The main purpose of my speaking tonight
is to present a report to the Senate on the
Ninth General Conference of UNESCO, held
in New Delhi from November 5 to December
5, 1956.
First, I would like to thank the Prime
Minister, the Right Honourable Mr. St.
Laurent, and the Secretary of State for External Affairs, the Honourable Mr. Pearson,
for the honour they did me in asking me to
be a member of Canada's delegation, and for

JANUARY 29, 1957
the very great opportunity they provided me
to continue my education in international
affairs.
Canada's delegation to the Conference was
the largest ever sent to UNESCO, and I think
the reason for that was the particularly grave
situation existing in Asia today. Many nations
are not committed, or at least not committed as much as we would like them
to be, toward the democratic world. The
leader of the Canadian delegation was that
distinguished gentleman Leonard Brockington, Q.C., and H. E. Morley Scott, High
Commissioner to Pakistan, was Deputy
Leader. The other members of the delegation were Col. F. T. Fairey, M.P. for Victoria;
Lionel Bertrand, M.P. for Terrebonne; Freeman Stewart, Secretary, Canadian Teachers'
Federation; Dr. Leon Lortie, Professor of
Chemistry, University of Montreal; Dr. Jean
C. Falardeau, Department of Sociology, Laval
University; John Parkin, President, Canadian
Arts Council; Mrs. Florence Bird, of Ottawa
-probably
better known as Ann Francis;
Melvin Clark, of Geneva; H. E. Escott Reid,
High Commissioner to India; Miss Mary
Dench, Information Office, Department of
External Affairs, and myself.
I wish to go out of my way to pay a compliment to Mr. and Mrs. Reid for the magnificent job they are doing for Canada in a very
heavy and difficult post. I have been told by
Indian publicists, educators, and politicians,
that in India Mr. Reid's advice is sought after
and listened to more than that of any other
representative of a foreign nation. I can
assure honourable senators that the advice is
given with typical Canadian forthrightness,
but his sincerity and his dedication to his job
are greatly appreciated by those with whom
he is working.
The Canadian delegation was very representative, and I think it gave a fairly good
account of itself during the five weeks of the
conference. It is certainly true that, out of the
hundreds of addresses that were delivered,
the two which captured the imagination of
the conference to a greater extent than any
others did were those of the leader of our
delegation, Mr. Brockington, at the opening
and closing sessions.
Perhaps I should take a moment or two
ta describe the setting of the conference, and
the political climate of the first week or ten
days. Before doing so, however, I wish to pay
tribute to India, to her leaders and people.
No delegate to the conference could help but
be impressed by the magnificence of the
arrangements made for the comfort and convenience of the delegates, and by the imaginative plans which were made for the delegates
to meet the leaders of Indian thought in every

walk of life-political leaders, educators,
members of the judiciary, journalists, artists,
businessmen and working people from every
walk of life; and, what was equally important
to us, for opportunities to get to know members of other delegations. Literally dozens of
cultural programs of a national and international character were arranged to coincide
with the conference, and this in itself made
the visit to New Delhi a stimulating and rich
educational experience.
The physical arrangements for the conference were on a splendid scale. The Indian
Government had not only built, in readiness
for the conference, the finest conference hall
I have ever been in, but they built two hotels,
the Janpath-a modest but comfortable hotel
-and the still incompleted Ashoka, which
when finished will be one of the finest hotels
in the world. Their organization of transportation, in a city of great distances, left little
to be desired. And to the fine physical
arrangements there were added the graciousness and courtesy of a great people, who are,
fortunately for us, in the vanguard of a significant democratic experiment in Asia.
Since my return from Asia I have been
somewhat concerned at the tendency to be
critical of India and of her leader, Mr.
Nehru, a tendency which I have found to be
prevalent among some individuals and in certain sections of the press. At the risk of
wearying you I think I must take a few
moments to give my assessment of India's
role in the world today as I see it and feel it,
after a careful and considered attempt ta
assess the situation. However, I ask honourable members to bear in mind that I had only
six weeks of first-hand study.
To begin with, India is a big country whose
distances are in many instances comparable
to those we are familiar with in Canada.
For example, it is 1,000 miles from Calcutta,
in the south eastern Bay of Bengal, to Delhi.
It is 800 miles from Delhi to the southwestern
port of Bombay. It is 900 miles northwest
across the Delhi plain and desert to Karachi,
just across the border in Pakistan. It is 700
miles north of Delhi to Simla and Darjeeling
in Kashmir, and the same distance eastward
to Benares. It is 1,800 miles south from Delhi
to Colombo in Ceylon. These instances will
give you some idea of the physical distances..
In this great subcontinent there are 376
million people, speaking 35 languages. In the
Indian Parliament there are 645 members, of
whom only 35 are communists, and I am told
the expectation is that after the new elections in March the number of communists
will be substantially reduced. It is interesting to a Canadian to learn that English is:
the main language of the Indian Parliament..

conference, but they did flot say very much.

pattern of discussion in the opening ten days
of a highly charged political atmosphere.
Fuel was added to, the emotional fire by
an impassioned speech by the delegate from
Egypt, who said, "I arn the only delegate
from my country because the others were
prevented from getting here as a resuit of
the British bombing of Cairo." He went on
to say, "As I stand in this conference hall
addressing this assembly I cannot help but
wonder what is happening to my wife and my
eleven-year-old child under the ramn of
British bombs in Cairo." Well, he went on in
that vein. We got to know him later on; he
appeared a very decent chap and you could
make some allowances for the emotional
situation in which he found himself. There
was flot the same excuse for the Syrian delegate who followed him, however. He was
completely unrestrained in his condemnation
of the aggression and according to him the
traitorous action of the British, French and
Israelis. Added to that was the fact that
scattered througli the corridors was the odd
radio receiving set, over whiých Radio Cairo
could be heard blaring away with the most
fantastic tales of British bombings and atrocities against defenceless women and ýchuldren. It is true that the B.B.C. was coming in
equally well, but the quiet well-modulated
voice of the B.B.C. announcer by its very
restraint seemed to fail in an adequate
rebuttal.
Now, added to this situation was another
calculated to keep the political atmosphere
sizzling. This was a motion interjected by
the U.S.S.R. to prevent the seating of the
Formosa Chinese delegation, and the reasons
put forward for not seating the delegation
were two:
I. That the Government which sponsored
this delegation did not represent the people
of China because another government did.
IL. That technically they were not entitled
to be seated because they had not paîçl their
membership dues for the last five yeau grid
were $500,000 in armers.

The Formosa Chinese delegation was ultirnateiy scated but many delegates felt the
whole wrangle did not reflect the conference
in a very favourable light.
It was in this tense and politically supercharged atmosphere, and after 57 delegations had spoken, that Mr. Brockington, the
leader of the Canadian delegation took the
rostrum. The papers referred to him as "the
aged and eloquent leader". This reference
to Mr. Brockington as aged greatly amused
the other members of the Canadian delegation, for he is only 69. While I cannot take
the time to quote in detail what he said, he
caught the ear of the conference at once and
he was responsible, I think, more than any
other person for breaking the tense political
atmosphere of the conference as it existed at
that time, and getting the conference back to
the discussion of subject-matters for which
it was called, namely, the educational, scientifie and cultural development of the world.
Mr. Brockington made two statements
which I shall emphasize. First, he stressed
the role of freedom and f ree discussion in
a democratic world; and secondly, Canada's
role as a composite of many races dedicated
to the free development of the human race.
In connection with the first point he said:
Perhaps we ean ail take somne comfort f rom the
knowledge that even today ne stronger criticism

no freer or more vigorous denunciation of its
dangers has anywhere been spoken or written
than in famous British newspapers freely published
in Britain itself. in publie meetings freely assemnbled. in earnest debates freely held in a free
British Parliament and wherever men gather in
Britain to hammer out the truth on the anvil of
f ree discussion.

Every tirne h-e used the word "free" he
emphasized it with ail his might and the point
was not lost among the delegates.
His second point emphasized Canada's peculiar appeal to peoples from other lands and at
the same tume stressed the raison d'être for
the conference being held at all. He said:
We in Canada who are the beneficiaries of the

gifts of se many other people believe that there
is only one race in the world which is really
important and that is the human race. We are
determined to pay with reverence our debt to
humanity.

These were the two key paragraphs in
Mr. Brockington's opening address which,
mind you, was the 57th address in that conference. He stressed the humanitarian note,
he reminded one and ahl that we were there
flot for a political discussion, but to discuss
something much more important-the educational, cultural and scientific development of
mankind.
I thînk most of the delegates would agree
with me that f romn this point on the political
atmosphere of the conference was reduced

SENATE
to a minor key and the delegates approached
their tasks in a more constructive frame of
mind. That is not to suggest that political
considerations did not obtrude themselves
on other occasions when we were dealing
with education, cultural activities, mass communications, and peaceful uses of atomie
energy-to mention a few of the subjects.
It would be rather naive to think that political
considerations would not play a part. But
by and large many people, men and women
from 79 countries, made a constructive contribution to the thinking on problems as wide
as humanity, and in effect the UNESCO conference became a great parliament of mankind dedicated to advance on the social and
humanitarian frontiers of the world.
So much for the general atmosphere. I need
not tell a meeting of this kind what UNESCO
stands for, although it is amazing to find out
how little conception many people throughout
the country have of its function and purpose.
For the purpose of convenience the UNESCO
program is divided into eight subject areas,
to each of which is allocated a share of the
total budget amounting annually to between
$11 million and $11.5 million, or something
under $23 million for the two-year period.
The subject areas, with their share of
the budget, are:

special effort to train teachers and to provide
the facilities for them to get at least an
elementary education.
The second major project-the arid zone
project, as it is called-is also vitally important in the kind of world in which we
are living, particularly when we remember
that 25 per cent of this globe is desert. One
of the particularly interesting discussions
that took place there, under the leadership
of Sir Charles Darwin, a scientist and member of the British delegation, and, of course,
a descendant of the famous Charles Darwin,
concerned itself with the project to convert
salt water into fresh water so that it could
be used for irrigation purposes. This gives
some insight into one of the projects which
UNESCO is studying.
Associated with this arid zone project is
the question of how to adapt a way of life
to the arid zones and how to deal effectively
with the nomadic people who live in those
zones.
The next areas of interest are the natural
sciences, the social sciences, cultural activities, mass communications, exchange of p'rsons, documents and publications.
A study of these subject areas will indicate
that the dividing line between each of them
is sometimes rather hard to define. I think
one of the reasons why there is so much confusion and misunderstanding, and so much
repetition in discussions in UNESCO, is that
insufficient time bas been spent in trying to
establish definite demarcation lines, if it can
be done at all. For this reason some of the
sessions of the UNESCO conference are somewhat confusing and repetitious, because the

Santa Claus. A UNESCO conference is no
different from others in that respect. The
resolution was carried by a vote of 27 for,
19 against, with 20 abstentions,-a most unsatisfactory way of arriving at a decision.
Honourable senators can imagine the effect
on the conference of suddenly having a million dollars more than it had planned to
spend. Al the "have-not" nations of Latin
America and South-East Asia put forward
their own pet projects and asked that the
money be spent on this, that, and the other,
while those with projects in being demanded
that their grants be increased. The result
was great confusion in the conference, and a
veritable blitzkreig of proposals to spend
money. Never in my experience have I been
subject to such a variety of resolutions, draft
resolutions and the like. The pile of documents that I have before me represents only
one-half of the mass of material of this kind
to which we were exposed. Anybody who
has had experience of a political or other
convention knows that, when a lot of resolutions are submitted from the floor many of
them are repetitive, or overlap and a screening process is very necessary. As the one
whose misfortune it was to be elected rapporteur of the conference, I was in a position
to appreciate the disadvantages of a nonscreening procedure.
Under these circumstances the Canadians,
I believe, played an effective role. Some of
the delegates were rather critical of our
people because, they said, Canadians always
look at the dollar; but that attitude, I suggest, is sometimes very useful.
Two suggestions made by Canadians were
accepted by the conference. One was, that
there should be a general overhaul of the
conference procedures so that succeeding
conferences should not be exposed to a blitz
of paper. The second suggestion was more
difficult to get approved, and great credit
is due to Frank Fairey, M.P., of Victoria, and
to Mel. Clark, of the Finance Department, at
Geneva. They pointed out that UNESCO had
been in existence for ten years and had a
spending budget in excess of $21 million, so
it would be a good idea to engage an outside
firm of consultants to examine the organization's administrative procedures. That idea,
as I have said, took a lot of selling, and the
original resolution was substantially watered
down, but finally a motion to that general
effect was accepted. It will, I believe, have
good results. Another point which should be
kept in mind in connection with the vote to

increase the budget is that the nations whose
representatives voted for the increase are
responsible for providing only 15 per cent
of the funds, while the nations whose representatives were opposed to it contribute 85
per cent. Another point with which Western
democracies must be concerned is that since
last summer 16 more nations have been
admitted to membership in the United
Nations. While this, I agree, is a good thing,
from now on the so-called Western democracies can be outvoted on any issue when
the Latin American countries decide to vote
as a bloc with either the Soviet or the AfroAsian bloc. This may lead to complications
in the days to come.
I will take no more than a short time to
allude to some of the details of the program.
I wonder whether it would be possible, without reading detailed figures, to put a statement into the record.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: First, education. Under

May I comment on some of the projects
outlined in the material placed on the record?
One example is the "sponsoring of an international conference on public education". It
may be said, "What has that to do with us?"
Not a great deal, but it is vitally important
to people in underdeveloped areas that they
may benefit by our experience and adopt
some of the methods and techniques which
have proved successful.

SENATE
Some Hon. Senators: Hear. hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: He made a trenendous
impression on the Indian people, and that
impression was further strengthened by the
more recent visit of our Secretary of State
for External Affairs, the Honourable Mr.
Pearson; and I have no doubt this impression
was again enhanced by the still more recent
visit by our Minister of National Health and
Wceare, the Honourable Paul Martin.
The welcome mat was out for Canadians
wherever we went, and I think one of the
reasons for this is that the Indian people
and indeed most peoples of the worldhave the feeling that Canada is in a peculiarly
fortunate position in that she is a composite
of many nations, and has welcomed people
from all countries to help build her as a
nation. This is an important element in engendering the friendly feeling towards Canada
and Canaïdians.
Another point is that these people feel
Canada does not want anything from anybody, that Canada will bring to her councils
in the international
field
a completely
objective and honest consideration.
That
means a lot.
I want to emphasize the great job that our
diplomatie service is doing, and I would pay
tribute to the work done by Mr. Escott Reid
and his staff in New Delhi, and to Mr. Morley
Scott and his staff in Pakistan. Our diplomatie
service throughout the world is looked upon
as first-class, and we have reason to be proud
of the job that has been done. We have
responsibilities to see that these people receive
our backing and encouragement at all times.
The third reason for Canada's role at the
present time being particularly helpful is
what this country is doing under the
Colombo Plan. The $34 million a year we
are spending under that plan is bringing
tremendous dividends in terms of good will

from Bombay, the Warsak Project in Pakistan, and our atomic reactor at Bombay are
giving a new appreciation of Canada's unselfish willingness to help these nations by
bringing our technological personnel into
close association with theirs.
The fourth factor is Canada's role in the
recent Suez crisis.
As I indicated in the
beginning, the tension in the first week or
ten days of the conference was extremely
high. Mr. Brockington's address to the conference made a great contribution toward
easing of that tension, but the thing that
finally broke the tension entirely was Mr.
Pearson's speech at the United Nations in
New York when he brought forth the idea of
an international police force supplanting the

armed intervention.
You could almost feel
the release of tension, because in those first
few days in that part of the world many of
us wondered whether we \vere wvell on the
way to World War III. It was a very unhappy situation, but from then on, thanks to
the imaginative and daring scheme promoted by Mr. Pearson, there was a great
sense of relief through the whole conference.
In conclusion I would emphasize that I
have dealt with the program of UNESCO at
some length because I believe it is important for people everywhere to know what it
means, what it stands for, and what is is
trying to do. I think we must come to look
upon UNESCO as a symbol of man's aspirations. It is idealistic and it attracts people
who may be more idealistic than practical,
but with all its weaknesses in administration
and its diffusiveness and its sometimes ineffectiveness, it does represent one of the
great hopes of mankind. As Mr. Nehru put
it in his opening remarks, it is the "conscience
of the world".
One final thing: in coming back through
London I spent some time with the British
Council, and they were rather proud of the
fact that they were helping to establish a
Chair of Commonwealth Relations at the
University of Aliwar in India. That is not a
very large university, but I think the idea of
establishing a Chair of Commonwealth Relations is excellent. I would go further and
say it is just as important to have a Chair
of Commonwealth Relations centred in universities in Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and other parts of the Commonwealth as it is
to have one in India, because the day has
come when we can no longer take the Commonwealth for granted. It can be stronger
than ever if we are willing to work at it.
The Chairs of Commonwealth Relations can
be one of the means of strengthening it. Another means is by increasing the number of
scholars that are being sent to study in other
parts of the world, as well as by bringing
more scholars from other parts of the world
to our country. In this way we shall be
playing a great role, not only in developing a
new appreciation of one country for another,
but in making of this British Commonwealth
of Nations one of the greatest factors for constructive good in the whole world. Honourable senators, we hear people talking about
the "decline" of the British Empire; some
say it with a malicious twist. My view is
that if we work at the job of creating harmony and understanding among the nations
of the Commonwealth, we shall succeed
in translating the great British Empire of
yesterday into the united Commonwealth of
free nations of tomorrow, and that will be

PRIVATE BILL
OBLATE FATHERS OF ASSUMPTION
PROVINCE-SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill T, an Act to incorporate
Oblate Fathers of Assumption Province.
He said: Honourable senators, I need not
detain you for more than a few moments in
connection with this bill. As its title indicates,
this is an Act to incorporate the Oblate
Fathers of Assumption Province. The proposed incorporation would establish a division in the Roman Catholic Order called the
Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The
proposed new Province has been established
aiready under ecclesiastical law, and it is
now desired to have it legally established in
Canada through this instrument. The new
Province will be organized and operated by
clergymen, mainly of Polish descent, all residents of Canada, and it is designed to be of
service primarily to people of Polish descent.
The head office will be in Toronto, and the
corporation would be competent to make
by-laws, to elect officers and directors, and
have all other powers customarily given by
bills of this character.
The main objects of the bill and of the
proposed corporation are to be found in
section 7, which reads as follows:

powers and duties of companies. The corporation is given specific power to borrow
money under the usual conditions, and it
may conduct businesses which will promote
the charitable or religious works for which
it is founded.
Honourable senators, if the bill receives
second reading I will move later that it be
referred to the Miscellaneous Private Bills
Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

BILL REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
move that Bill W, intituled an Act for the
relief of Jack Stevenson Chalmers, be not
now read a second time but that it be referred to the Committee on Divorce for
consideration.
The explanation is that since the bill was
recommended to the Senate a letter has been
received from the respondent claiming that
she had not contested the divorce because of
lack of funds; it was therefore deemed wise to
reconsider the bill before sending it on for
second reading.
The motion was agreed to.

TO

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, with reference to the motion, of
which I gave notice yesterday,The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, has the honourable gentleman leave
to move today the motion standing in his
name?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
yesterday I gave notice of a motion for the
setting up of a special committee to study
land use in Canada. At that time I suggested
that the committee consist of 25 members.
May I have leave of the house to increase
the number of senators to 26, and also to
make one substitution? I should like to have
the name of Senator Léger added, and to substitute the name of Senator Basha for Senator
Baird.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Has the
honourable senator leave to amend his motion
as indicated by him?
Hon. Senators:

Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I therefore move the amended motion, which
reads as follows:
1. That a Special Committee of the Senate be appointed to consider and report on land use in

JANUARY 30, 1957
Canada and what should be done to, ensure that our
land reaources are most effectively utilized for the
benefit of the Canadian economy and the Canadian
people, and, in particular, to increase both agricultural production and the incomes of those engaged
in it;
2. That the said committee be composed of the
Honourable Senators Barbour, Basha, Boucher,
Bois, Bradette. Camneron. Crerar, Golding, Hawkins,
Horner, Inman, Leger, Leonard, McDonald. MeGrand, Molson, Petten, Power, Smith (Kamloops),
Stambaugh, Taylor (Norfolk), Taylor (Westmorland), Tremblay, Turgeon, Vaullancourt and Wall.
3. That the commlttee have power to, engage the
services of such counisel and technical and clerical
personnel as may be necessary for the purpose of
the inqulry.
4. That the commlttee have power to send for
persons, papers and records; to sit during sittinga
and adjournments of the Senate, and to report from
time to time.

Honourable senators may recall that the
Speech from the Throne contained a paragraph reading as follows:
It la proposed to recomnsend in the Senate thie
establishment of a committee to consider what
should he done to make hetter use of land for
agriculture and thus to contribute more effectively
to the improvement of agricultural production and
the incomes of those engaged in it.

A number of senators who have already
spoken on the Speech from the Throne expressed their approval of this suggestion. I
recail that the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Bois), who moved the
Address in reply, devoted practically ail his
address to the subj ect of making better use
of farm land for the pUrpose of increasing
both production and income. When 1 spoke on
the Speech from the Throne I referred to
the fact that he is a specialist on the subject.
He is a highly regarded authority throughout
his own province of Quebec, especially, and
in other parts of Canada.
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig), when speaking on the Speech from
the Throne, welcomed the announcement
that the Senate would be asked to appoint
a committee to undertake a study of land
use. In tact, I think I may safely say that
practically ail senators were pleased by the
announcement.
In its infinite variety of climate and scenery Canada is a wonderful country in which
to travel, work and live. However, it is our
land to which I wish to make special reference, for it is a vital part of our national
heritage and a veritable treasure house of
resources. First there is the annual fecundity
of the soul, which produces so much food
stuiffs and other essential products both for
our own use and for sale abroad; and,' beneath the soil there is a wealth of oil, gas
and minerals whose extent is so great that it
can only be guessed at.
We are at times inclined to take ahl this
land and its resources for granted and to regard its productivity as unending. To my

mmnd, honourable senators, this is a dangerous
delusion. There is no doubt that we must
guard and conserve our land resources. We
must keep in reasonable balance the competing pressures for land, particularly when
good farmn land is affected. For above all we
must remember that good land is the essential
resource of a sound farming economy, a resource which we in our day should carefully
husband s0 that we can pass it on for the use
of the generations who will follow us, in ever
increasing numbers, and with steadily growing requirements that they will look to the
land to provide.
Agriculture is and will continue to be of
vital importance to the Canadian economy.
At present some 800,000 persons are employed in agriculture; and, besides the great
value of their products both for domestic and
external trade. our agrieultural workers
represent a very important market for the
products and services provided by their fellow citizens in non-agricultural industries.
It is clear that the prosperity of farming and
of farmers is of immediate concern to all
of us.
Over a period of many years there has
been a trend away from the farm. This in
large part is the normal and natural result
of the increased use of machinery in farming
and the application of scientific techniques
that together have quite substantially increased the yield of each acre of land, while
reducing the number of workers required for
the larger yield.
No one can doubt that this country owes
much to those who were raised on our farms
-as a number of honourable senators wereand who have left them to find other ways
to make a livelihood and contribute to the
building of Canada. But my concern today
is not with those who have left or with those
who have stayed on the farm and are doing
wel1 there, but rather with those farmers
who are waging a losing battle with insufficient or worn-out land or Who, for other
reasons, are unable to earn a reasonable
income for themselves and their families as
the reward of a reasonable amount of hard
work.
The Prime Minister, in a speech delivered
in Toronto on November 20 last, posed this
problem, to which I know he has for some
time given considerable thought.
After
referring to the need for increased food production generally to keep pace with Canada's
rapidly growing population, he said:
Now-at lest in eastern Canada-the area of
our arable lands cannot be suhstantiafly increased.
On the contrary. there is a not unimportant portion of those lands now included An the farmed

country unnecessary, to allow back-breaking work
to be conîtinued when it is so obvious that it
cannot yield a decent family livelihood to those
who engage in that work.
I say that should not be continued, because we
are blessed by Providence in this country with
such great and valuable resources that any man's
consistent arduous work could and should provide
him with adequate returns to secure for himself
and his dependents a decent livelihood, provided
that work is applied to the right job in the appropriate setting.

May I quote one more paragraph from the
Prime Minister's speech? He went on to say:
I am convinced that some of the land in eastern
Canada that hard-working Canadians are trying to
use as farms should go back to forest and water
conservation uses and those attempting to live on
them resettled in more rewarding surroundings.

The preliminary report of the Royal Commission on Canada's Economie Prospects
points out that between 1946 and 1955 the
physical volume of output per farm and per
man-hour has very substantially increased
vihile the number employed in agriculture
dropped by nearly one-third. I quote directly
from the report:
Over a long period of tirne the average incomes
of agricultural workers (farmers, family labour
and hired labour) were generally lower than the
incomes of other producers, except for fishermen.

This is to be noted:
But during the last ten years, the real earnings
of agricultural workers have inproved considerably,
bth absolutely and in comparison with the earnings of workers in other occupations.
This is a heartening conclusion, but one of

our chief concerns now, when we are instituting the comprehensive study proposed, is to
sce whether those farmers who are not sharing as they should in this general advance
could benefit from sorne rearrangement of
land use. Our endeavour, I suggest, should
bc to work out sorne long-term constructive
answer to the problem which the proposed
committee is to study.
In his speech giving the broad background
of the land-use problem with which it is
suggested a Senate committee could usefully
deal, the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Bois) emphasized that this is a
subject in which our Governments have
always been interested. He emphasized, too,
that research into agricultural policies must
take account of their social and national
features.
May I say a word here to remind honourable senators that under our Constitution
agriculture is one of those areas in which
the Parliament of Canada as well as the
provincial Legislatures may both make laws.
There can be no doubt that any comprehensive study of land use will have to range
widely across the Canadian scene, but much
of the information that the proposed committee will take under advisement will come

from the provincial departments of agriThe pattern of land use varies
culture.
widely, as honourable senators know, from
province to province.

The quotations from the Prime Minister's
speech and the paragraph that I read from
the Speech from the Throne represent there-

fore, in my opinion, and I think in the
opinion of all honourable senators, a very
proper and timely concern for a problem
which has many overlapping provincial and
national aspects. It is only appropriate that
ideas about the better use of land in this
country-important as that is for all citizens-should be looked into by both levels
of Government whose duty it is to legislate in
such matters and from whom our fellow
citizens quite naturally expect close co-operation in the examination and solution of problems of such national extent and significance.
Honourable senators, as we look back over
the years, as the honourable senator from
Montarville reminded us, besides the trend
away from the farm as fewer farmers with
more machinery and better techniques have
been able to produce the food that Canada
needed or that could be sold by this country
abroad, we sec a second trend, the gradual
movement away from marginal farms either
to take employment in the towns and cities
or to find some other farms or new land that

could provide a more adequate income.
I am sure that no member of the committee
or of this house will want anyone to leave
farming who could find a decent living in
this honourable field of human endeavour.
For all of us realize how attached a farmer
becomes to his own land, to his own locality
and to the friends and relatives who live
around him. Certainly, our first thought must
be of measures for the rehabilitation of the
less productive farm, wherever that is found
justified in the light of all the circumstances.
No farmer would want to consider moving
to "fresh woods and pastures new" unless
it is evident that his present farm cannot
be made sufficiently productive for his needs
and those of his family.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: And even then it is
difficult to get him to move away from home.
There is no place like home.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I quite agree that
there is no place like home. As I said, I do not
think any member of this committee or this
house would suggest to any farmer that he
should move from his home if he can make
a reasonable living on his farm by a reasonable amount of work. The purpose of this
committee will not be to induce Yarmers
to become dissatisfied with their homes and
their land.

JANUARY 30, 1957
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask whether
the productivity of the farm will be the
only consideration? A great deal often depends on legal conditions. For instance we
have all read of the plight of the share-cropper, when the mere owner carries away the
bulk of the produce and the man who actually does the work has very little left.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is probably what we call an economie and social
problem between the worker and the owner
of a farm. I think the committee will confine its inquiry more to the use to which
the land can be put.

other industries, or move to more productive
farms or new land. But we realize too that
the deterioration of income on a marginal
farm is a gradual process, and this, coupled
with the ordinary human inertia that dissuades us from leaving old, familiar surroundings, no doubt bas delayed some moves too
long.
It is, therefore, may I say, the challenging
task of this proposed Senate committee (a)
to make a broad survey of land use in Canada, (b) to focus public attention on all
aspects of this problem, and (c) to invite
the best minds in the country to set out
their views as to the appropriate solutions,

in the neighbourhood of the Trans-Canada
Highway, whose boys, aged 18 to 25, come
to the city each morning, work as carpenters
or otherwise in the building trades, and then
go home. I am not going to discuss the
reasons for the discrepancy of incomes, but
it is a fact, and an important phase of the
problem before us, that what the farmer
receives for his products is out of line with
the level of costs of living in Canada generally. From time to time when a farmer
brings in cheques signed by his boys, I ask,
"What are they doing?" and I am told,
"They are working for the Superior Construction Company" or some other city industry; and this indicates, of course, that
these boys are no longer engaged on the
home farm.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is it not also true that
people work harder and longer hours on
farms?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and probably that
has some influence on the movement away
from farms. But primarily what makes these
young people come to town is that they can
earn more money there. Once they have
become city workers their easier life inclines them to stay where they are, but
the original incentive is the prospect of
better pay.
I should like to illustrate one aspect of the
general question. In the province of Manitoba, in the area between Brandon and
Portage la Prairie, may be found many
hundreds of acres of sandy land. In the early
days of settlement the homesteaders cut down
the woods and tried to cultivate the land.
In this attempt they failed, and they moved
out. Subsequently trees began to grow again
in these districts as well as in other areas
of the province. I suggest that the committee
would do well to inquire what is being done
in Manitoba and other provinces about the
reforestation of lands of low fertility. I
have noticed that a large and well-wooded
district between Brandon and Portage has
grown up entirely through natural causes.
With proper attention the growth would
probably have been twice as large.

This committee bas a very difficult job.
I am reminded of the time when the Senate
undertook an investigation of income tax
matters. We know that our committee on
that occasion was not only able to help in
the solution of one of Canada's important
problems, and thereby do a real service to
the people, but that its work reflected great
honour on the Senate itself. Here is another

opportunity for this chamber to offer the
Canadian people, if not a complete solution,
some valuable recommendations and suggestions, and, at least, to present the facts of

the situation in respect of our agricultural
lands. I think that is the most important
thing the committee has to do. Immigrants
are needed; Canada will become the home

of a much larger population, and if people
who come here t settle can be enabled to
make a good living it will be all the better
for Canada and for the world at large.
What the committee will have to do is to
gather information not only from the provincial agricultural officials but from those
engaged in reforestation, for each province
bas already done some of this work. The
provinces are disturbed about the present
situation and are endeavouring to reforest
various sections.

Then there is the question of oil production and conservation. Some areas that are
barren so far as agriculture is concerned are
tremendous oil producers. I was amazed to

learn that the area around the little village
of Virden, Manitoba, produced enough oil
last year to meet the general oil consumption
of the whole province. Oil is now being
found in large quantities in Saskatchewan,
and honourable senators are familiar with
the fabulous oil story in Alberta and northern British Columbia. The committee will
have to take into consideration the fact that
our oil-producing lands must be protected.
I do not think it is a question of moving
people from one locality to another, but
rather of showing them what present areas
are best suited to produce crops. Fifty miles
east of Winnipeg the land is so poor that a
farmer cannot make a living off it, no matter
how capable he is. I have been through that
district time and time again, and I know
that its soil lacks some important element.
A farmer cannot grow a successful crop
there, yet twenty miles on the other side of
that district may be found some of the finest
farming land in all of western Canada.
Similar variations in soils are characteristic
of large areas in southern Saskatchewan and
southern Alberta. All these conditions will
have to be investigated thoroughly.
I am certainly not a soil or agricultural
expert, but I have seen areas in Ontario and

Quebec that look to me as though they are
not capable of growing any crops. Our commiittee will have to gather information about
all these places nut, I suggest, from experts
whom the committee might hire, but from

experts in the Government service who are
thoroughly acquainted with the problems
and difficulties faced every day by people
living on poor lands in different parts of
the country.
The problem of trying to make better use

of land for agriculture is not a new one. It
bas existed for many years. When I was a
member

of the Manitoba Legislature, some

JANUARY 30, 1957
thirty-five years ago, the subject was discussed there. It was a serious problem all
over Canada at that time, and it has been
ever since.
After the committee has -conducted a full
inquiry it must then use the information it
has gathered as a basis for recommending
ways and means of solving this whole
problem of land use. The committee will not
get anywhere if it recomends that people
move from poor land to good land. This
would be a costly scheme that would get us
nowhere. The aim is to find out what the
land is best suited to produce. If it can only
be used for reforestation purposes, that is
what it must be used for. The committee
must produce a reliable, practical report
which will, for instance, enable immigrants
to ascertain what kind of land they will find
in the district where they choose to settle.
I am genuinely happy to support this
motion. It is an assignment that the Senate
is better equipped to handle than the other
house is. I am sure the committee members
will perform a real service to Canada, and
one which will be everlastingly to their credit.
I am confident that for many years to come
their report will serve as a guiding light to
our own people and to prospective immigrants.
The Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) was kind enough to consult me
as to the personnel of the committee. He
made the selections and I concurred in them.
There may be other members who might have
been named to the committee, but by and
large we feel that an able and representative
committee has been selected. I trust the
Senate will express its unanimous approval
of the nominated members.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the
members of the committee for accepting the
onerous responsibility with which they have
been charged. I want to assure them that the
Senate will do everything it can to enable
them to produce a report which will go down
in the records as one of the finest achievements of the Senate of Canada.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
have just a few remarks to make at this time.
As honourable members are well aware,
Canada has both good and poor areas for
agricultural purposes. For instance, there are
whole areas where a mould had formed
during a period of thousands of years from
leaves and similar vegetation. These lands
have yielded a reasonable profit to farmers,
but in time the mould disappeared. Western
Canada has vast grass areas that are good
for grazing purposes but not for farming.
A committee of the University of Saskatchewan conducted a survey into soil conditions

throughout the province, and the information
gathered is available to the public.
I look upon our vast lands as a heritage
of all our people, and some day our children
will discover that Canada's most valuable
asset is its land. In this connection I am dismayed, to say the least, that it is found necessary to flood certain areas along the St. Lawrence River for the construction of the
seaway.
My main purpose in rising at this time is
to warn the Government that the construction
of air fields and other projects necessary for
the expansion of cities and towns should not
be carried out on good farm lands. I thought
the Premier of Quebec made a wise suggestion recently when he said it may be necessary to forbid the sale of good farm land for
building expansion purposes. In the vicinity
of Montreal, for example, some of the choicest
farm lands have been taken up entirely by
buildings. When I pass through there by train
it often occurs to me that it might have been
possible to build residential and other property on rock or sand rather than on productive land. Such questions will eventually become of great importance to Canada.
Honourable senators, I wish to make special
reference to the great fruit-growing areas of
Canada. The Niagara Peninsula is Canada's
finest fruit-growing land.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am told that it is the
most valuable agricultural land in the world.
We read of enormous prices being paid for
it. No doubt a man holding a portion of it
might be offered a sufficient price to retire
with his family, so there is always the risk
that such land may be sold for building
purposes. I think it is an awful thing to
use rich farm lands as sites for houses and
factories, when less valuable land could be
secured. What I am saying here applies also
to the very valuable fruit lands' in parts of
British Columbia, where certain fruits are
grown that cannot be produced anywhere else
in Canada. I think the Government should
use its influence to ensure that such lands
are not permanently destroyed for agricultural use. It is a great pity to see beautiful
heavy clay soil, which is admirably suited
for growing crops, laid over with cement
for huge airports and runways. If we do
not take steps to preserve our good land
for agriculture there may come a day when
we shall have nothing but desert left. Some

ways and means of increasing both agricultural production and the incomes of those
engaged in it.
Broadly speaking, those are the three important questions which this committee is
asked to examine into.
It is I think of interest to look for a
few moments at what has happened in other
countries, and to note what the lack of
proper methods of conservation has done
to the economies of those countries. Almost
3,000 years ago, if my Biblical history is
correct-and if I am wrong, I have no doubt
there are several members of this house
who can correct me-Solomon took the
cedars of Lebanon to help build his temple
in Jerusalem. At that time the hills of
Lebanon were covered with trees. As the
years passed the trees disappeared, and what
was the result? The hills became bare,
erosion of soil took place, and the disappearance of the forests, the natural conservation
agency for streams, has meant that to this
day destructive floods occur almost every
year in that part of the Near East.
There was a time when the substantial
area betweeen the Tigris River and the
Euphrates River in that part of the world
was covered largely with forests which
regulated the flow of these streams and provided subsistence for millions of people.
What is the situation there today? That part
of the Near East is pretty much a desert,
and we in Canada have a direct interest in
it because from time to time we are asked
through various agencies of the United Nations to assist in its economic rehabilitation.
But the Near East is not the only example
of the effect produced by the removal of
forests. Spain is an excellent illustration of
the devastating results. There was a time
centuries ago when Spain was largely covered
with forests, which have since been hewn
down and have not been replaced. The
inevitable consequence has been the erosion
and much loss of soil, and poverty and
distress for a great many of the Spanish
population.
By way of contrast, the Scandinavian peoples have shown great initiative in forest
conservation and rehabilitation. Indeed, they
were the leaders in this field in Europe.
Some 150 years ago Denmark, then little more
than a sand spit jutting out into the North
Sea, adopted sound methods of conservation
by the planting of trees and the growing of
forests. This, combined with the use of
fertilizers, built up the fertility of the soil
and so enhanced its productivity that today
several million people live happily in that
small country.
Sweden started about a century ago to
conserve its forests. I am told that today it

has probably as many trees standing as it
had 50 years ago. In other words, the policy
was that when a tree was cut down another
must be planted in its place.
Numerous illustrations could be given to
demonstrate the impoverishing results of lack
of proper conservation methods. Take, for
instance, India, now engaged in schemes of
rehabilitation; and China, particularly the
great Yellow River, which is generally known
as "the river of misery" because almost every
season its waters come down in turbulent
force, overwhelming the country and destroying not only a large part of the population but of their work as well. These
demonstrate the direct consequences of misuse
of land through the destruction of forests
and the erosion which follows.
We do not need to go far from home to
see what happens as a result of poor conservation methods. Let us look at the
beautiful Ottawa valley, which is the centre
and home of the capital of Canada. A century
and a half ago this valley had the finest forest of white pine known anywhere in the
world. It was logged off, used quite properly,
but nothing was done to replace it. What
In this area today
is the consequence?
you will find people endeavouring to
eke out an existence by farming land that
should be growing trees. I sometimes speculate on what would have happened had our
forests been maintained, as has been done
in Sweden for many years past. True, we
still have much forest wealth, but if we had
a white pine forest in the Ottawa valley it
would add to this wealth, would conserve
water for our power plants and provide much
useful employment.
I would point also to the erosion that has
taken place in the Grand River Valley, in
the western part of Ontario. I would hope
that our colleague from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) would have something to say about
it. This is an area which we have from time
to time discussed in Parliament, because of
its difficulties resulting from the cutting
away of tree coverage at the source of the
river and its tributaries.
Let me take you along to Manitoba; I
know something of the conditions there. The
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) mentioned an area between Carberry and Brandon where the natural cover of
spruce trees is coming along. I may say for
the information of the house that that is an
area where the soil is composed largely of a
very light sandy loam. It is admirably adapted
for the growing of coniferous trees, and it
is a tragedy to see farmers spotted here and
there trying to make a living out of a thin

SENATE
process of years time is effecting its changes,
and time is a great changer and a great
healer of these conditions. It is almost 50
years ago since I made my first trip through
this area, known as the Carberry Hills. At
that time only here and there could a coniferous tree be scen. Today they are there
in tens of thousands, wholly through natural
reforestation; but had we devoted to the
development of the resources of this district
a fraction of what we have wasted in other
directions over the last 75 years, it would
now be the home of a vast spruce forest
with all the wealth, the means of livelihood
and the pleasure that it would give.
I shall mention only one other example in
Canada, and that is the east slope of the

of Alberta, was at one time covered with
forest, which acted as a natural reservoir
for moisture and precipitation, and the
streams that came dowri from the mountainside found their way across the prairies.
With the passage of time some of the forest
was eut down, and fire, the most destructive
agency, carried away a great deal of the

He was correct on both counts. I am not sure that I did
not relate that incident in the Senate several
years ago. Anyway, it is true: we were, and
are, a very wasteful people; but there is
evidence that the importance of conservation
in its many aspects is being realized by the
Canadian people in an ever widening measure, and it is a good thing that this is so.
We have abused our farm lands in a large
part of Canada. Now we have the problem
of restoration before us and on that point may
I mention this, that if any of my honourable
colleagues are interested in what can be done

most suitable for specific types of production,
marketing organization, proximity to markets
and in general, and a set-up which will enable the farmers to get everything they can
out of their operations.
Louis Bromfield, to whom the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has
already referred, once said something like
this: "There is no more important labour on
earth than that of the farmer."
During the war years I had the responsibility of administering departmental operations
in my own province, and I will never forget
the spirit of devotion-of sacrifice, if you
will-of the farm people there in those times.
I would like to give you an illustration. I
was asked one time to address a meeting
being held in the dairy section of my province. Before the meeting took place I went
to visit a certain farmer, but I found he was
away from the farm doing some work in connection with the meeting. In the barn I found
his father and mother milking some cows
that belonged to a herd of pure bred registered Jerseys. The mother was a little
old lady in her seventies and, calling her by
name, I said, "It seems to me this is just
too much for you to be doing." Well, I will
never forget the look on her face when she
replied, "Mr. Taylor, it is something I can
do and I am only happy to be able to do it."
That is the type of sacrifice people on the
farms are still making.
Honourable senators, I must conclude my
remarks, but it is pretty difficult for me to
stop when I get going on a subject such as
this. This subject is very important to me and
I am happy that I have been selected as a
member of the committee. I can assure you
that in so far as the members of the committee are concerned, we will do our utmost
to bring about some condition to improve
the welfare of the farm people of Canada.
To my mind that is of primary importance,
for there is no more stabilizing influence in
the world today than our rural population.
The committee bas a big job to do and, as I
see it, it has taken on a tremendous responsibility. I believe that in the thoughts
of farm people throughout Canada today
there is, as a result of the setting up of this
committee, a type of optirmism that they have
not had for many years. They know that the
authorities are making a real attempt to do
something for Canadian agriculture.
I welcome the remarks of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig),
who said he was quite satisfied with the
establishment of the committee and that he
was willing to give it his full support. I am
sure every member of this august body has
the same view. I want to emphasize that
each of us on the committee has a great

responsibility and a difficult task ahead. We
must put our best efforts into our work in
order to bring about a report that will result
in improving the welfare of the masses of
people who are and who will become our
rural population.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I am sure I express the opinion of
everyone here when I congratulate my new
deskmate the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) on the very impressive speech he has just made.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I know that we all welcome the honourable senator and look forward to many contributions from him in the
years that lie ahead. He has already proved
himself to be a valuable member of the
Divorce Committee, of which I have the
honour to be chairman. I am sure that as
the years go by his experience, wisdom,
fluency and sincerity will make their mark
in this chamber.
One of my reasons for rising at this time
was to pay this compliment to our new
colleague. Another reason was to remark
that the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) was guilty of a masterpiece
of understatement when he told the house
that this was an important resolution. It
could not have been more important, for we

make of land is essentially important to our
progress and to our civilization.

anyone in the Senate in considering the problems and philosophies of land tenure, land
values, and so on. I do not mean to say, of
course, that I am the only repository of such

and the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) have already expressed

The importance of land and its use simply
cannot be overestimated. I hope that this
committee will not limit the scope of its
inquiry to even such important subjects as
land conservation with respect to agricultural
areas of our country. As the honourable
senator from Churchill bas already pointed
out, this resolution asks for a report on land
use in Canada. I am not a member of the

an agricultural one. If that is the reason, it

I should like to make particular reference

In passing I may say that although our
new colleague the honourable senator from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) bas not so
far spoken in the debate on the Speech from
the Throne, we listened with interest to his
remarks this afternoon on a subject on which
he is well qualified to speak.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
speak at length. Even if I wanted to I could
not, because although the spirit is willing
the flesh is indeed weak. However, there is
one item in the Speech from the Throne to
which I should like to draw your attention.
I refer to the proposal that grants to universities be doubled. University grants are
allotted on the basis of provincial population
rather than on student population in each
university. Under this system Nova Scotian
universities, with their large enrolments, have
always suffered a disparity in relation to
universities in other provinces, and the doubling of grants at this time would merely serve
to increase that disparity. I would ask the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) to again draw this protest on
the part of Nova Scotia to the attention of
the Prime Minister and his cabinet, with a
view to finding a more equitable method for
the distribution of grants.

Speech from the Throne. It is always a great
pleasure for me to hear the beautiful French

is widespread disappointment, particularly in
Maritimes, that the basis of calculation for these

grants still remains the same.

This is a situation against which Maritime
universities have protested long and vigorously.
By adopting as a calculation base in the first place
the provincial population, rather than the university
population, a disparity is established which in
effect penalizes the universities which are doing the
most work.

JANUARY 30, 1957
Universities in Nova Scotia, for example, where
the student population forms a higher proportion
of the total provincial population than elsewhere,
obviously receive much less in grant per student
head-and that for doing a greater amount of work
in relation to the province and its population.
And by the raising of rates of grant from fifty
cents to a dollar, the initial disparity, as well as
the total grant, is actually increased.
This lies particularly bard on a province with
such an educational record of service as Nova
Scotia, and seems hardly a fitting manner of
recognizing the obligations which the education
of this province has laid upon the whole country.
In this connection It is of interest to quote from
a most interesting report recently published by the
secretary to the University of Edinburgh. Charles
H. Stewart, who in addition to being a graduate in
Arts and Law, is also a chartered accountant-and
who, therefore, has more than one right to be
heard In such matters-last year toured Canadian
universities under appointment to a fellowship
from the Association of the Universities of the
British Commonwealth.
In his report Mr. Stewart comments on the
"irrefutable" need of Canadian universities for increased financial support, not merely to keep
abreast of the existing needs, but also to have
some prospect of coping with the vastly increasing
enrolment. And then follows this passage:
"For myself, remembering the Maritimes, which,
for all their small numbers, have made such an
immense, perhaps a preponderant, contribution to
Canadian education (did I say that they reminded
me of Scotland?), I very much hope that the
formula of calculation will be revised. It would be
a sad day for Scotland if ber universities were to
be treated in the same way as those in the
Maritimes."
This is a powerful witness from an unbiased
observer from outside, and its weight, especially
based on such qualifications, cannot be lightly dismissed.
The plain truth is that the system of
grants, as presently administered, may go far to
meet at least some of the more pressing needs of
Canadian universities, but it definitely works a
hardship on Maritime institutions.

May I add, honourable senators, that the
universities of Nova Scotia have made a tremendous contribution to this country, to our
neighbour to the south and to other countries. Nova Scotia has provided Canada with
three of its eleven Prime Ministers; New
Brunswick has produced one Prime Minister
of Canada and one Prime Minister of Great
Britain. So, the universities in our part of
Canada have a record of which they are
justly proud. I trust that that record will
help influence the Government to attempt
to improve, and if possible to rectify, the
situation to which I have referred.
Since my recent return from the east coast
I have read in the press of the extent to
which the facilities of the Port of Halifax
have fallen short of meeting the demands
made upon them. Some two weeks ago, about
the time that I left home to come here for
the session, there appeared in the press a
news item to the effect that Halifax harbour
was clogged, that all piers in the port were
occupied by steamships, that many had to

await their turn at the anchorage before
being provided with a berth, that considerable delay was caused to transportation facilities thereby, and that that condition was
going to affect adversely the Port of Halifax.
Now, honourable senators, if we do not
provide more harbour facilities at that location, the trade will go somewhere else. The
preliminary report of the Gordon Commission
says that economically the Maritimes are
away behind the other provinces of Canada,
yet here we have an opportunity to do business and we are not provided with proper
facilities to handle it.
That is all brought to light in an article
that appeared in one of our local newspapers
recently. It is headed "Enforced Delays In
Cargo Handling Draws Complaint." The article goes on to say:
A complaint that lack of adequate shed facilities

bas caused considerable delay in unloading perishable cargo from one of the freighters now in port,
has been voiced by a local steamship man. The
movements of the Marie Teresa G., the ship involved, were related by A. C. Huxtable, manager
of the Montreal Shipping Company, agents for the
owners of the ship.
Mr. Huxtable's narrative of the ship's movements
in this port gives the following picture:
Arrived on evening of January 15, unable to dock
as no heated shed available.
Docked first at noon on January 16 at pier 21.
Moved to pier two on morning of January 17,
with perishable cargo still aboard, as liner needed
pier 21 to disembark passengers.
Returned to pier 21 on evening of January 17,
when liner had departed.
Moved on morning of January 18 after ber perishable cargo had finally been removed to pier 36
to unload the remainder of ber cargo.
Mr. Huxtable said the cost of tugs for moving
the vessels from one berth to another was over
$600. Commenting, on the facilities offered ships
here be said there Is room for improvement. Mr.
Huxtable suggested that portable heaters could
be made available so that any shed along the waterfront could be heated if needed.

located at piers 21 and 24. Pier 21 is the passenger
and immigration berth and any passenger or mail
carrying ship has priority for accommodation over
cargo ships. Pier 24 is a grain loading berth and
almost continually used during winter months
by ships taking grain. The shed itself is used
mostly for storage of perishable cargoes waiting to
be shipped.
The majority of ships with perishable cargo go
to Saint John. Mr. Huxtable said if Halifax were
able to offer more facilities for the unloading of
such cargo, more traffic might come here.
The perishable part of the Marie Teresa G's
cargo consisted of 400 tons of oranges from

Mediterranean ports.
1,300 tons of general cargo. Three days to unload
400 tons of cargo plus over $600 extra expense
the spokesman said, hardly encouraged use of this
port.
Mr. Huxtable advised that having a heated shed
at a berth used by passenger vessels was superfluous, because during the busy season the pier
is almost continually made use of by ocean liners.

SENATE
The Danish freighter Lars Maersk, which is expected to arrive here Thursday from Boston, bas
about 700 tons of perishable cargo to discharge.
With several passenger ships also expected around
that time, similar difficulties are ahead for harbour
authorities.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the
session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bois,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops),
for an Address in reply thereto.
(Translation):
Hon. Jean-Marie Dessureauli: Honourable

in the mi]itary field. My ministers remain strongly

JANUARY 31, 1957
convinced of the need to maintain the North
Atlantic Treaty as the keystone of the defence of
the Western Nations.

Further on in the speech it is mentioned:
Recent events have confirmed my ministers'
belief in international problems through the United
Nations and of upholding by all practical and constructive means the principles of the United Nations
Charter. My ministers also believe, however, that
while making every effort to achieve these longterm goals, the Western nations must remain
strong and united in their defences and in their
diplomacy in order that aggressive action against
them will be prevented and international tension
can be lessened.

I am pleased with those references to
NATO, and I am in accord with the attitude
the Government is taking. Since I had the
privilege-thanks to our leader in this house
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald)-of being a member
of the Canadian delegation to the Interparliamentary Conference that took place in
Paris from November 18 to 23 last, I thought
it would be fitting at this time to give a
short report of that conference and to express to this chamber my thoughts and feelings about the importance of NATO. The Canadian delegation left Ottawa on
November 16 and returned on November 26
for the opening of the special sesssion of
Parliament. It was composed of 14 members
-12 members of the House of Commons and
two members of the Senate, Senator McLean
and myself. The delegation was headed by
Mr. Charles Cannon, a member of the House
of Commons and the Executive Chairman of
the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association, who represented our country on the
standing committee. Here I want to pay
special tribute to the able and distinguished
way in which Mr. Cannon discharged his
responsibilities as leader of the Canadian
delegation, and also to all the other members, who attended all the meetings regularly
and took an active part in them.
The United States delegation was composed of eight senators and nine members of
the House of Representatives. Mr. Wayne L.
Hays, Democratic congressman from Ohio,
was elected Chairman of the Conference of
NATO parliamentarians, to succeed Senator
Robertson, the Speaker of this chamber.
There was a strong delegation from Britain, 15 delegates in all, including the Right
Honourable Walter Elliott, the Right Honourable Clement Davies, the Right Honourable Sir Lionel Heald, the Right Honourable George Brown, the Right Honourable
Hugh Gaitskell and the Right Honourable
the Earl of Listowel.
France sent 33 delegates, including eight
senators.
The meetings were particularly important
this year because of the international situation, and the keynote was the importance
82719-8

of political consultation and economic co-operation. The best example of the importance
of political consultation among the nations
of NATO is the Suez incident. We all came
to the conclusion that it would have been
better if there had been political consultation
before action was taken, even if the consultation had not resulted in agreement.
An example of the importance of economic
co-operation is the Iceland situation. Iceland
is an important member of NATO because it
is used as an air base for NATO troops.
Russia offered to purchase one-third of Iceland's production of fish, on the condition
that American troops were to leave Iceland.
If there had been sufficient economic co-operation to prevent this situation arising it
would have had a very important effect from
a military and strategic point of view. Economic strength is a foundation for military
strength.
Political, economic, military and cultural
committees were organized by the conference,
and Canadians sat on all these committees.
Senator McLean was elected Chairman of
the Economic Committee and I was appointed
a member of the Political Committee.
The importance of NATO parliamentary
associations has been underlined, and I think
there should be placed on record some
reference to the report of the committee of
three-of which our distinguished Secretary
of State for External Affairs was a memberwhich was appointed by NATO. Paragraphs
58 and 59 of the committee's report, which
was issued recently, read as follows:
58-Among the best supporters of NATO and its
purposes are those members of Parliament who
have had a chance at first hand to see some of its
activities and to learn of its problems and to
exchange views with their colleagues from other
Parliaments. In particular the formation of national
parliamentary associations and the activities of
the conference of members of Parliament from
NATO countries have contributed to the development of public support for NATO and solidarity
among its members.
59-In order to maintain a close relationship of
parliamentarians with NATO the following arrangements are recommended:
(a) That the Secretary-General continue to place
the facilities of NATO headquarters at the disposal
of parliamentary conferences and give all possible
help with arrangements for their meetings.
(b) That invited representatives of member Governments and the Secretary-General and other
senior NATO civil and military officers attend
certain of these meetings. in this way the parliamentarians would be informed on the state of the
alliance and the problems before it and the value
of their discussions would be increased.

I submit, honourable senators, we have
there a very interesting and also well deserved commendation of NATO parliamentary
associations by the committee of three.
At this stage and in this respect it might
also be well to mention the visit during the
last few days here in Ottawa of three officials

SENATE
of the Conference of Members of Parliament
from NATO countries. They are Mr. Wayne
L. Hayes, President, Democratic Congressman
from Ohio; F. Berendsen of Germany, VicePresident, and Douglas Robinson of London,
England, Executive Secretary.
In closing, I wish to pay tribute to our
Speaker, the Honourable Senator Robertson,
former President of the Conference of NATO
Parliamentarians and of the Canadian NATO
Parliamentary Association, for his foresight,
tenacity and untiring work, without which
the 1955 Paris meeting of NATO parliamentarians would never have been held, and
probably the 1956 conference as well. At
the last meeting of the conference in Paris
a signal honour was conferred on him. The
conference named him Honorary President
for life, in recognition of the great work he
accomplished in bringing this organization
into being.
I wish also to make a special mention of
Lieutenant-Colonel R. Larose for his excellent and invaluable help as Secretary of the
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association.
He was in a large measure responsible for
the success of our delegation. He was untiring in his devotion and I can think of no
one who could replace him to advantagce.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pratt, the debate
was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
ALASKA-YUKON PIPELINES LTD.SECOND READING

Hon. Stanley S. McKeen moved the second
reading of Bill P-1, an Act to incorporate
Alaska-Yukon Pipelines Ltd.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this billHon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I don't know whether
that means support or opposition.
The purpose of this bill is a step toward
increasing the facilities for the distribution

asking for incorporation so that in conjunction with an Alaskan corporation it may
procecd with the construction of a pipe line
from Haines, Alaska, a sheltered port, to
Haines Junction in the Yukon. The pipe line
involves an estimated expenditure of about
$3,500,000, and it is expected that when it
gets into operation, prices to the majority
of consumers of petroleum products in the
Yukon Territory and Alaska will be conIt is estimated that a

connection can be made with the Canol System at Haines Junction. The Canol System
extends from Skagway, Alaska, through Carcross to Whitehorse, and then southwest to
Haines Junction and Fairbanks, Alaska, and
southeast from Carcross to Watson Lake.
Construction by Alaska-Yukon Refiners and
Distributors Limited of a refinery at Haines,
Alaska, is proposed to serve the Yukon
through the proposed pipe line to the Canol
System, if the latter is available.
The thoughts of most of us about the north,
as it is usually called, seem to date from
the time of the Gold Rush, when gold was
found in great quantities up there. But prior
explorations were made by the Vikings as
long ago as A.D. 1004. Centuries later, in
1576-78, Frobisher made three voyages in
search of the Northwest Pasage.
In that regard I would like to add something by way of a boost for the province from
which I come. Some years ago a vessel named
the St. Roch was built in our province for
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and on
a voyage from Vancouver to Halifax she
negotiated this Northwest Passage, which had
been long sought by navigators of many
nations. She was the first vessel in history
to go through the passage in both directions.
Not satisfied with that record, the skipper,
Larsen of the Royal Canadian
Captain
Mounted Police, circumnavigated with this
ship the northern half of the continent, going
from Alaska and down through the Panama
Canal. This is the only ship which has sailed
completely around North America. I might
add that she is to bc converted into a
museum piece and located at Vancouver.
Many years before the memorable voyage
of the St. Roch Mackenzie made the first
trip to the west coast, by land. In those
days travel was hard and difficult; and very
little was done about mapping the north
until the aeroplane came into its real place
in the community. Now there are in that
country more aeroplanes in proportion to the
population than anywhere else. The whole
area of the Yukon and Alaska has been
completely mapped geographically and geologically.
These remarks are by way of providing a
little background with respect to the territory
which this pipe line is to serve. The natural
resources consist of lead, zinc, copper, cobalt,
uranium, and asbestos, with the gold deposits
which brought the country into the forefront
of mining development. In fact, of the 33
minerals and other materials classed as
strategic by the United States Government,
only two, namely bauxite and industrial
diamonds, cannot be found in these territories.
Many Canadian companies are operating in
the area.

JANUARY 31, 1957

When pipe line bills were first introduced
-and there was quite a rash of them two
or three years ago-one of the main objections to them was that the lines would not
traverse Canadian territory, or, even if they
did, that the companies were being financed
by American principals. I might say that
the group which is starting this refinery at
Haines, Alaska, is a Canadian company
operating in the United States. It has no
shares for sale in the United States; all
are being sold in Canada, and the people
who constitute the company, management
and shareholders, are Canadians. So we have
here a reversal of the tendency of the oil
industry to be controlled in Canada by
citizens of the United States. The main line
of the company is in Canada. But it cannot
continue through Canadian territory to seaboard because of the Panhandle of Alaska.
A gentleman who was a member of this
chamber when I first came here-I refer to
Sir Allen Aylesworth-sat on the commission
which dealt with the boundary question
and refused to sign the treaty by which the
Panhandle was allotted to the United States.
As the line is drawn, hundreds of miles of
northern British Columbia are flanked by
a strip down the coast line, so that materials
consigned to the seaboard must go through
American territory. That is the position in
which this company is placed: to get directly
to seaboard they must use a port in Alaska.
There was some suggestion that the refinery
should have been built at White Horse, in
Canada; but refineries located at seaboard
have a great advantage over others, in that
their situation provides them with an open
field for the purchase of their raw products.
It was therefore decided that the refinery
should be at the seaboard, and it will be
established at Haines, Alaska. There will be
a pipe line from that place to carry the products to White Horse. The Alaskan business
is necessary in order to make the refinery
an economic unit, for the population of
Alaska is much greater than that of the
Yukon Territory. Anchorage, the largest city
in Alaska, has a population of approximately
110,000, of whom 75,000 are civilians and
35,000 army personnel. The largest city on
our side of the line is White Horse, with a
population of approximately 10,000. There
are other sizable cities in Alaska, one of
them being Fairbanks, and all northern cities
are expanding so rapidly that there is a real
need of fuel. The freight situation with
respect to Alaska is very difficult, and the
rates are very high. So this company is convinced that a great field exists for the
development of the petroleum industry, the
more so as there are no other refineries in
that area.
82719-8j

This bill, except in so far as the territory
involved is concerned, follows the same
pattern as other pipe line bills. There has
been much discussion about the undesirability of granting wide-open charters by which
promoters can build pipe lines anywhere
in the country. In Canada this pipe line is
restricted to the Yukon Territory and a
limited area of British Columbia; that is,
to the district covered by the company's
present plans, which it is in active process of
developing. As part of the scheme, and in
conjunction with the pipe line, marine terminals are being constructed. So this is not
a promotion of someone who wants to get
a charter and then peddle it around or try
to find someone else to do the development
work; it is an actual business proposition.
Those connected with it have gone into it
very carefully and are prepared to proceed
with it immediately.
If this bill receives second reading, I shall
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications, where further information, if required,
will be available. Honourable senators will
then be able to ask questions about the bill
from persons who know more about it than
I do. I received my information secondhandHon. Mr. Euler: You have done all right.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: -and
I am afraid I
could not answer all the questions that might
be asked about this legislation. However, if
honourable senators wish further information
today I will try to furnish it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is the pipe line being
extended as far east as Watson Lake?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The products from the
refinery will be distributed to Watson Lake.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What is the present
population of Watson Lake?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I am not sure, but I
know it is considerably less than that of
White Horse. I imagine it would be about
1,000.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes, I believe it is
around 1,000.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I take it that most of the
pipe line will be in Canada, although some of
it will be in United States territory. Has the
company obtained any rights with respect to
placing lines in United States territory or will
it later require such rights?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The Canadian company
is working in conjunction with an American
company which will have to build the American pipe line from the boundary into Haines,
and that line will connect with the one in

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It might be as well

we could discuss any or all of the items when
I have concluded.
The next is Vote No. 539, for the Immigration Branch of the Department of Citizenship

Inter-governmental Committee for European
Migration for the cost of transportation and
other assistance with respect to Hungarian
refugees coming to Canada, and to the provinces for the cost of caring for such refugees.
Honourable senators will recall that we approved in principle the suggestion that we
should welcome to Canada as many of these
valiant people as possible. The increase in
the number of immigrants from Hungary
necessitates this vote.
Vote No. 540, for the Department of
Finance, is a result of the increased allowance to municipalities for taxation on Government property. Honourable senators will
recall that in 1955 Parliament widened the
scope in which payments are made to municipalities in lieu of taxes on Governmentowned properties in municipalities. However,
in the appropriation bills passed last year
consideration was not given to the fact that
the Government rents a number of properties
on which it pays taxes, and it is now necessary to increase the grants to certain
municipalities by $2,024,000.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Would the honourable
Leader of the Government be good enough
to give us the breakdown of payments to
those municipalities, which according to the
bill are Winnipeg, St. James, Edmonton and
Vancouver?

university grants. Honourable senators will
recall that from 1950 onwards the federal
Government has given aid to universities by
way of grants at the rate of 50 cents per
capita of the total provincial population.
This vote will increase the grant to $1
per capita of the provincial population and
will put it on an annual basis. It will be
observed that the bill provides that the
amount appropriated under Vote 132 of
Appropriation Act No. 6 of last year is to
be applied to the purposes of this vote. The
total amount of this vote is $7,986,000.
The next item in the bill, Vote No. 542, for
the Department of National Health and
Welfare, would cover immigration medical

FEBRUARY 5, 1957
services in the amount of $225,000. This
sum is required in connection with the
services rendered to immigrants from
Hungary, and of course was not contemplated when the vote under this heading was
passed last year.
The increase is due
entirely to extended services to these
immigrants.
The next vote, honourable senators, No.
543, is for the Department of Transport,
railway and steamship services, and is in
connection with the construction of the autoferry which is to ply between Wood Islands,
Prince Edward Island, and Caribou, Nova
Scotia.
The increased appropriation is
required because the construction of the
ferry is going forward more rapidly than
was anticipated, and as a result payments
which were expected to be made next year
will be made this year.
The next item, No. 544, for the Department of Veterans Affairs, is in connection
with the construction of a hospital at Deer
Lodge, Winnipeg.
As in the case of the previous vote, construction is taking place at a faster rate than
was contemplated and as a result payments
which were expected to be made after the
end of the fiscal year are being made during
this fiscal year. The total vote is not being
increased.
The last vote, No. 545, covers a loan to
the United Nations Organization to help
finance the clearing of the Suez Canal.
Honourable senators recall that the canal
was blocked last year, and it is now necessary to have the canal cleared so that
shipping can pass through. That work is
being done with the approval of Canada and
other nations.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why doesn't Egypt pay
for it? It is her canal, and she blocked it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Canada agreed with
other nations that the canal should be cleared
as soon as possible. The question of who is
going to pay for it has not been determined.
Let me assure honourable senators of that.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Who is going to be able
to use the canal? There is no assurance
that Canadian ships will be allowed to pass
through the canal unless Nasser likes the
clothes the sailors are wearing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As far as our country
is concerned, and I think as far as Parliament
is concerned, we are anxious to do all in our
power to see that this canal will be open to
use by ships of all the nations of the world.
That is the stand which your Government
is taking and I know you will back up the
Government in that respect.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In the meantime the
canal has to be cleared. Of course, we could
discuss now with the nations of the world
all these questions as to who is going to pay
for the clearing, when it is to be done, who
is to have the use of it, and so on, but discussions of that nature might go on for
months. We feel that it is better, and I
think honourable senators will agree, to get
the canal cleared.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The canal is being cleared
at the present time at a rapid rate, according
to reports. Who is taking care of the payments now?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
says the canal is now being cleared, and he
is right. The expense has to be met, and it
is being met now by the United Nations.
But the United Nations has no funds with
which to pay for the clearing of this canal,
so it has asked a number of countries to
advance $10 million towards the cost of the
work. In the meantime an attempt is being
made to conclude arrangements which will
be satisfactory and will enable the ships of
all countries to use the canal. The cost of
clearing the canal will greatly exceed
$10 million; it is anticipated that between
$30 million and $40 million will be needed
for this purpose.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Would it not be possible
to spend that money on the St. Lawrence
Seaway, as the United Nations' contribution
to that great project?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The seaway is not
yet opened; and I would think that the
United States and Canada would prefer to
have our two countries build the canal. We
shall then invite all the world to send its
ships here to do business with us.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Has the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
any information as to what countries have
been appealed to by the United Nations to
contribute to this expenditure, and how much
they have provided? I think we are entitled
to know at least what amounts other countries
are paying.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am very pleased
to give the Senate such information as is
available, and I believe I have all there is.
As I stated, Canada has been asked to advance $1 million as a temporary loan. It is
not a contribution, and I do not think the
word "contribution" should be used in this
connection; it is a loan to enable the United
Nations to get on with the work of clearing
the canal. The United States has made a
loan of $5 million, and other nations which

I reiterate that it is a loan to the United
Nations to enable it to get on with the job of
clearance while we continue to work out
arrangements for the use of the canal by all
ships which desire to use it.

Hon. Mr. Reid: What about France?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Neither France nor
Great Britain has been asked to lend any
money at this time. It has not been deemed
advisable that they should be.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They have the equipment, and some of it is being used at the
canal. But even if the work had been assigned
to France and Great Britain, those countries,
I suppose, would have expected to be paid
for it. The United Nations organization, including our own delegates, thought that the
present arrangement was preferable, and
Canada approved it. May I say I think the
Senate is very happy to know that at this
crucial time the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll), who was
in his seat a few minutes ago, is one of
Canada's representatives at the United
Nations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am only sorry that
he is not now in the chamber so that we
could tell him how glad we are that he is
taking such an interest in the work of the
United Nations.

Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Is there any assurance
that, after the canal has been cleared of the
obstructions through the contributions made
by the United States, Canada and other
countries, it will not be blocked again?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I cannot give definite
assurance to that effect, but, in view of the
manner in which our representatives have
handled various crises which have arisen
in the last six months, one may express the
hope that they can be relied upon to do their
part in bringing the representatives of the
nations together in an effort to avoid the
recurrence of a disaster such as happened
last fall.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
there are certain items in this bill with which
I am sure the house can agree, but there are
others with which I do not think we should
agree at all. I propose to go over the items
and point out my objections where they exist.

FEBRUARY 5, 1957
The first vote is for "Freight assistance on
western feed grains". There has been a lot
of discussion about this item through the
years. What it amounts to is this. Farmers in
Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime provinces
receive assistance on transportation costs on
grain from western Canada to the east.
Western farmers feed and fatten their cattle
and then pay freight on that fat, so to speak,
when the cattle are shipped to be sold in
competition with eastern-bred cattle. Western
farmers have always raised an objection to
this. I never thought that granting freight
assistance on feed grains is the way to solve
the problem. I have always felt that western
farmers should get an allowance on freight
rates similar to the allowance eastern farmers get in freight assistance on feed grains.
This is not a really serious matter, but it is
always one of contention whenever the item
is brought up.
The next item in the schedule of the bill is
with respect to citizenship and immigration.
The vote provides financial assistance for
Hungarian refugees coming to Canada, and I
have no criticism at all to make of it. I am
in favour of what the Government has done.
Mistakes may have been made in the matter
of detail, as there always is in this kind of
thing, but by and large Canada has done a
service for humanity that will not soon be
forgotten throughout the world. What is
more important, it will not soon be forgotten
in our own hearts that we did the right thing
at the right time. I am wholeheartedly behind
the Government's scheme of bringing these
Hungarian refugees to Canada. It may even
be that we are rescuing some of them from
being murdered in their homeland.
The next item in the schedule comes under
the heading "Payments to municipalities". I
do not know how the various grants to the
municipalities in lieu of taxes on federal
properties are arrived at. I notice that the
total grant to the municipalities of Winnipeg,
St. James, Edmonton and Vancouver amount
to $197,000, and yet the municipality of Halifax alone is to get $150,000.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: We have more federal
property than the municipalities to which my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) has
referred.

public buildings.
Government properties
are of course, used for federal purposes,
but such Government departments as Income Tax, Customs, and Post Office are
and
an
businesses
revenue-producing
equitable tax should be paid on them in
every province. I was hoping that this
year the Appropriation Bill would place
these federal properties in that category.
The next item has to do with university
grants. Some of my friends at home say that
my speeches in the Senate are a little too flattering to the Government. They say that I do
not criticize the Government enough, that I
am not bitter enough, that I have lost all my
ability to make a high-powered attack like I
used to make in the Manitoba Legislature.
Perhaps I should practise in the basement of
the Parliament Buildings and really go after
the Government. Be that as it may, I feel
that the best thing this Government has done
since I entered Parliament is to authorize
payments for making grants to our Canadian
universities.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is a wonderful scheme.
I want to be pardoned for going into this
in detail but if there is one subject that I
know anything about it is this. The university of Manitoba was formed by four colleges-St. John's Anglican; Manitoba College,
Presbyterian; Wesley College, Methodist; and
St. Boniface College, Roman Catholic. These
four colleges are still part of the university.

as I know, the University of Manitoba is the

in which four denominations joined together

SENATE
Salaries of professors in our universities
are low. Increases in salaries for other occupations have given rise to the question
whether salaries of professors should not be
commensurate with the work they do. Men
and women in this chamber who are graduates of universities know that something more
is derived from study at a university than is
in the textbooks. Something is imparted
by the teacher that stays with the student
for the remainder of his life, and sometimes
it is stronger than the counselling of his
father and mother. I have always felt happy
to know that fine men and women are teaching in our university and colleges in Manitoba. We have now reached the stage where
it is difficult to pay our professors and
teachers salaries commensurate with the service the public receives. The university recently divided the sum of $400,000 among
students in residence at the various colleges;
the distribution was fair, and not a single
complaint was raised. I can speak with some
authority, because at one of the colleges, of
which I am chairman of the Board of Regents, we have seven or eight hundred students in seven- or eight-degree work.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How much did your
college receive?
Hon. Mr. Haig: $56,000 last year. That
money was largely devoted to increasing the
salaries of professors, and setting aside a sum
of money for annuities for superannuation.
That is a splendid way in which to use the
money.
Honourable senators, if these proposed
grants are made, I can promise you on behalf
of the college I have the honour to represent
-and I am sure I can speak of all other
colleges as well-that a large part of the
money, if not all of it, will be devoted to the
same purpose. The men and women on the
staffs of St. John's, St. Boniface, and others,
are highly capable and deserve support. On
behalf of the people of Manitoba and of western Canada in general I wish to thank the
Government and the people of Canada for
these grants, because they are making a real
contribution to the education of the young
men and women of our country.
I have read in the papers lately that there
are not so many boys taking up engineering
and the practical sciences here as in Russia.
But I have learned that in Russia those subjects make up the complete curriculum, and
that the humanities are not included.
Honourable senators, I heartily support this
vote to authorize grants to the universities,
and if the present Government goes out of
office, I hope the party which takes over will
develop this policy along the right line. I

am not a bit afraid that if grants are made in
Manitoba the federal Government will control
the province.
The honourable leader has told us that the
next item, Vote No. 542, for the Department
of National Health and Welfare, has to do
with the immigration of people from Hungary. I have no doubt that vote is necessary,
and I hope the money will be properly spent.
The next item, Vote No. 543, for the Transport Department, is a contribution toward the
Maritime provinces, and I presume that will
be well spent.
I want to mention a subject on which my
honourable friend from Bedford-Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) spoke the other day. In
Manitoba very few students come from other
provinces. I believe that also applies to Saskatchewan and Alberta, and presumably
British Columbia. The Maritime provinces,
especially Nova Scotia, are noted for their
educational institutions, and there is a tendency for students from other provinces to
attend their institutions of learning. No
recognition is given to such students by way
of increased grants, because the grants are
determined by the populations of the various
provinces. Formerly Saskatchewan, with a
population of one million, received $500,000;
it will now receive $1 million. Similarly,
British Columbia, with a population of a million and a half, formerly received $750,000;
it will now get $l1 million. That is decided
not on the number of university students but
according to population. Some consideration
ought to be given to the plea of my honourable friend from Bedford-Halifax, for the
people of Nova Scotia should be assured of
the same privileges in education as are the
rest of the people of Canada.
I come now to the last item in the schedule,
Vote No. 545, a loan to the United Nations
Organization to help finance the clearing of
the Suez Canal. Nasser of Egypt, and his
people, filled the canal with boats and other
obstructions, and now we are to spend our
money to clear the canal. When that is done
Nasser will defy us and tell us what he will
or will not do, and we will give in, as we
always have done. The United Nations did
not make Russia back up in Hungary, nor
did it make India back up in the area it
took over. Now a resolution has been passed
requiring Israel to make a withdrawal. Will
Israel give in, and if not will the United
Nations take action? I am not too sure about
that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am not sure that
Israel is going to give in, either.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not sure if anybody
has the nerve to take action.

FEBRUARY 5, 1957
If I were in charge in Israel I would not
give in, because the minute that was done
Egypt would start her attack all over again.
Look at the ratio of prisoners exchanged
between the two countries the other day.
The United States said that Britain and
France must get out of the Middle East. But
now the United States is going in there with
its men and money. and doing so without the
consent of anybody.
I believe that you do not make a friend
of any man by lending him money; indeed,
you are more likely to make an enemy of
him. I can understand the difficult position
in which our Government is placed. But I
believe it made a mistake in the first place;
it should have taken a firm stand at the
United Nations and insisted that if Britain
and France had to leave the Middle East,
then Nasser must go tob, and let the U.N.
take over the control and management of
the Suez Canal. But Canada did not take
that stand, and perhaps she is not to be
wholly blamed for not doing so. But my
point is that we cannot go on making deals
with a man like Nasser. We cannot rely on
a dictator, a man who has no intention whatever of carrying out his word or obeying the
law. I understand that our Secretary of
State for External Affairs has tried very hard
to do something constructive, but I think he
fails to realize that when we are dealing
with a crook we must treat him as such and
keep our powder dry. That is the situation
in the world today, and believe me we are
much worse off now than we were five years
ago. Russia has defied us, and so bas India;
indeed the whole of Asia has defied us. And
what progress has the United Nations made
toward a solution of the present world problems? Why should it allow a little nation of
7,000
people the
same voting power
as that of a big country like the United
States? Certainly a small nation has not as
much power in foreign affairs as has United
States, Russia, Britain or France.
I would say to the honourable Leader of
the Government that Canada can never expect to get back a nickel of this loan. The
only way we might get some return would
be by lending a further $2 million, and then
we might get our first million back. If you
complain to Nasser he will tell you you can
jump in the ocean, and you will have very
little choice. That is the situation Canada
is facing today.
We must realize that the United States is
a new nation in world affairs and does not
understand and appreciate world problems.
How can she do otherwise when her own
nation is divided within itself? How could
the Government of Canada establish a proper

foreign policy if the Prime Minister was a
Conservative and the majority of the members in the House of Commons were Liberals?
We would find that an impossible situation.
President Eisenhower can only get effective
support when the Senate of his country supports him.
Speaking for myself, I am thoroughly disgusted with the United Nations. Unless there
is from now on a change and a rebirth of
independence in that body, and unless men
and women whom we send there to represent us are willing to stand up and say what
they really think, I see no future for that
organization. Nobody in my part of Canada
thinks that Nasser can be trusted; nor does
anyone think that Mr. Dulles is the leader
of public opinion in the world today. Indeed,
the people in my part of the country someLimes wonder why he goes off on tangents as
he does. I quite admit that our own Mr.
Pearson tries harder than either Mr. Nasser
or Mr. Dulles to get near the truth. Yet, he
does not stand up and fight for it as we
sometimes think he should. Whether that is
because the Government here does not want
him to do so or because he himself does not
choose to do so, I cannot say.
I come back to my point that we will regret
making a loan in this amount to finance the
clearing of the Suez Canal. To my way of
thinking it will be lost money-we will never
get a cent of it back. Not only will we not
get it back, but we will make enemies by
lending it. It will go down the drain and
be lost forever.
Hon. J. W. deB. Farris: Honourable senators, I have listened with a great deal of
interest to the remarks of my honourable
friend the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig). I am not so much concerned with
what he had to say about Vote No. 541 for
university grants, but I am concerned about
and interested in what he had to say about
Vote 545, which would provide a loan of $1
million to the United Nations Organization,
a loan which he says will never be repaid.
To me, that is a small consideration.
This item reads:
Loan to the United Nations Organization to help
finance the clearing of the Suez Canal, $1 million.
What is meant by the "clearing of the Suez
Canal"? If it means only the raising up of
the sunken ships, enough is not being done.
To me the real issue is, how is the canal
to be cleared so that those nations who are
entitled to use it may use it?
I think Israel's position in the Middle East
is the vital issue today. She has taken her
stand, and I must say I fully support her in
that stand. In effect, Israel is saying: We

SENATE
were created by the United Nations, of which
we are one, and the peril that we have
suffered has come primarily from Egypt,
which in every sense of the word bas broken
ber obligations under the treaty. Israel has
taken her stand on the Gaza strip today for
only one purpose, namely, ber own safety.
She is asking only one thing from the United
Nations, that she also have the right to use
the canal. From my reading of the news in
the press, the United Nations has not said
anything that would ensure to Israel the
right to use the canal. Surely the words
we read in this bill, "to help finance the
clearing of the Suez Canal" in their wider
sense should mean the clearing of the canal
for the use of nations which are entitled
to use it. I cannot see any other sense to it.
Are we only going to dig up those few ships
sunk by Nasser? And who is behind Nasser?
Russia. To me the situation is indefensible.
I am not going to oppose this vote, but unless
the canal is cleared for use by all nations
which are entitled to use it, what is the good
of spending this money?
I cannot overlook the fact that Russia has
openly defied the United Nations, and India
has done the same. Indeed, country after
country bas defied the United Nations. The
only nations which today are being put under
threat of action by the United Nations are
those which are disposed to submit to the
pressure of the United Nations.
Sir Anthony Eden is now out of office.
In my opinion what Eden did was one of
the finest things that any statesman has ever
done, and I want to go on record as to that.
One Sunday, the first Sunday of the Suez
crisis, I listened while speech after speech
was made in the United Nations. I heard
Cabot Lodge speak there, and alongside
of him was the representative of Russia,
with the blood dripping from his hands
because of the things that were happening
in Hungary at that time.
Now, honourable senators, I am not offering any criticism of what the Honourable
Lester Pearson bas done. I think be is
one of the great statesmen of the world.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think he appreciated
the realities of the situation when he frankly
said how closely we were tied in to the
policy of the United States. I think that
was a very practical statement. Now I
have heard a lot of criticism of Dulles, who
I think has been very inappropriate in his
expressions, but in my opinion he has never
expressed anything that did not have the
backing of Eisenhower, and for my part I do
not think Eisenhower has played the game

with the British Empire. When we come to
this question "But what could Pearson do?"
we are faced with the grim possibilities as
regards Russia, and the question: If we do
not co-operate with the United States what
is going to happen to us? Those are practical realities that we have to accept and the
time has come when no party in Canada
should have any disagreernent with the
policy of the present Government in the
necessities that confront us.
I would like to know what assurance the
United Nations is going to give to Israel
which is being threatened with reprisals
in order to drive her out of Gaza and compel
ber to submit to the dictates of Nasser. I
cannot find any reason in God's earth why
Israel is being treated in the way it is.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon.

Arîhur

W.

Roebuck:

Honourable

senators, I want to make just one or two
remarks. I asked a question and I would
like to put myself right. I am going to vote
for this million dollars of course, because it
is necessary in the public interest of the
whole world that the canal be cleared and
as rapidly as possible-and particularly is
it in the interest of Great Britain that it be
cleared-but at the same time I would like
to know whether after we clear the canal
we are going to allow Mr. Nasser to run off
with the fees paid by the shipping of the
world for passage through the cleared canal
or if this million dollars of ours is going
to be repaid out of the fees. If it is not to
be repaid, then the proposal is a jug-handled
proposition, it is cockeyed. If we clear the
canal and then allow Nasser to take the
receipts while he defies the rest of the world,
and denies use of the canal to Israel, we
are just being stupid.
I want to say also that I agree with my
friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) with regard to Israel. Israel has
played a heroic hand and I hope she has the
courage to stay right where she is in the
Gaza strip and in the Aqaba area. She
should not withdraw until she gets the
guarantee she requires for her own safety
and ber own freedom of the seas.
Hon. John A. McDonald: Honourable senators, in view of what the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) has said
about Vote 538, I wish to repeat how deeply
appreciative the farmers, especially those of
eastern Canada, are for this freight assistance
that has been given by the Administration
over the years. With the present high cost of
farmers' supplies and the lowering prices they
receive for their finished products, this has

FEBRUARY 5, 1957
now become a must, and I am sure the honourable Leader of the Opposition would not
wish to vote against it; for even if he is
thinking only of the farmers of the Prairie
provinces he must admit that this assistance
is a means of providing a considerable market
for lower grade grains from the west.
Also, honourable senators, I would ask the
Leader of the Opposition if he would join
with some of us on this university grants
question in urging that the funds be distributed a little more fairly. Would he agree
to the suggestion that has been made by
some of us to the effect that these grants
should be paid on the basis of the number of
university students in a province rather than
on the basis of the overall population of that
province?
Hon. Mr. Haig: If, for example, a student
at Dalhousie University comes from Prince
Edward Island, part of the Prince Edward
Island grant should be paid to the province of Nova Scotia. Under the present plan,
if all the university students from Prince
Edward Island were studying at universities
in other provinces, Prince Edward Island
would still be paid its full grant, although it
would have no students to whom to pay it.
What, then, would Prince Edward Island do
with the money? I suppose it would keep it.
My thought is that the Government, instead
of paying the money to the province from
which the student comes, should pay it to
the province in which he is studying. I see
no objection to an arrangement of that nature.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
have a word or two to say before the debate
is closed.
On this first item of an additional $2 million required for freight assistance, I am
bound to say that I find myself in sympathy
with the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and differing somewhat
from the honourable senator from King's
(Hon. Mr. McDonald).
It is worth while to look for a moment at
the history of this business of freight assistance. It commenced during the war, and for
a very specific purpose. The need of producing food, particularly meats, acquired very
great importance at that time, and in order
to stimulate pig production, particularly in
Ontario and Quebec, this policy of assisting
in the payment of freight on feeding grains
-not from western Canada, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition stated, but
from Fort William east-was adopted. It
was never intended to be anything other
than a war measure. It had not happened
before. Prior to the adoption of this policy
for war purposes, the farmers of Quebec,

Nova Scotia and Ontario bought their grain
on the market and paid the freight on it.
The objection to the policy was stated by the
Leader of the Opposition. What is the basis
today of cattle prices in Canada? It is based
mainly on the Montreal and Toronto price;
and for the greater part of the time this is
true as regards hogs also. If the Government had a policy to pay the freight on the
finished product, on the processed carcasses
of cattle and hogs to eastern Canada from
Fort William, the western farmers would be
on a parity and a fair basis with eastern
Canada. But that is not the case. What
happens is that eastern farmers buy their
grain at a reduced price because of this
freight assistance, which by the way-make
no mistake about it-the western farmer
through his taxes helps to pay; and then this
same western farmer has to compete with
easterners in these livestock markets. I do
not think that is fair.
It may be within the memory of honourable
senators that when the war was over the
continuation of this policy was advocated
and sought to be justified on the ground that
we were still in the aftermath of war, that
conditions were upset and disorganized. But
the arrangement has continued; it has been
renewed year after year, and it appears now
to be a permanent policy. All I have to say
is that it is distinct discrimination against
the producers of livestock in the prairie
provinces. No successful argument can be
made against that statement. If it is intended
to equalize matters, freight should be paid
on slaughtered cattle and hogs shipped to
markets in eastern Canada. But were we
from the west to put up a proposition of
that kind it would not get very far. This
vote exemplifies one of the things that we
get embedded in our way of doing business;
and there is nothing so difficult to remove as
something which, having no terminable date,
becomes a vested right or a vested privilege.
The honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) stated that this year
the taxpayers have paid over $16 million in
freight assistance. I would respectfully suggest to him that the Government could cut its
budget of expenditures-and heaven knows
it is necessary-by removing this item from
next year's estimates and putting us back
where we in this country were before this
policy was adopted-let me repeat, purely
as a war measure.
I have not much else to say concerning
these items. There bas been some discussion
on the final vote in this bill, a loan of $1
million to help clear the Suez Canal. Personally my attitude is that the vote should

SENATE
pass. The honourable Leader of the Opposition may not be so far wide of the mark in
his statement that we may never recover
this sum. But even if that were so, I would
support this vote, and I would do it for this
reason: so long as the canal is blocked the
economies of western Europe-of Britain,
France, Italy and all our NATO allies there
-are
gravely endangered.

East. It may be possible to get the conscience
of the world to a point where Egypt can no
longer play fast and loose with its treaties but
will have to respect world opinion. If it does
not do so, then I say in all seriousness
that further measures would have to be
considered.

It may be asked, what guarantee have we
that after the canal is cleared the western
powers will be able to use it and so greatly
reduce the freight costs on their oil requirements. My answer would be, at the moment
we have no guarantee. I am not in sympathy
-and in that respect I share in considerable
measure the views of the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)with the whole manner in which this business
has been handled from the first. But that is
water over the dam. We have to deal with
the situation as it exists at present. The
United Nations, supported, I am bound to
say, by the United States, bas put too high a
premium on the sovereignty of Egypt. If that
policy holds, then unquestionably Egypt will
be able to say what ships shall go through
the canal and what ships shall not, and Egypt
will set the toll on the ships that use the
canal. In my judgment the only way in which
this loan can conceivably be repaid is by
putting a charge over a period of years on
the tonnage that goes through the canal once
it has been reopened. Has Egypt got a veto
power with respect to that? We do not know,
and that is why I say that I would support
this vote in the hope that conditions will
change and that in the end Egypt, if necessary, will be told what it has to do in reasonable respect for the other nations of the
world.

Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
when I entered the chamber this evening I
did not have the slightest intention of taking
part in this debate, but as the discussion has
touched upon perhaps the most vital problem
facing the world today I feel that I should
contribute a few remarks at this time.
I am one of the most friendly of people
towards Israel, but if I were an Israeli
looking upon that country's future I would
recommend that its Government take an
entirely different action from the one it is
contemplating at this moment.
Canadians must realize several things. One
is the fact that the Honourable Mr. Pearson,
our Secretary of State for External Affairs,
acting in large measure for the people of
Canada through the Canadian Government, is
trying to settle at the United Nations one of
the most momentous problerns confronting
the world.
le is attempting to have the
United Nations operate on a basis that it
should have been operating on for years. If
anything should go wrong wilh the question
now under discussion, then anything at all
might
happen
to the
United
Nations
Organization.
We must examine the whole matter relating to the Suez Canal and the dispute between
Israel and Egypt. We must not forget that
because of Egypt and other Arab countries,
Israel has been deprived of shipping facilities, particularly through the Suez Canal.
Vote 545 of the schedule authorizes a loan
to help finance the clearing of the Suez Canal
trom obstructions placed there during the
last four or five nenths. In itself this does
not affect the dispute between the so-called
Western world-including the NATO countries and Israel-and Egypt, over the right to
control trafie through the canal. The authorization of this loan would simply be a first step
on our part towards reopening the canal to
trafine, which is of vital importance to all
European countries, whether they are satellites of Soviet communism or belong to the
so-called Western group or NATO. I feel that
those who consider thermselves friends of
Israel should adopt the attitude that that
country should carry out the resolution passed
by the United Nations. Israel should abandon the Gaza Strip and withdraw its forces
rom that area.
The U.N. could not have

I am aware of the troubles that exist. Russia
is in the Near East today, getting ever more
firm a foothold established in that vital
area. I do not know what will come from
the recent action of the United States, but I
do say that if that country had taken such
action twelve months or even six months ago,
this whole problem would probably not have
arisen. I make that statement in full recognition of the fact that our policies must in large
measure march with those of the United
States. This is of supreme importance net
only to ourselves but to the whole civilized
world, for I fear this struggle will continue
for many years to come.
May I respectfully suggest that what we
need today are not recrininations over the
past. We may criticize and we may point
out, but it would be a good thing if we could
forget these past differences and again close
our ranks against this menace in the Near

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

FEBRUARY 5, 1957
passed a resolution demanding the Israelis
to withdraw from the Gaza Strip unless many
individual members of the U.N. intended to
protect Israel's position afterwards.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Have they said they
would?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I know what is in the
mind of the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), but I submit
that Israel should withdraw from the Gaza
Strip now, and it would then be the responsibility of the United Nations to back her up.
This course would also enhance Mr. Pearson's
efforts to establish the United Nations on a
proper basis. If Israel were to decide to
withdraw from the area concerned and rely
upon the United Nations to carry out that
which naturally is the conception of this
resolution, then Mr. Pearson, who without
question is the biggest man in the world
today, so far as the United Nations force
is concerned, would then be in a much
stronger position to deal with Egypt, Russia,
or any other country that is part of the United
Nations.
That is one reason why I am supporting the
vote. I sincerely hope that before very long
Israel will take that attitude, because there is
no other way to meet the situation. As it is,
the United Nations has to pay the cost of
getting traffic through the canal, largely on
account of Nasser's attitude, and at the same
time must take a certain definite action on
behalf of the world at large. The proposed
action by Israel would be the best way to
relieve the situation, and would put the
United Nations in a position where positive
and effective action could be taken.
Honourable senators, I hope this vote will
pass, and that our representative at the United
Nations in New York, the Honourable Mr.
Pearson, will be given added strength to deal
with the matter.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, it was not my intention to speak on
this subject, but since the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and also
the honourable member for Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) made certain remarks which are
not quite according to fact, I feel that I
must reply.
Probably I am more familiar with the
background of freight assistance than any
other member of this house, because back
in 1926, when I was President of the New
Brunswick Farmers' and Dairymen's Association, I appeared before the Board of Railway Commissioners-now the Board of Transport Commissioners-and appealed for relief
in relation to freight on feed grains to eastern Canada. I recall very distinctly at that
time-and the record will bear this state-

ment out-that feeds could be shipped from
western Canada to Halifax loaded on board
vessels, shipped to Germany, unloaded and
shipped back to Halifax for less money than
it cost to buy and ship grain from western
Canada to the eastern provinces. It was on
that basis that I made the presentation to the
board on behalf of the farmers of New Brunswick, and presentations continued to be made
until 1941, when the present policy was
adopted by the federal Government. The
approach was made on the basis that some
assistance must be given to the eastern farmer
in relation to the feeds required in the east,
because we could not grow them in sufficient
quantities. From the time I became Minister
of Agriculture, in 1935, on many occasions I
attended conferences at which ministers and
federal department officials met to discuss
these matters, and at first the proposal was
opposed by the western provinces, or at least
by some of them. However, after three or four
years of negotiation in an attempt by all
parties to understand the problems of both
east and west, an agreement was finally
reached by the eastern farmers and organized
agriculture in western Canada, that some
assistance should be given to the eastern
feeder because he was becoming, and now is,
one of the best markets for the western grain
farmer in the world today. It is true that the
amount proposed is a considerable sum, but
the western farmers are now shipping to the
eastern provinces, under this freight assistance policy, from 2t to 3m million tons of feed
per year, and that is why they support it.
I wish to point out to honourable senators that we in the east have always paid
a certain portion of the cost of freight. I think
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) indicated that the freight assistance applied only from the head of the
lakes to the east. That is quite true, but
the federal Government has never paid the
total cost of freight from the head of the
lakes to the Maritimes or to any other part
of eastern Canada. I happen to have the
figures. From 1941 to 1956 the farmers of
the Maritimes paid 25 cents freight on every
bag of feed shipped. Since July 3, 1956
there have been two increases in freight
rates; those have not been paid by the federal Government, but are being absorbed by
the feeders of eastern Canada. In the Moncton area, instead of paying 25 cents we are
now paying 34 cents; in Newfoundland they
are paying 41.4 cents, and in or near Halifax,
something like 38 cents is paid.
Honourable senators, I suggest that we
not only support this policy but that we ask
the federal Government to include the increase in freight rates over the basic rates

SENATE

of 1953, so that the Maritime farmers can
remain in the live stock business, and also
so that the Maritime provinces will continue
to be one of the best domestic markets. If
that is done the eastern provinces, instead
of buying 22 to 3, million tons of feed, may
be able to buy 5 million tons per year. If
freight assistance were abandoned the Maritime provinces would become an even more
depressed area than now.
I hope honourable senators will support
this vote. I also hope that through the efforts
of both eastern and western farmers the
Government will adopt freight assistance as
a permanent policy in Canada, rather than
as a year-to-year policy. I ask this support
and co-operation on behalf of all farmers in
Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes, and I
am confident that we will have the support
of the farmers in western Canada. Freight
assistance was not introduced merely as a
war measure, but because we applied for it
year after year from 1926 onward. The
Government recognized that in the provinces
of Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes there
was a balanced agriculture, because we grew
so many head of livestock, so much grain,

made so much butter and cheese, and raised
so many hogs, whereas often in western
Canada farming was mainly limited to grain.
In order to stabilize the industry in eastern
Canada, as well as the rest of Canada, a
policy was adopted for a two-fold purpose:
first, to assist the farmer in maintaining farm
operations and to plan for the future; and,
secondly, to provide a market for the coarse
grains of western Canada right here in
Canada.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
should like to direct a ouestion to the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). Is
it his intention that the bill should receive
third reading tonight? I ask that question
because I intend to make some rather extended remarks with respect to Vote No. 538,
freight assistance on western feed grains.
Even if I had not had in mind speaking on
this subject, the remarks made this evening
by some senators from the prairie provinces
would prompt me to raise my voice on behalf
of the province of British Columbia. There
is a story to be told about this freight rate
assistance question, and it is one about which
the Prairie provinces should not be proud.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think we should
hear what the senator from New Westminster has to say now.
Hon. Mr.
information,

structed to

Reid: I am waiting for certain
which I expect will arrive later
tomorrow morning. I am inplace this matter before the

Senate, and I may say it was not dealt with
in the other house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should like to have
this bill receive second reading at least
tonight.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If the bill receives second
reading tonight, perhaps I will have an
opportunity to speak on the motion for third
reading tomorrow.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
may I take a few moments to refer to the
item in this bill dealing with university
grants, a matter of particular interest to
my province.
The honourable senator for Kingston (Hon.
Mr. Davies) gave us a few days ago a most
interesting discourse on the great work the
universities in Canada are doing and the
need for extending university services
throughout wider areas of the country. The
call for specialized training which only
the higher seats of learning can supply is
becoming more demanding all the time.
With the view expressed by my honourable
friend from Kingston I entirely agree.
I think the arguments brought out here
this evening that university grants should
be made on the basis of so much per
student enrolled at universities would have
an adverse effect. I believe it would result
in a greater concentration being placed on
the bigger universities, and less opportunity
and financial help being extended to the
smaller and more widely spread institutions.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it would not have that
effect at all.
Hon. Mr. Prat: In my province of Newfoundland for many years we have had a
university college, but our university as
such was late in getting started. However,
it is now doing excellent work and has a very
practical structural program and a well
planned extension of its work in the
academic field.
Since the creation of the Memorial University of Newfoundland, as our institution is
known, a much larger number of our
students have taken advantage of university
training than ever before. We owe a good
deal to the fine service extended to us by
the universities in the Maritime provinces,
and also in Ontario and Quebec, to which
our students from Newfoundland have gone,
but the number of those who can take
advantage of training in these far-off
institutions is very limited. On the other
hand, the student of average means can
attend our university at home.
I believe the plan of setting up grants
based on the provincial population is a good

FEBRUARY 5, 1957
one. It will more fully equalize the opportunity for university training throughout
the country than would a plan based only on
the enrolment at existing universities.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable
senators, I have only a few remarks to make.
I was surprised and almost scandalized by
what the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) said about
the proposed subsidy on the shipment of
western feed grains to the eastern provinces.
I have now been in this house for some
years, and scarcely a session goes by that we
do not debate and pass legislation to subsidize
the western farmer. Sometimes we are told
the subsidy is required because his crop is
too large, and sometimes because it is too
small; we have even been asked to grant
a subsidy because the farmer was not able to
harvest his grain before the snow came. In
these various circumstances we have voted
millions of dollars to help the farmer in the
west.
Let me remind my honourable friends that
before the Second World War the eastern
provinces were quite able to grow and market
their own grain. With the outbreak of the
war the Government asked the eastern farmer
to concentrate less on the growing of grains
and more on the development of cattle and
the production of butter, cheese and milk. By
way of assistance to the eastern farmer the
Government agreed to pay part of the freight
on feed grains from western Canada. After
the war the farmers in eastern Canada were
prepared to return to their former production
of grains for feed, but the Government asked
them to continue to concentrate on the production of milk and other dairy products.
And so today more than 60 per cent of the
feed grain from western Canada is used to
maintain the dairy industry in the east and
thus to provide milk, butter and cheese for
the west.
The honourable senator from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Taylor) explained very clearly a
few moments ago the effect of freight ratesand they seem to increase every month-as
they apply to agriculture. Freight rates are
now so high that it is cheaper to ship grain
from Fort William to Germany and certain
other places in the world and back to Canada,
than it is to ship it from Fort William to
Quebec city or Halifax.
I have always believed that the best market
for the product of the western farmer is provided by the eastern farmer. Now that we
have a committee to study land use in Canada
we can of course say to the farmers in the
east that their land is suitable for the growing of grain, as it was in the past. Then what

will the western farmer do with his feed
grain? Certainly, he cannot feed it all. I
believe that the proposal to give assistance in
the payment of freight cost on western feed
grains is the best policy we can adopt.
On many occasions in the past when our
western friends were subsidized because of
a good crop or for a poor crop, we never
complained; now we hope that they will
support us in the proposed assistance for
eastern farmers.
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh: Honourable
senators, I am pleased to be back in Ottawa
in time to take part in this debate.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: First, I should like
to congratulate our new senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) upon what he has
said tonight about the subsidizing of feed
grains. I agree with every word he said.
I am not speaking now as a city dweller,
but as a bona fide farmer, as one who still
grows grain, a considerable part of which is
fed to cattle and hogs, and as one whose sons
and neighbours carry on a similar farming
operation. We in Alberta are not particularly
alarmed by what this bill proposes to do by
way of freight assistance on western feed
grains. We realize the best market available
for any of our products is the domestic
market, and the eastern farmer is the best
domestic market for our feed grains.
We farmers of the west, it is true, have
received some apparent subsidies from time
to time, and we have been pleased to have
our fellows from the Maritimes back us up.
Indeed, we are grateful to them for their
support in that respect, and I think we should
show equal generosity toward them.
Therefore, I must say I am thoroughly in
favour of what the bill proposes to do. I do
not begrudge the few dollars that are to be
put up to maintain the domestic market we
have had for western grain. About a year
ago Parliament voted some $31 million to
pay for the storage of surplus wheat in
Canada. That amount went entirely to the
west. Nevertheless, our friends from the
Maritimes voted in favour of it, and helped
to pay for it, and I think we should act
similarly with respect to this item.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon.

Mr. Macdonald:

Honourable

sen-

ators,-

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, if the Leader of the Government
speaks now he will close the debate on second
reading of this bill.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My remarks at this
stage will be relatively brief. However, I
think I should make some reference to statements made about the proposed loan of
$1 million to the United Nations Organization
to help finance the clearing of the Suez Canal.
I quite agree with the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that
it is a relatively small sum of money to spend
if in the end we succeed in getting the canal
cleared and to make it available to the ships
of all nations of the world. Whether the
amount is paid back or not, it is a small
consideration. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), I believe the money
will be paid back. In any event, I am confident that if the cost of clearing the canal
is charged against the United Nations Organization we will be given credit for this
million dollars against any other payments
we may have to make to it. The first step
in our objective is to clear the canal, and
while we are doing that we are working
toward the end that it will be made available
to the ships of the world.
Honourable senators, I was quite disturbed
over certain remarks that were made tonight
about the United States. I feel very keenly
that Canada must stand together with the
United States and the other free countries of
the world in friendship.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is our only hope
of salvation. We cannot fight with our
friends.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We would like them to
stand with us.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We hope they will
stand with us, and we must stand with them.
We must stand together. Over the years the
United States bas been one of our true friends.
She was our ally in two world wars.
Hon. Mr. Farris: She came in pretty late.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: She may have come in
pretty late, but she came in in time to be a
vital aid ta us. I do not think we should
disparage what the United States did in either
of the great wars. We fought together and
we were successful together. Let us stand
together now.
President Eisenhower has been a friend to
Canada and to the United Kingdom during
all the years be has been in power. True, he
did not agree with the action of the United
Kingdom and France last November, but
friends can disagree. Because he did not
approve of what those countries did he cannot be accused of want of friendship toward
them. Some may say that he did not do what
they would have liked him to do, but I am

confident that be did what he did in friendship to the United Kingdom and to France.
I believe he did what he thought he should
do to help the United Kingdom and France
and to maintain peace in the world. But,
honourable senators, if you disagree with
what he did then, and you think he should
have done something different, do not think
that he is unfriendly to our country. At least
let us not do anything that will disturb the
great friendship that binds us together.
Some remarks made here tonight were not
complimentary to the United Nations Organization. Honourable senators, I think even
the keenest supporters of the United Nations
would admit that it is not perfect, but in my
opinion it still is the organization which provides the greatest hope for peace in the
world. No other organization has yet been
proposed or set up to take its place. While
we have the Honourable Mr. Pearson and
his associates at the United Nations doing
everything in their power to maintain peace
in the world, let us do our part to support
the organization and to maintain friendship
with peaceful nations.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I would like to ask the
honourable Leader a question. To get back
to the subject of freight assistance on western
feed grains, can he supply us with the total
amount of freight assistance that has been
given over the years? It runs, in my opinion,
to something like $200 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will endeavour to
get the information for the honourable
senator.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understand the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) wishes to make some
remarks on the subject of feed grains,
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: This bill
will be placed on the Order Paper for third
reading at the next sitting.

SENATE STATIONERY
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I would like to ask what amount of
office stationery, supplies and equipment has
been supplied by the Stationery Branch

during each one of the last ten years (a) to
the three offices of the Speaker of the Senate,
the Leader of the Government in the Senate
and the Leader of the Opposition in the
Senate, collectively; (b) to each one of the
branches of the Senate, and (c) to the other
members of the Senate, collectively?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will endeavour to
get the information for the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot). It may be very difficult to ascertain
the amount of stationery used by the Leader
of the Government. I cannot vouch for the
accuracy of the information to be tabled.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I do not ask for the
information separately, but collectively, for
the three offices together-the office of the

Speaker, the office of the honourable Leader
of the Government, and the office of the
honourable Leader of the Opposition, collectively, separating them from the stationery,
supplies and equipment used by the other
members of the Senate; and also I want the
information as to each one of the branches.
I wish to know where the money goes. I
should like the Senate to have some sense
of proportion and reality in matters like
these, especially after big amounts such as
the ones specified in Bill 25 have been voted

on, and the bill has had second reading, in
two hours. We are ready to spend a million
dollars for the clearance of the Suez canal,
but when it comes to the expenditure of the
small amount of $7,000 on supplies for the
use of the Senate, including all its branches,
there is great kicking about it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does the inquiry
include the amount for stationery used by

the Leader of the Government?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No. I want the honourable gentleman to understand my question.
It is divided into three parts. First, I should
like to know what amount has been spent

for

the

three

offices

collectively,-the

Speaker's office, the office of the honourable

Leader of the Government and the office of
the honourable Leader of the Opposition. I
exclude these from the particulars of what
is being supplied to us, the other members
of the Senate.

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: The honourable senator's inquiry will be placed on the
Order Paper.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I shall be satisfied. I
do not want an immediate answer.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: There cannot
be a debate on an inquiry.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No, sir. I am explaining
my question.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Perhaps I should
explain to the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye that I did not understand
his question. I now realize that it is a notice
of inquiry and that it will appear on the
Order Paper.
QUEBEC SAVINGS BANKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. C. G. Power moved the second reading
of Bill Q-1, an Act to amend the Quebec
Savings Banks Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this legislation is intended to cover the operations of
two savings banks located in the province of
Quebec. They are the Montreal City and
District Savings Bank, and La Banque
d'Economie de Quebec. These are banks of
long standing and of great repute, known for
their safe, sane and almost ultra-conservative
banking policies. They are savings banks
and do not carry on a commercial business.
They were originally founded, I might almost
say, as semi-benevolent institutions with the
encouragement of Church and State for the
purpose of encouraging thrift in the lower
income bracket of the population.
These banks have been very successful in
their operations. They must compete in certain respects for business with so-called
chartered banks, insurance companies and,
in some instances, with institutions known as
Caisses Populaires. They are, however, restricted in their operations by the Quebec
Savings Banks Act in that they can only
make certain types of investments.
It is
proposed by certain amendments to clarify
some of the powers which have been con-

ferred upon them.
In passing I should like to say that I
learned only today that although there is a
wide distinction made between the so-called
chartered banks and these two savings banks,
the only really chartered banks in Canada

are these two savings banks. By a strange
anomaly of nomenclature they are known as
savings banks, whereas the non-chartered

FEBRUARY 5, 1957
banks, which carry on their operations under
the provisions of the Bank Act, are known
by definition in the statute as chartered
banks.
The first amendment repeals subsection 14
of section 47 of the act. The new subsection
simply repeats what is in the existing statute,
with the added provision that a copy of the
statement and report submitted at the annual
general meeting shall be forwarded to the
minister within four weeks after the meeting.
Section 2 of the bill makes a distinction
between the deposits made with these two
savings banks in foreign currency, and the
deposits made in Canadian currency. With
respect to foreign currency it is provided that
the banks shall maintain adequate reserves
against liabilities payable in foreign currency.
My information is that this really means that
the banks must maintain a reserve equal to
100 per cent of the deposits in foreign currencies. That is to say, whenever any foreign
currency is deposited with them, the practice
will be for these banks either to purchase
such currency or to make deposits in foreign
banks.
With respect to the cash reserve to meet
deposits in Canadian currency, the banks are
obligated under this section 2, which is an
amendment to section 55 of the act, to have
these reserves in the form of notes of or
deposits with the Bank of Canada or of
deposits with a chartered bank in Canadian
currency. This species of security is really
notes of cash, and the banks must maintain a
reserve of not less than 5 per cent of such of
their deposit liabilities as are payable in
Canadian currency.
In addition to this 5 per cent they must
have a reserve equal to at least 15 per cent
of these deposit liabilities in the form of notes
of or deposits with the Bank of Canada or
of deposits with a chartered bank in Canadian currency, or securities of or guaranteed
by the Government of Canada or of a
province.
The only thing new in section 2 is the
distinction made between deposits in foreign
currencies and deposits in Canadian currency.
Section 3 of the bill repeals section 59 of
the act. It deals with investments these
banks may make and it provides-and this is
new-that they shall make investments in
securities which are defined in the act as
being bonds or debentures in a broad and
general way, and preferred shares of a corporation, the common shares of which are
listed on a recognized stock exchange, or
more than one-half the common shares of
which are owned by a corporation incorporated in Canada whose common shares are
in turn listed on a recognized stock exchange.
In other words, they could buy bonds issued

by a company more than half of whose common shares are owned by a corporation incorporated in Canada and whose stock is
listed in a recognized stock exchange.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does that include common shares? It says "securities".
Hon. Mr. Power: They can buy bonds or
preferred shares in those corporations whose
common shares are listed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But it says they can
buy the securities of these companies, and
common shares are securities.
Hon. Mr. Power: They cannot buy the
common shares. Under this section they cannot invest in the common shares of one of
these companies, and they can only invest in
any of the other securities of a company if
its common shares are listed on the stock
exchange or more than one-half of its common shares are owned by a corporation incorporated in Canada. There are other provisions, which are already in the act, to the
effect that a company whose securities may
be invested in must have paid in cash in each
of the last five years, out of income earned, a
dividend on all its outstanding capital stock,
or interest in full upon all its outstanding
securities, one or the other. It is further
provided that the banks may not invest in
such securities more than 15 per cent of their
deposit liabilities.
Section 4 of the bill deals with another
portion of the assets of the bank, if I may
put it that way, although perhaps inaccurately, for the paid up capital and the rest
account of the bank properly belong to the
shareholders, so to speak, although in the long
run the banks are responsible for deposits.
Under this section, which is entirely new, it
is proposed to give to the banks the right to
invest in securities and shares of Canadian
corporations, provided the aggregate book
value of the investments of the bank under
this section, together with the market value
of the proposed investment, does not exceed
50 per cent of the paid up capital and rest
account of the banks.
Section 5 amends the present provision
that a loan shall not be made to any individual in excess of $2,000. I am advised that
the experience in loaning has been very good,
and it is now proposed to permit the banks
to make loans to indiivduals to an amount not
exceeding $5,000.
Section 6, which is perhaps a little more
complicated, amends the present section
which permits the banks to loan money on
mortgage. The loans will be restricted to
the lesser of 60 per cent of the value of the
real or immovable property, or $100,000. The
properties on which these loans are made
must be improved real or immovable resi-

SENATE
dential property in Canada.
The words
"improved real or immovable residential
property" are defined in section 6 as follows:
In this section "improved real or immovable
residential property" means land or immovable
property upon which there is situate a building
that constitutes a permanent improvement to the
property or on which there is such a building
in the process of construction, if at least one-half
of the floor space of the building is used, or in
the case of a building in the process of construction,
is to be used, for residential purposes.

So there is a considerable restriction on the
power of the bank to loan money on mortgages. Under the same section the banks
are authorized to lend up to 40 per cent of
their deposit liabilities on these types of
mortgages, including those under the National
Housing Act.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable member a question? If all these amendments are accepted, will the savings banks
not become commercial banks?
Hon. Mr. Power: Indeed not. Unlike the
chartered banks, they are specifically prohibited from lending money on warehouse
receipts, goods, and merchandise, or from
carrying on an ordinary commercial business.
Under a new subsection, the banks will
no longer be restricted to a rate of interest
of 6 per cent on all mortgage loans.
Section 7 gives some indication, perhaps,
of the origins of these two banks, which have
funds accumulated for the benefit of the poor
in the communities in which they are established. I am not too sure what becomes of
this fund in Montreal, but in Quebec City, La
Banque d'Economie, formerly known as La
Caisse d'Economie de Notre-Dame de Québec,
has its poor fund from which every year it
distributes certain sums of money to the
I think in
St. Vincent de Paul Society.
Montreal there is a similar custom, because
I note that the Montreal City and District
Savings Bank has an amount of $180,000 set
aside. The securities invested on behalf of

these poor funds were formerly invested with
the approval of the Treasury Board, but that
section seems to have been dropped, and the
banks are allowed discretion as to the manner
in which these moneys are to be invested.

The final section, which governs reports
to the minister, is routine.

Honourable senators, if second reading is
given to this bill I shall move that it be sent
to the Banking and Commerce Committee,
where officers of the department who are
familiar with the operations of these banks
will be called to give all information required.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: May I ask the honourable senator if the bill has been approved as
to form, and if so by whom?

Hon. Mr. Power: This is a Government bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Has it been approved
by the department?
Hon. Mr. Power: I take it that the department approves of it. At any rate, departmental officials and inspectors of banks will
be available to give information if the bill
goes to committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

and tons, because after one looks over the
process, beginning at the point where the
wheat enters the elevator, one easily sees
how a mix-up can occur in the many changes
made from bushels to pounds. In that regard
I commend to honourable senators a statement put out by the Searle Grain Company
only the other day, which throws a clear
light on this matter. The changes from
pounds to bushels take place hour after hour
and it would appear desirable to have some
common denominator of quantities of grain,
but perhaps that is asking too much.
The following table-which I will give in
round figures-shows the benefits received
by the various provinces from the $261 million
expended by the federal Government from
1941 to 1956:
Ontario ...................
$ 81,000,000

To complete the picture, I may say the
average assistance per province per ton is
as follows:
Ontario ................................
$ 4.92

6.52
New Brunswick .......................
9.17
Nova Scotia ............................

I thought these figures would be interesting
to honourable senators.
Before I forget it, I want to compliment
the honourable senator from Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Stambaugh), a wheat-grower from the
wheat-growing province of Alberta, upon
having risen to support the provision of
this assistance. I would also like to assure

of freight rates. In any event, on July 1,
1951, tariff 145 was abolished.
On November 18, 1941, the freight assistance policy was instituted and continued
during the war years. As a matter of fact,
under this policy all freight on feed grain
and millfeeds from Calgary or Edmonton to
British Columbia points was paid until
January 31, 1955.

On February 1, 1955, this

assistance was reduced to 290 per 100 pounds
on a basis of Calgary to Vancouver. The
rates I have given are from Calgary only,
but the average difference between export
and domestic rates on feed wheat from Alberta to Vancouver is 460 per 100 pounds.
In other words, all grain leaving the Prairies
and being shipped abroad for export is carried at the rate of 200 per 100 pounds, and
yet we in British Columbia are now being
charged 600 per 100 pounds. Of course,
against that is the assistance being given to
us by the Government.
One thing that leads many provincial
representatives astray when they appear
before the Board of Transport Commissioners
is the misinterpretation of certain sections of
the Railway Act. Here is a perfect illustration of how plain words can be misleading
to ordinary citizens from all over Canada
who read the act. They do not find out what
many sections of the legislation mean until
they appear before the board.
Incidentally, I am one of those who hold
the view that the majority of the members
of the board favour the case of the railways
rather than that of the public. I recall when
we thought that the establishment of a Public
Utilities Commission in British Columbia
would result in justice being carried out and
that the average citizen would have a means
of redress. But such was not the case, according to the decisions that have been made
there in the past number of years in favour
of the companies. I know it will raise the
ruffles of some, but I think this accusation
also applies to the Board of Transport Commissioners, which is no longer protecting the
public. Let me read section 317(1) of the Railway Act and see what honourable senators
think about it.
All tolls shall always under substantially similar
circumstances and conditions, in respect of all
traffic of the same description, and carried in or
upon the like kind of cars or conveyances, passing
over the same line or route, be charged equally
to all persons and at the same rate, whether by
weight, mileage or otherwise.

Then section 336(1), which deals
national freight rates policy reads:

with

It is hereby declared to be the national freight
rates policy that, subject to the exceptions specifled
in subsection (4), every railway company shall, so
far as is reasonably possible, in respect of all
freight traffic of the same description, and carried

on or upon the like kind of cars or conveyances,
passing over all lines or routes of the company in
Canada, charge tolls to all persons at the same rate,
whether by weight, mileage or otherwise.

I have with me here in the chamber two
samples of wheat. I cannot pass them around,
but I would like to show honourable members
from the Prairie provinces what we in British
Columbia are getting for $3 per 100 pounds
for No. 1 and No. 6 grade wheat. These
samples come from Alberta wheat pools and
are stamped and duly authenticated.
Close to where I live there is an organization known as the Surrey Co-Operative Association, comprised of some 4,000 members,
which runs a $4 million business in feed
grain. It buys the grain wherever it can
get it at the cheapest price, and most of it
comes from the Prairie provinces. I could
never understand why in a train load of
wheat or feed grain the price charged is 200
per 100 pounds on the contents of the first
car, and 600 per 100 pounds on the contents
of the car behind. It is simply a preposterous
state of affairs.
Let me illustrate what often happens. Sometimes half the contents of a loaded car, which
is transporting wheat for export at a rate
of 200 per 100 pounds, is sold back to a
co-operative which is called upon to pay 60¢
per 100 pounds in freight charges. Not only
are the contents of two cars being transported
at different freight charges, but half the
grain in one car may be earmarked for
domestic purposes and the other half for
export.
I appeared before the Board of Transport
Commissioners in 1933-I admit that was
a bad year-but I was able to place before
the board certain documents showing that
in British Columbia at that time we could
purchase Alberta wheat in China and bring
it all the way from there to the Fraser Valley
at a far cheaper rate than was charged for
bringing the same product from Calgary or
Edmonton. What an utterly preposterous state
of affairs! We have never been able to get
redress, and we are still paying through the

nose.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
talked about buying feed grain to fatten
cattle and then selling the animals in competition with eastern-bred cattle. Well, we
have just the same kind of a complaint.
We find that on account of costlier feed grain
in British Columbia, our cattle are sent to
Alberta where they are fattened and finally
slaughtered and sent back to Vancouver to
be sold as beef. We could get our own beef
much cheaper if we could ship the cattle
when finished directly to Vancouver.
This is not a one-sided affair; and I am
referring to authentic cases. It is no wonder

FEBRUART 6, 1957
people get riled when they appear before the
Board of Transport Commissioners and find
that the apparently simple sections of the
Railway Act to which I have referred are
not interpreted at all as they think they
should be. The board's answer is always
the same: that so many years ago a certain
ruling was made and there is no way to get
around it. It is like a judge saying he has
made a decision on a certain case and that
his decision will have to stand for all time
to come with respect to other cases. I thought
I had a good case when I appeared before the
board but in the end I was sorry that I
had ever gone before it. I just wasted my
time presenting the case as I did.
Honourable senators, if we do not look
after the welfare of our farm population
Canada could suffer serious consequences. I
think it was the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) who recently
spoke about men leaving their farms to
work elsewhere. I know that in my own
province many farmhands have left farms
to take up jobs where they work only five
days a week, enjoying two coffee breaks
each day and getting two or three weeks'
holidays with pay a year. They say, "Why
should we stay on the farm, where we have
to work six or seven days a week at long
hours with hardly any holidays?" I know
of a farmer in my. own district who is
paying a man $250 a month and all found
to have his cows milked. If it were suggested
that the price of beer or whisky should be
raised there would never be a word of objection, but try to raise the price of milk and
listen to the cries of protest. Yet milk is one
of the basic healthful foods of life.
Honourable senators, farmers now cannot
pay low wages and get men to work. I ask
that the Government be serious about these
things; I know something can be done about
them, and therefore I make no apology in
speaking on behalf of the people engaged
in farming in and around my province.
I do not think I have any more to say
at
present. I have warned honourable senators
that later on I shall speak on the Wheat
Board. I hope the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable member
iram Churchill (Han. Mr. Crerar) will
be
present when I speak an that sub ject, and I
shal deal with it in as speedy a manner
as
possible. There may be some argumentsit is time that we had a really good argument
in the Senate-but I shall try to keep to the
facts, and certainly shall not attempt to stir
up animosity.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
82
719-9j

Hon. Mr. Reid: Bef ore resuming my seat, ýI
wish to express my appreciation for the hearing I have been accorded this afternoon.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
had not intended to speak on this bill, but I
want to make a few remarks in connection
with the $1 million loan to the United Nations
to help in the clearing of the Suez Canal. I
find it very difficult to understand people who
support the policy of the Government and
the action of the Secretary of State for
External Affairs, the Honourable Mr. Pearson,
with regard to the decision that Israel should
quit a certain part of the Gaza Strip. The
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) favours, and even demands, that Israel's armed forces stay there
and hold out. The honourable senator from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) hoped they
would withdraw.
Honourable senators, my chief purpose in
rising is to make a few remarks in connection
with freight assistance on western feed grains
for the eastern provinces.
The honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) mentioned that cattle from the Prairies
are shipped to distant markets. That is quite
logical, because the western farmer has an
abundance of grain for feeding cattle. I
know one farmer who shipped $9 million
worth of cattle into the United States, and
was able to compete well in the market down
there. There is nothing impossible or unnatural about cattle being shipped from the
hills in British Columbia, where it is difficult
to grow grain, to the Prairies, where feed is
abundant; in fact, it is far more practicable
to ship the cattle, providing water is available, than to ship the grain to the cattle. At
the present time there is on the Prairies an
abundance of low-grade grain that is difficult
to market. During the past several years we
have had heavy crops, but there have been
years when hay was shipped from Montreal
to the west at $60 freight per ton. We would
have done better to shoot the cattle than to
pay the freight on the feed. At that time
every bushel of grain grown in western
Canada was needed there, and that time may
come again.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Are you speaking of
feed grain?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Feed grain, yes. Now,
with regard to the subsidy, who is getting
it? Let us be perfectly fair about that. In
western Canada we had a ceiling of $1.20 a
bushel on the price of wheat when our
neighbours to the south were getting $3.
Canadian millers were allowed to buy at a
special price of 75 cents a bushel when
western farmers should have received $2.75.
It bas been estimated by men who know

SENATE

that that arrangement alone resulted in a
total donation of $700 million or $800 million
by the western farmers to support the economy of Canada.
It will be remembered that in 1939 there
was a shortage of cattle in the United States.
I am sure the honourable senator from Bruce
(Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) will recall that very
well, because the ranchers from all over
Alberta were wiring the Government and
holding meetings about it. Although cattle
similar to those bringing 30 cents a pound
live weight in the United States were selling
at only 9 cents a pound in western Alberta,
we were prohibited from sending one animal
across the line. We were in effect, subsidizing the rest of Canada to keep the cost of
living down. There was nothing in the nature
of equality about that.
As far as the Maritimes are concerned, it
has been argued by two senators in this
chamber that western grain is going to
British Columbia to feed cattle there. We
are thus deprived of that domestic market
for our cattle. The east, which is a natural
market for our cattle, is now subsidized
with respect to western feed grain. I do
not oppose the subsidy to feeders in eastern
Canada, because I realize that in the west we
usually have an abundance of grain, except
in those seasons when we are hit by rust.
At the present time we have large stocks of
barley and oats, which are not selling readily
on the market.
Honourable senators, self help is one of the
greatest things in the world. I will suggest
to the honourable senators from the Maritimes
a method by which they can get western grain
much cheaper than by freight assistance.
They can get it by boat through Churchill,
in northern Manitoba, and it will cost them
much less than to ship by train with the
assisted freight rate. There is any amount
of feed grain within four or five hundred
miles of the bay, and I may say there are
no toll charges at Churchill.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: The possibility of
bringing grain through Churchill has already
been studied, but there have been no freight
facilities to take it there.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It could be taken by
freight to Churchill. The last 200 miles of
rail down to Churchill Bay are perhaps the
most easily maintained railroad in any part
of the country. It is a gradual downward
slope, and as the track is laid on either rock
or permafrost formation a double load can be
easily hauled down that stretch.
I have made these remarks, honourable
senators, to give you some idea of what

western Canada has contributed to the welfare of the country generally.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Would my honourable friend permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Does my friend
realize that the farmers in the eastern provinces are now paying from 25 cents to 35
cents per cwt. more for their feed grain
than the price on the world market? In this
way, the eastern farmers are paying a subsidy
to the west.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, that is not my
fault. I would do anything I could to help
you.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-

DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday,
January 31, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's Speech at the opening

FEBRUARY 6, 1957
of the session and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Bois, seconded by Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops), for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Calveri C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
I would like to make reference to some of the
matters dealt with in the Speech from the
Throne, but first I would join with our colleagues who have spoken to this motion to
compliment the mover and seconder on the
practical and helpful manner in which they
opened this debate. Unfortunately I was unable to be present when those gentlemen
spoke, but I read their speeches with great
interest. I wish also to extend a word of
welcome to the honourable senators who have
recently joined our ranks.
I am sure it will meet with general approval
of all honourable senators if I expressalthough I am a few days late in doing so
-a word of congratulations and hearty birthday greetings to our Prime Minister, the
Right Honourable Mr. St. Laurent, and wish
him many more years of family happiness
and useful public service.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Prati: As the Speech from the
Throne indicates, the subjects we have before
us this session are in two major categories,
those that have to do with international
affairs and those of chiefly local significance.
This distinction is, of course, usual, but it
stands out all the more forcibly when national
tensions flare up in many parts of the world,
as has been the recent experience. Major
divisions among countries of the world today
are fraught with terrible danger. These divisions are accentuated by difficulties recurring
in areas such as the Middle East, and create
situations of great alarm. These international
problems can run us to the brink, if not into
the abyss, of world disaster. Under the critical circumstances of the present times, they
must have a priority of attention and the
most loyal and undivided endeavour. I do
not mean to suggest we should have any
lessening of concentrated effort in matters of
purely local concern; in fact, the more effort
and public awareness we have right down
the line, the better for all.
We in this country must be on guard, as
must the people of all democracies, against
the issues of an international character becoming mixed with those of purely local
p9litical consequence. In these days of atomic
energy, and when the guided missiles, hydrogen bomb experiments, and so forth, are just
day by day news in the press, we all realize,
of course, that measures calling for relief
from international tensions are of the greatest
importance, not only to us here, but to the
whole human race. For that reason, I would

say again that we must under no circumstances allow our thoughts, our policy and our
activities in the matter of international
affairs to be tinged with local political colour.
I think it proper to pay tribute, and very
sincerely so, to the honourable Leader of
the Opposition in this chamber (Hon. Mr.
Haig) for the fair and thoroughly non-partisan
attitude he takes on these international issues.
I feel that fact is generally recognized.
But I would not by my words of tribute
to him wish to convey the suggestion that
the proper attitudes in these matters have not
been well maintained in this house.
Actually, in view of the gravity of the
times, I would like to see political party
affiliations disregarded entirely in the selection of representatives of Canada for the
complex and varied organizations of the
world, where solutions of world difficulties
are being sought. In periods of war there
have been many instances of such practice
in the democracies, and in the efforts to
avert war the same broad policy might well
prevail.
I can well imagine some persons saying
"That is a good idea, but politically impossible." All I would say to that is that politics
is cheap stuff compared to the riches of the
fullest possible contribution to world peace
at this time. We in this country should not
have a political dividing line among our
elected representatives in these matters, where
one group recognize their duty to work progressively and constructively, and the other
group feel their responsibility calls only for
criticism. I am glad to think we employ a
helpful policy whereby parliamentary representatives from all political parties attend
the United Nations proceedings as observers;
I believe they sit in as fairly intimate consultants on inside policy discussions.
Canadian people, irrespective of party
affiliation, I am sure, are proud of the world
recognition that has been given to the part
that the Honourable Mr. Pearson has taken
in international deliberations and in the
leadership generally that has been given by
Canada in these times of crises. Let us back
up and strengthen this leadership in every
way possible.
The Speech from the Throne illustrates
the world-wide activities of this nation. They
include the need for maintaining the basic
unity of the Commonwealth, which is a
policy accepted by everyone. It rightly, I
think, comes first in the many references to
the international scene. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization is also mentioned, and
I would like to pay tribute, as others have

SENATE

done, to the splendid contribution which the
Speaker of this house, the Honourable Wishart
Robertson, has made to this organization,
and in particular to the effort towards economie development within its framework.
That policy has not yet borne the fruit that
was hoped for, but let us keep on working
and hoping in that direction. It is very gratifying to us to find that our Speaker has
been made Honorary President of the Conference of NATO Parliamentarians.
It was of great interest to those of us
who are members of the Canadian NATO
Parliamentary Association, to have had recently the opportunity of meeting Mr. Wayne
Hays of the United States House of Representatives, the President of the Conference
of NATO Parliamentarians. He gave us a
very informative address on the work of
that organization, which enlightened us on
the co-operation that comes from him and
others in their official capacities in the United
States.
Our colleague Senator Cameron gave us
the other day a splendid description of the
UNESCO Conference held in New Delhi quite
recently, which was attended by delegates
from 79 nations. It was most interesting that
he was able to state with such feeling and
sincerity that Canadians, wherever they went
on that trip and throughout the conference,
received a very hearty welcome. As he
stated, he and the others representing Canada
had the thought conveyed to them generally
that Canada is not a nation which in those
affairs is trying to get anything from anybody.
but is recognized as bringing to these councils
in the international field a completely objective and honest consideration. I feel, honourable senators, that Senator Cameron in
bringing such a message to us from that far
eastern conference has told us something of
which Canadians can be justly proud.
I would like now to direct your attention
to certain matters of local significance, some
of which have a direct application to the
Atlantic provinces, and to Newfoundland in
particular.
There are certain aspects of the interim
report of the Royal Commission on Canada's
Economic Prospects which I will refer to at
this time. Immediately the report came out
it drew dominion-wide attention through the
press and radio such as is not usually given
to royal commission reports.
It should be borne in mind in these discussions that the report is a preliminary one
and that the commission's final submissions
will no doubt include much information which
will assist in the interpretation of their first
presentation. I am sure that the members of
this commission, of which Mr. W. E. Gordon is

chairman, are recognized as men of outstanding ability and with very widespread interests
throughout the dominion. From the point of
view of personnel, the selection of this board
unquestionably meets with national approval.
In reviewing the various sections of their
submission, I found myself referring back to
their terms of reference and wondering at
times why they were making specific recommendations as to policy, inasmuch as they
are really a body set up to study conditions
as they are and can be foreseen, and to
anticipate the economic prospects of Canada
over the next 25 years.
It is singular also that of the ten provinces
of Canada they should group four togetherthe Atlantic provinces-and treat them as a
unit in the matter of reporting on and making
recommendations with respect to them, notwithstanding their varied conditions.
My understanding, and I think the
general thought of the public is that this
commission was set up to provide facts
and to anticipate trends on which national
policy as formulated by Governments in
the future may be influenced.
In other
words, it was supposed to provide a foundation of facts on which to base consideration
of future policy in every part of Canada. I
feel they were unwise in making specific
recommendations as to policy in certain
fields, because I do not think they had the
organization or time or opportunity to make
the comprehensive study that would be a
requisite preliminary to some of these definite
recommendations.
I do feel, however, that their reference
to the advisability of the Government of
Canada giving assistance to the residents of
the four Atlantic provinces who may wish
to leave those provinces, owing to lack of
employment opportunities, has been overpublicized and taken a bit out of its context.
It is hard, nevertheless, to reconcile oneself
to an aggressive future policy in any part of
Canada which sets forth the need for supplying money to assist people to get out of those
parts. However, I know that extreme views
have been taken on that one point. It has
given rise unnecessarily, I think, to a
reaction and probably has not done any good
at the moment. While I am a little surprised that that reference was made in the
preliminary report, which the commission
must have considered in a sort of casual
and easygoing way, I am still not inclined
to go along with some of the extreme views
that have been expressed. A few evenings
ago I was listening to a group of men, none of
whom I was acquainted with, who were discussing that very point. They had been
reading what was in the newspapers and

FEBRUARY 6, 1957
probably hearing more on the radio, and one
of them expressed the opinion, in very
strong terms, that it was a terrible thing
that a commission set up by the Government recommended taking everybody out of
the Maritime provinces. The language in
which that view was stated would not look
well on Hansard.
I notice from the report that the commission's first public hearing was held in
St. John's, Newfoundland, and it lasted for
part on one day; in the province of Nova
Scotia the hearing lasted for just three days.
Now I know for a fact that when their visit
was made to St. John's for the official hearings the general public and the organizations
who would have liked to make submissions
were not fully aware of the significance of
this commission's work. The newspapers of
course had written about it and so on, and
people knew generally about the royal commission, but there was not a public awareness of the significance of the work of this
organization whereby various interested
bodies could prepare the factual submissions
for their public hearings.
I should be surprised if the same apathy,
or unawareness, if I may so term it, did not
prevail in the other Atlantic provinces where,
altogether, there were six days of hearings,
spread over a little more than one week.
The commission's report, of course, had to be
based on the submissions made to them, but
these submissions, to fulfil so far-reaching a
function as this royal commission had, should
be the result of expert study and investigation
in each of the fields covered. As the commission went on and held hearings in the
other provinces, I have no doubt that they
received explanatory statements and submissions and a far greater breadth of information
than was the case in the Atlantic section.
The report in its section on the Atlantic
provinces makes reference to the case that
was before the commission for improvement
of the transportation system of the area. They
rightly suggest that this is a matter for
special inquiry on which policy could be
determined.
As far as the province of Newfoundland is
concerned, the transportation problems there
are of unique significance, and certainly in
that relation must not be considered only
as part of those in the eastern area of Canada.
It is unfortunate, I think, that more adequate
provision was not made for communications
and transportation in the early days when
discussions for entry to the dominion were
being carried on. Perhaps in other provinces,
in some areas, railway transportation may
be subordinate in importance to the roads.

But Newfoundland, with its widespread population along the coasts, has unique conditions and problems which require special
consideration.
Another factor which must be borne in mind
in considering Newfoundland's future is that
the sea is its greatest natural resource. That
fact is not generally recognized, and to my
mind it is not brought out in the report
with the emphasis that it should be given.
It is true that today the mineral development
which is going on there is .commanding almost
worldwide interest. We have also, as is
generally known, a pulp and paper industry
which is making use of our forests in a very
capable and progressive manner. Further, we
have an increasing number of diversified
types of industry. On the other hand, thus
far there has been brought forth only a
very limited policy for making use of the
products of the sea and for the general promotion of the fishing industry.
The report anticipates that by 1980 the
number of fishermen will have dropped by
one-sixth, but that by reason of greater
mechanization during the next 25 years the
productivity may increase by 60 per cent.
That anticipation, surely, is nothing more
than an estimate based on present trends and
has been arrived at without consideration of
what an adequate modernizing program commensurate with the natural resource would
mean. It is a fact that today the wealth
of the sea in relation to the available production is barely touched by Newfoundlanders.
It was my privilege a few months ago to
be able to inspect a new Russian fishing ship
which called at St. John's and was much
publicized. It cost several million dollars
and is, I believe, the pattern on which a
large fleet is to be built by the Russian
Government. It was a floating factory on
which the fish that are caught are processed.
The crew freeze what fish are required for
human consumption, and process into oil,
meal and so forth, what is needed for animal
consumption and soil fertilization. Not a
particle is wasted. I question whether there
is in the North Atlantic a ship which compares in efficiency with that boat.
The French, Portuguese and Spanish boats
are fishing off our shores, and scores of them
use Newfoundland ports as their base. They
are progressing in their efforts and increasing
their catches, while ours in many branches
are declining. In world markets our competition is greatest from the production of
France, Norway and Iceland; in fact Newfoundland is being forced right out of some
markets.
The Gordon Commission's interim report
points out that it is a general policy of many

SENATE
of the competing countries to support their
fisheries by artificial aids or bounties and
in other ways.
In the face of these facts, I cannot understand why the specific recommendation of
policy made by the commission states that
it would be unwise ta institute policies of
artificial aids and bounties such as prevail
in other producing countries, but that Canada should take every opportunity for negotiations which could lead to the removal or
reduction of barriers to international trade
in fish. One can thus see an industry perish
while those concerned are waiting with
patience and lofty thou'ghts on the realization of the ideal of freedom of international
trade. I am surprised that in these circumstances, and while the resources of the sea
are not being used by our people ta anything
like the extent that they should be, the
commission would piously deny what may be
an inevitable course, at all events for the
time being, if progress is ta be made. It is,
1 admit, a course which is theoretically incorrect, but it may be in the competitive
circumstances the only practical and effective one.
Direct subsides in one form and another
apply to commodities right across Canada,
and some of these commodities may not
be as vital to the livelihood of the people
as fish is to fishermen. It may be in the
minds of the commission ta let the Government pay fishermen ta move elsewhere to
other jobs. Surely no recommendation could
be more defeating.
Subsidies to industry take many forms
besides what are called direct aids. Are not
protective tariffs, excise taxes and sa forth
just as much a subsidy and a charge on the
people's resources as a direct payment to
encourage industrial promotion and production? There is hardly a manufacturing industry in Canada which is not protected,
and that protection is provided through the
payment by every Canadian family of a
higher price for the products which are made
here than it would have to pay if similar
products could be brought duty-free into this
country. I am not saying that entire abandonment of duties is a practical course. I am
sure it is not. The dangers are only in the
excesses; but a direct subsidy ta an industry to produce a product which can be
exported to other countries, and create earning power which can be used ta extend the
scope of local manufactures and production,
does not call for any more condemnation
than a reasonable application of customs
tariffs.
I mentioned just now that the sea is the
greatest natural resource of my province,
and I genuinely believe that it is and will

continue ta be beyond the period of 1980,
which comes under review. On the other
hand, and ta emphasize the particular problems of Newfoundland, I should say that the
sea is the greatest deterrent ta a natural
integration of the life on the island with that
on the mainland. Arising out of that comes
the problem, as I have said, of transportation
and a hundred other matters which are not
common in the same degree ta many parts
of Canada. This means that Newfoundland,
by its need for a more developed economy,
requires support in the provision of more
adequate public services. The provision of
these facilities sets up assets valuable ta all
of Canada. Newfoundland is off there by
itself, shipping its fish and the products of its
forests and mines ta scores of far-away
markets in four continents of the world,
thereby earning the funds required for the
purchase of its consumer needs from the other
provinces of Canada, and this fact calls for
special consideration.
As I have said in this chamber before,
there is no province that buys such a large
proportion of its requirements from other
provinces and supplies sa little of its production in competition with the producers
in the other provinces. Our close neighbour
Prince Edward Island sends three to four
million dollars' worth of its production each
year into Newfoundland, but buys practically
nothing whatever from our island.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: We do buy some cement
from Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: That is fine, and I hope you
keep on using more and more of our cement.
I do not attach any blame ta Prince Edward
Island because a two-way trade up ta the
present time at all events has not been a
natural condition. I am just pointing out
that it is not right ta condemn out of hand a
policy which may set up more earning power,
and which in turn would be of general help
ta the whole economy of Canada.
There are many other subjects in the
Gordon Commission report on which I would
like ta express some views, but I feel, honourable senators, that I have taken up as much
of your time as I should just now. In the
course of the session, when business having
relation ta the many matters of national
interest comes before us, the facts of the
report and the commission's later submissions
will, I am sure, be used extensively and profitably in parliamentary deliberations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable senators, in rising ta speak in this distinguished
chamber my first words must be ta acknowledge the courtesy and kindness that have been
shown me by members of this august body

FEERUARY 8, 1957
and by the staff of the Senate since my
appointment here; and to thank them most
sincerely for the warma and gracious welcome
that they have given me.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, I also wish to thank
my French-speaking colleagues for their kindness and courtesy. I amn sorry that I do flot
speak their beautiful language better but I
hope, with Urne and the help of my good
friend the senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) that my French will improve. In the meantime, I shall have to
revert to English.
(Teoet):
Honourable senators, I join with the others
who have spoken in congratulating the mover
and the seconder of the motion for an Address
in reply to the Speech frorn the Tbrone. The
experience and the knowledge of the mover,
the honourable senator frorn Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Bois), as shown by his remarks,
will be of great value to the very important
Special Committee on Land Use which has
been set up at this session.
As for the honourable senator from Kamnloops (Hon. Mr. Smnith), as I listened to the
good sense of bis rernarks, so well delivered,
I was happy indeed to be his deskmate. I
congratulate also the new senators from
Prince Albert (Hon. Mr. Boucher) and Westrnorland <Hon. Mr. Taylor) upon their
appointments, and I wish to say that I have
a fellow feeling for thern, for I too arn a
recent newcomer to the Senate.
Honourable senators, the debate on this
resolution ýaffords an opportunity for a wide
discussion of Canada's affairs. Both this year
and last year I enjoyed the rernarks of those
who have denît with some special part of
Canada about which they have particular
knowledge, such as the address just presented
by the honourable gentleman from St. John's
West <Hon. Mr. Pratt).
It bas been my good fortune to have
travelled extensively throughout Canada,
from Newfoundland to British Columbia, but
I know you do not expect me to tell you
anything about the place frorn whence I
corne. In rny travels I have learned to
appreciate the various parts of this country,
and the more I have seen of our people, the
prouder I arn of thern and of my country,
and the more grateful I arn, not only for the
blessing that made this my native land, but
for the wisdom that brought about Confederation, which, out of the diversities of
our people and notwithstanding the vastness
of our territory, rnoulded us into one great
united nation.
If it is not presumptuous on rny part I
should like to echo the rernarks of the
honourable Leader of the Opposition <Hon.
82719-h10

Mr. Haig) that Confederation wouhd not have
been possible witbout the establishmnent of
this bouse. Here, in effect, each great section
of this country speaks with equal voice and
influence, so that the rights of minorities may
be protected and that hegishative decisions
may not be unduly influenced by a preponderance of population -in any one section of
our federal systern. It is as if we were a
partnership of four--one frorn the Maritimes,
one from Quebec, one frorn Ontario, and one
from the west-concerned primarily with the
good of the whole, but fully respecting the
special views -and interests of each portion.
And so the Senate is a safeguard for the
continued existence of our federated system
of governiment.
Honourable senators, the particuhar topic
with which I wish to deal today is the reference in tbe Speech frorn the Throne for the
need to cbeck the inflationary tendencies now
existing in this country and ehsewhere. The
seriousness of these tendencies is emphasized
by the fact that Mr. Eisenhower, the President
of the 'United States of Anierica, in his State
of the Union message on January 10, put if
first in bis consideration of his country's
domestic affairs. He said:
No subi ect on the domestie scene should more
attract the concern of the friends of Amnerican
working men and women and of f ree business
enterprise than the forces latent and active that
threaten a steady deprectation of the value of our
money.
I must admit that I enter upon this subject
with a certain amount of trepidation. I
remember reading a good many years ago
sometbing written by Sir Norman Angehi, in
wbicb he said, "The two things that seern t0
addle a man's brains most are, (1) rnonetary
tbeory, and, (2) women." At the outset, I
sbould say tbat I arn not an expert on either.
However, I amn ernboldened to say sornething
on the subi ect of inflation, because it seems
to me that it is important enought to warrant
the consideration of nîl tbougbtful Canadians
and an appreciation of the issues invohved,
and so I venture to put forward my views
for wbat tbey rnay be worth.
In the flrst instance, may I define the word
"inflation" as I use it. because it may mean
different things to different people. By inflation I mean a substantial and continued
rise in the general hevel of prices. One reason
for being careful about the use of the word
is that it may arise from quite different sets
of circurnstances, and sometimes the rneaning
of tbe word is confused with its underhying
causes. For example, we are ahi familiar
with the inflation that took place in Germany
after World War I, and wbicb was the resuht
of an enormous increase in govermnent
spending, based on government deficits, and
flnanced by an increase i the currency, so

SENATE

that marks turned out by printing presses
rapidly depreciated in value and prices
soared. It was pure inflation, and the misery
and hate that it caused made a fertile breeding ground for a dictator and a war.
An entirely different set of circumstances
caused inflation during World War II, both
in Canada and elsewhere. Here a magnificent
job was done to keep inflation within reasonable control. In wartime a country bas to
mobilize a very large proportion of its manpower and material resources in order to
produce guns, planes and warships, and to
man its armed forces. All this spending done
by the Government becomes purchasing
power in the hands of the public, while at the
same time there is a limited amount of
civilian goods which can be bought. This
causes prices to rise. In wartime it was recognized that this situation must be controlled
and curbed in order to win the war, and we
were prepared to make sacrifices accordingly.
We therefore paid high taxes, bought Victory
bonds, and submitted to the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board controls and rationing, in
order to keep inflation within reasonable
check.
Coming now to the present inflationary
tendencies, we see that they arise from
something different again from the other two
cases that I have mentioned.
As the honourable Leader of the Opposition
pointed out, the present cost of living index
is about 90 per cent higher than the figure
for 1939. In order to understand our present
situation it seems to me that we must divorce
the period between 1939 and 1951 from the
period since 1951. First of all, after 1939
we had the inevitable wartime inflation of
which I have spoken. In the immediate postwar period when price controls and rationing
were removed it was like the lifting of a lid,
and there was released a pent-up demand for
spending, which again forced up prices in the
post-war period; then came the Korean War
in 1950, with consequent heavy Government
expenditures for the war effort. However, by
1951 all of these inflationary influences had
spent themselves and we reached a point of
stability, so that for a period of approximately
four years we had no inflation, and prices
remained stable, even though generally
throughout that period we were expanding
production and employment. The cost of
living index averaged 116.5 for the year
1952, and in May of last year it was 116.6,
practically the same figure.
Since May of 1956 the cost of living index
has risen to 120.4, a gain of nearly 4 points
in seven months, and it is that rise in the
last seven months that is the significant feature in our present situation, and not the

inflation that took place between 1939 and
1952. That is the warning signal that inflationary pressures are at work in our
economy.
When we look into the causes of this rise
in prices we find that in 1955 the gross national production in Canada rose about 9
per cent above the figure of the previous
year. That was perhaps the largest single
annual increase in the history of the country.
The expansion continued through 1956 and
brought our economy to the point where production is bumping up against the ceiling
imposed by our physical capacity to produce;
yet we want to go on expanding. In effect,
what we are trying to do is to run faster
than our legs will carry us. One set of
figures will give an example: As of October
1956, compared with two years earlier,
October 1954, there were nearly 370,000 more
persons employed in Canada, and the number
of persons unemployed and seeking work had
dropped from 180,000 in October 1954 to
98,000 in October 1956. The percentage of
labour force unemployed and seeking work
was down to 1.7; in other words, we had
practically 100 per cent employment. At the
same time, because of the expansion during
those past two years, shortages had begun to
develop in a number of essential materials.
We have therefore reached the zone of full
employment of our resources of manpower
and materials.
Honourable senators, one might ask: "What
is wrong with all this? We are prosperous,
everybody is working, profits are good, so
why not relax and enjoy it?" A good
many people would be prepared to swap a
little inflation for what they hope will be a
continuation of the boom. This is dangerous
psychology and might involve our economy
in some serious trouble. An analogy comes
to my mind of the man who likes to drive
his car f ast along a highway; the faster he
goes the greater thrill he gets out of it, but
if he keeps pressing his foot down on the
accelerator I am afraid that at some time lie
will pay dearly for his enjoyment. If this
inflationary tendency of the present time was
to stop at the 4 per cent rise seen in the
last seven months, and were now to level off,
of course, no harm would come, but in fact
the rapid rise in prices has not yet percolated
through our whole economy, and there are
still price increases to come as the result
of the 4 per cent rise during the last year.
Furthermore, when we reach this stage
of full employment and still wish to expand, bidding for the available supplies
starts. Organized labour is able to ask for
and receive higher wages; businesses making good profits are able to pay the higher

FEBRUARY 6, 1957

wages, and that higher cost is passed on in
the form of higher prices. One man's higher
price becomes another man's higher cost,
and so the infiationary spiral is at work.
Now, what is wrong with that situation?
Here are some of the things that happen if
we are not able to curb or control the infiationary trend.
In the first place, the people who suffer the
most are those who are not able to raise
their incomes as fast as prices rise. They include unorganized workers, pensioners, annuitants and all recipients of social welfare
payments. The second thing that happens
is that people are discouraged from saving.
They are afraid that their savings would
depreciate by reason of the increase in
prices, and therefore it would be better for
them to spend rather than to save. And
one more push is added to the inflationary
spiral. A third thing that happens is that
our competitive position in world markets
is worsened. Those industries which depend
upon exports find their costs have increased,
and they are unable to compete in world
markets. And so a contraction starts in that
very important section of our economy.
Continued inflation leads to speculation,
because people think goods are going to continue to rise in price. Finally there is an
ultimate collapse, and the higher the prices
have risen the more severe the depression
that follows.
Well, what is the solution to the situation, if that is a true analysis of it? As the
problem is one of excess demand against the
available supply of resources, then of course
you can try to increase the supply or decrease
the demand, or do both. As we are in a
state of full employment, we cannot add to
the supply of our resources except over a
period of time, during which the inflationary
pressures of demand for spending may grow
as fast or faster. So the pressure grows.
The answer seems to lie in decreasing the
demand while we catch up with the supply.
There are several ways in which we can
slow down our demands for spending on more
goods and services. One of course is that we
voluntarily postpone the buying of thingsand this goes for governments, business and
individuals-which can reasonably be postponed until prices are more stable.
The second point is-and it is an unfortunate one for us-we will have to continue to pay relatively high taxes. I dislike
that as much as anybody, but there is not
much doubt that in this situation relatively
high taxation does help to dampen down the
demand and eventually to stop the inflationary
pressure. In this connection the federal Government's surplus is a help to the economy
as it decreases the spending pressure.
82719-104

The third factor in reducing inflationary
tendencies, and the most important of all,
is the credit squeeze. At present we have
tight money and high interest rates. In that
connection, I think I should first say that
tight money and high interest rates are a
natural development of the expansion in our
economy which I have described. During
this past year $7J billion out of our total
gross national product of $30 billion was
invested in capital goods. That is 25 per cent
of the total, which is an enormous proportion. Indeed, it is much higher than the
proportion achieved in the United States.
It is probably much higher than the proportion of output devoted to capital improvement in countries behind the Iron Curtain,
where the people are regimented and controlled and there is a government direction
of credit. Our supply of capital funds is
limited by the supply of our savings. There
is intense competition for the capital funds
necessary to finance our investment program.
During 1956 we saw new issues of bonds for
a very substantial amount of money, for
capital investment for development, in
uranium, gas, oil, iron, copper, aluminum,
and allied industries such as pipe lines, transportation and power facilities. All these
demands upon our supply of capital funds
have tended to raise interest rates and to
create the condition of tight money. That
capital investment program has been the
most dynamic feature of our economy over
the past two years. At the same time there
has also been an increase in consumer expenditure by all of us, at the retail level, on
consumer goods. Some of this expenditure
has been due to an expansion of consumer
credit in the form of instalment buying and
personal loans. In the past two years there
has been an increase in consumer credit of
$650 million, and the total outstanding consumer credit as of last September was $2,400
million.
Now one may ask, would it not be a good
idea to inject some new credit into this tight
money situation? Should we not have the
Bank of Canada artificially inject more credit
into the economy, so that people may borrow
funds which they cannot now get, or which
they are unable to get in sufficient quantity?
Such an injection of new credit, if not
accompanied by an equivalent supply of
goods, would serve no purpose. As long as the
basic problem is an excess demand for the
limited supply of goods and manpower, more
money would only intensify the demand.
Prices would go higher, and the efforts of
the borrowers to spend would be frustrated by
this further increase.
I have said that tight money and high
interest rates are a natural development of

SENATE
this situation. They are symptoms of it, but
they also help to cure it. They do it in this
way: In the first place, high interest rates
encourage people to save, and tend to bring
the volume of savings more into equilibrium
with the demand for capital investment. In
the second place, and more important, they
cause governments, businesses and individuals to take another look at their spending
programs and to decide to postpone until
interest rates are lower some of the expenditures which they now think they should
go ahead with. To the extent then that people can postpone spending now, and spend
later, we will spread out our expansion and
production, and we will extend the period
of our prosperity.
In the result, tight money, high interest
rates, relatively high taxes, Government surpluses and such voluntary saving as we make,
help to overcome the inflationary influences.
I realize that the effect of tight money
falls unevenly throughout the country. It
affects some people, some areas, some businesses, and some sectors more than others.
Consequently complaints arise and one cannot help but be sympathetic toward them.
But under any treatment that we might apply
to a situation of full employment and rapid
expansion, somebody has to do without. It
has been suggested that possibly there should
be selective controls, that perhaps the Government should step in and direct a flow of
money into certain quarters. Somebody still
would have to do without. It is a very serious
question how far a Government in peacetime
should interfere in a free economy with the
direction and flow of credit. Such regulation
might be all right in wartime when everybody recognizes that the one objective is to
win the war, but in peacetime to try to determine who is to have access to borrowed
funds and who is not, how much credit people
may have, what businesses are to be allowed
to expand and what ones are not-to do all
these things would involve a degree of regimentation that I think would not command
popular support in this country at this time.
To sum up: the situation that I think we
would all like to have is one in which our
economy would go ahead at a steady, sure
pace but without an overall price increase.
This is possible if we can cut down sufflciently on our immediate demands for
spending. We can still be very well off in
this year 1957, for example, if instead of
expanding at the rate we did in 1955 and
1956 we were to slow down to a point where
our gross national production increased during
the year by 4 or 5 per cent over the 1956
figure.

There are people who fear that the effect
of tight money might go too far and cause
unemployment. In this connection it is interesting to look at other countries where
inflationary pressures have been working,
and a credit squeeze exists. For instance,
they have tight money in the United States,
the United Kingdom and Germany. In the
United Kingdom the bank discount rate is
5j per cent, compared with our rate of something under 4 per cent. Germany's rate was
5 per cent until recently.
I was interested to read the remarks made
this week by Sir Oliver Franks, Chairman of
Lloyds Bank in England. He was discussing
the effect of the credit squeeze in the United
Kingdom, where credit restrictions were
imposed in 1955, on the recommendation of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The United
Kingdom also put into effect some other
measures designed primarily to direct her
industry toward exports, under the old
principle that Britain must export or die.
Looking back now over the period of time
during which this tight money policy had
been in effect in Britain, Sir Oliver Franks
pointed out that there had been a check in
production as a result of tight money and
the auxiliary measures, but that there had
been no appreciable downturn. He said:
In the light of this we should hear no more of
the cry that any measure of disinflation, however
gently applied, can result in wholesale slump and
unemployment.
On the contrary, should we find
ourselves in a similar situation in future, the
authorities ought to be emboldened by this experience to act more promptly and effectively.

I will sum up by suggesting that what we
want to do is to avoid the excesses of inflation and of subsequent depression. We want
to smooth out the hills and the valleys. We
want to avoid the "boom and bust" cycle, and
if we can dampen down a boom by relatively
high taxes and interest rates, a subsequent
depression may never come, and if there is
any recession it should be milder and shorter.
Some of the increased spending by consumers and business should be spread out
over a longer period so that our prosperity
can be continued into the future. In the
long run of course it is the destiny of Canada
to go on to greater wealth and production, far
beyond our present stage, but if we bring
to this problem of inflation in peacetime the
same qualities of understanding, intelligence,
self-discipline and leadership that we brought
to the problem of inflation in wartime, then
our progress will be steadier, surer, faster
and greater.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax
North), the debate was adjourned.

FEBRUARY 6, 1957
DIVORCE RULES
AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
January 24, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck for adoption of
the thirteenth report of the Standing Committee on Divorce.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I find this a very interesting subject and I
think I should say sornething with respect
to the suggested amendments to the divorce
rules. We have been a long time in reaching this item on the Order Paper, and I may
have forgotten some of the things I intended
to say. But I want to make it clear that
anything I say is meant to be helpful; none
of my remarks will have any political
significance, and they are not intended to be
critical of any person, living or dead.
Our divorce rules have not been amended
for a long Uie. In May of last year the
committee thought that something should be
done about them, and it passed a resolution
requesting the former Law Clerk of the
Senate, Mr. MacNeill, the present law Clerk,
Mr. Hopkins, and the Chief Clerk of committees, Mr. Armstrong, to look over the
rules during the recess and bring in a
report and recommendations in this matter.
They did so. Their report is a very interesting document. I have read it with care,
and I compliment those concerned on having done a good job. We have been told by
the chairman of the committee that the
committee carefully considered the report
and drew up a number of amendments,
which it has submitted to us for approval.
I like the way in which the amendments
have been drawn. Instead of saying that in
a certain line certain words should be
struck out and other words inserted, which
is the kind of thing we are confronted with
when we consider amendments to the Income Tax Act, the committee has deleted
whole sections, drawn new ones, and analyzed
the changes involved. In that respect, I
submit, it has done a good job.
I trust that honourable senators have read
the report and the suggested amendments.
Most of the amendments deal with routine
matters and are of no great importance. In
fact, when I was a member of the committee
and we could not find any rule to go by, we
always fell back on rule 152, which states:
152. In cases not provided for by these rules the
general principles upon which the Imperial Parliament proceeds in dissolving marriage and the
rules, usages and forms of the House of Lords in
respect of divorce proceedings may, so far as they
are applicable, be applied to divorce proceedings
before the Senate and before the Standing Committee on Divorce.

We considered that that direction covered
a multitude of things, and we did not worry
about whether or not we could find a definite
rule. In fact, I do not like to be tied down
by too many rules; in this respect I prefer
a little freedom.
As I have said, I find no objection to most
of these amendments; but one of them, having
to do with the naming and serving of corespondents in all cases before petitions are
heard, gives me considerable concern, and
I shall deal with it a little later.
I think I should say something about the
present rules. They were drawn up when
divorce in Canada was in its infancy; but
whoever prepared them had a good precedent.
They were copied practically in their entirety
from the rules of procedure prevailing in
England at the time. That is why they have
stood up so well and so long.
At the present time eight of the ten
Canadian provinces, including Ontario, the
west, and the Maritimes, have their own
divorce courts. They, also, adopted the good
practice of copying their rules and regulations
from those in force in England; and that, I
suppose, is why there is so much similarity
between the Senate rules pertaining to
divorce and those which prevail in the various
provinces.

Before I came to Ottawa I had had considerable experience of divorce matters in the
province of Saskatchewan. When I became
a member of the Divorce Committee of the
Senate I began to compare the rules in force
in Saskatchewan with-those of our committee,
and I noticed many similarities. But there
are some differences in procedure. In Saskatchewan we issue a writ which names the
parties, and states the time for appearance
and the names of the solicitor for the plaintiff.
Attached to the writ is a statement of claim
which sets out all of the things that are mentioned in Senate Rule 139, with certain additions, and in an action in any province the
name of the -co-respondent must if at all
possible be provided and the co-respondent
must be served before the case goes to trial.
If the name of the co-respondent is not known,
an application has to be made to a judge
of the court, before a writ is issued for leave
to proceed with the action without naming
the co-respondent. When I found out that
the Senate rules did not require the corespondent to be named or served, it bothered
me quite a bit. I was of the opinion that in
parliamentary divorce petitions, as in court
cases, the co-respondent should be named and
that he or she should be served with the
papers.
I have found other differences as well. For
example, in the provinces we are allowed to
obtain evidence on commission and to proceed

SENATE

to get facts by examinations for discovery.
We do not follow these methods in parliamentary divorce. Another thing is that in
the provincial courts a notice of trial has to
be given to all parties whether they appear
or not, and the trial is held in open court,
whereas in the Senate the petitions are inquired into in camera. In both proceedings,
however, before a case can proceed the plaintiff in the courts or the petitioner before
Parliament must take an affidavit swearing
to the facts known at the time and contained
in the statement of claim or in the petition.
As I was a member of the Divorce Committee for quite a number of years, and its
chairman during some ten years, honourable
senators may wonder why I did not take
steps to provide for the naming of and serving of papers upon the co-respondent. The
reason was this. When I first became a
member of the committee we had a very
capable chairman in the person of Senator
McMeans of Winnipeg. He was followed by
Senator Robinson of Moncton. Preceding
those gentlemen as chairman there had been,
among others, Senator W. B. Willoughby ot
Moose Jaw, Senator Sir James Lougheed of
Calgary, and Senator W. B. Ross of Middleton,
Nova Scotia.
When I asked Senators McMeans and
Robinson why the Senate rules had never
been amended to bring them into line with
those of the courts they replied they had
discussed the matter together many times,
and Senator McMeans also told me that he
had discussed the question with Senators
Willoughby and Lougheed. They had ail
come to the conclusion that the rules should
o hech
not
not b chagad.thing
I should like to give you their reasons.
In the first place, they pointed to the fact
that the Senate committee was not a court,
and that an application to have a divorce
dissolved by Parliament was made by way
of petition to the foot of the Throne. They
also claimed that in their opinion a parlia-

respondent and serving hlm was that it
would lead to more divorces, which was
against public policy. Take the case ot a
husband who is named and served as a
co-respondent. His wife finds out about it
and there is another divorce.
They also said that in most petitions
emanating from the province ot Quebec,
particularly from Montreal, the name of the
co-respondent could not be ascertained, and
that if a change were made in the rules 50
that the co-respondent would have to ha
named and served it would place too great
an obligation on the committee. They felt
it would ha a different matter if the committee sat throughout the year and not just
In other
during sessions of Parliament.
words, they claimed that we have not got
the machinery to justify such a change in
the rules. They said, too, that if they saw
fit they could order that the co-respondent
be named in any petition filed with the
committee and that he be served. In any
avent, they predicted that Parliamantary
divorces would soon he done away with and
for that reason they did not think anything
should be done to change the rules.
I also discussed this whole question with
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) who for many years assisted
me in thîs Parliamentary divorce work as

mentary divorce could be obtained on the
ground of adultery, desertion or any other
ground or, as a matter of fact, upon no
ground at all. But they did not feel that the
Senate, as one branch of Parliament, had the
authority to make a rule that the petitioner

should specify this, that and the other thing.
They felt that every petition should be decided on its own merits.
That was the main reason they had not
adopted the practice prevailing in the provincial courts. They said that the Senate
rules were only for guidance and to help
establish some uniformity in procedure. They
referred me to Rule 152, which I read to the
house a few minutes ago. They also said
that another reason for not naming the do-

would mean that in almost 300 cases a year
the proposed new procedure would apply if
the amendment were adopted. I am quite
sure that there will be at least that number
of cases every year wherein the co-respondent
is not known and cannot be served.
The suggested rule provides for the naming
of the co-respondent and the service of all
the papers on the co-respondent; it also provides that if the co-respondent is not known,
before the petition can be set down for hearing an application must be made to the
committee by the petitioner or his or her
solicitor for leave to proceed without naming
and serving the co-respondent. That is going
to be quite a proposition. That means that
every year the committee will be faced with
hearing some 300 applications or more for
leave to proceed. That procedure will be
expensive, because the solicitors for the petitioners will have to appear before the committee, sometimes at considerable expense.
It may even necessitate more clerical help
for the committee. Further, I think it would
be an imposition on the members of the committee to have to go through all that procedure. I am afraid that the committee
would become bogged down, and that when
our present and capable chairman of the
committee retires we would be unable to get
anyone to take his position.
Honourable senators, if the committee insists that a rule of this kind is necessary, and
if the Senate considers it advisable, I suggest
that the rule be redrawn to provide that in
cases where the co-respondent is known he
or she must be named and served. That is al]
that would need to be put into the rule. Then
if a petitioner came before the committee
with a petition in which the co-respondent
was not named and it was found by the
committee that the co-respondent was known
and should have been named, it would only
be necessary for the committee to adjourn the
case and order the parties to be served.
Under that system the committee would not
have to hear 300-odd applications for leave
to proceed in advance.
I have another suggestion: If the proposed
new rule should happen to go through as it is
worded now, why could not some procedure
be adopted whereby the Law Clerk of the
Senate, when Parliament is not in session,
would hear these applications for leave to
proceed without naming the co-respondent?
May I make a further suggestion? Why
could not the chairman and one member of
the committee, when Parliament is in session,
have power to hear all these applications
and make an order allowing a case to proceed
or not to proceed, as the case might be.

That is all I wish to say about the suggested change in the rule, which has caused
me a great deal of concern and which, in
my opinion, may not improve matters to
any great degree if adopted, and may in fact
do harn.
Honourable senators, I want to refer to Rule
136, which has not been mentioned. It provides that in all -cases of petitions for divorce
to Parliament notice must appear in a French
and an English newspaper, as well as in the
Canada Gazette. That is a most expensive
procedure. It bas been found in the past
that where applications had been made to
waive the payment of part of the parliamentary fee, and cases of that kind, the
cost of the advertising was sometimes over
$100, and for the life of me I could never
understand why the notices had to be published in French and English newspapers as
well as in the Canada Gazette. Publication
in the Canada Gazette should be sufficient.
Why could we not redraft Rule 136 and eut
out this requirement? I think that is of
sufficient importance to be considered before
these amendments are finally dealt with.
I should also like to see provision made
for examination for discovery, and for taking
evidence by commission, if possible. For
example, under the present procedure if a
person from Newfoundland files a petition,
he or she must give evidence by personal
attendance, unless the committee issues an
order that certain facts may be proved by
affidavit. Such persons are obliged to bring
a lawyer and witnesses to Ottawa, at great
expense. I do not know if the committee
has considered the possibility of receiving
evidence in the way I have suggested, but if
it were possible it would be much to the
advantage of people who otherwise would
have to come from Newfoundland or other
great distances to give evidence.
We are told that these new rules would not
come into force until September 1. In the
meantime, I presume they would be printed
and distributed to the legal profession, but
between now -and September 1 the old rules
would still apply, and petitions for divorce
would come in without naming the co-respondent. The committee would have to deal
with such petitions at a later time.
I feel, honourable senators, that the suggestion I have made is worth while. Let us
not make the work of the committee more
burdensome. I feel this particular rule should
be redrafted to provide simply for the naming
of and service on the co-respondent when he
or she is known. In other cases the matter
could be dealt with by the committee when
the cases come up for hearing.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Farris, the debate
was adjourned.

THE LATE HON. J. J. DUFFUS
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before we proceed with the Orders of
the Day may I refer to the passing of one
who was a very dear friend to the members
of this chamber, the late Joseph James Duffus.
His passing is a personal loss to a great many
of us who have known him over the years.
The first time I met him he was interested
in plowing matches. He travelled over this
country encouraging young farmers to take
an interest in a skill, the nature of which
has since changed considerably. At one time
in the memory of all of us plowing was done
entirely by horses, and some honourable
senators may recall when it was done by
oxen. Plowing is now done by machinery,
but it still requires a great deal of skill. The
matches which take place nowadays, both
national and international, have developed
from the early days when the late Joseph
James Duffus was one of the first to take an
interest in them. He was well known across
Canada, and was called by thousands not
"Mr. Duffus" or "Senator Duffus", but "Joe",
and to those thousands of people throughout
the country his passing is a great loss.
His life was filled with good works.
I
recall that the first speech I heard him make
in this chamber was on a subject which was
very dear to him, the establishment of the
David Fife Memorial Society to commemorate
the discovery by David Fife of Red Fife
wheat. He made a very stirring appeal to us to
support him in that undertaking. I do not
believe the memorial has been eracted yet,
but he started the movement, and probably
some of us will see it completed. That was
only one of the many good works in which
he was interested.
The late Joseph J. Duffus was born on June
17, 1876, at Peterborough, Ontario, where he
lived all his life.
He was the son of
James J. Duffus and Maria Glavin. At an
early age he threw himself with vigour into
farming, and subsequently business pursuits,

in the Peterborough area, where he soon
established himself as a leader of the
comm4nity.
On April 30, 1907 he married Gertrude L.
Sullivan, who survives him with two sons
and two daughters. He was a man of varied
and wide interests, and in every field of
endeavour to which he turned he achieved
success and leadership. He was an alderman
of the city of Peterborough for six years
and mayor during 1916 and 1917; and for
three years he was president of the Peterborough Chamber of Commerce. In addition,
he was president of the Ontario Plowman's
Association, vice-president of the Ontario
Tourist Association, and a member of various
religious, educational and service organizations in the Peterborough area. He was interested in military affairs and served with
various regiments. He entered the House
of Commons in 1935 on the same day that I
did. He had offered himself for election unsuccessfully on two previous occasions, in
1926 and 1930. He did not seek re-election to
that house, and in 1940 he was summoned to
the Senate.
Although he was an ardent Liberal he was
not bound by narrow partisanship. He was
always willing to give help to all who needed
it, and to support al worthy causes, no
matter who sponsored them.
Honourable senators, his passing is a great
loss to his wife and family, to all of whom
I extend our deepest sympathy.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I only knew the late Senator Duffus after he
was summoned to this house. His health
was not very good at that time; in fact, it
was gradually declining. I shall never forget
his speech on the late David Fife, after whom
Red Fife Wheat was named. Red Fife was
one of the outstanding types of grain produced in the west, in my part of the country,
for many years. Before hearing the speech
by Senator Duffus I had thought that Red
Fife was just the name of a certain type of
wheat; it had never entered my head that
Fife was the name of the great man who
had discovered this wheat which contributed
so largely to the development of the west.
Red Fife wheat resists rust, which comes to
Canada even from so far as Mexico. It was
a great lesson to us younger men back in
the days when we were just "feeling our
oats", so to speak, and beginning to take a
live interest in our country, to learn what
science could do in these matters.
Senator Duffus was a credit to his native
province of Ontario. Personally, I was delighted and inspired by his speech on the
discovery of Red Fife wheat, and I felt an
obligation to him for the information he
presented to the Senate on the subject.

SENATE
Our late colleague will be sorely missed
by his wife and family. I have experienced
bereavement myself, so I know something
about those things. On behalf of all honourable senators I extend to his widow and
family a warm tribute to the memory of their
husband and father, who gave to his country
something very much worth while, for which
he will long be gratefully remembered.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, it is with a considerable measure
of sadness and regret that I rise at this time
o support the words that have been so
appropriately expressed by the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I had the great privilege of knowing the
late Senator Duffus for the past thirty years.
Perhaps the highest tribute one can pay him
is to say that he was essentially a good
Canadian citizen. He was particularly attached to that part of the country which be
knew best, the district of Peterborough and
the adjoining counties of central and eastern
Ontario. As a result of his active interest
in all community affairs be earned for himself a reputation of being not only an accomplished speaker and a tireless worker among
his people, but a representative who could
be relied upon to attend to the needs of his
fellow citizens in that part of the province.
When I think of my own intimate contact
with Senator Duffus during the thirties, particularly the working relationship we had in
connection with political affairs, I recall his
ardent non-partisan enthusiasm for public
affairs and service in the interest of not only
his own people but the country as a whole.
For example, the tribute he paid in this house
to the late David Fife, the discoverer of Red
Fife wheat, reflected a mind concerned with
matters of national and even international
importance. Indeed, in his own way, he
was a devoted student of international affairs.
As I was turning over in my mind what I
migbt say about our late colleague today,
there came to my hand rather conveniently
a letter which I received not long ago from
a well-known Canadian who for some time
has served this country in Europe and is now
about to return here. The lines which I
propose to quote were contained in a letter
in which the writer expressed his own philosophy about Canada, a philosophy which
it seems to me applies most appropriately to
the late Senator Duffus. I quote:
Those of us who call ourselves liberal-democrats
often believe that we are at home everywhere.
It is often our best
But that is not the case.
faculties that wither first in foreign soil. If the
finest people of every country left it to become
missionaries elsewhere, then I am afraid every
country would go to ruin. The essential thing is
for us not to make foreign people over in our

image, but to understand them. There should be
fewer disappointed missionaries in the world and
more people who have learned to improve their
own surroundings and to love what they do not
understand.

I submit that that quotation, irrelevant as it
may seem, serves to emphasize the distinguished service which Joe Duffus gave to
his fellow countrymen, especially in the community in which he lived.
I join with those who have already spoken
in extending sympathy to his widow and
family.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I wish to join with my colleagues in saying
a word of sympathy to the family of the late
Senator Duffus. I worked with the late
senator in the House of Commons, and our
close friendship continued after we became
members of this chamber.
As has been pointed out, the work of the
late Senator Duffus was not limited to his
own community. I take this opportunity to
speak of the great developmental work now
being carried on by his son, who has settled
in the district of Terrace in the northwestern
part of British Columbia. He is a very highly
regarded citizen in that community, and I
know he will be pleased, as will the other
members of the family, to read the kind
words that have been said here today in
tribute to his father, the late Senator Duffus.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, in paying tribute to the memory of
Senator Duffus I think it hardly necessary
to mention the fact that he was of Irish
ancestry. He was a kind man, he was a
friendly man. Those of us who know a little
about his career know at least that he was a
most versatile man. As has been said by the
honourable Leader of the Government, the
honourable Leader of the Opposition and
other honourable senators, our late colleague
had a wide variety of interests. He described
himself as a farmer, a businessman, and a
builder. I think if we remember him more
as a builder than anything else we will have
the key to his career.
It is unnecessary to say to those who knew
Senator Duffus well that he had a distinguished military career, and that he was very
proud of his association with the armed
forces. One had only to look at his erect
carriage to appreciate how proud he was of
that part of his life's work. It is interesting
and perhaps of some historic significance to
recall that he was one of the members of the
Canadian contingent sent to Britain on the
occasion of the Coronation of Edward VII.
As the senior senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) has said, perhaps the greatest
contribution of our late colleague was in the

FEBRUARY 7, 1957
realm of public affairs, at almost all levels of
public life in Canada. He served his city
as alderman, as mayor, and as school trustee,
and he worked in sports organizations, farm
groups and other community associations. In
the 1930's he was most active in the political
work of his province, and finally succeeded
in winning a federal seat as member for
Peterborough.
There was versatility in his career, and
more than that. It was another parliamentarian of Irish ancestry, by the name of
Edmund Burke, who said:
Certainly it ought to be the happiness and glory
of a representative to live in the strictest union,
the closest correspondence and the most unreserved
communicaion with his constituents.
That, I think, was very true of the public
career of Senator Duffus.
He was a Christian gentleman, a sincere
and devoted son of his church and an exemplary family man.
I think his high sense of public service is
not only a credit to the people from whom he
sprang but it is a record which will be a
source of pride, and, too, of inspiration for
his family and the people with whom he was
associated.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, it is impossible for me to add to the
eloquent tributes that have already been paid
to the late Senator Duffus, but I feel impelled to say something because I knew him
for so long. I joined with him in the election of 1926, when I visited Peterborough
at his invitation, and the two of us addressed
the electors in a small hall in that city. He
was then a young man and I was impressed
with his vigour, the activity of his mind, his
public interest, and the vital thought he had
for the welfare of his fellow men, particularly
in his home community. I had known him
prior to that time for I do not know how
long, and it was my attendance at various
public functions with him which led to my
going to Peterborough on that occasion.
I followed his career ever since, and while
it is not necessary to go into detail I can
say that I admired his energy, his vigour
and his constant efforts in the public interest.
In these later years we were colleagues in
this house and very close friends.
And so, without attempting to add to the
tributes that have already been paid, may
I say that I join in them and I extend to
his family my most sincere sympathy.
Hon. William H. Golding: Honourable senators, I would not like to let this opportunity
pass by without saying a word in reference
to our late colleague Senator Duffus.
I remember very well when he came into
the House of Commons, in 1935. He was a

kindly man and we became very good friends.
I got to know him exceptionally well. I knew
what he thought about the problems of the
country, of his church, and of the people
generally. He was a real friend in the true
sense of the word to the farmers of this
country: to every organization that was doing
anything for the farmers he was always ready
and willing to give his time and energy.
I always had a very high regard for Senator
Duffus in every way. He was a really sound,
sensible, Christian gentleman.
I wish to join with other honourable senators in extending sincere sympathy to the
bereaved family.
Hon. James P. McIntyre: Honourable senators, this was the first intimation I had of
the death of our colleague Senator Duffus.
I sat with him here for the last fourteen years.
I knew him intimately, and the longer I knew

him the better I liked him.
I distinctly remember one occasion when I
met him, quite accidentally, in Montreal.
I said, "Joe, where are you going?" He replied, "I am going to the Royal Victoria
Hospital for a check up." Then he asked,
"Where are you going?" I said, "My wife and
I are going to Boston." In the course of
conversation I told him that I had had different check-ups, at the Royal Victoria Hospital, in Montreal, and at the Leahy Clinic in
Boston, and I explained to him what they
did at the Leahy Clinic. On the spur of
the moment he cancelled his reservation at
the Royal Victoria Hospital and, although I
did not try to influence him in any way, the
next morning he was on the train with me
going to Boston. On the way there he
casually remarked, "I have no American
money and I don't know how I will be able
to get along."
I said, "Joe, I have some
American money and I will share it with
you." I gave him half of what I had. I did
not see him for a year after that, but I
received a cheque for the amount, plus the
exchange.
Senator Joseph Duffus was a real gentleman, and I know that in saying this I am
expressing the sentiment of every honourable
senator in this chamber. I join with honourable members in extending sincere sympathy
to his bereaved wife and family.

were some who wondered why. A few, of
course, concluded that, like all Nova Scotians,
I am shy, unassuming and inarticulate. I
confess to possessing some if not all of these
virtues.
Actually, however, there were
other reasons why I had nothing to say, and
among them are these. I am, in a sense, a
fugitive from the legislative life of this
country. I came into a chamber that was
almost entirely unknown to me. I recall
having been advised by many of my Scotch
associates of other years that sometimes one
is given credit for a wisdom one does not
possess if one merely remains silent; and I
thought perhaps there was something worth
while in that advice. Actually I wanted to
familiarize myself more clearly with the procedures and the activities of this chamber
before saying anything. Now, however, the
period of incubation is over, and so I inflict
myself upon you, with your tolerance, for
a brief period.
Before coming to the Senate I, in common
with many other Canadians, knew very little
about the activities of this chamber. I was
aware, of course, of its purpose and function,
but as to its activities I had only a superficial
knowledge; and, frankly, I wondered what
awaited me here. I want to say to you at
the very outset that I have been pleasantly
surprised.
To commence with, and in common with
other recently appointed members of this
chamber, I was received here with great
kindness. Nowhere over the years have I
encountered a finer reception. You may be
interested if I tell you what, in addition, I
discovered in this Senate of Canada. I found
here men and women who were postgraduates
from almost every sphere of human activityfrom the professions, from labour, from
business, from the educational life of Canada;
and I found in them assets not possessed by
too many people in any other legislative
bodies across this continent. I found that
these assets had been sharpened by experiSPEECH FROM THE THRONE

When, throughout the last session, I sat to be presumptuous, I must say that in this
as mute as the harp on Tara's walls, there regard I have found a very serious deficiency.

FEBRUARY 7, 1957
I have sat in this chamber day after day,
having regard occasionally to the galleries at
both ends, and have seen very few in the
visitors' gallery, and an almost complete absence of the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate
who inform the people of Canada as to what
goes on in this capital city. I wondered why.
Without meaning to assess blame, my conclusion was this, that possibly, and probably,
the fault rested with the Senate itself, largely
because it has never endeavoured to secure a
measure of the public relations that this great
body is entitled to.
So I venture today to propose or to suggest
that we of this body should seriously consider
setting up a committee on public relations.
I know it would have to be an unofficial body;
but the good that it could do is beyond my
power to describe. It would be able, for
example, to convey to the people of Canada
the mission of the Senate, the part that it
plays in the public administrative process of
Canada, and to properly inform the people of
this country, not too many of whom read
Who's Who or similar publications, as to the
personnel that occupies the seats in this
august assembly. I urge very seriously upon
the Senate the advisability of setting up a
committee of the sort to which I have just
referred.
I am reminded too of something that to
me, and to many here, is of particular importance. For the first time since Confederation
the Atlantic provinces have a majority representation in a federal legislature. Whereas
each of the great provinces of Quebec and
Ontario is restricted to representation by 24
senators and the four great western provinces
combined are limited to the same number, the
four Atlantic provinces are entitled to a total
of 30 senators. I think that imposes upon
those of us who come from the Atlantic
region a very definite duty and responsibility.
Some time in the future I shall hope to discuss that matter more fully and, perhaps,
point to the manner in which this representation can be made effective for the benefit of
the people of that region.
I have no right to speak for Newfoundland,
Prince Edward Island or New Brunswick, for
there are men and women in this chamber
more competent than I to discuss the aims,
the responsibilities and the rights of those
provinces. I will perhaps be pardoned, then,
if I confine my remarks almost exclusively
to matters concerning the little province in
which I was born, Nova Scotia. I hope that
you will grant me this privilege and that at
the same time you will not think that this is
a partisan or sectional speech or that it
smacks of wailing and lamentation, for that
is not my purpose.nor my intention. My sole

purpose and intention is to say a few words
for my section of this great country where,
as is generally known, the economy is not
up to the standard of the average Canadian
economy.
Let me say, then, as kindly but as firmly
as possible, that Nova Scotia and Nova
Scotians are not looking for charity. They
are not looking for anything they do not
deserve, and if I am, as I am, a poor spokesman for that delightful province, you will at
least concede me that its people are not
looking for anything that is not justly deserved. The people of Nova Scotia are, in
the main, as competent and as industrious
as any other people in Canada. If they have
suffered more acutely than others because of
their partnership in the Canadian Confederacy
it has not in any degree made them less proud
of their Canadianism; for search as you will
throughout the length and breadth of this
country you will not find many people with
a greater concept of nationhood than you
will find on the little peninsula that I call
home.
If, on occasion, we lift our voices to complain of existing inequities and to suggest
remedies which will enable us to participate
more fully in the nationhood of Canada, it
is because we believe the Canadian people
desire us to.share more fully in the national
growth of this country, and also because we
believe that the stronger we in Nova Scotia
become in the economic sense-and what
applies to us, applies also to the other less
well-off provinces-the greater the Canada
of the future will be.
Honourable senators, lately we have heard
a great deal and read just as much about the
preliminary report of the Royal Commission
on Canada's Economic Prospects. Like all
such documents, it has evoked praise and
criticism. I admit quite freely that my own
reaction to it is one of mixed feelings. However, I question the ability of mere men to

peer into the future.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): There
are no gods among us, and, as we all know,
there has not been a prophet upon the face
of the earth for many centuries past. However, certain evidences. of faith in that fallacy
are perhaps somewhat offset by the reasoned
logic of other sections of the report, and we
would be wise, I think, to reserve full judgment until the complete report has been laid
before us.
The references to the Atlantic region,
however, are such that no one from that
section of Canada can afford to pass them
by without comment of some kind. I should
like to point out that the Gordon Commission

SENATE
was a fact-finding body. It is unfortunate,
therefore, that it fell into the realm of fortune
telling. It cost us a lot of money to have
our palms crossed. It is even more unfortunate that although a special section of
the preliminary report is devoted to the
Atlantic provinces, the best decision the commission could arrive at with respect to the
far eastern section of Canada was this-and
I shall read from the report itself:
What is required is a positive and comprehensive
approach to the problems of the Atlantic region.
With this as the objective, it is suggested that the
people of Canada as a whole might be willing to
assist the people of the Atlantic provinces in discovering, developing and making the best use of
resources in that area.

It says "might be willing".
continues:

The report

If it should turn out that there is not the
necessary combination of resources in sufficient
quantities to permit a substantial rise in living
standards in the Atlantic region, generous assistance
should be given to those people who might wish
to move to other parts of Canada where there may
be greater opportunities.

And here a note of sanity pervades the
atmosphere:
But even if assistance is provided for those people
who might be willing to move elsewhere, many
people undoubtedly would prefer to remain where
they are, despite the handicaps referred to.

That is a profound conclusion. The report
continues:
People who so choose should at the same time
be prepared to accept a different kind of life, or
certainly life at a different tempo, and lower levels
of income, though not necessarily a lower standard
of living in its broadest sense, than people in
ertain other parts of Canada.

Honourable senators, I have tried hard
to look upon this recommendation with a
tolerant eye, but I must say that I have no
alternative other than to believe that what
is proposed for the people of the Atlantic
provinces by this much talked about report
is something in the nature of an economic
concentration camp. It is hardly flattering
to the people involved and it is no more
flattering to the authority in this country which
was responsible for the setting up of this
royal commission.
Honourable senators, this commission which
could easily peer into the future for 25
years to determine the trend of the whole
Canadian economy, could not see 25 minutes,
even 25 seconds ahead in the case of the
people of the Atlantic region. Help them
if you like, it says in effect to the people
of Canada, but if there is nothing there,
bonus them to move out. It is a most lamentable document and one to which the people
of the country where I live will not take
kindly.
I would remind the commission that humans
are members of the upper animal kingdom

and not the lower animal kingdom; that it
might be possible to move cattle and pigs
in mass migration, but certainly not the people
of a free country, and certainly not the
people of Nova Scotia. It is true that we
have a little province with an economy which
does not compare with other sections of
Canada, because nature was not so kind to
us, but we have in that province the descendants of those who succeeded the original
inhabitants.
Our people in Nova Scotia are of English,
French, Scottish, Irish, and Hanoverian
ancestry. I should have put the French
first, because they came there first. However, that is the sturdy stock that is now represented in Nova Scotia. The foreign population, as it is generally called, is negligible.
I want to stress that in our province the
people, whether Christian or Jew, are first
Nova Scotians, and that nothing short of
a giant tidal wave could ever dislodge them
from their habitations. Certainly, honourable
senators, nothing in the nature of a report
from the Gordon Commission, or any other
commission, could do so. These people have
their roots deep in the soil. There they are,
and there they will remain. I trust we
shall have no more nonsense about this business of migration. If there is a desire to
help, let it reflect itself in the application
of the remedies that are needed to cure our
economic ills.
Honourable senators, I had resolved to be
as dispassionate in a discussion of this
matter as have been my honourable confrères who spoke before me. However, I
have strayed from the path. I shall therefore endeavour to get back to what may be
regarded as near normalcy.
My purpose in speaking is to propose
several things which in my opinion, if entered
into without loss of time, will greatly
improve the economy of Nova Scotia and dissipate any possibility of mass migration.
The first that comes to my mind is one of
the great national natural assets of that
province, namely, the Port of Halifax. Some
may think that the Port of Halifax is a
parochial issue, and some may assume that
the improvement of the port could only
benefit the city of Halifax. May I point out
that a goodly part of the economy of Nova
Scotia is dependent on the prosperity of
the Port of Halifax. Not only the people of
that city would benefit, but virtually everybody with a livelihood to make. In fact, almost everybody who is in business derives
some measure of benefit from a successful
Port of Halifax.
Honourable senators, prior to 1867 Halifax
caught the attention of the Canadians of that
day, who recognized it as one of the great

FEBRUARY 7, 1957
natural harbours of the world; they saw in
it an escape route for the people of the
central sections of this country, in the event
of war; they pictured Atlantic liners operating almost like a ferry service from Liverpool to Halifax, and vice versa, as against
the utterance of Joseph Howe, the Nova
Scotian who said that entry into Confederation would result in grass growing in the
street. Well, there is no doubt about the
value of the Port of Halifax, and there never
has been any doubt as to its importance in
the national interest during times of war.
May I remind honourable senators that
Halifax is the only city in Canada that has
seen war at first hand, because upon the
shores of that city, and upon the shores of
the little peninsula of Nova Scotia, there
were washed the first dead of World War 1,
and also of World War II. From that great
national Port of Halifax in this New World
there were sent out to the rescue of the Old
World large convoys of men, munitions and
foodstuffs. One day I flew out over a 92ship convoy, and I wish I could describe to
you the operations necessary, after the
opening of the gates, by aircraft and torpedo
destroyers, and the scope of motion required
by these 92 ships, with the tankers in the
middle and the ships three abreast. They
were not expendable. If the gas or petrol
had not gone to the other side disastrous
consequences might have fallen upon us.
The Port of Halifax was vital in time of
war. Is it to be virtually abandoned in time
of peace? Well, for the past few weeks
ships have been lying at anchor in the harbour of Halifax, unable to find piers or
berthing facilities, because they are not
available. Some may say this is only an
occasional occurrence, but that is a type of
retrogressive thinking that has operated for
years against the economy of the Atlantic
Region; it is the sort of thing that, on the
part of officials of Government, can do more
harm than many sessions of Parliament can
repair. I say to you, honourable senators,
that if the real potential of the Port of
Halifax is to be realized facilities must be
provided for the shipping of the world that
wants to use the port.
Halifax, or Nova Scotia, does not own the
Port of Halifax any more; the city and province lost its ownership some years ago when
the National Harbours Board was set up. The
port is entirely in the hands of an organization that is the result of a statute. I make no
criticism of its membership, for it is composed
of worthy members, who act according to
their lights, but my criticism is that they do
not see clearly or accurately or far enough
ahead. I think that long ago they should
have envisaged the potentiality of the Port

of Halifax and secured options in the north
and in the south from one point to the other
so that a giant sea wall with proper facilities
could be built to extend from Pier 9 in the
north end to Pier 20 in the south end. I urge
that immediate attention be given to this,
and I do not mean that in the sense in which
it is usually applied. I do not mean that the
matter should be taken under advisement or
that it should be given careful consideration,
because those terms are used nauseously. I
ask them to appreciate the fact that simply
because the harbour is in Nova Scotia it is
not withdrawn from the Canadian economy,
and further that the facilities the port so
badly needs will have to be provided if the
potential of this great harbour is to be
realised.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): I pass
on to point number 2. I note, as no doubt
all honourable members of this chamber have
done, that the provisions of the Maritime
Freight Rates Act have been under discussion
for some time. The news in that connection is
tempered, however, by the fact that according to the newspapers-and I do not profess
to know if they are correct-the intent is
merely to arrange the present subsidies now
existent so as to put more emphasis on transport of goods outside the province rather than
between provinces. There is some merit in
the scheme, but I suggest that by logical
reasoning it does not go far enough. The
Atlantic manufacturer who wants to sell in
the central Canadian markets is at a great
disadvantage because freight rates to these
parts, where the centres of loading anld population are, make it impossible for him to
compete there. He requires not only a rearrangement of the present subsidies, but also
I speak collectively now-a much
-and
greater additional subsidy to remove the
existing differential.
I do not blame the railways for increasing
freight rates. I sometimes question the wisdom of the Maritime Board of Trade in
paying for expensive legal representation at
hearings of applications by the railways for
increased freight rates. The railways are in
business for profit, and I see no reason why
they should not get an equitable return for
carrying freight to any part of the country.
But, honourable senators, the Government of
Canada is the agency which should not allow
any section of the country to be victimized
by freight rates. That is the position in
which we in the Maritimes find ourselves
today. We hear a good deal said about the
unity of Canada with respect to race and
religion. But there is another relationship,
which perhaps is just as important, namely,

SENATE

economic unity. Canada can never achieve
real greatness while only three or four
provinces are prosperous and the other six
or seven live on a hit or miss basis.
Another field in which assistance can be
given is that of tariffs. I suggest that there
should be a complete examination by the
Tariff Board, or some other responsible body,
to determine which tariffs bear too heavily
and unjustly upon the Atlantic area and to
propose remedies to correct such a situation.
I recall that several years ago a Nova Scotian
manufacturer was endeavouring to expand
his markets to Quebec and Ontario. He made
a product, and still does, that compares very
favourably with any made in this country.
Because of tariff restrictions he was compelled to purchase the containers for his
product from manufacturers in central Canada. He paid freight on the containers to
Halifax, and when he shipped his product
he again paid freight on the containers from
Halifax to points in Quebec and Ontario.
Imagine his chagrin when he discovered that
the manufacturers of the containers had zoned
an area in Quebec and Ontario within which
they absorbed the freight rates, but they
declined to extend that service to the customer
in Halifax. Under such circumstances how
can an eastern manufacturer hope to compete?
I am no lover of tariffs. I concede, however,
that there may be circumstances under which
they are necessary. But this I should like to
say: When the Goverment of Canada lays
down a tariff, the full benefit of that tariff
should apply to all the people of Canada and
not to a certain few only. An examination of
the tariff structure would perhaps reveal
many inequities which, if corrected, would
greatly assist the Maritime economy.
Now honourable senators, I corne to my
final point, that of risk capital. We in Nova
Scotia are not a wealthy people. One of the
reasons why we have what might be called
a backward economy is the lack of risk
capital. The Government of the day is at the
present time endeavouring to propagate a
scheme by which it would match dollar for
dollar of risk capital put up by any agency
within the province. This scheme would assist
persons already in business, and enable
those who desire to get into business to do so.
It indicates the extremity in which we find
ourselves.
When the Industrial Development Bank
was set up some years ago we had hopes that
it was the answer to our problem. But what
a great disappointment we met with. I have
in my hand the annual report of that bank
for the year 1956, and on the flyleaf I read
this:
Whereas it is desirable to establish an industrial
development bank to pronote the econornic welfare
of Canada by increasing the effectiveness
of
monetary action through ensuring the avallability

of

credit to industrial enterprises which may
reasonably be expected to prove successful if a
high level of national income and employment is
maintained, by supplementing the activities of other
lenders and by providing capital assistance to
industry with particular consideration te the
financing problems of small enterprises . . .

As I say, we regarded this bank as a ray

of hope. Here, we thought, was a bank set up
by a wise Government, which recognized
that certain disabilities exist in some sections
of Canada which do not obtain elsewhere,
and authorized the bank to assist the economy
of those areas which need assistance. Now,
there is nothing wrong with the intent and
purpose of the Industrial Development Bank,
as exemplified by the act under which it was
set up, but there is a great deal wrong with
its operations. Its operations parallel those
of the chartered banks so closely that it fails
to provide worthwhile assistance to those
sections of Canada where it is badly needed.
In reading the report of the bank I note
that it points with pride, and perhaps justifiably so, to the fact that it had a profit last
year of $1,322,210, and that its reserve fund
While there is
now stands at $8,706,000.
nothing wrong with making money, I submit
that was not the intent of the Government
which set up this bank. The thought behind
it was that this organization would do a job
for people scattered throughout many sections
of the country who now find themselves unable to finance their needs because of the
rigid regulations of the standard banks. This
financial institution seemed to signify a return to the old-fashioned system of credit,
when a man's record and competency were
the determining factors. But not so.
Lastly, as a means of implementing the
Atlantic economy, I suggest a redrafting of
the Industrial Development Bank Act, so
as to make risk capital available where it is
most urgently needed, in the less prosperous
provinces of Canada. I suggest further that
the redraft be so clearly and explicitly
worded that nothing will be left to the interpretation of well-meaning but unknowing
officials who, unwittingly, ofttimes do more
harm than many sessions of Parliament can
repair.
Honourable senators, you have been most
indulgent. If I have spoken with undue
feeling I hope you will attribute it to the
fact that, like you, I am very fond of the
province of my birth and of its people. I do
not argue that the people of Nova Scotia are
greater than those of any other part of
Canada. But to me they have a sweetness
and a charm that are unexcelled. They have
a way of life which they would not exchange
for all the material things the world could
offer them. I would not be happy if I had
to live too long away from that little
peninsula.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate continued from Thursday, February 7, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bois,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops), for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I sometimes think that honourable senators
may be amazed, because of my limited ability to express myself, that I persist on occasions of this kind in presenting my views,
but I believe that, in the light of the gravity
of world conditions today and of the state
of things even in our own country, it is a
duty to give voice to one's ideas and beliefs.
At the outset I would add my congratulations to those offered to the honourable
gentlemen who moved and seconded the
Address. When I read the remarks of the
honourable senator from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Bois) I recognized at once his deep knowledge of and interest in farmers and farming. We expected, of course, a great deal
from the honourable senator from Kamloops
(Hon. Mr. Smith), because he spent some 20
years in the great province from which I
come, and we were not disappointed.
A great problem, if not the main one before the Canadian people today, is inflation.
There is much difference of opinion about
the right course to follow, and frankly I am
not at all satisfied that the action which is
being taken is doing anything other than
penalizing small businessmen and farmers.
I cannot see that it bas had the smallest

157

preventive effect. Inflation is with us, and
without it probably we could not cope with
our enormous public debt. But the pouring
forth of statistics concerning our gross national product and the great prosperity it
supposedly indicates does not impress me;
such figures are no more than a house of
cards. We read in the press that purchases
on credit-in which I do not include mortgages on homes and industrial buildingshave risen to nearly three billions of dollars;
they have doubled in the last few years. The
other evening someone told me that a friend
of his who holds a position in one of our
largest retail outlets was approached by a
man who asked for a credit of $500. He
did not think that the applicant was entitled
to it, so he took him to the manager. The
manager's comment was: "Well, we might as
well give it to him. If we don't, somebody
else will."
When is all this debt going to be paid?
That is what alarms me. It may be argued
that more people own their own homes than
ever before, but how many of them have
barely been able to scrape together the down
payment and will be paying the balance over
the next thirty years? However, if economic
conditions change and these people become
unemployed, I suppose the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation will take the
attitude that it is better to have its buildings
occupied than empty, whether or not it receives any revenue from them.
I have been very much interested in the
many fine speeches that have been made
during this debate. I was particularly impressed by the remarks of the honourable
senator from Halifax North (Hon. Mr. Connolly). I also enjoyed those of the honourable senators from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) and Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies),
and of course we always enjoy hearing the
honourable gentleman from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid).
We all prefer to talk on subjects about
which we have a special knowledge, and the
seconder of the motion for the Address, the
honourable senator from Kamloops (Hon.
Mr. Smith), spoke about Canada's motorists
and truckers, stating that they pay a very
large proportion of taxes at municipal, provincial and federal levels. When I left western
Canada this winter the administrative
officers of the villages, towns and cities out
there were seriously considering the imposition of a special automobile tax. It is
almost impossible for these small communities to borrow money because of the
high rate of interest, and on top of this
they are faced everywhere with rising administrative costs. Among other things, they
have to pay for police and fire protection,

SENATE

and maintenance of the highways leading
in and out of their localities. It seems to
me that a special automobile tax may be
the only solution to their problem. When
I was reeve of my municipality I argued
many times with the provincial government
authorities that a larger share of the motor
vehicle licence revenue should be paid to
the municipalities to assist them in meeting
their administrative costs. However, up to
the present time that has not been done.
The honourable senator from Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) expressed alarm at
our highway traffic death toll. Hardly a day
goes by but we read about somebody being
killed on the highways. Automobile manufacturers change their car designs every year
in order to sell their products, and they keep
making the cars wider, lower and more
powerful. The law in most of our provinces
imposes a speed limit of fifty miles an hour,
so why in the world do these manufacturers
produce cars of 250 horsepower or more and
capable of going well over a hundred miles
an hour? It seems to me that only police
cars should be geared for these higher
speeds. Recently I read that two youths
were chased by a police car at a speed of
100 miles an hour through a settled community. It was only a miracle that somebody
was not killed. It is the height of folly
that something is not done to curb speeding
on our streets and highways. The TransCanada Highway near Brandon, Manitoba,
has a slight curve but the road is wide
enough for four vehicles to pass abreast.
One night last fall five oil men in one car,
and a man and his wife in another, were
involved in a collision. All were killed
instantly except the father of the four
children and he was so seriously injured that
he spent a long time in hospital and probably
will never be well again. No one was able
to explain the cause of the accident but
someone told me that the speedometer of
one car registeeied 80 miles per hour. There
was some evidence, therefore, that it had
been travelling at a terrific rate of speed.
Honourable senators, something was said
by both honourable leaders of this house
about reform of the Senate. I was grateful
to the Prime Minister for the appointment to
this house of our dear friend the late Senator
Hackett, and I deeply regret he was with us
for only a very short time. If the people are
to have confidence in this chamber, I think
there should be a rule of law that at least 25
per cent of its members must belong to a
different political party than that of the
majority. Of course, I know there are outstanding examples of men of independent
thought here. I recall that on at least two
occasions, and on one occasion in particular,

I was instrumental in asking for a vote.
There had been a rumour that two independents were appointed to this chamber,
and I was somewhat curious to find out just
how independent they were. On those occasions there was an absolutely faithful vote
along party lines, just as faithful as if this
had been an elective chamber; it was a vote,
as the saying is, at the "crack of the whip".
That is scarcely good enough for the Senate.
I think that if my suggestion were followed
the people of Canada would have greater
confidence in this chamber.
I made a few notes on matters I have
spoken about on previous occasions, and one
is the opportunity a senator bas in a debate
of this kind to say something about the conditions in his own province. In the province
of Saskatchewan we have about half of all
the agricultural land in the dominion. We
are, so to speak, in the centre of the prairies.
The Alberta farmers have an advantage over
us, as a great deal of shipping now goes to
the Pacific coast; and compared with the
Manitoba farmer, we have a longer haul on
shipments to the east; so on shipments to
the west and to the east we are under a
handicap because we have to pay extra
freight. It seems as though a determined
effort is made to place my province in the
position of the poor relation, for besides having to pay higher freight rates we receive
lower prices for our cream, butter, hogs and
other produce.
Now, our great hope in Saskatchewan was
that we would be able to use the Hudson Bay
route for shipping wheat. The British millers
who recently made a trip here said they
would prefer to buy wheat through Churchill
because they got a better grade at lower cost.
But how do we in Saskatchewan benefit by
that arrangement? Notwithstanding the fact
that all down through the years we have
received less for our grain than the Manitoba
farmers have, the Wheat Board now prices
wheat at ten cents a bushel higher through
Churchill. But they put that extra ten cents
into the kitty and we get no benefit from it.
The Minister of Trade and Commerce in a
speech he made some time ago said that
about 17 million bushels was the limit that
could be shipped through Churchill. Now,
that is not a fact. There is no limit short
of 100 million bushels, as long as there are
adequate storage facilities and the ships will
come in there. I have talked to the captains
of some ships myself, and I know they like
to come to that port. Of course it is not
easy to secure shipping through Churchill
because of the problem of getting inbound
cargo. But I believe a great deal of the
materials which go into the building of the
pipe lines in western Canada could come as

FEBRUARY 12, 1957
ballast from England, where there is at
present one of the best markets for our
grain and other products.
I have in my hand an article, headed "Big
Boost for Grain Elevators" which appeared
recently in the Montreal Gazette and clearly
indicates the attitude of the businessmen of
that city to competition from Churchill. It
reads:
Grain storage space in Montreal harbour will be at
least one-third greater by 1958 than it is today,
it was announced yesterday. The increase will
toost the port's capacity to more than 20,000,000
bushels and a possibility exists that even more
space may be added later at downriver ports.
E. J. Desrosiers, Jr., president of the Montreal
Corn Exchange Association, said "the news is
welcomed as evidence that Montreal will continue
to retain its dominant position as a grain shipping
port".
He told the group's annual meeting that a
1,500,000-bushel addition will be made to Elevator B.
Elevator 3 will be enlarged to handle another
4,000,000 bushels, as well.
Despite problems at the start of the navigation
season last year, 118,000,000 bushels of grain passed
through Montreal, compared to 83,000,000 bushels
during 1955.
More would have been handled had 16,000,000
bushels not been routed £rom Churchill, Manitoba,
Mr. Desrosiers said. That movement established
a new record and was made at the expense of St.
Lawrence River ports. Present bookings indicate
the Churchill movement will be even greater this
year.

I can understand the concern on the part
of those persons who are interested in the
shipment of grain through Montreal, but I
say we in Saskatchewan are entitled to some
consideration.
Some difficulty is being experienced by the
farmers of western Canada in the marketing
Farmers in the east who
of livestock.
specialize in the growing of, for instance,
sugar beets and tomatoes supply canneries
under contract. I believe even the tobacco
growers today have a guaranteed quota on
which they are assured a ready market at
a fixed price. But the farmers in western
Canada have none of these benefits. We hear
it said that we should go into hogs or beef
cattle. But it takes time and a lot of money
to develop that type of farming. True, our
hogs and beef cattle are not as perishable as
tomatoes and sugar beets, but unless there is
a ready and profitable market for the livestock it can ruin a farmer just as quickly as
perishable products can. I believe the time
will come when the farmer who raises feeders
for beef will have to adopt standard business
practice, and have a contract with the packer
to take his stock at a fixed price. With such
an assured market he could go to his bank
and make his financial arrangements beforehand as business people do. But as the situation now exists the position of the farmer is
so uncertain that he cannot make his commitments beforehand.

The Speech from the Throne said the
Senate would be asked to set up a committee
to study land use, and the committee has
now been appointed. Well, honourable senators, I hope it may be able to make some
helpful recommendations. But I am not one
of those who favour big farms. I see by a
recent news item that some of the prominent
and more prosperous farmers of Ontario
agree with my thought, that it would be a
sorry day for Canada if her small farms were
absorbed by bigger farmers carrying on large
single operations. I believe that only certain
sections of the Prairies are ideally suited for
that type of farming. Even in the great
northern part of the Prairies, where there has
been heavy production of livestock and some
grain grown, the people favour the modestsized, family farm.
I think we in Canada are drifting toward
the wrong idea that money represents wealth.
More and more people have come to think
that if you make a lot of money, and so
increase the standard of living, that constitutes wealth. I say this whole concept of
wealth is entirely wrong. During the remarks
of the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in this debate, I posed
the question of why it was that full-scale
inflation did not ruin Germany. As yet no
one has given me a complete answer to that
question, not even a professor of economics
in one of our largest universities. However,
I think the answer in part at least is found
in the frame of mind of the people of that
country. Certainly we found during the
Second World War how vicious the human
being can be. But all the viciousness was
not confined to Germans. What about the
Russians, and the unearthing of some
thousand Polish officers?
I come back to my proposition, that the
real wealth of a country is the character of
its people, and their ability and willingness
to work. I have not the slightest fear for the
future generations of Canada, for my children
or my grandchildren, just so long as we do
not entirely destroy or give away our natural
resources. Our country abounds in natural
wealth, but paper money is not wealth at all.
So, the question stands: how was Germany
able to survive inflation and at the same time
very nearly defeat the whole world? Besides
that, she is today in the act of tearing down
old and ruined buildings and replacing them
with structures of glass and steel, and constructing one of the finest highways the
world has known.
Italy too has done great things. If Canada
and other members of the League of Nations
had taken the action that then should have
been taken we might never have had a Mussolini, or a Hitler, either. But these dictators

SENATE
were allowed to go their own way and the
league broke down. I wonder if we are
witnessing a similar breaking-down at the
United Nations today.
On this question of what constitutes wealth,
I would say that we are barking up the
wrong tree entirely. The honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) told us an
interesting story of the training he received
as a young man. Well, I can tell a bit of
personal history too regarding training that
I received as a boy on a farm 50 or 60 miles
from this city. The school we went to was
located a mile and a half from our home. One
day my father bought some little pigs from
a farmer a mile and a half the other side of
the school, and my younger brother and I
were told to go and pick up these little
porkies after school. We had brought with us
to school that morning jute bags-we call
them sacks in western Canada-to carry the
pigs home in. I may say we had horses that
could have been used to do this chore, but
it was considered good training for youngsters. The farmer took us to the pen where
the pigs were, and when I saw the little
fellows I asked "Which one can I have?"
He said, "Take any one you like," so I immediately pointed to the biggest one, which
would pass as a bacon-type today. When he
saw the one I picked out he said, "You littie
scoundrel, you are taking the best pig I've
got". Eventually we landed the pigs in the
sacks and started for home, through the
woods. A bad thunderstorm came up, and
my brother was having a hard time handling
his bag, it was almost touching the ground.
I wasn't any better off, and I was thinking that I should have taken a little lighter
pig, because it felt pretty heavy before we
had gone the three miles. Back home my
mother was uneasy and anxious, knowing
that we were out in the storm, but everything
turned out all right. I just wanted to mention
that incident by way of showing the mighty
good training we got. I honour my father for
having taught us to work.
The other day the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) seemed to question the statement by the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that our production costs are high. Well, every manufacturer in the country is complaining that
our costs are too high for us to compete in
the export market. I read an article in the
B.C. Lumberman which stated that labour
and other costs are so high that the export
market for lumber is being curtailed. And
high costs are restricting the domestic market for some products. I read in the press
the other day that Italian textiles are being
sold in Canada at low prices and making

heavy inroads into the Canadian market, thus
adversely affecting the output of Canadian
textile mills. So serious has the situation
become that even the President of the United
States said that he may possibly be forced to
set wage levels in order to avoid a recession
or depression. And no less a person than
former President Hoover made a statement
recently to the effect that conditions today
looked to him very much like those of 1929,
and he remarked that he would not like to
see them return for he did not want to go
through another depression like that of the
early thirties. Honourable senators, I only
hope that my fears as to what may happen
are not well founded.
Now I want to say something about the
Trans-Canada Pipe Line. How is it that we
always seem to be so ready and willing to
give away our heritage? As I remarked last
year, there is no safer place for our oil and
gas than where it is, in the ground, and it
must always be remembered that these are
wasting resources or wasting assets. Perhaps I will not see it, but our children will
no doubt see the last of these wasting natural
resources of oil and gas. Honourable senators no doubt read the figures published in a
recent bulletin put out by the Bank of Nova
Scotia on the amount of oil reserves in the
world, and showing that reserves in Canada
amounted to a mere one per cent of the total.
In spite of the fact that the production
of oil and gas in Canada is steadily increasing, it seems strange, now that all farmers
are equipped with gasoline-burning machines,
that the oil companies should decide to raise
the price of their products one cent a gallon.
As a matter of fact, the prices of their
products have been going up one cent a
gallon occasionally of late. Diesel fuel and
all other fuels are increasing in price, and
there is no justification for that other than
the fact that these people have control of
the situation and are going to exercise that
control.
The Calgary Albertan ran an article
recently pointing out that Canada should
receive a price higher than 25.8 cents per
thousand cubic feet for its natural gas delivered at the United States border, and
suggested we could get more than 30 cents.
There was some difficulty about financing
the project and the company had to renegotiate the contract. The renegotiation took
the form of asking the Alberta gas producers
to take a lower price for their gas at the
wellhead, and it was said that if they did
not the pipe line could not be financed.
Honourable senators, I still maintain that the
whole undertaking could have been accomplished by the use of Canadian money. This,

FEBRUARY

in part, is what the Calgary Albertan said
in its issue of January 11:
It bas not been explained why Trans-Canada
renewed its 25.8 cent contract with Tennessee
without exploring the chance of getting a better
price.

No doubt in due course the pipe Une will
be moving natural gas to the market in
Montreal and Ottawa. But when this is done,
there will be something else to consider:
what about the people in those cities who
are now engaged in supplying wood, coal and
other fuels for heating purposes? The sale
of western gas in eastern Canada is bound
to affect them.
I know that in the northern half of Saskatchewan thousands of farmers would be
in a much better position today if they had
continued to farm with horses, and I am
sure the same thing is true of many farmers
in other parts of Canada. My own boys may
not agree with me, but I know that my farm
was operated at less expense and I grew
more grain when I used horses on the farm
than since I started using a tractor.
I would like to point out that farmers are
buying distillate oil and other fuel to run
their farm machinery with, but if more
horses were in use on prairie farms they
could be fed our coarse grains and to a
great degree that would solve the problem
of what to do with our feed grains. To clear
some of the land on the prairie a great deal
of money and hard work is required. I
refer to some of the low-placed land which
at one time was covered with bush, but later
on prairie fires burnt the tops off the bush and
the willow roots remained, and that made it
a hard proposition to clear that land for cultivation. Working with horses, these clumps
of roots can be cut through and broken up,
but with a tractor this is not possible. Other
objections to the tractor are the high initial
price and the cost of keeping it in repair.
I have here a report of a very interesting
address presented at the Light Horse Show
in Calgary, and circulated over the radio.
It states:
Horses did most of the heavy slugging in converting this mid-west to farms-of course they did.
Now, they seem to have lost the place of essential
importance they once enjoyed-but they haven't
lost their friends and admirers. At the annual
Rangemen's Banquet at Calgary in July the toast
of the evening was to the Cowboy's Horse and
several hundred ranchers and pioneers stood to
pay their respects. It was a solemn and lovely
moment. And anybody supposing that interest in
horses is a thing of the past, should visit the ringaide at Brandon exhibition when the draft horses
are being judged or attend a spring horse show
at Regina or other western city. When Lord Lovat
was here in 1952 he said with evident feeling: "I
can see that you Canadians will never quit the
horses.'"

Well, in all too many cases they have
"quit the horses", and you will see them
82719-11

12, 1957

struggling with a tractor, trying to thaw it
out, shovelling it out of the snow, meeting
bill after bill of expenses-all of which could
have been avoided by the use of horses.
Also, though everyone will not agree with
me, it is a greater pleasure to work with
horses. The happiest hours of my life were
spent behind eight horses hitched to a three
furrow plow, fourteen inches to each furrow.
This outfit would plow twelve acres a day,
and with it I was as happy as a lark, whereas
had you placed me on an engine you might
as well have taken me down to the villge
lock-up. Some may find pleasure in diesel
tractors, but they have their perils; one of
them caused the death of a man in our
district from carbon monoxide poisoning.
It was threshing time, there was very little
air moving that evening, and as he sat
beside the engine with his eyes closed his
fellow workers thought he was taking a rest,
but he was lying in the path of the exhaust,
and when they went to arouse him he was
dead.
On the question of the proposed Canada
Council and grants to universities, everyone
may not like what I have to say. While, perhaps, I would not oppose the whole scheme,
I certainly object to the immediate grant of
so large a sum of money, and the suggestion
of the Prime Minister that it is being provided
from succession duties on particular estates is
about the most ridiculous I have ever heard.
In the first place, it is as much a contribution
from my income tax as from anyone else's;
also, the fortunes represented in these duties
were contributed through purchases by the
Canadian people of steel and other products
made by the owners of these large estates.
Perhaps, as the years go by, our universities
will provide a somewhat different type of
training from what is given today, and
thereby will equip a man to make his way
in whatever position he may find himself. In
too many cases, I am sorry to say, the student's academic training seems to put him
entirely out of contact with practical affairs.
I remember a boy from my district, a university graduate, who during the difflcult
times in the thirties accompanied a wellknown lady, a former member of the Saskatchewan Legislature and now, I believe,
editor of the Tribune, a leftist paper, who was
holding a meeting at Blaine Lake. I took
him to task severely. I said: "Your father
and mother, without the advantage of any
university education, proved themselves good
citizens, established a nice home, and were
able to give you educational advantages they
never had; yet the best you can do as a
result of this training is to cause trouble. If,
instead of spreading propaganda, you would
return to the farm and work it, you would

flag ships or to subsidize Canadian flag ships. The
subsidy threatens to interfere with the Canadian
policy of maintaining a freely competitive field
for shipping. Subsidized American ships on the
Great Lakes will be calling at Canadian ports,
participating in the movement of Canadian cargo.
The Maritime Administration fact-sheet called attention to the point that there would be "a substantial amount of cargo available at Canadian
ports in addition to cargo moving through United
States ports on the Great Lakes".
There is the further prospect that a considerable
volume of goods produced for export by Canadian
factories controlled by American firms will be
directed to American ships.

Talk about controls! This means that goods
produced by Canadian subsidiaries of American companies will be carried on American
ships.
These factors might reduce by more than 50 per

cent the calls of other foreign fiag vessels at
Canadian ports west of Montreal and nullify many
of the benefits of the Canadian open-sea policy.
Aside from the extortionate rates which dominant
carriers tend to charge, such American domination

of Great Lakes shipping would add to the present
dangerous imbalance of Canadian trade. Shipping
services are an export by the country rendering
them. Subsidized American shipping lines on the
Great Lakes would be another subsidized American
export to Canada, which Is already struggling with
a $,000,000,000 imbalance in its trade with the
United States. On the contrary, the use of other
foreign ships to pick up cargo puts Canadian
dollars into their hands and brightens the prospects
for Canadian trade.

That is the position we find ourselves in
with respect to this great St. Lawrence seaway. All the time and money we will have
spent on it will be chiefly for the benefit of
that great country to the south of us. I
for one have been doubtful about the course
that we have been taking in some of these
undertakings.
Honourable senators, I have talked at much
greater length than I had intended, but before
concluding I do want to make some comments about the preliminary report of the

Royal Commission on Canada's Economic
Prospects. I do not understand the Minister
of Trade and Commerce as suggesting that
the adoption of certain recommendations in
the report would seriously affect the Wheat
Board, and I do not wish that anything would.
I would like to read from paragraph 6 on
page 32 of the report:
It seems to be desirable to give the farmers, in
advance, as much information as possible not only
on price (as is done now), but also on the
quantities of wheat which can probably be ac-

cepted by the board, and paid for, in the coming
year. The quantity in any year will depend
upon the stocks on hand in relation to off-farm
storage capacity; and the expected disposal of
wheat in both the domestie and foreign markets.
The board should be able to appraise these two
factors and to arrive at an informed estimate of the
quantity which it would be possible to move off
farms in the next marketing year. The announced
initial price would apply to this quantity. Such a
procedure under which both price and quantity
would be announced in advance should be of some
advantage to wheat producers. As we have pointed
82719-111

out, under the present arrangements the producer
does not know in advance the quantity on which
the minimum price will be paid during a given
year. While he has an assured price, he has no
assurance of a minimum income. If the board
were required to pay the minimum price on the
quantity they estimated could be moved off farms,
this would assure the producer of a minimum income, except in the event of a small crop. In
times of surplus, such a procedure could exert a
corrective influence.

For the life of me I cannot see how it
would be difficult for or would ruin the
Wheat Board. It would be of some advantage
to the farmer to have some idea of how much
income he would be able to receive. I cannot
see that it would be any different from lending him money; in fact, it would be more
realistic. Also, if in future years the farmer
were fortunate enough to have a good crop,

and year after year the quota was placed
very low, it might well influence farmers to
turn to raising livestock or to some other
branch of farming. As the report states, it
could exert a corrective influence, and I fail
to see what damage could be done.
Honourable senators, I think I have detained you long enough.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Pouliot, the debate
was adjourned. ,

when they actually come to construct their

always thank them for doing that. And then
I saw men at work doing something that
was not foreseen by the honourable Leader
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald)-I saw them cleaning
the walls. Now I see that most of the walls
are cleaned, and all that good work filled my
heart with feelings of thankfulness to the
committee. I did not know who were members on the subcommittee until later, and on
January 16 words of gratitude fell from my
lips for the good things ordered done by the
committee. I was in the same position as
any other honourable senator would have
been; I tried to make a gracious speech, to be
publicly thankful for what had been done.
But it was not a favour they were doing me;
those were matters of right, things that I
was entitled to.
When I visited this chamber during the
recess I asked the electricians who were
working here "How is it that we have better
lighting in the Senate now?" They replied,
"Sir, we have discovered that by using
stronger bulbs we will have more light."
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: This discovery is very
timely and I am surprised that it was not
made when the Senate chamber was built,
just after the First World War. Anyhow,
now it is possible to read Hansard with
glasses in the Senate, and this indicates the
immense improvement that has been made.
True we have only two clear pieces of glass
in the window to the extreme right of the
chamber, but there is a ray of hope that in
the future all those dirtily painted windows
will be replaced by better glass so that we
can enjoy a little bit of sunshine in here. I
am more pleased because those two glasses
in that window are exactly the same as
those in my parish church of St. Patrice de
Riviere-du-Loup, and when I glance at these
windows I feel rather at home. I tell those
whom I meet that a beginning bas been
made, that something is being done. It is
very nice; it evidences a good spirit.
Earlier this session a report was received
from the Standing Committee on Internal
Economy and Contingent Accounts, recommending that its quorum be reduced to seven
members. So far that is the only report
which this committee has tabled. It gave me
my first opportunity to express my gratification: This is what I said:

Now, honourable senators, there was a good
disposition on the part of the members of

Honourable senators, before this report is adopted
I wish to express my appreciation to both leaders
of the house, to the Honourable Senator Dessureault,

World War. May I quote what Senator
Dandurand said on May 14, 1928:
Honourable gentlemen, ever since I came into
this chamber I have reflected with very great
sorrow on the fact that no one insisted that the
architects should give us a replica of the old Senate
chamber. I have passed through quite a number
of capitals, and have seen many parliament buildings, but I do not know that I have ever seen any
chamber comparable with the Senate of Canada as
we had it before the fire. Honourable gentlemen
can therefore imagine my feelings-shall I say my
indignation?-at finding our old chamber replaced
by this den.

Those are the words of a man who left a
great name, Senator Dandurand.
It may have certain qualities, architecturally speaking, and I confess that I am not competent to cross
swords with experts on the architectural value of
this chamber; but I told Mr. Pearson-

That is not Mr. Lester Pearson, the Secretary
of State for External Affairs, but the architect.
-that he would have to wait for all those who
had known the other chamber to close their eyes
before he would be permitted to hear an unbiased
judgment as to the value of this chamber.

On the same date there were eminent
speeches by Senator Daniel, Senator Belcourt,
Senator Turriff and others, complaining of
the ugliness of this chamber.
Sometimes I have some very good friends
who give me their support. I will quote from
an article which appeared in one of the largest Canadian dailies, the Halifax ChronicleHerald, on March 30, 1956.
The article,
which was headed "Good suggestion", said:
The unpredictable Senator Jean-François Pouliot
has started a movement to make the peaceful
atmosphere of Parliament's Upper Chamber even
more peaceful.
A curt question ho asked the Senate Government Leader about what ho called the eight depressing war scenes that have adorned the chamber
for years, developed into an almost full-fledged
debate generally endorsing his views. And it now
looks like the paintings of the landing of Canadian
World War I troops in France, guns on the Rhine
and others will be replaced by what one Senate
veteran suggested should be something "more in
keeping with what we desire now-the peace of
the world".
Senator Pouliot and those supporting him are
right. There is a place of honour for those paintings from the 1914-1918 Canadian War Records
collection, but it is not in the Senate chamber at
this time. They have served their purpose there
and should be replaced by others which will help
to inspire parliamentary thoughts about a progressive, peaceful future, instead of a warring
past.
The National Art Gallery should be able to produce from its supply-which too few people now
see for the money spent on it-a good collection
of peacetime scenes, and the emphasis should be
on Canadiana produced by Canadian artists.
If
it is still felt that there should be some war
paintings among them, then proper recognition
should be given to World War 2 as well as World

and all my colleagues for the good work that bas
been done by this committee to improve conditions
in the Senate chamber. I hope the committee will
continue its good work, for there still are some
things to be done. I trust that with good will and
perseverance the physical appearance of the
chamber will be improved in the near future.

Hansard continues:
Hon. Mr. Macdonald moved, with leave, that the
report be adopted.
The motion was agreed to.

So the quorum of the committee was
established at seven, after my remarks. This
is the first chapter of a novel which I am

to write it all, because of the limitation

honourable members: if I hestitate a little
in my speech it is because I did not have
enough paper to write it all out.
I have been told that there has been a
meeting of the Subcommittee on Stationery.
Who are the members of that committee I
do not know, because everything is mysterious. But I know that my questions on
this subject, which have been on the Order
Paper since January 29, were answered,
with one exception, today. I have not
seen the replies, but I can surmise what they
are. In fact, when I ask a question I have
a definite idea what the answer will be.
I assume that the replies will be as nice
as they can be, now that the Minutes of the
Proceedings have indicated that yesterday
I adjourned the debate on the motion for an
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
In the obscurity resulting from lack of
knowledge of what the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said in reply
to these questions, may I remark, first,Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman to assure him that I
received these answers less than fifteen minutes before I came into the chamber.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I do not blame the
honourable Leader of the Government. I have
not uttered a word of blame. My point is that,
in spite of improved ceiling lighting, I am
still in dark obscurity with regard to the
answers to my questions. Even if the honourable gentleman had them only 15 minutes
before the house opened, I did not have even
a minute to peruse them before I rose to
speak. Therefore, I repeat, my obscurity is
profound. But I am not blind. In fact, honourable senators, I am far from being blind,
because even in this darkness I can read
between the lines.
82719-12

Of my four questions, the one easiest to
answer is precisely the one which has been
left unanswered. To familiarize honourable
senators with the matter, I will read it. It is
this:
What amount of office stationery, supplies and
equipment has been supplied by the Senate
Stationery Branch during each one of the last
ten years
(a) to the three offices of the Speaker of the
Senate, and the Leader of the Government in the
Senate, and the Leader of the Opposition in the
Senate, collectively;

I am not interested to know what quantity
of stationery has been used by any one of
them. What I want to find out is the total
amount of stationery, supplies and equipment
used by the three together. That is the first
part of my question. Then I asked, what is
the amount of office stationery, supplies and
equipment supplied(b) to each one of the branches of the Senate;

That is clear.
(c) to the
collectively?

And, in the third place,
other

members

of

the

Senate,

I will tell my honourable colleagues why I
asked this question. It is because the total
amount allowed in the Estimates for stationery, supplies and equipment for the Senate is
$7,000. That is not much. But it would be
unfair if, to establish the quota of each
senator, that amount were divided by the total
number of senators, because the three honourable gentlemen to whom I referred in the first
place have at their disposal an unlimited
amount of supplies and equipment; and,
Senate branches must consume large quantities of paper as well. If you disregard the
stationery supplies of the three honourable
gentlemen-His Honour the Speaker, the
honourable Leader of the Government, and
the honourable Leader of the Oppositionand that used by the Reporting Branch
and the Committees Branch, you are left with
the supplies used by honourable senators. It
is not a matter of $7,000, but it is a very easy
thing to calculate. If the records were kept
in the Committees Branch as they should be,
the answer should be available within five
minutes. If the question is left unanswered
it is because there is something wrong with
our Committees Branch. The other day the
honourable Leader of the Government did not
understand my question very well. He
thought that I wanted an outright answer,
but it was not that at all. He said he did
not know how much paper was used in his
office. I would not know how much was used
in my office either, because, like all you good
honourable senators, when I need some paper
I ask for it. I just phone to the Stationery
Branch and sometimes I get what I want and
sometimes I do not. In any event, I am very
surprised not to have received from the

SENATE
honourable Leader of the Government an
answer to the question which serves as the
basis for my argument today.
Hon. Mr. Slambaugh: May I interrupt to
ask a question? You have spoken about the
stationery used by Senate branches and I do
not know what ones you refer to. There may
be other senators here who are in the dark
on this too.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I thank my honourable
deskmate for asking that question. Let me
explain that the greatest eater of stationery
in the whole Senate is the Debates and
Reporting Branch, which is supplied by the
Stationery Branch. Then there are the Committees Branch, the office of the Clerk of
the Senate, the office of the Assistant Clerk
of the Senate, and the office of the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod.
I found the names of those branches in a
place where they are easily found, the Government telephone directory. Unfortunately
I do not have a copy of that directory with
me now, but all these branches are listed
under the heading of "The Senate" in that
directory. I have to use very simple ways,
for the complicated ways are denied me. I
cannot reach them, and therefore my method
of working must be very simple.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: And my question was
a simple one.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: And I tried to give an
answer with a flourish. I am thankful that
my honourable deskmate is listening to my
remarks, for he may get some information.
Last week when the Senate was giving consideration to Appropriation Bill No. 1, I felt
the bill indicated a lack of a sense of proportion and reality. I do not want to be unpleasant, but I notice that this sense of
proportion and reality is lacking in the House
of Commons as well as in the Senate, and as
a matter of fact throughout the whole world.
Now, honourable senators, I pass on to
other matters. I will not speak about the
freight assistance on western feed grains,
for our new colleague from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Taylor) and my honourable deskmate (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) have said all
there was to say in answer to the speeches
of the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) and the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). The
speeches of those four honourable gentlemen
should be printed together for the edification
and information of farmers of both eastern
and western Canada. I shall leave that question aside.
Under the item of Citizenship and Immigration the sum of $9 million was voted to provide for, among other things the cost of

transportation and other assistance with
respect to Hungarian refugees coming to
Canada. I do not criticize that item. The
expenditure may be justified, but let me show
you where the lack of a sense of proportion
comes in. Some nuns from Rivière du Loup
had been interned in concentration camps
in Japan, and when I asked the Department
of Citizenship and Immigration to pay for
their return to Canada, their native land,
my request was refused; yet here we are importing Hungarians by the thousands. I have
been unable to conceive the proportion between refusing these few nuns their fare
home and at the same time voting money
to bring thousands of Hungarian refugees to
this country. I cannot understand it.
Honourable senators, with regard to university grants, I remember the present
Canadian Ambassador to France, Mr. Jean
Desy, once remarked during a lecture that
there was a great difference between culture
and civilization; that some people who do
not know how to read or write can be perfectly civilized, and others who are very
cultured can be uncivilized. Mr. Desy's lecture on culture and civilization have been
published in book form and I hope my
honourable colleagues may have the enjoyment of reading it.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) was very enthusiastic about
these university grants, but at the same time
fie was agreeable to imposing a limitation
on the stationery quota of his colleagues in
the Senate, although he himself has an unlimited supply. I wonder if the students of
the great University of Manitoba, of which
the honourable gentleman is a distinguished
graduate, have had a limitation imposed on
the paper they use. I wonder if in taking
their notes they have to use slates and
blackboards or papyrus, which was used in
ancient times, or birch bark, which was used
by our early Indians. On the one hand the
honourable gentleman, as a member of the
Subcommittee on Stationery, thought it was
wise to impose a limitation on the stationery
used by honourable members of the Senate,
and fie was aware that in the Estimates there
was an item of only $7,000 to cover the cost
of stationery in the Senate. On the other
hand he was aware that in the recent supply
bill there was a vote of nearly $8 million
for university grants. Now how could the
students take notes during lectures by their
professors if they had so little money to
spend on stationery that they had no notepaper and had to rely on blackboards and
chalk? How could they take notes during the
orations and lectures by the learned professors in the medical schools, for instance?
What a benefit to the lumber industry the

FEBRUARY 13, 1957
demand for ail those blackboards would be.
And what a profit the paint manufacturers
would make.
Honourable senators, I do not want to
take too much time. I come now to the
climax of the story. I wonder, honourable
senators, if you are interested in my speech. I
do not see anyone dozing now, and that is
the greatest comfort that I have. If you
want to listen to my story I will unfold it
before your eyes. No, I will unfold it so
that you will hear it-I cannot unfold it
before your eyes because my paper supply is
limited.
In the Minutes of the Proceedings of last
session I found something that was not offensive to any senator, the tenth report of the
Standing Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent accounts, dated August 1, 1956,
which reads as follows:

That is the pleasant letter which rewarded
me for my gracious speech. Immediately
after I made that speech I received that
letter, and the first thing that I did was to
go to the office of the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to ask him if
he had a copy of the report of the Subcommittee on Stationery. He had none. Then I
went next door to the office of our good
friend the Clerk of the Senate. He had none.
I asked the honourable senator from Ottawa
West (Hon. J. J. Connolly) if he had a copy.
He was in his office in town, and he told me
that perhaps he had one, but he could not
remember definitely. Next I asked the chairman of the subcommittee, the honourable
gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), if he had a copy, and he did not.
Finally I went to the office of the clerk

On the other hand, the amount in the

year it is $560,081, or an increase of $96,783.
The Meteorological Division of the Department of Transport spent last year for office
stationery, supplies and equipment $378,000
and this year will spend $363,000. Look at
the proportion between the item of office
supplies for the Senate and that of these
and other departments. I know some departments spend more than $1 million for
paper. Mark you, honourable senators, I
do not criticize that expenditure for paper,
but we must show a sense of proportion.
If there is no limitation on paper or no
stationery quota for the other departments,
I do not know why there should be one for
the Senate, where each member has his own
work to do. Some members write their
letters in longhand, and others dictate them.
Some members like plain paper of good bond
quality to write on, not the expensive vellum
paper with envelopes that do not stick, or
parchment paper, and all embossed, if you
please.
Honourable senators, except for the small
scratch pad we are not provided with a bit
of paper which is not embossed with the
Canada crest and the words "The Senate". It
is absolutely ridiculous extravagance and
waste. We use a sheet from an embossed
pad to write a name or an address on. That
embossing costs a lot of money; I know when
I have some done for myself I pay quite
a lot for it. But I do not use an embossed
letterhead except when writing letters.
Honourable senators will understand why
I have asked these questions. It is because
I want the Senate of Canada to be respected.
When I ridiculed the Woolsack it was to

prevent the Senate from being ridiculed, and
it was a long time before I thought of coming
here to be with you. Now how is it that
we are being told by a man who is in charge
of a certain quantity of stationery, and who
does not seem to know the difference between expensive paper and good business
paper, and who fills our desks with pads of
embossed English letterheads, without putting
in any French letterheads-how is it that
we are being told we can have only so much
and no more? He does not supply us with
good unembossed pads, because he has none.
The ones he has are of cheap quality, on
which the pen scratches and makes blots.
It is surprising that so much consideration
was given by the Internal Economy Committee to an increase in the salary of that
man. I have no objection to civil servants
being well paid. I believe that the staff of the
Senate is efficient, mostly efficient, and they
deserve to be paid as.well as the civil servants
employed in the other house. But the Civil
Service Commission is the judge of the merits
of an employee with regard to salary. The
case of the so-called chief of the stationery
branch, whose designation should be only
caretaker, was submitted to the Civil Service
Commission, and the commission refused the
increase which it considered unjustified. But
in order to get the increase a complaint was
made about the extravagance of members of
the Senate with regard to their use of stationery. Does he want to get what was
refused to us? I do not know. But what I
do not like, and what I denounce, is the
secrecy which started last year. Everything
was taken from the members of the Senate,
and finally what we get is an insult. I know
some senators who were in my place told me
after having received the notice last year
they had to go to their colleagues to beg
some paper because they needed it. They
were too proud to call at the Stationery
Branch after receiving such a letter, and
asked their colleagues to let them have a
supply sufficient to enable them to fulfil their
duty as members of the Senate. And may I
say to the members of the Subcommittee on
Stationery that if what they say in the report
is true, that they made an inspection of the
Stationery Branch, I am very sorry for them,
and I cannot congratulate them. They should
have noticed the wasteful supply of paper
that is there.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
senator to repeat the statement that he has
just made?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I say that if the members of the Subcommittee on Stationery really
meant what was said in the tenth report
of the Internal Economy Committee last

FEBRUARY 13, 1957
August in which. the committee recommended "that the usual supply of stationery,
etc., which has been selected by your comnrnittee with due regard to usefulness and
economy, for use of the senators in their
roins and desks in the Senate Chamber, be
supplied according to the lists approved by
your Comnuttee and deposited with the Clerk
of Stationery,"-I say that if they meant
that they do flot know their business.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Pardon me just a moment. Ail this is entirely the work of the
subcommittee and there is no blame whatever
to be attached to Mr. Lay in the matter.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And I must apologize.
It was possibly through my f ault that the
report of the subcommittee was not obtainable, because I believe that I left for home
without signing the report. That is most
likely why it was not available at once.
There was nothing to prevent any honourable
senator frorn attending the meetings of that
subcommittee. I must say that we arrived at
our conclusion with due regard for everything, after having looked over ail the various
accounts, after having considered the work
senators were doing, and the stationery that
they recelved in the past. That record was
before us and ail was taken into consideration before the resolution was recommended
to the Internai Economy Committee.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I appreciate what has
been said by the honourable gentleman. I
do flot accuse anybody, but I stili say that
if they did check the list and approve every
item on it they do not know the requirements of each of the members of the Senate
with regard to stationery. That is my point.
In the House of Commons we always had a
plentiful supply of stationery, and it was
supplied i accordance with the requirements of the members. I must congratulate
the present Leader of the Government i
the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) on that,
for when he was Speaker of the House of
Commons we neyer had any trouble about
such matters. For instance, the scratch pads
that were supplied there were ail made of
good substantial paper and came in various
sizes. They certainly were not to be compared with the scratch pads furnished in
the Senate, which are made of the poorest
of paper. It is really a waste of money to
buy such notepaper. In the House of Coinmons bound notepaper pads were supplied;
they were flot made of expensive bond paper,
linen or parchment, nor vellum, but they
were serviceable. I hope that in the future
we wiil be supplied with cheaper and better
paper in the Senate. Can anyone tell me
what an expenditure of $2000 or $2500

amounts to when divided among 102 senators
-let us say 87 because there are 15
vacancies?
Especially, what does that
expenditure amount to when compared with
the expenditures for stationery by departments of government?
There is a whispering campaign going on
against the Senate which could turn out to
be very harmful. Members of the committee
seem flot to have realized that by reducing
their coileagues to the status of office boys
under the whip of a bureaucrat who does not
know his business
they committed a
great oflence against the Upper House of
Parliament.
And now, honourabie senators, I corne ta
the iast subi ect, which is along a somewhat
different line. I want to tell honourable
senators of a committee that was set up i
1938. In that year the Right Honourable
Mackenzie King entrusted 25 members of
the House of Commons with the task of
making a survey of the -civil service with a
view to considering the usefulness o! each
civil servant at that time. To do that a
special committee was set up to study the
operations of the Civil Service Act, and that
was the finest committee that was ever
set up in the House of Commons. I pay
tribute today to my very good friend the
honourable senator from Huron-Perth (Hlon.
Mr. Golding), who was a most valuable
member of that committee, and I likewise
pay tribute to ail the other members of it.
The first recommendation adopted by the
committee in its final report was suggested
by a member who afterwards became
Minister of Public Works in the Mackenzie
King Government as well as in the St.
Laurent Government, and who today adorns
the bench o! the Exchequer Court, the
Honourable Mr. Justice Alphonse Fournier.
My good friend the senator from HuronPerth, who made other valuable suggestions
while serving as a member on that committee, must remember the recommendation,
for lie was one o! those who was insistent
that it be the first one adopted. Let me
read the recommendation in question, to be
found in the minutes of the committee's
proceedings, at page 1551, under date of
June 27, 1938:
Your committee deems it expedient and Ini the
interest of the public. the civil service and the
Civil Service Commission that a standing commlttee on civil service matters be appolnted at the
commencement of each session of Parliament and
therefore recommends to Parliament that Standing
Order 63 be amnended by adding after clause (k)
of said Order the foflowing clause (l)-'on civil
service matters to consist of fifteen members, nine
of whom should constitute a quorum."

The purpose of that recommendation was
to give to each civil servant the privilege of
coming under the protection o! Parliament, to

SENATE

express his grievances without any feeling of
being treated unjustly by any subchief or
other civil servant. It was an excellent recommendation-I can say so because it was not
mine-and it was supported by the whole
committee. Mr. King said, "Let us wait for
another session before adopting that report."
The following session the committee sat under
the chairmanship of Mr. Fournier and adopted
precisely the same recommendation; but nothing was done. I regretted very much that
this proposal was not put in force by the
House of Commons on the initiative of the
Government of the day. But here in the
Senate is a Civil Service Administration Committee, exactly what we fought for in vain
in the House of Commons and that committee
sits only to fix its quorum at seven members. It seems to me that all matters pertaining to civil service positions, reclassifications, promotions and so forth should come,
not before our Committee on Internal Economy, but before the Committee on Civil
Service Administration-the only body of its
kind in Parliament. I do not blame the
chairman of that committee for not having
called it together. When I was in the other
place I suggested that there should be a
meeting of the Committee on Debates, which
had not sat for many years: I wanted to meet
my colleagues, to see what they looked like,
to shake hands with them. But when we
asked for work, the late Mr. King rose indignantly and said, in effect, "Mind your
own business; wait until the House gives
you orders".
I trust that some use will be found for
the Committee on Civil Service Administration. How beneficial it could be to the civil
service to have that committee as a sword
of Damocles over the heads of all those who
practise office favouritism. They would have
to come before the committee and explain
why they have not treated this one or that
one fairly.
I shall not pursue this subject any further.
MVy conclusion is that there is one thing to
be done: the Standing Committee on Internal
Economy should meet, and should direct the
Subcommittee on Stationery to meet; and I
am sure that if my friend the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
the chairman of the subcommittee, does not
have to leave in the middle of the sitting or
before a report is prepared and sent to the
'Internal Economy Committee, everything will
be ironed out satisfactorily. I gather from
'What he has said, which I appreciate very
much, that he thinks the subcommittee, in its
report, should not have gone as far as it did.
like my colleagues, and I do not wish to be
àlnpleasant to any of them, but I am, adamant

in defence of the rights of the Senate. Also
I like to work. When I was a member of
the other house I was among the last members to leave after the work of the day had
been completed. I hope I have made myself
clear, ard that there will be, not merely
answers tw my questions, but the action
which is expected by the great majority of
my colleagues.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Barbour, the debate
was adjourned.
DIVORCE RULES

AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
February 6, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck for adoption
of the thirteenth report of the Standing Committee on Divorce.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable
senators, I approach with some diffidence the
discussion of the proposed changes in the
divorce rules at this time. I cannot help but
feel that, after the momentous issues we
have heard discussed this afternoon, the
trifling questions which arise from the rights
of parties in divorce proceedings may seem
somewhat of an anticlimax. On two occasions
I have moved the adjournment of the debate
on this question, not because I wanted time
to prepare a speech and eloquently evolve
profound arguments, but because I needed
time to decide on which side of this question
I was going to speak.
When the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) Chairman of the
Divorce Committee, spoke on this resolution,
I was convinced of the soundness of his position, partly because I have great respect for
him and for the very creditable way he is
performing his duties on that committee,
partly because of his wide experience as a
lawyer and the apparent soundness of his
arguments. But when I heard the speech of
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) I felt like the judge who bitterly
complained that he had his mind all made
up until the defendant rose and submitted his
argument. I listened with growing conviction
to my honourable friend, and with the
greatest regard and respect for his services
for many years as Chairman of the Divorce
Committee. He spoke with the authority of
long experience, he quoted authorities whose
rules were worthy of consideration, and he
stated his reasons very clearly. Further, may
I say to my honourable friend, I felt something of a kindred association with him because on two previous occasions, in the last
couple of years, we have spoken on the same

FEBRUARY 13, 1957
side on quite important issues in connection
with divorce. However, having heard both
sides, and the Senate having been good
enough to give me a little time to decide on
which side of this question I wish to speak,
I regret to say to my honourable friend
from Rosetown that I take the opposite side
to his and I support the resolution.
There seems to be only one issue in which
there has been a real challenge, and that is
the proposed rule requiring the naming of
and serving of papers upon the co-respondent.
I have before me a copy of the speech
made by my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in which he set out
reasons for not introducing this rule, some
of which were obtained from previous chairmen of the Divorce Committee. I am irmpressed in a way with the wisdom of these
gentlemen of the past, but if they were no
abler in this connection than the members of
the Senate have been in attempting to make
the proceedings of this chamber more audible
to members and spectators alike, then I
might question their wisdom just a little
bit.
The first reason given by these advisers was
that the Senate committee is not a court and
that Parliament is not limited in its jurisdiction to granting divorces on the grounds of
adultery-that a parliamentary divorce can
be granted on any ground at all. The honourable gentleman from Rosetown said this
was the main reason why these gentlemen
had not adopted this rule. If that is so, I am
puzzled to see the force of it. It is true that
our jurisdiction extends wider than granting
a divorce on the grounds of adultery, but it
is also a fact that the committee and Parliament only proceed to hear divorce petitions
on that ground. I do not see why the fact
that Parliament is not limited in its divorce
jurisdiction should be a reason for not changing our procedure so as to require the naming
of the co-respondent.
. My honourable friend said that his predecessors, in giving their reasons for not
changing the Senate divorce procedure, referred him to Rule 152, which reads:
In cases not provided for
general principles upon which by these rules the
the Imperial Parliament proceeds in dissolving marriage and the rules,
usages and
forms of the House of Lords in respect
of divorce proceedings may, so far as they are
applicable, be applied to divorce proceedings before
the Senate and before the Standing Committee on
Divorce.

My honourable friend suggests as a reason
for not changing our procedure the fact that
Rule 152 covers all cases not provided for in
the rules. It seems to me there is just a
little inconsistency here. First of ail, there
is an objection to the proposed ainendment

under discussion, and then there is the assertion that the situation is already covered in
this omnibus Rule 152. I am rather inclined
to agree with this latter assertion, but there
is no harm in having the matter specifically
covered and out in the open.
The honourable gentleman from Rosetown
said the former chairmen of the committee
felt that the naming of the co-respondent
would lead to more divorces. I doubt the
correctness and soundness of that conclusion.
I rather think it would have the opposite
effect. Let us suppose that a married woman,
unknown to ber husband, was going to commit adultery. If she realized that she might
be named in divorce proceedings for ber improper action and that as a result her husband
might petition for a divorce from her, she
might be less likely to commit this kind of
depravation.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Or it might make ber
take steps to see that she was not found out.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There was another reason
given by my honourable friend's predecessors
for not amending the rules, and I quote from
his remarks made to this bouse:
They also said that in most petitions emanating
from the province of Quebec, particularly from
Montreal, the name of the co-respondent could not
be ascertained . . .

I do not know why there is something in
Montreal which does not obtain in Toronto
or even in Vancouver about the mystery of
these things and the secrecy about people's
names.

I just do not understand

it.

My

honourable friend gave figures to show that
in 1956 the name of the co-respondent was
known in only 85 cases out of 356. He drew
this conclusion:
I am quite sure that there will be at least that
number of cases every year wherein the corespondent is not known and cannot be served.
I talked to the honourable senator from

Rosetown about these figures and I know
they are correct, but I must respectfully disagree with the

conclusion he draws from

them. The statistics he gave were compiled

under the present procedure, which does not
require the name of the co-respondent to be

ascertained or the service of papers upon
him. That being so, the witnesses and the
petitioner do not-take any steps to find out

the name of the co-respondent if. it is not
readily available.
I understand from Mr.
Armstrong, Chief Clerk of Committees, that

there are practically no cases in which the
petition sets out that the petitioner bas made
a diligent search to ascertain the name of the
co-respondent but has been unable to do so.
It is true that the petition is s'worn to, but It
does not allege that any effort has been made
to ascerta4n the name or the residence of thé

SENATE
co-respondent-and I suggest the reason is
that this information is not required by the
rules.
On the other hand, if the rule were changed
to conform with those in Ontario and other
provinces having divorce jurisdiction, then a
complete change in the practice would take
place. The petitioner would get busy at once
to take all possible reasonable steps to ascertain the name and address of the corespondent. That information would have to
be sworn to in the petition, a copy of which
would have to be served upon the corespondent before the petition would be inquired into by the Senate Divorce Committee.
If the petitioner were absolutely unable to
ascertain the name of the co-respondent he
would have to appear before the committee
and satisfy it that he had exercised due care
and diligence in trying to ascertain the name
of the co-respondent, but had been unsuccessfui. I venture to say that under those circumstances, instead of the co-respondent
being named in only 85 cases out of 356, he
will be unnamed in only 85 cases out of 356.
Take that iniquitous place, Montreal, that
my friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) comes from. A lot of divorces from
that city go through a kind of routine. I have
sat in the divorce courts long enough to get
the general picture. I am sure that my bonourable friends from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) and Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) will both confirm that there are
quite a number of routine cases, in which
detectives who devote most of their time to
this kind of work are called as witnesses.
On thinking this matter over, I have a
strong feeling that if the petitioner is compelled to give the name and the place of
residence of the co-respondent, or, failing
that, to make diligent search to the satisfaction of the Divorce Committee, there may be
less "monkey business" going on than there
is today.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think that pretty well
covers what my honourable friend said about
that point.
My honourable friend from Rosetown
pointed out that rules similar to those now
being proposed exist in every province in
Canada, except Quebec and Newfoundland.
I understand from Mr. MacNeill, the Clerk
of the Senate, that the rules as proposed in
the committee's report are identical with
those in the courts of the province of Ontario.
I am not a specialist in divorce cases, but
I have dealt with some, and my recollection
is that generally the same rules are in force
in British Columbia, as I imagine they are
in all the other provinces having divorce

courts, yet I have never heard any complaint that the judges who try divorce cases
have an undue task imposed on them through
having to decide whether due diligence has
been exercised in cases where the name and
address of the co-respondent are said to be
unknown. I do not think the failure to
provide this information happens often, and
I venture to say it will not happen anything like as often as my friend's figures
would suggest if this rule is changed.
My friend suggested an amendment which
caught my fancy at first, but on thinking it
over and discussing it with Mr. MacNeill, I
changed rny opinion. It was that the Law
Clerk of the Senate be delegated to hear,
during the parliamentary recesses, applications for leave to proceed without naming
the co-respondent. Whether he could do so
without authority of a statute or not, I am
not quite sure; but of this I am sure-and
Mr. MacNeill agrees with me-his power
to call witnesses or to make a proper investigation of such matters would be very
limited; he could not subpoena a witness
and compel him to come, and he would be
under that limitation unless we supplemented these rules by an Act of Parliament.
I do not think we would want to have an
act of Parliament in this matter.
In conclusion, I think, as a matter of
broad principle and decency, that when a
man or a wornan is charged with being a
co-respondent in a divorce case he or she
ought to know of the charge. Let us assume
that it is a woman, and that she is innocent.
Under the present procedure her name is
not ascertained and she is not served, yet
a divorce is granted on the basis of her having committed adultery. If she is a married
woman it won't take long before it leaks
out among the parties themselves on both
sides as to who was the alleged guilty party.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
What an outrageous
Hon. Mr. Farris:
thing it would be if an innocent woman, or
an innocent man for that matter, was
deprived of the knowledge and the opportunity to come to court and deny such an
allegation. On the other hand, supposing
the person were guilty. Oh, wouldn't it be
too bad to bring that poor man or woman
into court because his wife or her husband
might find out about it! I think the principle
of the present procedure is wrong, and much
as I regret to part, for once, from my
honourable friend from Rosetown on a
divorce issue, I must support the amendment.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Kinley, the debate
was adjourned.

SENATE
INTERNAL ECONOMY COMMITTEE-REPORTS
OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON STATIONERY
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot moved, pursuant to notice:
For a copy of each one of the annuai reports

of the Subcommittee on Stationery to the Com-

mittee on Internal Economy of the Senate during
each one of the last twenty years.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I have the documents asked for in the
motion of the honourable gentleman from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) and I
shall table them. Before doing so, however,
may I refer to the remarks which were made
respecting the
this bouse yesterday
in

Stationery Branch of the Senate.
Upon inquiry I found that the Subcommittee on Stationery reported to the Internal
Economy Committee in August last, and the
report of the final meeting of the Internal
Economy Committee at the main session of
1956 reads in part as follows:
After some discussion, a decision was reached
whereby the Subcommittee would recommend to
the Internal Economy Committee that each honourable senator's stationery account be limited
to the sum of $30 per annum, with the exceptions
of the offices of the Speaker of the Senate, and the
Leaders of the Government and the Opposition in
the Senate. There would, however, be no limitation in the case of a newly-appointed senator during his or her first year in office, in order that
.all his or her basic requirements might thus be
,obtained. Furthermore, when the abovementioned
quota has been reached, that the Chief of the
Stationery Branch be instructed to forward a
circular letter to honourable senators, requesting
their co-operation in limiting their requests to
this figure.

That report was approved by the Internal
Economy Committee, and I am informed that
the Chief of the Stationery Branch was accordingly instructed to send copies of the
letter referred to in the report to each senator when his or her stationery account had

reached $30. Honourable senators, the Chief
of the Stationery Branch, having received
those instructions, had no alternative but to
send the notice.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If he had not done so
it would have been, at least, insubordination,
and if he had continued to refuse to obey his
instructions, I suppose he might have lost
his job. Having carried out his instructions,
May I say that the
there was criticism.
criticism is not all from one member of the
Senate. I find that the Chief of the Stationery Branch is a capable and courteous official.
He was given instructions, which he carried
out, and as a result a number of senators
have spoken to me. They do not all complain
about the Chief of the branch, but they feel
that the Internal Econorny Committee should
not have put him in the position in which he
was placed. If that is so, certainly all the

members of the committee must take part of
the blame; and I, being a member, am prepared to take my share of the blame.
Hon. Mr. Aselitine: The members of the
committee should take all the blame.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I said the members of
the committee must take part of the blame.
I meant that the rest of the blame should be
taken by al4 senators generally, because the
report of the Internal Economy Committee
was approved by this house. So we must all
take some of the blame, and some a little
more than others.
I think the letter might have been worded
a little differently, but in all fairness to the
Chief of the Branch, I would point out that
the letter as worded was approved by the
Subcommittee on Stationery, so the Chief
was just working as an agent for the
committee.
I would express my personal opinion now
that if this matter were to corne up again
we should not try to prevent senators from
getting all the stationery they need for their
requirements. I will support a motion to
that effect when the matter comes before the
Committee on Internal Economy at a future
time. In the meantime, I have been assured
that no honourable senator has been refused
stationery. Indeed, it was not the intention
of the committee that any senator should be
refused. I have been assured further that
every honourable senator will receive all the
stationery he requires until the next meeting
of the Committee on Internal Economy and,
I hope, afterwards as well. In view of the
discussion which bas taken place in this
chamber, I think it would be well for the
Committee on Internal Economy to meet in
the near future. As chairman of that committee, I would ask that the committee be
convened.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask a question?
Will the letters continue to be sent out?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, I am only one
member of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Careful!
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would suppose that
unless the Chief of the Stationery Branch
gets instructions to the contrary, he would
continue to carry out his present instructions.
However, there will be a meeting of the
Committee on Internal Economy in the very
near future, and it is unlikely that that
problem will arise.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I suggest that
consideration be given to the appointment
of a new chairman of the subcommittee?

FEBRUARY 14, 1957
The point I would like to make is that
the grain growing and grain marketing
industry is not a local western interest, but
a national matter of first importance. No
subject is more consistently and voluminously
represented in the Statutes of Canada over
the last 50 years than is this one.

SENATE
However, I have an idea that some points of
criticism have been incubating in the back
of his head which might make him willing
to let me be the "goat" on this occasion. He
has been celebrating lately an anniversary
or two, including the fiftieth birthday of the
United Grain Growers Limited, of which he
was the first president.
I would like to draw attention to another
anniversary of equal distinction which is
falling due this year. One of the by-products
of the grain growers' movement in western
Canada, which was largely responsible for
the first federal legislation regarding the
marketing of grain, was a leader who sits
among us today as the oldest living privy
councillor in this Parliament and the fourth
ranking privy councillor in Canada (Hon. Mr.
Crerar). Forty years ago this year, at a time
of crisis in the affairs of this country, he
came direct to Ottawa from the presidency of
the United Grain Growers Company, with
the full approval and support of that cooperative organization, to be Minister of
Agriculture in the Union Government administration of Sir Robert Borden. When the
First World War was over he resigned from
his important ministerial post to become the
political leader of the same agrarian group
which sent him here in the first place and
which had expanded into what became known
as the Progressive party. In the federal election of 1921 that group returned to Parliament a solid block, with the exception of
one seat -

Regina -

of representatives from

the three middle western Prairie provinces.
It is important to record that two years
before, in 1919, not long after he had reresigned from Sir Robert Borden's Government, the first Canadian Wheat Board was
set up by that Government to take charge
of the marketing of wheat during the crop
year 1919-20. That board was established not
so much by reason of the demands from the
producers or the trade of western Canada as
affecting the
because of circumstances
economy of Great Britain and the United
States, whose efforts gradually to liquidate
the accumulation of supplies Canada agreed
to assist. That accumulation had developed
during the last few years of the war; and
I am sure a good many people will remember
that that war came to an earlier conclusion
than even the best informed authorities anticipated. It was a historic year, because it
marked the beginning of a demand from
western grain producers for the continuation
of government control of wheat marketing
through a government wheat board, and it
was one of the issues which had considerable
influence on the outcome of the election of
1921.

When it became evident here in Ottawa
that public opinion elsewhere in the country
was not as favourable to a continuing wheat
board as it was in the western provinces, the
organized farmers, first of Alberta, then of
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, took active steps
towards establishing their own wheat board
in the form of an organization which became
known as Canadian Wheat Producers Limited,
or, in more popular language, the Wheat Pool.
By the year 1925 the wheat pool movement
was going strong, and to it was transferred
much of the vigour and enthusiasm which
marked the rise of the Progressive party.
As the honourable senator from Churchill
can, I am sure, eloquently testify, the Wheat
Pool flourished for five years on a buoyant
world's market for wheat, and then it bit a
toboggan slide with the economic upheaval
which affected all parts of the world in
1929-30. At that time the federal Government, under the Right Honourable R. B.
Bennett, went to the rescue and appointed a
wheat stabilization agency, under the direction of the late John I. McFarland, of Calgary,
to take charge of the Wheat Pool's unmarketed grain. When the Mackenzie King
Government came into power in 1935, and
brought back into office with it the honourable senator for Churchill, a new wheat board
was set up to take the place of the stabilization agency which had been under the direction of Mr. McFarland. That board was
established by the act which it is proposed to
amend today. During the 22 years since the
act was passed, nine amendments to it have
been adopted by the federal Parliament. The
one before us represents the lth; and it,
like the others, has been passed in the House
of Commons without a division. The reason
for this unanimity is the steady and consistent support which the wheat board system
has received from the vast majority of western
producers.
Much has been said, and much still may be
said, as to the respective virtues of private
enterprise and the open marketing system as
compared with the operation of state control
in the disposition of western grain crops. But
there can be no doubt about the support of
the present system by the organized grain
producers in the west and by a very large
section of the trade as well.
When the King Government took office in
1935, one of the declarations of policy which
it brought with it was that "Liberalism is
individualism helped by the state." Those
here who remember that saying will also
recall that it had considerable appeal in certain parts of this country. I contend that
this wheat board legislation, after 22 years,
is pretty fair evidence that the present Government has been loyal and true to the
professions of its predecessor.

FEBRUARY 14, 1957
I have left to the last of my remarks references to the actual operations of the Wheat
Board. Probably some honourable senators
will raise questions and some criticism regarding its performance as a marketing organization. I shall do my best to make anyv contribution I can in that connection, but I
would observe that much information of a
detailed character is contained in the recently published report of the Canadian
Wheat Board for the crop year 1955-56.
And I propose, if the bill is given second
reading, to move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where officials of the Canadian Wheat
Board and of the Department of Trade and
Commerce will be available to furnish detailed information that might be required.
I should like to say now, however, that
I think the Wheat Board has served this
country well and has faced up to a difficult
domestic situation, as well as a baffling international one, with skill and ability. In
the face of disrupted values of monetary
exchanges throughout the world and notwithstanding nature's overly bounteous crops of
recent years which have created unprecedented surpluses in Canada as well as in
the United States, the work of those in charge
of the Wheat Board's operations has in my
opinion, been creditable indeed.
As the Wheat Board's report shows, last
year's exports of wheat and wheat flour,
amounting to almost 310 million bushels,
rank with those of the best years in our
history. There has also been an increasing
domestic consumption of wheat. In the export field there has been a very noticeable
readjustment or reorientation of supplies
from this country to markets where our
wheat previously went in small amounts
only; so at this stage there is every reason
to think that, even with the large surpluses
around us, there will be a far-reaching change
in the development of our grain trade both
within this country and without.
As the minister stated in the other house:

enough to get certain information for me

wonder if he could give me that information

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The honourable Leader

enough to ask in advance for information
as to the supplies of wheat on hand for the
period from October 1955 to October 1956,
and also at January 1956 and January 1957.
I have that information and it is as follows:

perpetuated."

Those words do not come from the senator
from New Westminster, but from a paper in
the midst of the wheat growing district. The
mover of this bill today overlooked one important factor. I am not by any means setting
myself up as an authority on the Wheat Board
Act, because I am not; indeed, many members
here can speak more fluently on the subject,
as, for instance, the honourable senator fron
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
However, I
well remember that in 1935, when the act was
first introduced, many farmers of that day
were very skeptical of the Wheat Board for
one particular reason. If my mernory serves
me, there was quite a strong feeling throughout the country that the farmers were asking
or striving for too high prices for farm produce. The statement was made time and time
again that if care was net taken the various
countries that were buying wheat from
Canada might be forced into the wheat growing business themselves. Many farmers feared
that the setting up of the Wheat Board might
have the effect net of raising prices but of
holding prices down.
Right here, may I point out particularly
to the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that we in British Columbia-and I
say "we" generally-supported the taking of

FEBRUARY 14, 1957
grain out of the Winnipeg Wheat Exchange.
But I remember very well receiving a long
petition when I was the Member of Parliament for New Westminster. There had been
something like 500 names affixed by members
of various farmers organizations in the lower
mainland, supporting a resolution to establish
a wheat marketing board in order to take
the wheat out of gambling, so to speak. When
this resolution came to me, they stated: "If
you do not support this you will receive no
votes from the above signers." I warned them
that they would be called upon to pay for
the wheat. Well, honourable senators, I have
always held that when there is a principle
at stake one should stand for that principle.
I did not support the resolution on that
occasion and, strange to say, I had no difficulty in being re-elected. It shows that the
effect of some of these petitions is not very
great. I mention that by the way.
I want to speak now about the disabilities
that we in British Columbia are suffering
from in relation to Wheat Board regulations.
First of all, the farmers of British Columbia
are suffering from importations of poultry,
turkey, eggs and potatoes from the United
States. Oh, it is not the same as wheat, for
you cannot import any wheat-they have a
closed corporation in the Prairie provinces.
We cannot buy wheat except through the
board; we cannot even buy it from the farmer,
but I will deal with that a little later. Due
to the terrifically high prices of wheat and
feed grains we cannot compete with farmers
in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba who
go into the poultry and turkey raising business, because in most instances they have
and use their own wheat at about half the
cost which we in the province of British
Columbia are compelled to pay, owing particularly to the high freight rates. The flooding of our markets with poultry, eggs, and
like produce is a matter of great concern to
us. The three Prairie provinces are able to
feed poultry with low-cost grain, and that
has quite a bearing on the price which our
farmers receive when they go to market
turkeys, poultry and other farm products for
sale.
Again, in the interior of British Columbia
cattle are being shipped to Alberta to be
finished as beef and are grain fed. The beef
then comes to Vancouver and may go back up
again to the interior, almost to the place
where the cattle were shipped from. We
cannot afford to buy the grain and compete
with Alberta.
In 1956 more than 22 million pounds of
poultry entered Canada from the United
States. Had this poultry been raised in Canada, as it could have been, it would have
created a domestic market for about 125,000
82719-14

tons of wheat from the three Prairie provinces. Is the domestic market to be ignored?
Are we going to let the Prairie farmer say
to us, "I am not interested in what you buy
or what you pay for it; I am just interested in
what wheat we sell abroad"?
May I point out that with respect to one
grade of wheat at least, Durum wheat, the
act allows the charging of a higher price to
the Canadian consumer than to the buyer
abroad. Well, I have heard a lot of complaints about dumping on the part of the
United States, and I am very much against
allow ing that country to send produce here
at lower prices than it is being sold at across
the line. Of course it can be done quite
easily, now that the Canadian dollar is valued
about 4 per cent above the U.S. dollar. But
to allow the Canadian farmer to charge the
domestic market more than a foreign market
is to my mind a form of dumping.
I have the same complaint with respect
to the marketing of potatoes. However, I
am pleased that at last there is some evidence
of progress in this field. But ever since I
have been attending Parliament in Ottawa I
have protested to the utmost of my ability
against the great quantities of potatoes which
come here from the United States. In some
areas down south the growers get as many
as three crops a year to our one. They flood
the Canadian market just when our early
potatoes are ready, and down goes the price.
Honourable senators, I hope that some
arrangement can be arrived at whereby we
will concentrate more effort on farming generally in this country. I am one of those who
believe that farming should not be neglected
but should be encouraged in every province. I
say again what I have said many times: one
of the reasons why we have had difficulty
in getting redress in British Columbia is
that we lack voting strength. If anyone can
contradict that statement, let him do it. We
have too few people and too few members
of parliament interested in agriculture to get
the things we should get. But when the
Prairie provinces go after something they
act as a group, and their voice, certainly here
in Ottawa at least, is a very loud one. The
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) laughs at that, but he knows it is
true; and it would be true regardless of what
party was in power. I am stating facts now,
and I know whereof I speak.
Let me return, however, to the general
question of agriculture. We are being carried away these days by the prophecies and
the rosy pictures painted by the Gordon
report; we are lost in the great dream of
industrial development and a general business boom, with huge pipe lines being built

SENATE
and other ventures bringing millions of dollars to the country. But I think it is well
that we keep in mind the value and use of
the farm land of this country.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: True, Canada has vast
territories, but we must remember that our

The
will be exhausted in this country.
United States has exploited its minerals and
oil, and now it is coming to help us exploit
and take our treasures from the earth.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is it
not a fact that the Bureau of Statisties talks
about the exhaustion of mineral resources
only on the condition that no further discoveries are made?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would assume that the
Bureau of Statistics, with its level-headed
body of men, is well aware of the fact that
there are vast territories in this country
which have never been explored. I assume,
therefore, that that fact would be taken
into consideration.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask what minerals
would be exhausted within a period of 22
years?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not have that information at hand, but I will give it to my honourable friend afterwards. As I recall it, three
minerals were mentioned which would be
exhausted over a period of from 22 to 64
years. When I say I will give my friend the
information afterwards, I do not imply that
there is any secret about it.
Honourable senators, I should like to take
a few moments to discuss land areas in
Canada, in an endeavour to bring home the
fact that, extensive as this country is, it
has not the agricultural land that many
people think it has. We are envisaging a
population of perhaps 30 million people by
the year 1980. If that prediction materializes,
we should be thinking about how these
people are going to be fed. I note according
to the latest Year Book published by the
Bureau of Statistics that the total land area
in Canada is, in round figures, 3,577,000
square miles. Of that area 40 per cent or
some 1,458,000 square miles, is in the Yukon
and the Northwest Territories. The official
figures which I have in my hand give the
agricultural land of all the provinces as
well as for the country as a whole. The
total agricultural land in Canada is estimated
at 552,725 square miles, which is only 15
per cent of the total area. A great deal of
our land is rock and mountain, much of

it is in the frozen north and some of it is
under forest. Indeed, some of our land
should never grow anything else but trees.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Some proper plan should
be inaugurated whereby we could restrict
the land suitable for timber to that purpose
only. I am one of those who believe that
the best way to produce or reproduce timber
is by encouraging the growing of trees by
farmers, instead of mainly by big companies
as we are now attempting to do it.
I note with interest that Saskatchewan has
the largest agricultural area of any province,
amounting to some 128,591 square miles. It
has more agricultural land than either
Ontario or Quebec, which have 100,514 and
64,662 square miles respectively. Of course,
these two provinces have other land which
is very valuable. We are just beginning to
reach down through the rocks for oil and
minerals, but as I mentioned a moment ago
a great deal of the land is used for growing
trees.
Having said that, honourable senators, I
now come to the real purpose which brings
me into this debate, namely, one grievance we
have in the province of British Columbia.
Someone might ask me why I did not take
this grievance to the Government. As everyone knows, an appeal often goes through
either a senator or a member of the House of
Commons to the minister concerned, and in
that way the average citizen may obtain redress of his grievance. I believe if a senator
or member of the House of Commons does not
listen to the appeal of the ordinary ciitzen.
democracy to that extent may be weakened.
So I took this grievance--I was almost going
to say to the foot of the Throne-to the
minister in charge. I am not going to read
the correspondence or say anything about it
other than that I got nowhere and I do not
believe that the matter was ever thoroughly
investigated.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Was your grievance
against the Wheat Board?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, the grievance is against
the Wheat Board. I came to the conclusion
that the Wheat Board is really a monopoly by
itself and evidently cannot be touched by the
Government. That is my belief. At least, you
will hear what the trouble is in just a minute.
We have a co-operative organization about
four miles from where I live, one of the most
successful co-operative associations in the
whole of Canada. It has some 5,000 members
and it does a business of between $4 million
and $5 million a year. The profits are spread
among the members. Most of the business
done is the buying of grain from the Prairies.

FEBRUARY 14, 1957
Now it was found that grain could be
bought at a place called Creston, which is
located in the eastern part of the province,
away up by itself. Creston district grows
wonderful wheat. The farmers there are
under the Canadian Wheat Board and no one
is complaining. They want that. Nor is our
association, the Surrey Co-operative Association, complaining. The buyers went up there
and bought 2,000 tons of wheat. Now, practically the only way to get the wheat out from
that part of British Columbia to where it is
needed and used is through the United States.
And this is where the Wheat Board stepped
m.
Under the Wheat Board Act, as I feel sure
every honourable member knows, wheat cannot be moved from one province to another
without an order from the board. I may be
wrong, but my information is that the three
Prairie provinces have provincial legislation
to control, if they wish to do so, the movement
of wheat within their own provinces, but they
are rather winking at the enforcement of
these laws. We in British Columbia have no
such legislation. The wheat grown in Creston,
British Columbia, comes under the judisdiction of the Canadian Wheat Board. To move
the wheat from Creston to the coast it is
necessary to use truck transport, there being
no railways serving that area, and the trucks
have to enter the United States and follow
along U.S. highways for a certain distance
before re-entering British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The wheat is transported by trucks, you say?
Hon. Mr. Reid: By trucks. There is no
railway there to take it out.
After a certain quantity of wheat was
taken that way through the United States
an order came from the Canadian Wheat
Board to the Customs to the effect that it
was not allowed and must be stopped. The
trucking concern tried to bring one truckload over the mountains, but the truck was
nearly wrecked on a rough road, and I
understand the truck owner refused to make
another try over that route.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if the prohibition was due to the
wheat being transported across an interprovincial boundary?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, it was not that. The
reason is to be found in the provisions of
section 32 of the act and the interpretation of
the wording thereof. The section reads:
Except as permitted under the regulations, no
person other than the board shall
(a) Export from or import into Canada wheat
or wheat products owned by a person other than
the board; . . .
82719-14J

The shipments were stopped in virtue
of that section. The ordinary meaning of the
word "export" as contained in the dictionary
is the sending of goods or merchandise from
one country to another, and "import" means
the bringing of goods into one country from
another. Remember, the wheat in question
was being moved from one part of British
Columbia to another part of British Columbia, all within the provisions of the Act,
yet the Canadian Wheat Board said "You
cannot do it."
Can you understand the feelings of our
5,000 members when they were told that
they were violating the act? There is nothing in the regulations as to this; what
governs is only the Wheat Board's interpretation of the provision.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Did you try taking the
matter to court?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. There are certain
judges before whom I would not like to take
anything of this nature-and that is not to
give you a smart answer.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: You were not exporting
grain by taking it around that way.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We were not exporting
grain and we were not importing it; we were
hauling it for consumption in British Columbia, and using a short stretch of highway in
the United States. But the board said we
could not do that.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: You were within the
law in doing that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We feel we were well within
the law, but we see so many decisions given
against those who tried to go against the
Wheat Board that it makes us hestitate before
taking the matter before a judge. I do not
know what more I can do for our people than
air it here. I placed it before the minister
and nothing was done. I take the stand that
something should be done, but I do not
know how one can make the board see that
export really means export. Their interpretation of the meaning of the word is not
that found in a dictionary.
We feel we are within our rights. We
think we should have the right to take that
wheat from one part of British Columbia
to another, but we are denied it, and I am
rising in my place today to protest against
the denial as strongly as I can.
Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh: Honourable
senators, with regard to what the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) has said about this co-operative association not being able to buy wheat in one part
of the province for delivery in another, I am
inclined to think that if this is so there must

SENATE

be a provincial law involved. In Alberta one
farmer can sell to another, or a farmer can
sell to a feeder, as long as the transaction is
within the province, and I will be surprised
if it is not that way in British Columbia. I
do not know why wheat cannot be transported through the United States. Manufactured articles can be transported from one
part of Canada to another through the United
States, in bond, and I do not know why
wheat cannot be transported in this way.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We were stopped this week.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Probably you did not
put the wheat in bond. It would be necessary to do that.
The honourable senator from New Westminster also said the building of the railway
to Churchill was done for the benefit of the
western farmers. I think his stand is rather
poorly taken. What he says may be true, but
the Canadian Pacific Railway was built to
British Columbia for the benefit of that province, and it probably cost ten times as much
as the Hudson Bay Railway.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It was not built for our
benefit.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: It surely was, just
for British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is nonsense.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: It is no more nonsensical than your statement about building
the railway to Churchill. Also, the bonds
of the Canadian National and the Grand
Trunk Pacific were guaranteed for the same
reason, to help the people of British
Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would like to hire a hall
and debate the matter with you.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: All right, so long as
you don't play the bagpipes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Never mind that. There
would be more sense and harmony in them
than in your speech.

Don't be personal.

Hon. R. B. Horner: I believe the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) could make out a good case before any
judge in British Columbia. All he needs is a
good lawyer.
The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) who introduced the amendment
stated that in the past several months, or at
least until a month or two ago, considerable
sales of wheat have been made abroad. The
explanation of the apparent increase in sales
which was given by Mr. John West, head
of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, is that
when Great Britain withdrew from participation in the International Wheat Agreement
it was believed in several European countries
which purchased wheat that the price would
fall, so they ceased or limited their purchases; but following damage by frost in
France, and rather poor crops generally in
continental countries, there were fairly good
sales to Europe during the past summer.
The speech of the honourable senator from
Ottawa has not given us much encouragement for the future, which is a matter I
personally am very much concerned about
in view of the union of European states which
is now under way, and which no doubt will
be joined by Great Britain. The subject was
referred to by the honourable senator from
New Westminster, but he did not develop his
views as to its special significance to Canada.
Since these European countries have replenished their stocks there has been, in the
last month or two, a great falling off in our
expert sales of grain. Altogether the picture
is net very bright. I would like te see some
solid grounds for optimism in the coming
year.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask a question of
the senator from New Westminster? He complains that the Wheat Board prevented
buyers of grain from carrying wheat from
one part of British Columbia to another because it had to be moved some distance
through the United States. Did those who
were shipping wheat in that way by truck
attempt to bond the grain before they moved
it; and would it not have been possible for
them to do so? In short, was the wheat
bonded?

Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: The honourable senator said something to the effect that there is
not much more land in Canada available for
agricultural purposes. Only this morning we
received some figures from an expert in the
Department of Agriculture who has made a
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not sure. I do know
study and survey across the country. He told
that these people carried about 1,500 tons

Board, transport was stopped.

for settlement.

FEBRUARY 14, 1957
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: If honourable senators will allow me to add a few words to my
remarks, I should like to point out to the
honourable senator from New Westminster
that a few years ago, to help the people of
British Columbia, we voted millions of dollars
for the Pacifie and Great Eastern Railroad.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I was never in favour of
that project. It was just throwing good
money after bad.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: No matter whether
the honourable senator favoured it or not,
the money was voted.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Crerar, the debate
was adjourned.

most lucid and thorough manner.
The

SENATE

amendments have now been before the house
for some time, and only one member has
criticized them or claimed that they are not
in the interests of the committee or its work.
May I say to honourable senators that the
work of the Divorce Committee is exacting,
aemanding and almost continuous during sessions of Parliament. Naturally some of us,
at least those of us who have served some
eleven years as active members of the committee, have formed certain opinions about
the procedure we think should be followed.
We feel that the work and achievements of
the committee would be enhanced by adopting this series of amendments. We feel that
the rules should be streamlined to be in
keeping with present-day demand and to
coincide as closely as possible with rules
of procedure followed in provincial courts,
especially in Ontario. We believe that if
we adopt these amendments they will result
in greater uniformity in procedure and the
better operation of the committee.
The Divorce Committee as at present constituted is a most efficient branch of the
Senate. The work is well organized; and the
members, who have been very faithful in their
attendance, are able to cope with the volume
of work placed before them. The chairman
has shown special organizational ability in
addition to his energetic approach to the work
and his special legal talents.
In its peak year the Divorce Committee inquired into 402 petitions. If the committee
were divided into four subcommittees, each
subcommittee without undue pressure could
handle five undefended cases a day. Under
those circumstances the committee could
easily accomplish its work during a session
of Parliament. Defended cases are more
tedious, of course, but there are not so many
of them and usually they are heard by a
committee presided over by the chairman
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I mention this because
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) expressed fear that the committee would become bogged down in its work
if these recommendations were adopted, and
that if we lost the present chairman nobody
else could or would take his place on the
committee. I do not think this is so. I think
the Senate is a big enough institution to have
the work of this committee carried out regardless of changes in membership fom time
to time.
The honourable senator from Rosetown
made a very interesting speech. He wanted
it to be helpful and I feel it was. In my
opinion his mild criticism of the amendments
was helpful, by way of confirming our belief
that they would be beneficial.
He took a lot of time to explain why during
his régime as chairman of the committee no

amendments were made to the Senate rules
on divorce. I served with him on the committee for some years and I know he was
most industrious and did his work well, as
did the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), who acted as subchairman.
They did an enormous amount of work, but
they did not quite organize it as well as it is
organized now, and I do not think they had
the capacity for work that the present committee has.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: We had no trouble. We
each took seven or eight cases a day and we
had no trouble at all in handling them.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: My honourable friend is
absolutely right.
However, he said the rules on Senate
divorce were drafted when divorce matters
in Canada were in their infancy. That being
a long time ago, would it not be natural to
assume that some changes should be made in
them now?
The honourable gentleman said that when
he came here first he was disturbed by the
rules. I will quote his words from Hansard
of February 6, at page 141:
When I found out that the Senate rules did not
require the co-respondent to be named or served,
it bothered me quite a bit. I was of the opinion
that in Parliamentary divorce petitions, as in court
cases, the co-respondent should be named and that
he or she should be served with the papers.

Then my friend went on to tell us why he
had changed his mind; he said that he had
talked to some older members of the Senate
who had served as chairmen of the committee
and they had stated their reasons for not
advocating changes in the rules. In reading
their names, and knowing something of the
history of the Senate, I will admit they were
distinguished men. My honourable friend cited
three of the reasons, which seemed to please
him. First, the independence of the Senate
committee. Members of the committee, it was
said, did not want to be circumscribed by too
many rules, but preferred to deal with each
case on its merits. Also it was pointed out
that the committee has power to recommend
a divorce for any reason agreed upon by the
members.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that
rules are necessary, especially on the fundamental matters. If there were no rules to
guide the Divorce Committee there would be
confusion. For one thing, the committee could
not carry on without rules to govern its internal operation. Then again, solicitors coning before the committee should know what
they have to face. Without rules to guide or
direct them, they could not be in a position
to bring their cases intelligently before the
committee or to serve their clients properly.

FEBRUARY 14, 1957
My honourable friend cited another reason.
His point was that the naming of corespondents would lead to more divorces. He
said that if, for instance, a woman learned
that her husband was a co-respondent in a
case, she would probably seek a divorce from
him. I do not think that argument has much
weight. When a man files a divorce petition
against his wife it is very seldom that the
co-respondent is not known; in fact, the corespondent is usually named in the petition.
If any honourable senator will look through
the files, as I have done, he will find that in
almost every case where a husband brings a
petition against his wife he names the corespondent.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Lots of petitions are by
the wife against her husband.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Oh, I agree. The
last reason given by former chairmen
to my honourable friend for not making
any change in the rules was that parliamentary divorce would soon be done away
with. In this, of course, they were wrong.
I do not think it is the function of the
Senate Committee on Divorce to protect iniquity or social errors. The duty of the
committee is to find out the truth and to
deal justly. I think that to plead that
adultery has been committed with an unknown person leads to connivance and collusion, and almost allows perjury to be
committed with impunity. I feel it is safer
to name the co-respondent and that this
should be done wherever possible, just as it
is in the courts. The court rules require it,
and I think our committee's rules also should
require it. If we adopt such a rule there
is an escape clause, so to speak, because
section 4 of rule 135 says that the committee
may use its discretion, so if under certain
conditions it considers that in the interest
of all concerned the name should not be
given it can act accordingly and no injustice
will be done.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), in his splendid speech
of yesterday, said there might be less
"monkey business" if the name and the address
of the co-respondent were known, or, otherwise, if a diligent search were made to the
satisfaction of the Divorce Committee. Well,
often it is in cases in which the co-respondent
is a "person unknown" that the "monkey
business" comes in. A senator does not need
to be a member of the Divorce Committee
very long to know the kind of set-up where
the evidence is supplied, and to realize that
many of these cases are not genuine cases
at all.
My honourable friend from Rosetown said
that the Divorce Committee sits in camera.

But, after ail, any solicitor is allowed to be
present, as is any senator or member of the
House of Commons. And some 300 or more
copies of the printed evidence are distributed
among senators, members of the House of
Commons, officials and so on. It seems to me
that distribution provides lots of opportunity
for advertising, so there is no point in saying
that the committee sits in camera, or that
these cases are not for the public to see.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I did not give that as
a reason at all. What are you talking about?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is right here in
HansardHon. Mr. Aseltine: I was merely comparing
our procedure with that of the courts.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I will take my honourable friend's word for that.
My honourable friend suggested there would
be a bogging down of the committee because
of applications to proceed without naming
the co-respondent. I think the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) answered that point completely. My
honourable friend from Rosetown said that
out of 356 cases he had looked into, only 85
co-respondents were known, and that it
would be a tremendous task to examine every
petitioner who had not named a co-respondent, in an effort to ascertain who the
co-respondent really was.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That was not the argument at all.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: In the first place, his
arithmetic was a little out. He figured that
the co-respondent would not be named in
about 300 cases, but the number would be
considerably less than that.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: For many years during
the time I was chairman of the committee
there were more than 300 cases in which the
co-respondent was not known.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes, that is true.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: You know that is
correct.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: That may be true, and
I know you were quoting from records. I
am simply repeating what you said, that in
only 85 cases the co-respondent was known.
I think that if the rules required the naming
of the co-respondent they would be complied
with. The Divorce Committee deals with
only about 400 cases a year, whereas the
courts in Ontario deal with thousands. From
what I have heard, the Ontario courts are
not bogged down by reason of the fact that
they require the co-respondent to be named.
Reference has been made to Newfoundland. Well, Newfoundland has not yet been

SENATE
badly struck by this disease. In 1955 only
one case came out of that province. I think
that section 2 of the proposed new Rule 147,
which allows the use of affidavits to prove
certain facts, would help reduce the cost
of obtaining a parliamentary divorce in that
province.
Honourable senators, I should like to deal
for a few moments with the report prepared
by Mr. Gilman, the Chief Treasury Officer
of the Senate. Now, he is a competent accountant, and I know it is dangerous to dispute the figures of a good accountant. However, I should like to make one or two
comparisons.
Mr. Gilman estimates the cost of processing
a divorce through the Senate to be $235.
Under our Rule 40 we require the petitioner
to pay $210 for a divorce case. On this
computation the Senate loses money on each
case it hears. But let me point out that the
fees paid to Parliament for bills of
divorce heard and recommended during 1956
amounted to $73,595, which amount was paid
into the general fund. Now if a divorce court
had to be set up in Quebec or some other
part of Canada, I do not think $75,000 would
cover the cost.
It is a sound business principle that if you
can do more business with the same overhead
you will likely make a profit. The staff of
the Senate which serve the divorce committee
on certain days of the week are regular
employees of the Senate. Sometimes they
are busy and sometimes they are not. But
in order to keep competent help the Senate
has to pay them, whether there is work to
be done or not. The Divorce Committee
gives full employment to certain members
of the staff who might not be kept busy at
other duties. For instance, the Senate will
adjourn this afternoon until Tuesday night,
but the Divorce Committee will be sitting
tomorrow morning and certain members of
the staff will be working there.
So, honourable senators, I do not think we
can say that this committee costs the country
any fixed amount of money. Certainly, all
other committees of Parliament are run at
the expense of the country, and are not expected to make a profit. Why should we say
that the Divorce Committee, which is fuifilling a duty placed upon it by the British
North America Act, should make a profit?
Do the provincial courts of the land which
hear divorce cases make a profit? I do not
think so. It does not cost very much to apply
for a divorce in a provincial court. Perhaps
our fees here are too high. Much has been
said about the hardship on poor people who
apply to Parliament for a divorce. Well, may
I say that poor people usually have a genuine

case. Frequently they do not hire professional witnesses, because they know from
their friends and relations what is going on,
and they know who the co-respondent is.
Furthermore, in many cases we remit a part
of the fees paid by people in unfortunate
financial circumstances.
In that way the
cost of a parliamentary divorce is not a great
burden to those who can least afford it.
I believe the Divorce Committee has a good
record. As I have said, it showed an income
last year of $73,595, which goes into the
general fund; and it uses the services of the
regular staff of the Senate. In my opinion,
it is one of the most efficient branches of the
Government service.
In conclusion, let me say that the Divorce
Committee deals very closely with human
nature, and therefore has a most important
work. It considers the problems of human
relations which have gone stale and turned
sour. That being so, its work is worthy of
the attention of the most capable members of
the Senate. While some persons say the
work of the committee is sordid and not very
elevating, it is rendering a valuable service
to our citizens and is maintaining harmony
in a province which does not want a divorce
court. So, the set-up would seem to be
generally satisfactory.
With respect to the naming of the corespondent, I think we should demand that
he or she be named, except in extraordinary
circumstances. Above all, we should keep
our standards high, and by our attention to
the work of the committee impress upon all
who appear before us that they should not
treat lightly the marriage vows which they
have solemnly taken. The new rules will, I
think, make divorce cases more genuine and
dissolution of marriage more difficult to
procure.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I rise to say a few words in this debate with
a good deal of hesitation and misgiving, because it is largely a problem for those learned
in the law. Some very fine contributions to
the debate have been made by the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) who has a wealth of experience
in this field, the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), and the
honourable gentleman who has just taken
his seat (Hon. Mr. Kinley).
I favour the amendments to the divorce
rules because I believe they will result in
fewer divorces in Canada. If co-respondents
are to be named in petitions, I think people
will hesitate before they become corespondents and project themselves between
husband and wife.

FEBRUARY 14, 1957

I realize that in Canada divorce cannot be
obtained for extreme cruelty, complete and
hopeless insanity, or for a long period of
desertion. But I do believe we have gone
off on a tangent in the granting of divorces
on the ground of adultery, either committed
or pretended to have been committed. Each
case which comes before the committee is
of course a domestic tragedy, and we fully
appreciate that some are not as genuine as
they may seem to be. I believe the corespondent should be named, and, if named,
notified of the hearing and allowed to put
in a defence. I would go further and say
that a co-respondent should be punished.
Adultery, which is a moral crime, should be
a crime against the laws of the land. If
punishment were provided, I believe there
would be fewer divorces.
It has been said in a news item that the
Divorce Committee recommends a bill if
adultery has been committed at divers
times and places. That is not the fact. The
committee demands that a specific time and
place be alleged and proven by the petitioner.
It has been said that the Senate is a
divorce mill. Let me say this: we do not
break up homes; they are hopelessly broken
up before the parties come to us. It has
also been said that the children involved
suffer most. In many cases that may be so.
But the children brought up in a home where
there is hatred, constant quarrelling and
infidelity, are reared in a bad atmosphere.
We admire the woman who will stand up and
say that despite the fact that she knows her
husband is liable for the maintenance of the
children if a divorce is granted, she is prepared to take care of them herself. That is
a spirit which we often meet.
In closing, I would suggest that further
amendments should at some time be submitted. In the darkest part of East Africa,
which I had the privilege of visiting recently,
the inhabitants practise plural marriages. In
that country when a young man becomes of
age his parents pick out a wife for him.
When they have lived together for a period
of time and reared a number of children,
the wife helps the husband choose a second
wife, and perhaps a third and even a fourth
one. But the first wife is always the queen
bee, so to speak, and the others are more or
less slaves to her. However, today those
plural marriages are being discouraged even
in that dark country.
At one time the North American Indian
had more than one wife, but that practice
has now been given up. For many years
there was a great struggle in one of the
western states against polygamy.
The
practice had the sanction of and was urged
by the church, but it was against the laws

of the land. Several laws were passed before
an effective one was found. During those
years the Government sent out marshals to
track down cases of multiple marriages and
obtain proof of cohabitation. This proved
difficult, because when the news came that
a marshal was approaching a town or village
the people would ring a bell and the extra
wives would run and hide. However, in
cases in which satisfactory evidence was
found the parties were punished by imprisonment for as long as five years.
But here in Canada a man can go to his
wife and say, "I am done with you; I have
transferred my affections to someone else,"
and he can openly and boldly go and live
with another woman.
This is a very
unfortunate state of affairs, and indicates
that we are not as far advanced as are the
people in some other parts of the world.
When I am not in Ottawa, I work for a
railway company. If there is some discord in
the homes of employees, the head of the
brotherhood or the head of the women's
organization or the assistant superintendent
of the railway, as the case may be, will go
and talk to those people in language that they
can understand. Very often conditions are improved in this way. These officials have a
good deal of influence, because they can tell
a person that if a certain thing is not stopped
he will be put out of the brotherhood, or lose
his job or something like that.
I believe that if a marriage consultant or a
marriage adviser contacted unhappily married
couples in the early stages of their discord a
good deal could be done to lower the number
of divorces. I do say that our rules should be
continuously and diligently reviewed in the
hope of improving conditions in the homes of
such people. If we can be the means of a
little more contentment and happiness coming
into some of these homes we shall be doing
something really worth while.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, if I speak now I will close the
debate.
The Hon.

the

Acting Speaker: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I can assure the house
that at five o'clock in the afternoon, and with
a very thin house, I will speak very shortly.
To begin with, I have already addressed the
house on this question fairly fully and in
detail. As a matter of fact I have spoken
three times. This will be the fourth address
in connection with these rules. So it is not
necessary for me to say a great deal, and in
fact the case bas been very thoroughly
covered by the honourable senators who have
spoken.
The senator from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Kinley) dropped the remark that the

SENATE
work of the Senate Committee is exacting,
and it is. I think the members of the committee are entitled to expect a sympathetic
consideration of their problems when they
come before this house, and I am grateful
and glad to say that that sympathetic consideration has been extended to us in ample
measure. I am very pleased indeed by the
reception which the committee at all times
receives.
I have expressed my gratitude on previous
occasions, and there is no reason why I should
not express it again, for the loyal and intelligent support which I receive as chairman
of this committee.
Now, I suppose I should not single out any
one. I said I was going to make a short
speech and I am. I feel that after the address
made yesterday by the honourable senator
from Vancouver-South (Hon. Mr. Farris) I
could well rest my case, and I want to thank
him for that address. My honourable friend
has had a long experience of distinguished
service at the bar of British Columbia, of
which he was at one time Attorney General,
and many years of practice before the highest
court of the dominion.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would like to say that
I came from New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is indeed a compliment to New Brunswick, although the
honourable senator did not mean it in that
way.
Well, I thank him for the skill with which
he presented the case and the knowledge and
experience which he brought to his decision.
I thank the member for Queens-Lunenburg
for the effort that he has just put forth, and
I also thank the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw).
Now may I say something about the address
of the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). It would be a mistake,
I think, to picture the honourable gentleman,
a former chairman of this committee, as in
any way opposed to the committee's recommendations for amendments of the rules.
As a matter of fact, in his opening statement
he said that he wished to be helpful, and I
think he was helpful in the address which
he delivered. He bas brought up more new
material than anybody else, including the
present speaker, and has furnished reasons
for thought in connection with the whole
matter, and so I thank him. I would be
sorry indeed if anybody pictured the former
chairman of the Divorce Committee as opposed in any way to the present chairman in
the endeavour we are putting forth.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There is no opposition
whatever.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not a bit. The honourable senator's speech was friendly, and it
was thoughtful. This is not an argument we
are conducting, and certainly I am engaging
in no contest with him, although I join with
him in discussion of the problems involved.
Some of the things the honourable senator has said stimulate thought. For instance,
he pointed out that there are some differences
between our committee and the courts of the
provinces. We do not take evidence on commission. When I took over the chairmanship
that struck me very forcibly and on many
occasions I discussed the question of bringing
in new rules giving us power to send commissions abroad and into our provinces.
To those who are not members of the
committee may I say that to send a commission abroad means that in the course of a
case the committee, or a court, directs authority to some person resident in another province or abroad to take evidence. That person
notifies the parties, and they appear with
their witnesses. Statements are taken down,
cross-examination takes place, and the transcript of evidence comes back to the court of
origin. That makes it unnecessary to bring
witnesses across the sea or, for instance,
from Newfoundland to Ottawa to give their
evidence. I think that we ought to have that
same power which the courts of the provinces have. I am indebted to the honourable
senator from Rosetown for bringing up the
subject because I think we had better consider it next session.
The honourable senator also mentioned
that there is no provision in the Senate
procedure for examination for discovery. I
am not so concerned about that, because it
is the rule in most of the provinces and in
England that admissions made in an examination for discovery shall not be acted upon by
a court of trial. Admissions of this kind are
serious matters, and the courts have held
that such admissions must be made in the
court itself, where the parties can be observed by the judge. Further, it is not possible in examining a witness for discovery to
put questions to him that may show him to
be guilty of adultery. So in these matters
the examination for discovery is not as useful
as it is in other types of cases.
The honourable senator also said, in differentiating our court from other courts, that
a trial elsewhere is in open court. I do not
know that that is so great a difference as it
may appear at first glance to be. The Divorce
Committee meets in camera, but not behind
sealed doors. Any person with reasonable
grounds for being present is welcome to come
in and sit down and examine what we are
doing. Members of Parliament attend, and

FEBRUARY 14, 1957
so may anybody else who has a legitimate
interest. But the big consideration is that
the evidence is printed and a fairly large
number of copies is distributed. The honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg estimated the number at 300 or more. We send
copies to members of Parliament, though
not to all of them, because if a member
signifies that he does not require a copy we
strike him off the list. But 260 or more members of the House of Commons are entitled
to the record: when all the chairs are filled,
102 members of this house are also entitled
to it; 10 copies are sent to or reserved for
the use of the parties; and at the present
time 25 copies are kept in reserve. We have
been told that some of these copies are
thrown into waste paper baskets and distributed among janitors and others; some
have actually turned up and have been read
in the schools. So the proceedings are far
from secret; and anyway, I do not like
secrecy. Really, the trial before the committee is as much in an open court as if it were
in one of the courts of the provinces. Perhaps it attracts more attention here than it
would there.
The honourable senator said that the
Divorce Committee is not a court. I think
some elucidation is required. I suggest that
by any dictionary definition it is a court. I
looked up the dictionary definition of "court"
and find that it is "the session of a judicial
assembly". That makes it, in ordinary parlance, a court. It is not, if you please, according to judicial decision, a court for the purposes of the Criminal Code, or rather, of one
section of the code which makes criminal
the fabrication of evidence for use before a
court. Under that section someone was convicted of fabricating evidence for use before
our committee, and it was held that for the
purposes of that section we were not a court,
so the conviction was quashed. But although
in respect of that section the Divorce Committee is not a court, it is so for all other
purposes. It sits as a judicial committee and
gives judgment.
It may be said that it does not give judgment, that it simply recommends its decisions
to Parliament. Well, so does the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council, which is the
highest court of Great Britain and until recently was the highest court for this country.
Its judgments are in the form of advice to
the sovereign as to how the case before it
should be decided. Our committee operates
in exactly the same way. We send our recommendation to the Senate; from the Senate it
goes to the Commons; and it is finally passed
into law. In my judgment, therefore, it is a
court. Furthermore, in the conduct of its
proceedings it is required to apply the rules

of evidence; that is, the rules of the Canada
Evidence Act, which are those contained in
the Evidence Act of the province in which
the proceedings take place. So we conduct
our proceedings according to law and according to the Evidence Acts of Canada and of
Ontario, and we do so as strictly as it is done
in any court.
My honourable friend said that he did not
like too many rules. I agree with him that
rules should be as short as is compatible with
clearness and that unnecessary rules should
not be passed. But the rules we are considering are not restrictive so far as our
tribunal is concerned; they are to apply to
those who practise before the tribunal, and if
anybody is bound by them, it is the litigant
rather than ourselves.
There are only two matters of any importance before the house in respect of this
change in the rules. The first is that both
the petitioner and, if the case is contested, his
opponent shall supply each other and ourselves with a concise statement of the facts
upon which they rely. We need that provision; its importance was strongly impressed
on me in a case which was before us recently. The respondent, a woman, contested
the petition, went into the box and pleaded
not guilty, whereupon the solicitor for the
petitioner launched a cross-examination
about almost everything in her life. What
could the chairman say? As there was no
statement available of the facts on which the
petitioner's counsel relied, the committee
could not rule that his cross-examination
was not pertinent. The best I could do was
to intimate that the committee relied on the
good judgment of counsel not to waste our
time. Had we had before us a statement
of the grounds on which the respondent relied
I could have very quickly ruled that what
counsel was asking was not pertinent to the
proceedings. But under the circumstances
the hearing dragged along and along: I suppose an hour was wasted in that crossexamination.
The committee was greatly
handicapped by the absence of a concise
statement of facts, and both parties were
handicapped as well, because neither had
given the other in the pleadings a statement
of the facts on which he or she relied. However, we are unanimous as far as this point
is concerned. But let us not forget that we
are asking for a very much needed revision
of the rules in that particular.
The other important amendment has to do
with naming the co-respondent. The argument against adopting this amendment is
twofold. First of all, it is said that the innocent party may learn of the facts and, as I
have heard it put on several occasions, this
may result in another divorce case.
There

SENATE

is something to be said for secrecy in the
carrying out of proceedings of this kind, but
over the years and down through the centuries we of the Anglo-Saxon race, at least those
of us who have had some knowledge of Star
Chamber proceedings, have come to the conclusion that secrecy is a bad thing in the
administration of justice and that, speaking
generally, it is advantageous to let in the
light of day. It is usually a matter of suspicion when anybody covers anything up, and
in the long run it does not work out.
But this is not a case of secrecy. As I have
already said, we publish the evidence, which
is given by the parties who go in the box and
swear to tell the truth and the whole truth.
Well, telling the whole truth involves giving
the name of the co-respondent, if it is known,
and of course the name goes into the record
and is spread all over the place. I am sure
it usually goes back to everyone interested
in the particular case.
So it is not a question of covering up or of
giving publicity. It is a question of timing
as to when you disclose the name of the corespondent-whether you disclose it before
the trial or during the trial and publish it
afterwards. My submission to the bouse is
that it is better to disclose the name of the
co-respondent before the trial, so that be
may have an opportunity to appear and defend himself against any charge of adultery,
and in this way assist the committee in coming to a righteous decision with respect to
the charge.
It seems to be almost indecent to have a
proceeding where a man accuses bis wife
of committing adultery and not have the
third party informed that divorce proceedings
are going to take place in which he is involved; and then publish his name afterwards, as we do in the printed report of our
divorce proceedings. I think that is deplorable. It is certainly in bad form and it does
not work out well at all.
Another point made in this connection is
that if we require the naming of the corespondent it will throw a greater burden
upon the members of the committee. Well,
it is the members themselves who are asking
for the adoption of these amendments and I
can assure the bouse that these members are
prepared to accept this burden if it will make
their work more effective and just.
But will it? To begin with, let me explain
that it is not intended, as has been suggested,
that in some 300 cases where the name of the
co-respondent is said to be unknown, the committee will call before it all the petitioners,
their solicitors, witnesses and so on, in order
to determine whether the name must be given.
That would indeed be a cumbersome procedure, but if the committee is empowered to

do so it will require the solicitors in these
cases to prepare an affidavit setting out the
facts with regard to the unsuccessful efforts
that have been made to ascertain the name
of the co-respondent.
I picture that each year when Parliament
assembles a subcommittee of one or two mem-

bers of the Divorce Committee, with the assistance of the officers of the committee, will
go over these affidavits and in bona fide cases
give the petitioners permission to proceed
without naming the co-respondent. Where
there is any ground for suspicion or where
in our judgment an affidavit is insufficient in
respect to the naming of the third party, we
will demand an explanation from the solicitors. Perhaps their eloquence may carry the
day, or we may not give them the permission
they seek. It will all depend upon the good
judgment of the committee, something upon
which you have always relied in the past and
upon which I think you can rely today.
Just think of 85 cases in which the corespondent was admitted to be known as compared with approximately 300 cases in which
the petitioner swore that he did not know the
name of the person with whom he accused
bis spouse of committing adultery. The thing
is ridiculous! Of course, in most cases he
knew. In the very last case that I read-I
did not hear the evidence, but I reviewed the
record and consulted with the subcommittee
on it-the petitioner pleaded in her petition
that her husband had committed adultery
with "a female person whose name is unknown to your petitioner". Then she got in
the witness box and swore that her husband
had told her he was leaving ber to go and
live with a person she then named. It was a
flagrant piece of perjury, if you like, and it
was fraud as against the committee. I can
assure you that this particular divorce will
not be granted unless at least counsel for the
petitioner explains this apparent perjury in
the petition taken by him and sworn to by bis
client.
Now, what would the case be if these
recommendations are adopted? Counsel would
have to have the petitioner swear an affidavit
stating she did not know the name, why she
did not know it and the facts upon which she
relied. Then we would look at that affidavit
when Parliament assembled, and if it seemed
bona fide and satisfactory we would give permission to proceed without naming the corespondent.
It was suggested that we ask the Law
Clerk of the Senate to hear these applications, but after my explanation of the way
we intend to handle this by affidavit, nobody
would suggest that the Law Clerk be burdened
with work of this kind. I do not think it
is his duty, and I would hesitate very much

FEBRUARY 14, 1957

indeed ta ask him ta perform it. The honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) suggested that it would fall upon the
shoulders of the chairman to perform this
work, and I suppose in a large measure it
would. But in these circumstances and in
my desire to improve the proceedings of the
Divorce Committee, I arn prepared ta take
on a full share of the work. It would probably
fail ta a cammittee of two members ta laok
aver the affidavits and decide which petitians
should be allowed to proceed without naming
the co-respondent, what parties should be
called before the committee, and s0 on.
There was one other matter which the
honourable senator from Rosetown brought
Up and which I should like to discuss. I
refer ta the cast of advertising. I cannat
discuss this subjeet naw, for I have flot all
the facts and figures before me, but I can
say that we are naw calling upon these
people, many of them who are very poar,
ta spend much too mucli money on useless
advertising in cannection with these cases.
But that matter is flot before us taday. Perhaps next session, or at same other session, the
questions of commission evidence, examination for discovery, and waste of money an
What
advertising, will ail be considered.
we have before us now is, first the requirement that the litigants corne ta each other

and ta us with a concise statement of the
facts upan which they rely, whitch they do not
do now; secondly, that when one spouse
accuses the other of adultery he or she shall
name the other persan accused of the matrimonial off ence, and that persan shall be
served with notice of aur proceedings, and
have the apportunity ta defend his or her
reputatian if desiraus of doing Sa.
In closing, honourable senatars, I wish ta
say that the cammittee will appreciate yaur
concurrence in these amendments. We wili
thank you for your assistance in carrying
on this work in an efficient and capable
manner.

Honourable senators, may I take this opportunity to make a brief statement on the
work of the Divorce Committee? At the main
session of Parliament last year the time
limited for filing petitions for bills of divorce
expired on February 20, 1956. At the present
session the expiry date was yesterday, February 18. I have here a table showing comparable statistics as of the expiry date in
each of these sessions:

*441 represents an increase of 6 over the petitions filed at the 1956 session of Parliament.

Honourable senators, it will be noted that
the committee has dealt with 40 petitions
more this session than it dealt with in the
same length of time last year, and I think
that is an indication of the industry of the
members of the committee. By way of general
comment, it can be said that we are making
reasonable progress.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
gentleman what progress the divorce bills
are making in their passage through the House
of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That I cannot answer.
Some divorce bills were being dealt with
there this very afternoon, but I have heard
very little about any debate on the bills
in that house. I am not much concerned
about discussion of divorce bills by members
of the other house: usually it does not involve
the merits of particular cases, but rather
marks an occasion when someone wishes to
get a little publicity in the newspapers.

FEBRUARY 19, 1957
SENATE CHAMBER
REPORT OF SUBCOMMITTEE
PRECINCTS

ON SENATE

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Would the
honourable Leader of the Government be
kind enough to give a report on the progress
of the repairs to this chamber?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: I must thank the
honourable gentleman from De la Durantaye
for giving me notice of this question.
Honourable senators will recall that when
Parliament prorogued on August 14 last year
a subcommittee of three, composed of the
honourable Senators Dessureault, John J. Connolly and myself, had been appointed by
the Internal Economy Committee to continue
the work that had already been started in
connection with certain improvements to
this chamber. After prorogation the Clerk
of the Senate again got in touch with the
Department of Public Works and requested
that the work proceed as soon as possible.
The work did proceed, although there is
not much evidence of it at the present time.
It has been intimated that this small subcommittee probably did not do much during
the recess. I can assure honourable senators
that it was very faithful to its task. We had
a number of meetings between September
and November. One member, the honourable
senator from Stadacona (Hon. Mr. Dessureault), came from Quebec to attend three
meetings, at his own expense.
The problems which we had to look into
were four in number. I will refer first to
the lighting. I think honourable senators
will agree that there has been a considerable
improvement in the lighting of this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is not perfect yet,
and the engineers are endeavouring to make
further improvements. We found that the
defect in the lighting was not entirely due to
the lighting system itself but was connected
with the condition of the walls of the chamber. Honourable senators will observe that at
present the stone walls are practically white,
or at least they are the natural colour of the
stone. It may not be generally recalled that
when we left this chamber on the 14th of
August last the stonework was almost black.
I am informed that it had not been cleaned
since the chamber was built. Of course, so
long as the walls of the chamber were black
there was little or no reflection of light. The
stonework in the galleries was in an even
more disgraceful condition than it was in the
chamber itself. The improvement in the
lighting is due to the cleaner walls and increased wattage of the bulbs in the ceiling

fixtures. But I repeat that our efforts have
not ceased and we intend to get even better
lighting if possible.
The subcommittee also found that the surface condition of the woodwork was not very
good, that it too needed cleaning. However,
the woodwork could not be cleaned until the
stonework was cleaned. The cleaning of the
stonework took a long time, because there is
no machinery that can be used to do that
work: scaffolding had to be erected and every
square foot of that stonework was cleaned by
hand.
The windows of the chamber were the next
problem we faced. That problem was directly
connected with the lighting. It had been
brought to the attention of the subcommittee
that the windows up near the ceiling are not
appropriate for the chamber. We had representatives from the Department of Public
Works at our meetings and a certain type of
glass was examined. We thought it was satisfactory, and had some put in the far window,
but we found that the sunlight came through
too strongly. It will be appreciated that we
must have a glass which, while allowing the
light to come in, will not admit sunrays so
powerful that honourable senators sitting
opposite cannot look at the light. So we
started all over again and considered another
type of glass and we believe that this glass,
which is similar to that in the far window on
the left-hand side of the chamber, will be
satisfactory. To instal it will take some time,
as all the framework must be removed. The
new glass is on hand, and if there had been
sufficient time last year it would have been
in place by now. The work will be done as
soon as possible.
We have been asked to obtain a new carpet.
Application was accordingly made to the
Department of Public Works, and the new
carpet is on hand; but honourable senators
will realize that if it were laid while the dirty
work incidental to the installation of the
glass is being carried on, it might soon be
ruined. It has therefore been decided not to
lay the carpet until the woodwork has been
cleaned and new glass put in the windows.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is the carpet to which the

Mr. Macdonald) refers intended for the floor

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What is wrong with the
present carpet?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is

The

subcommittee was authorized to obtain a new
carpet and it has done so. If the honourable

senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
will look more closely at the carpet now on
the floor lie will see that in many places it is
worn down to the welt. It will not be entirely
discarded; the portions which can be used
will be placed in various rooms. But in
many places it is worn beyond repair, and
the committee feels that the chamber is
worthy of a new carpet.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon.

Mr.

Macdonald:

Another

problem

with which we were presented was the air
conditioning of the chamber. Experts were
called before us; several proposals were
made; and one of them, which we think is
satisfactory, was accepted. It will provide
for ingress of air from the sides of the
chamber, but at points higher than where it

comes in at the present time.

improve the acoustic properties of the room.
When the chamber was first used the walls
were bare, and the echo of voices was so
great it was impossible for honourable senators to be clearly understood when addressing the house. To improve this condition the
authorities had some wadding, from six to
twelve inches thick, placed on certain parts
of the walls. This wadding was covered by
light canvas, which in turn was covered by
paintings.
The subcommittee felt it might be advisable to have the present paintings replaced
by murals depicting typical Canadian scenes,
including perhaps a scene from each World
War. I suppose everyone who thinks he has
an appreciation of art will have his own idea
of what should be hung on the walls, but that
is not our problem at the moment. Our problem is to decide what it would be feasible to
put up, for the acoustical engineers are not
sure that murals would be satisfactory if an
amplification system were installed. They
admit this poses quite a problem, but they
are still inquiring into it.
Another thing that has to be decided is
what equipment should be installed. Many
people are strenuously opposed to the idea of
stringing microphone wires from the top of,
this beautiful ceiling.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It certainly would not look
good.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I, too, arn inclined to
think that way, but this is a matter which

between the middle of November and the end
of the year had to be set aside.
Now, what about the future? We hope that,
as soon as Parliament prorogues, work will
start immediately on the air-conditioning
system, the windows and the cleaning of the
woodwork. When that has been accomplished
the new carpet can be laid. At the same time
the work on the amplification system will
continue, but I am not too optimistic that it
will be finished by next fall, when it appears
there will be a session of Parliament. I am,
of course, speaking on my own and I have no
authority for making that statement; but if
Parliament should prorogue in April I think
it is altogether likely there will be a fall
session.
Another difficulty arises from the fact
that the World Postal Congress is to assemble
in Ottawa on August 16. I am informed that
this is one of the largest organizations of
its kind, and it is likely to require the use of
both chambers of Parliament in order to
carry on its meetings. That is all arranged.
However, the work which we hoped would be
in full swing earlier may have to be delayed;
of that I cannot be certain. All I can say
is that I am satisfied that the subcommittee
appreciates the confidence which the members of this house have placed in it. We feel
that we have been faithful to our task, and
we shall continue to do our best as long as
our efforts are required.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I am sure that we are all gratified by
the report made by the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and
are glad to hear that the subcommittee is
making some progress. However, may I ask
if it is not merely continuing a very unsatisfactory condition in keeping these pictures
on the walls or by substituting other pictures? This chamber was never designed for
its present form. The spaces between the
pillars on the sides were intended for galleries. The blueprints, which are available,
show how the chamber was planned back
in 1916, when space was set aside for galleries
on both sides. These pictures are simply
blocking what should be the openings to
galleries.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The cost of removing
the pictures and completing the galleries in
accordance with the original plan was considered twenty or thirty years ago, and it
was estimated then that this chamber could
be finished according to the original plan,
with galleries built to accommodate some 300
people, at a cost of some $200,000. Of course,
the cost would probably be double that
amount now. On the other hand, it seems to

me that we shall never have a proper chamber so long as we retain this subterfuge of
blocking our galleries with pictures, or whatever else might be put in their place.
Honourable senators, at the opening of this
session I raised a question about the noise
made by members of the other house who
carried on conversation behind the bar at
the entrance to the chamber while the Governor General was reading the Speech from
the Throne. The unfortunate people standing
or sitting back of the members cannot hear
or see anything. This has occurred session
after session. I am rather surprised that
people continue to attend under such conditions, and that their patience has not long
since been exhausted.
Honourable senators, I think the time has
come to complete this chamber in the way
it was planned in the first instance. The
erection of this building began shortly after
the fire in 1916. Perhaps the reason for not
having completed the Senate chamber was
lack of money, or more likely the desire
to have it ready for occupancy as early as
possible, with the idea of finishing the job
in the near future. Unfortunately, decade
after decade has passed while the unsightly
walls and very unsatisfactory acoustical conditions have remained.
Honourable senators, I compliment the
subcommittee on the work it is doing, but
wish to point out that whatever solution it
arrives at in replacing these pictures will
simply continue an unsatisfactory condition
which perhaps should have been corrected
forty years ago. I hope the subcommittee
has given some consideration to this problem,
and if it has, would the honourable leader
mind telling us what problems have been
met and what prospect there is of completing
the chamber?
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) rose so
quickly that I did not have time to thank
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the most interesting
explanation and report that he has given
to us. For my part, I am satisfied when
there is good will and when there is progress;
and apparently there is good will and progress in the work of the subcommittee over
which he presides.
I am most interested in what the honourable senator fron Toronto-Trinity suggested,
and it deserves serious consideration. Might
I add a word? The more attractive this chamber is made, the more influential the Senate
will be, and the larger will be the attendance
at our debates, for the very good reason

SENATE

that those who come into the galleries will
be in a position to hear what is said in this
chamber.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
perhaps I should first answer the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity. We did consider the question of enlarging the galleries,
but as it involved an outlay of probably
half a million to a million dollars we did
not think that you intended us to take an
expenditure of that kind under consideration.
I should also point out that the subcommittee's work is ended, because we were
instructed to act during the recess only.
Since Parliament has reassembled the matter
has gone to the Internal Economy Committee,
to which body our subcommittee will give a
full report. If we are requested to get some
information regarding the possibility of putting in the galleries, I am sure we shall be
glad to do so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I make that
request?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then the request
would be to the Internal Economy Committee.
Hon. Mr. Molson: May I ask the honourable
Leader whether a ventilation or air conditioning system is proposed?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
Air conditioning.

equipment will be underneath this chamber.

certain members were ever re-elected was
that they spoke in a very loud voice that
was audible in the galleries. Defeated members have been told, "You never even made
a speech", because their constituents in the
galleries did not hear them. The Manitoba
Legislature spent a good deal of money to
try to find an answer to the problem, and
conditions have been greatly improved,
although the situation is far from perfect
yet. I suggest that before engineers are
asked to decide on how to meet the problem
in this chamber the committee send a
representative to Winnipeg to study what
has been done to improve the acoustics in
the Legislature there. I am confident that
this would be worth while.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Have they loud speakers
there?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, they have not; they do
not need them. The building is of stone,
and stone throws an echo back. The inside
of the chamber is now lined with silk, which
when put on properly and well maintained
does not give back an echo. Many other
improvements have been made to meet the
problem, and I do urge that these should be
investigated by the committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Of course, our problem
is not the sane as theirs.

FEBRUARY 19, 1957
On beginning my remarks I am reminded
of a story about two Presbyterian ministers
who frequently exchanged pulpits. The occasion usually arose when one of them wished
to leave his charge. The first time this minister invited his colleague to substitute for
him, he said: "When you start to preach,
some of the congregation will get up and go
out. Pay no attention to it, for they do the
same to me." The visiting minister took as
his text, "Thou art weighed in the balances,
and art found wanting." After he had been
speaking a while one member of the congregation got up to go out, and the minister
said "As you are weighed, pass out." No
further members left.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: First may I join with
the honourable senators who have already
spoken in congratulating the mover and the
seconder upon their splendid addresses. The
mover comes from that rich province of
Quebec, and the seconder from the rich and
fast-growing province of British Columbia. I
am sure these honourable gentlemen will find
the Senate a pleasant place in which to meet
and work with their colleagues from other
parts of Canada. Two other new senators
entered the chamber this session, one from
New Brunswick and the other from Saskatchewan. I feel sure that they too will
have already felt something of the warmth
of friendship that abounds in this chamber.
At the commencement of the present session about the only disturbing factor in
Canada was the strike on the Canadian
Pacific Railway. However, after a short time
the differences were resolved and rail operations were resumed. But conditions in other
parts of the world, such as Austria, Cyprus
and the Middle East were not as peaceful as
those in Canada. When we think of the disturbing conditions in other countries we
should be very proud of Canada, a country in
which we are able to live in peace and contentment, and in which we can each go our
own way and choose what we shall do. I
think we can also be proud of our Government, and of the Opposition too, for the
prompt action that Parliament took in voting
money to supply food, clothing and transportation to refugees from Hungary who wished
to come to Canada.
One of the problems that has been with us
of late years is that of the continual rise in
the consumer price index. In 1949 the Bureau
of Statistics made up a list of items to which
it apportioned certain percentages, the total
of which was 100. That list consisted of: food,

32; shelter, 15; clothing, 11; household operations, 17; and other commodities, 25. The
total of the figures for these items today is
120 or more.
I should like to draw particular attention
to the item of food, 32 per cent. This is the
portion of the consumer items which the
farmer provides. At the time the bureau
published its latest report I believe the index
was down slightly, for the reason, it was said,
that food was cheaper. There are about 170
items other than food which enter into the
consumer price index and which the farmer
and his family have to buy. I refer to clothing, for instance. So the farmer not only
supplies the food, but he has to bear the
increase in all of the other items which he
purchases.
We recently received the preliminary report
of the Gordon Commission. I should like to
say something about why it was found by
that commission that incomes in the Maritime
provinces were much lower than in other
parts of Canada. In 1871, four years after
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and
Ontario entered Confederation, the population of Canada was 3,631,786. At that time
the population of Prince Edward Island was
98,021. In 1951 the population of the Island
was 98,492, or an increase of about 470 people.
However, in 1891 the Island had 109,000
people, but in 1931 only 88,000.
You may ask why the population in that
province is not increasing. I say one reason
is that the federal Government has not since
1912 carried out the terms of Confederation
with respect to freight rates as promised in
1864 to the people of Nova Scotia when they
entered Confederation. In that connection I
should like to read from a booklet published
by the Transportation

Commission of

the

Maritime Board of Trade:
It is not necessary to quote in detail the declarations of some of the Fathers of Confederation with
reference to the Intercolonial Railway as an inducement tu the Maritime colonies to enter the political
union, nor is it necessary to question here whether
those pronouncements were made in other than
good faith and sincerity. Suffice it to refer to but
a few excerpts from addresses of Sir John A.
MacDonald, Hon. A. T. Galt, Hon. George Brown
and Hon. George Etienne Cartier to indicate what
they wished to impress as the purpose and intent
of the railway.
Sir John A. Macdonald said in part at Halifax
in 1864:
"I don't hesitate to say that with respect to the
Intercolonial Railway it is understood by the people
of Canada that it can only be built as a means
of political union for the colonies. It cannot be
denied that the railway, as a commercial enterprise, would be of comparatively littie commercial
advantage to the people of Canada."
The Honourable Mr. Galt made this statement:
"The railway is not to be looked upon as a
question of cost but as a bond of union that will
'unite us in peace and in time of need."

SENATE
At Halifax on September 10, 1864, the Honourable
George Brown had this to say:
"Union of all the provinces would break down
all trade barriers between us, and throw open at
once to all a combined market of four millions
of people. You in the east would send us your
fish and your coals and your West India produce,
while we send you in return the flour and the grain
and the meat you now buy in Boston and New
York."
At the conclusion of his address in Halifax, the
Honourable George Etienne Cartier said:
"Let me assure you that the promises we make
are made in al sincerity and good faith-in urging
union upon you we believe we are doing that
which will be for your happiness and prosperity."
The Royal Commission of Maritime Claims (generally known as the Duncan Commission) after
"a balanced study of the events and pronouncements prior to Confederation, and, at its consummation" found:
"(a) That leading Canadian statesmen in urging
the adherence of the Maritime Provinces ta Confederation defined the purposes of the railroad
to be
(i) A means of affording to Canadian merchandise, and to Canada herself in times of national
and imperial need, an outlet and inlet on the
Atlantic ocean-available all the year around-and
(ii) To afford to Maritime merchants, traders
and manufacturers, a market of several millions
of people instead of their being restricted to the
small and scattered populations of the Maritimes
themselves, particularly in the light of the disturbance with which their trade was threatened
as the result of the discontinuance by the United
States of the reciprocal arrangements that had
prevailed.
(b) That strategic considerations determined the
actual course of the line-making it many miles,
estimated by Sir Sanford Fleming at 250 miles
longer than was necessary-if the only consideration had been "to connect the cities of the Maritime Provinces to those of the St. Lawrence."

A little farther on the booklet says:
The Duncan Commission was satisfied that up to
1912 the freight rate structure on the Intercolonial
Railway reflected a "fulfilment by successive Governments of the policy and pledges" incipient with
the railway. Evidently Maritime trade and conmerce was able to bear the then prevailing rate
structure. Subsequent to 1912 until the time of
the Commission's report (1926) it was found that
the "Intercolonial rates have suffered an estimated
cumulative increase of 92 per cent" (i.e. their 100
became 192) whereas "the estimated average increase of rates for the rest of Canada" was "55
per cent" (i.e. their 100 became 155)-a situation
which resulted in the following conclusion:
"That the rate structure as it has been altered
since 1912 has placed upon the trade and commerce
of the Maritime provinces (a) a burden which,
as we have read the pronouncements and obligations undertaken at Confederation, it was never
intended it should bear, and (b) a burden which
is, in fact, responsible in very considerable measure
for depressing abnormally in the Maritimes today
business and enterprise which had originated and
developed before 1912 and on the basis and faith
of the rate structure as it then stood."

So, honourable senators, you will see that
at the time of Confederation it was never
intended that the Maritimes should bear the
whole burden of freight rates.
Consider, as an example, the transportation
of automobiles from such centres as Oshawa

Oshawa and Montreal or between Windsor
and Montreal is much lower. Honourable
senators driving along the highway frequently meet transport trucks loaded with
as many as five automobiles. These transports are loaded at the factory and deliver
the automobiles at the dealer's door, and the
cost of doing that cannot be more than onethird of the cost of transporting automobiles
to the Maritimes.
A great deal has been written about the
preliminary report of the Gordon Royal Commission. Perhaps the final report will contain some proposals of benefit to Prince
Edward Island. The Island cannot well spare

The group aged from 25 to 64 years number

women there are not more than 20,000 male
workers under 65.
Our farmers are capable and efficient. The
main cash crop of the Island, potatoes, is
subject to strict supervision. Every grower
must plant certified seed, and the plants are
inspected twice in the field by federal inspectors. Very often the potatoes are planted

field and the uprooting of bad plants-the
seed is maintained at high quality. I talked
over the matter of cost with the honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor).
I figure that an outlay of $150 to $175 is
necessary to plant an acre of potatoes. This
includes $50 for a ton of fertilizer, the cost
of digging, spraying, cultivating and removing diseased plants. As I have mentioned,
the potatoes are inspected twice in the field;
they are inspected in the bin; they are inspected again when they are graded at the
farm, and the final examination takes place
when they are loaded into boats or cars. As
a result, quotations average from 15 to 20

In other lines of farming our people are
just as capable. But the whole family has

ta work. One may see girls and boys and
women driving tractors and busy in the fields;
they enjoy it. But after ail, that is one
side of farming: what makes the life worth
while are the homes and the children. As
a rule it is in the country, flot the cities,
where one finds large familles. A couple of
days ago 1 saw in one of aur newspapers a
photograph of 20 nurses on the staff of the
Charlottetown hospital. The report of their
names and places of origin showed that two
were from, Charlottetown, 1 1 from farms in
the province, two from Boston, one from
Moncton, and four from other towns. Our
farm children are taught to work, and they
make good citizens.
Many years ago, Jeremiah Blanchard,
speaking in the Legislature on the subi ect
of education, remarked that for aIl they knew
a future Pope of Rome might be sitting on
some school bench. So far our schools have
not produced a pope, but the first English
cardinal in Canada, Cardinal McGuigan, was
sitting at that time on a school bench on the
Island. He was raised on a farm and came
fromn a rather poor section. 1 believe the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) knows the Rev. J. S. Bonnell.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I surely do.
Hon. Mr. Barbaur: 1 think the honourable
senator was in Mr. Bonnell's congregation
at Winnipeg. The reverend gentleman is
now pastor of the First Presbyterian Church,
New York. His congregation think highly of
him, and he was offered a larger salary than
hie would accept for his own use, sa he
returned some of it, saying he had plenty ta
live an. He too was born on a farm on the
Island, in only a fair farming district.
Having spoken of the Island's spiritual
assets, perhaps I should turn to some of its
commercial achievements. Not all aur successful people have left home. Captain Car]
Burke was raised in Prince Edward Island
and has stayed there. He taa was raised on
a small farm. His father told me many years
ago that he could not get the boy interested
in anything but aeroplanes. Carl warked
away until hie got $500, and then bought a
little plane and engaged in flying.

and five weekly trips ta the Magdalen Islands

PRIVATE BILLS
KINGS MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANYSECOND READING

Han. John A. McDonald moved the second
reading of Bill A-5, an Act ta incorporate
Kings Mutual Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the Kings
Mutual Fire Insurance Company, with headquarters at Berwick, Kings County, Nova
Scotia, was established in 1904 by a group of
farmers of Berwick and vicinity who were
interested in insurance for themselves.
Chapter 46 of the Acts of Nova Scotia, session of 1903-04, provided for the formation of
fire mutuals in the province. One hundred
thousand dollars insurance bad ta be subscribed before making application for incorporation. This amount of insurance was
subscribed for, and articles of incorporation
were presented ta Messrs. S. C. Parker, John
H. Chute and B. H. Lee. Today the company

and at the close of the year 1955 had over

the company has made 119 flights across the
Atlantic and braught 18 plane-loads of Hun- policyholders.

senators were acquainted, became president;
and at the time of his regrettable and sudden
passing, a few days ago, he had had an unbroken record of 45 years as an officer of the
company. He has been succeeded in office by
a director of long standing, Mr. Hall.
In 1954 the company was obliged to seek
legislation empowering it to supply its policyholders with what was then known as the
supplemental coverage for attachment to fire
policies. This was brought about by the result
of damage caused by the two destructive
hurricanes "Edna" and "Hazel".
As honourable senators know, the trend of
the fire insurance business in recent years has
been to offer to the public various forms of
contracts which might induce people to buy
coverage to the prejudice of other companies
not in a position to offer similar coverage. In
other words, competition bas been very keen,
and with an eye to the future of this company the directors hope to place their company in a position whereby they will be able
to offer low composite policies, which seem
to be meeting public favour at this time. It
is rather a slow, roundabout way if they are
obliged to seek special legislation under the
provincial act from time to time for the privilege of writing the various coverages being
asked for from the insuring public.
The Kings Mutual Fire Insurance Company
is the largest of several farm mutuals in Nova
Scotia, and has outgrown its provincial status.
Since all Nova Scotia insurance companies
are required to register with our federal
Superintendent of Insurance, Mr. MacGregor,
he has had previous knowledge of this
company.
This bill, if it meets with the approval of
honourable senators, would grant the request
of the directors of Kings Mutual for incorporation under the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act. The manager of
the company, Mr. Taylor, wrote a few days
ago stating that at their annual meeting the
shareholders unanimously approved the request of the directors for this legislation.
The Superintendent of Insurance and our
Senate counsel have told me that the bill is
in order and similar to that given the Perth
Mutual and another mutual in Saskatchewan.
Honourable senators, if this bill receives
second reading I shall move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills for further consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills.

ALLIANCE

NATIONALE-SECOND

READING

Hon. L. M. Gouin moved the second
reading of Bill T-5, an Act respecting
Alliance Nationale.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple bill. The first section merely
seeks to change the name of Alliance
Nationale to Alliance Mutual Life Insurance
Company, and in French, Alliance Compagnie
Mutuelle d'Assurance-vie. May I say here
that I am not a policyholder nor have I any
other interest in the company. This organization was originally incorporated as a fraternal benefit association, by a Quebec statute
enacted in 1893, chapter 84. Then in 1917
it obtained federal incorporation, by chapter
69 of 7-8 George V. Amendments were
introduced in 1924 and 1929, but they were
repealed in 1945, by chapter 44, and under
that statute of 1945 the organization bas become a mutual life insurance company. The
proposed new name accurately describes the
nature of the company. I would add that
the company enjoys a very good reputation.
Section 2 repeals section 8 of chapter 44
of the statutes of 1945. Section 8 was of a
purely provisional character and provided
that the members of the executive of the
Alliance Nationale would be the directors
until the board of directors were duly elected.
Section 3 is more interesting, and its purpose is to repeal section 9 of the statutes
of 1945, chapter 44, which I referred to a
little earlier, and to substitute a new section
9. The intention is to have this section
brought in line with the provisions of the
Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act. Under subsection (1) the members of
the company entitled to vote will be every
person who has contracted for a participating policy, and who holds such a policy upon
which no premiums are due. That is the
normal procedure.
Subsection 2 of new section 9 provides for
the qualification of directors. They would
be such members holding participating
policies for $4,000 or more, exclusive of
bonus additions, and upon which no premiums are due, and who have paid premiums
for at least three full years. The subsection
also provides for those who, instead of taking an ordinary participating policy, take
an annuity. A scale is given showing how
the calculation will be made in the case of
what I would call an annuity policy.
Subsection 3 of new section 9 provides that
a person having any acquired rights shall not
suffer any prejudice but will retain his
qualification as a member, provided he continues to meet the conditions of eligibility
existing as at the date of issue of the insurance policy on his life. In other words, the

FEBRUARY 19, 1957
persons in the future who will be the qualified members and eligible to become directors
will be practically on the same footing as
those of any other mutual life insurance
companies under the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act, but at the same
time care was taken that nobody should suffer any prejudice through the amendments
which I have just explained.
Finally, section 4 states that the Act shall
come into force on the first day of January,
1958. That is in order to allow the necessary changes to be made in the policies and
in the other documents of the organization,
which is doing a great amount of business.
It will take some time before the company
is ready to act under what I would call its
new charter.
Honourable senators, if second reading is
given to this bill I shall ask that it be referred to a committee so that all the explanations which may be required can be given
by those who are interested in the company.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman three questions? (1) Would
he give us his definition of a participating
policy? (2) Are there other policies besides
participating policies? (3) If there are others,
why are they not recognized as well?
Hon. Mr. Gouin: If I understand correctly,
a participating policy is one under which the
insured is not only entitled to benefit, say at
death or after so many years, but receives
also the so-called bonus or dividends, because
it is a mutual life insurance company. Of
course, a much better explanation on this
point will be given in committee. I must
admit that personally I have no intimate
knowledge of the company's manner of doing
business; but I know that generally speaking
our companies proceed in the way in which
I have just described.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can the honourable
senator give us the reason why only the
policyholders who participate in the profits
are allowed to vote at the company's general
meetings?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There are two kinds of
policies. On the participating policy the
insured pays a larger amount than on the
other kind.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But he gets more
benefits.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: One policyholder is a
creditor and the other has a proprietary
interest.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, why
not leave these questions to be answered
when the bill is considered in committee?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
understand the practice is to refer bills of
this type to the Banking and Commerce
committee. However, the honourable senator
from Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald) has asked
that the bill which he explained be referred
to the Miscellaneous Private Bills Committee,
to which I have no objection. As these two
bills are in some respects similar, it would
seem logical that they should be considered
by the same committee. I would therefore
move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed ta.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, may I direct a question to the honourable Leader of the Government with respect
to a press dispatch which has just reached
me? The dispatch states that Premier Bennett
of British Columbia declared Thursday night
that Donald Gordon, President of the Canadian National Railways, was prepared to buy
the government-owned Pacific Great Eastern
Railway. I would like to know if it is correct
that Mr. Gordon is prepared to take this railway off the hands of the Government of
British Columbia.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I have no knowledge of such an offer,
but I can make inquiries about it. I would
remind my honourable friend that the Canadian National Railways is a crown corporation, and whether or not I can get the information I do not know. However, I shall
inquire.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In making such an off er
as that surely Mr. Gordon would be responsible to Parliament, because if the
purchase were made he would have to come
to Parliament to have it approved.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is quite true that
if the railway were purchased the necessary
funds would have to be appropriated by
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would like to know if
a legitimate offer has been made.
QUEEN ELIZABETH HOTEL, MONTREAL
INQUIRY

Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
may I ask the honourable Leader of the Government if Donald Gordon secured the permission of Parliament before making an
agreement with the Hilton hotels company
for the rental of the Queen Elizabeth Hotel
in Montreal?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I doubt if it was
necessary for him to obtain that permission,
but whether he did or not is a matter of
record. The honourable gentleman was here

FEBRUARY 20, 1957
and he would recall whether or not permission was obtained fron Parliament. I do
not recall the matter having come before
Parliament.
PRIME MINISTER OF FRANCE
MR. GUY MOLLET TO ADDRESS
OF BOTH HOUSES

MEMBERS

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, may I refer to an announcement
that was made by the Prime Minister this
afternoon in the House of Commons? It was
that Mr. Guy Mollet, the Prime Minister of
France, and Mr. Christian Pineau, the Foreign
Minister of that country, will arrive in
Ottawa from New York on Saturday, March
2. They will spend Saturday in Ottawa, and
on Sunday will proceed to Quebec City. On
Monday, March 4, they will return to Ottawa.
On that day the Prime Minister of France
will address a meeting of the members of
both bouses in the House of Commons, beginning at 11.30 in the morning. That hour is
not as convenient as it might be for many
members of this house, but as Mr. Mollet will
have such a short stay in Canada it is the
only time available.

INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Calvert C. Pratt inquired of the Goverrnment, pursuant to notice:
Have plans been prepared for the building of an
airstrip at Wabana, Newfoundland, and. if so,
when does the Department of Transport propose to
proceed with the work?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The answer to the
honourable gentleman's inquiry is as follows:
The Department of Transport bas prepared
plans of a proposed airstrip at Wabana, Newfoundland, and these have been forwarded
to the Department of Public Works of the
Province of Newfoundland. The federal Government is prepared, subject to the approval
of Parliament, to contribute funds up to an
amount of $85,000 on the basis that subject
to this limitation the costs will be shared
equally with the Government of Newfoundland. Arrangements for construction will be
made by the provincial Government and not
by the Department of Transport.
CANADIAN

WHEAT BOARD BILL

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
February 14, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Lambert for the second
reading of Bill 9, an Act to amend the Can'adian Wheat Board Act.
82719-15

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, the
Wheat Board Act, of which this house bas
clear memories, is back with us once more.
It is something like an acquaintance, long
absent, who has been in the habit of calling upon us for a small cash donation. Onte
more be comes: we wish he had remained
away, but be is here, and usually we get
rid of him by giving him some more cash.
The first thing I wish to say is a word of
appreciation to my old friend the honourable
the senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), for the kind and even generous
words which he said about myself in his
introductory remarks on the bill. I daresay it is the vanity of advancing years, but
I am bound to admit that what he said was
not unpleasant to me. I venture to add,
however, that there are many outside this
house, possibly some within it, who will not
endorse the kind things that be said. But
at any rate I am grateful to him.
My honourable friend explained Bill 9,
which is entitled "An Act to amend the
Canhadian Wheat Board Act". The amendments are three in number, and are very
simple: in each instance the figure "1957"
is changed to "1962". On the face of it this
looks very innocent; but honourable senators
may permit me to observe that it packs quite
a wallop. The sections which we are asked
to amend, and which if so amended will
then remain in effect from 1957 to 1962, are
those which give the board all the compulsory powers it has.
I think honourable senators are aware of
the nature of these powers. For example,
no farmer who grows wheat in Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, or Alberta, or in a few
districts of British Columbia can' market
one bushel of it until he gets a permit to
do so from a governmen't authority, the
Wheat Board. He cannot dispose of his wheat
except through the board. Every country or
terminal elevator company is an agent of the
Wheat Board, and in order to cloak all this
with the necessary respectability, the board
is declared to be an agent of the crown. In
essence, therefore, it is the crown that is
doing all this business.
I can give you another illustration. The
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), with his Scottish love of
freedom, bas protested against this sort of
thing on more than one occasion in the
Senate. Let us suppose that I grow seed
wheat in Manitoba and I have a farmer
neighbour who lives half a mile distant but
on the Saskatchewan side of the boundary.
The only way he can get my seed wheat for
his farm is through my selling it to the board,
because under the law he cannot buy it from
me.

SENATE
A year ago the honourable senator from
New Westminster gave as an illustration a
wheat farmer on the Prairies-say in Saskatchewan-having a poultry ranch in the
Fraser Valley. He grows feed on his farm in
Saskatchewan and wishes to ship a carload
to his poultry ranch in the Fraser Valley;
but he cannot do this. If he attempts to do
it he will be subjected to penalties, and so
will any railway company that attempts to
transport the feed. If that is not a gross
interference in a matter in which we should
have a natural and undisputed freedom, then
I would like to know what it is.
This is the sort of thing we are perpetuating
in this legislation. Several years ago Parliament, always jealous of the powers it gives
in legislation, wisely and justly provided that
this legislation be reviewed within a stated
period. That is why this bill is now before
us. But let me repeat that the bill simply
provides for continuance of the arbitrary
powers of the Wheat Board in the manner I
described a moment ago.
The Wheat Board has done a very good
job within the limits of the tasks assigned it.
Its chairman is a man of integrity and character, and that is a fortunate thing for us.
However, this fact does not detract from the
arbitrariness of the powers which the board
is obliged to exercise under the law.
The senior senator from Ottawa, in explaining this bill, gave a historical survey, and I
also wish to deal with a few historical incidents in relation to this whole business of
wheat marketing.
The 1920's gave rise to the development of
wheat pools in the Prairie provinces. A pool
was established for each of the three provinces. The men who operated the pools were
not highly experienced, but they were enthusiastic, and unquestionably of fine character and good intentions. At the end of 1929
and the beginning of 1930 the pools were in
serious financial trouble. Their method of
operation was to pay the farmer an initial
advance on his grain when it was delivered
to the pool. At the end of the crop year,
when the grain had all been sold, the proceeds,
less the initial advance and other necessary
charges, were distributed among all the farmers who had consigned or sold wheat to the
pool. Unfortunately, the operators of the
pools failed to see the storm clouds gathering,
and with the general economic crash at the
end of 1929 they found that the value of the
wheat they had on hand was not sufficient by
a wide margin to cover the advances they
had received from the banks to buy and
handle it. The pools, therefore, went to the
three provincial Governments of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta. The Governments could see the disorganization that

might result, and reluctantly guaranteed the
repayment of the advances made to the respective pools by the banks. Of course, they
wisely took all the security that the pools
had. The only tangible security the pools
then had was grain elevators, which they had
built from 1923 onward, and which by this
time reached very considerable numbers.
In 1930 a change in government at Ottawa
occurred. Mr. Bennett-later Viscount Bennett-became Prime Minister and he had to
deal with the situation. It should be borne
in mind that the pools required millions of
dollars of credit to handle their operating
business. Their tangible assets were in hock
to the provincial governments. So they came
to the Prime Minister at Ottawa and asked
him to have the federal Government guarantee their operating accounts at the banks. Mr.
Bennett, recognizing the situation, reluctantly
agreed to do so, but on one condition, namely
that Mr. John I. McFarland, an experienced
grain man whom he had known for many
years in the province of Alberta, be put in
charge of the pools' central selling agency
and have sole charge of the operation of this
agency.
In the parliamentary session of 1935 Mr.
Bennett introduced the Canadian Wheat
Board Bill. At that time, as everyone knew,
a general election had to be held that year.
I do not know what influenced Mr. Bennett
to introduce the bill, which led to the Wheat
Board Act which we have on the statutes to
this day; but he did. The interesting point is
that when the bill was introduced in Parliament it contained practically the same compulsory provisions that are in the present
act. What happened? The Liberal Opposition, led by the late Mr. Mackenzie King,
fought those provisions on second reading in
the House of Commons. In addition, when
the bill went to the agricultural committee
for discussion clause by clause, so vigorous
was the opposition to this interference with
freedom that the Prime Minister finally
agreed, in order to get the legislation passed,
that the clauses containing the compulsory
provisions would go into effect only upon
proclamation; and he gave his word that the
provisions would not be proclaimed until
after the election. The opposition to this
compulsion put upon a man in his own
private business was, historically, on sound
Liberal grounds. If any honourable senator
wishes to become informed on this matter he
may read the debates which took place at
that time. Well, the Bennett Government
was defeated; a Liberal Government, under
Mr. Mackenzie King, came into office, and
those compulsory provisions were never proclaimed. But a change had to be made in
the Wheat Board. It is not pleasant to refer

FEBRUARY 20, 1957
to this, and I shall say no more about it than
that I think the Government of the day was
amply warranted and justified in making the
changes that it made.
In the autumn of 1941 the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board was set up. The purpose
of the board, of course, was to control the
whole economy of the country.
Wages,
salaries, prices, and so on, were frozen.
Everything was thus affected but the price of
wheat, and wheat was deliberately left out
because it was recognized that for years,
through crop failures and low prices, the
wheat farmers had not shared in the general
prosperity of the country. Prices of wheat
were allowed to rise until September 1943,
when by order in council under the War
Measures Act the price of wheat was automatically brought under the control of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, which
operated the grain part of its business
through the Wheat Board. That continued
until 1946, when the Government, very unwisely, I think, negotiated what was known
as the United Kingdom Wheat Agreement.
That agreement was made, in the first instance, by virtue of powers under the War
Measures Act, but in 1947 Parliament passed
a statute validating the agreement, and in
this statute were incorporated the compulsory powers which by the present amendment
we extend for another five years.
The agreement, which was for four years,
provided several things. One was that the
United Kingdom during the two crop years
from August 1, 1946 to August 1, 1948, would
purchase each year 160 million bushels of
wheat at the ceiling price of $1.55 at Fort
William. Another provision was that the
price in the two succeeding years would be
mutually adjusted. Some honourable senators may recall the famous have-regard-to
clause in the agreement. That clause simply
provided that if the price had been too low
in the first two years of the agreement, the
United Kingdom would have regard to that
fact and take it into account in fixing the
price for the succeeding two years. It was
too low, and the price was fixed at $2 a bushel
for the second two years of the agreement.
Then in 1949 we had the International
Wheat Agreement, which everyone applauded.
Britain entered into that first International
Wheat Agreement, although the United Kingdom Wheat Agreement overlapped it by a
year. The interesting thing, honourable senators, is this: At the very time when we were
selling wheat at the ceiling levels I have just
mentioned, wheat was being sold from
Canada by the Wheat Board outside the
agreement at prices that reached on one
occasion $3.45 a bushel. There is no disputing that; these are matters of record.
82719-154

From the beginning of that agreement until
practically six years afterwards the price of
wheat never dropped to the level of the
British Wheat Agreement price, even that of
the second two years. The result is clear.
The farmers of western Canada put their
wheat under that agreement. It may be
argued that they wanted such an agreement.
It may be argued that they were willing to
hold out their hands and have them shackled
by the federal Government. Even if they
were, that is no reason why the federal Government should have incorporated these compulsory powers in the legislation.
Let me make myself clear. The federal
Government was not the only party to the
enactment of those compulsory powers.
Every party in the House of Commons,
including the party represented by the honourable Leader of the Opposition in this house
(Hon. Mr. Haig), supported it. So there is
no question of laying the blame on one party
more than another.
I know there are honourable senators in
this house who feel that we on the Prairies
are a rather importuning lot, that we are
always coming to Ottawa for favours. I wish
to tell this house that it can be demonstrated,
I think, beyond anr question of doubt, that
the western wheat farmers lost at least $400
million and probably $500 million by the
operation of these agreements. Why should
the western farmers have been singled out?
The Ontario and Quebec farmers were wise
enough to keep out of that net. People who
sold copper, lumber, zinc, lead and everything
else had their prices fixed by market operations. Anyone could see that after the war
there was bound to be in the matter of foodstuffs a great vacuum to be filled, for the agriculture of Europe had been largely destroyed.
Now I submit it might have been a proper
policy for Parliament in 1946 to have taken
the position that Great Britain had suffered
grievously during the war, that she was
struggling back to her feet, and that Canada
should help her by supplying her with wheat
at a price below that obtaining on the open
market. I would have held up both hands
for such a policy. But the point is this: the
burden of that policy should have been
carried by all the people of Canada and not
alone by the wheat farmers out on the
Prairies.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No only that-and this
I would ask my honourable friends from the
rest of Canada to bear in mind-the wheat
farmers on the Prairies did more than subsidize the British bread consumers; they
subsidized the Canadian bread consumers as
well.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Because everyone in
Canada, whether he lived in British Columbia, the Maritime provinces, Quebec or
Ontario bought his bread on the basis of
the British Wheat Agreement prices. Had
the market been open, or had the Government
taken the stand that Canada as a whole
instead of the Prairie farmers would make a
contribution to Britain's need, the people
of eastern and western Canada also would
have been paying very much more for their
bread than they paid during those years.
That fact cannot be successfully challenged.
We still have the International Wheat
Agreement with us. What is the value of this
method of marketing? The annual report of
the Canadian Wheat Board which was placed
in our hands a few weeks ago stated that in
the 1955-56 crop year-that was the year
which began on August 1, 1955 and ended
on July 31, 1956-the Canadian exports of
wheat and flour through the mechanism of
the board totalled 309 million bushels; but
Canada's guaranteed quantity under the International Wheat Agreement during that
year was only 153 million bushels. That was
the amount of wheat which, through the
operation of the agreement, Canada was
entitled to export to importing countries
which are parties to that agreement. What
happened? May I read one paragraph from
the board's report? It says:
Canada's guaranteed quantity for 1955-56 was
153,077,860 bushels. Total sales by Canada under
the agreement-

Note this.
-amounted
to 75,820,401 bushels, or slightly less
than 50 per cent of this country's guaranteed
quantity.

So out of total exports of 309 million
bushels we sold 75 million bushels under the
agreement, and the balance was sold outside of it. Well, honourable senators, it
makes one question how much value an
agreement of that kind has. I do know this,
that it adds quite a heavy sum to the expense of marketing our wheat.
There is another aspect of this question
that I wish to deal with-I trust I am not
wearying honourable senators-and that is
the United States story. After the war the
United States adopted what was called parity
prices. Even today one reads a good deal
about parity prices in the United States, and
we are not without advocates who claim we
should have them in Canada uider the same
formula.
The parity formula was a simple one. The
American statisticians in Government departments took the prices of things that farmers
bought in the period from 1911 to 1915

and arrived at an index that was representative of the prices paid over those years. They
did the same thing with the prices farmers
received for the products they sold in that
period. Now, when they arrived at these
two price indices they had the parity or the
relationship betweenï those prices, and they
applied it to current conditions in the
United States.
An index was made in,
say, 1954 of the prices that farmers paid for
the same range of goods then, and of the
prices received for the same range of products and this was equated to match the
parity secured from the comparison of the
indices between 1911 and 1915.
That of course worked out tremendously
to the advantage of the American farmer,
because the prices of everything that be
bought were going up month by month and
year by year, while the prices of the commodities he sold tended to decline. Public
opinion in the United States strongly supported the parity system, which was administered through the Commodity Credit
Corporation in Washington. After several
years of operation the Commodity Credit
Corporation found that it had over $8 billion-quite a lot of money, honourable
senators-tied up in this fashion in commodities, and it was costing over $1 million
a day in charges to carry them.
Now, there is this interesting comparison:
whether for good or ill the farmer in the
United States was carried to this enormous
extent-I think very ill advisedly-while in
Canada the very reverse was the case. The
United States Government did not take wheat
from its farmers from 1946 to 1950 and sell
it under any British Wheat Agreement or
any other kind of agreement. It sold the
wheat in the open market. That is what we
should have been doing, even if we had gone
to Britain's assistance by buying wheat and
giving it to her at a price below the world
market price. The burden then would have
been distributed over all the people of
Canada, as it should have been, and not
placed on the back of the western wheat
farmer alone.
What is the result in the United States?
Finding itself with huge surpluses, the United
States Government is endeavouring to devise
means to reduce them, and in doing so is
treading on our toes, make no mistake about
it. But can we find fault with that? At the
expense of the taxpayers of the United States
it has got itself burdened with these enormous
surpluses, and so it

says to countries that

need wheat or corn or any of the other commodities that are supported-and I think
there are seven or eight of those altogether"We will take your currency in exchange."
The United States may sell to India, for

FEBRUARY 20, 1957
example, and take rupees in exchange, but
that currency cannot be paid to American
farmers, sO the rupees are used for development purposes in India. The American Government is doing the sarne thing ail over the
world. It sells for foreign currencies in
many cases, but its give-away programs
bolster some weak nations.
This creates
competition that is intensely difficult for
Canada to meet, and there is a good deal of
grumbling at the United States on that
account. I cannot find it possible to criticize
the United States. We are perfectly open to
do the same thing, but it would be perhaps
a very unwise thing to do. At any rate, the
one unquestioned lesson that can be learned
from all these experiences is the unwisdom
of attempting by these means to get away
from the normal laws that have governed
commerce for thousands of years.
That brings me to another point: we are
not making any headway so far in cleaning
up this problem of a wheat surplus in Canada.
The surplus, the carryover, of wheat at the
lst of August last in Canada was 540 million
bushels. Either the Board of Grain Conmissioners or the Wheat Board is the authority for this figure. Now, it is fairly well
known what the last crop was-I mean there
are pretty reliable estimates-and if you add
the 1956 crop to this figure, making a liberal
deduction for our domestic consumption and
the amount of grain we have sold and shall
sell at the sane rate of export between now
and the 31st of July, the prospect, on the
present outlook, is that we shall wind up next
July with probably at least 600 million
bushels of surplus wheat, which will be substantially above the amount of the 1956
carryover.
The plain fact of the matter is that we are
not solving this problem. It is difficult to
know where the answer is to be found, but
clearly the present method will not solve it
unless there should occur a series of crop
failures in western Canada or in the United
States, the Argentine, Australia or other
wheat-producing lands. Unquestionably a
high price level bas been maintained, and it
may be granted the Wheat Board was a factor
in maintaining it. But this price level has
stimulated wheat production almost everywhere in the world. This is a natural consequence of high prices. Forty or fifty years
ago France and Turkey were importers of
wheat. At present, in a normal year France
exports 80 to 90 million bushels: Turkey,
Syria and North Africa likewise have sur>luses to dispose of. One can grow wheat in
ilmost every country; and as an important
affect of high prices is to stimulate production,
the answer to the problem will not be found

in that direction unless the normal laws of
supply and demand are allowed to operate.
I hope that no honourable senators will get
cold shivers at what I am about to say. We
have applied the principle of support prices
to several commodities-to butter, to eggsI am not sure whether it applies to cheese or
not, but certainly it does to hogs. This proceeding is based on the theory that it is not
in the national interest that prices shall be
allowed to fall below a certain level. The
practice may be questioned; I am free to
admit that I do not like it. It can be argued
that it is wrong in principle: however, we
have adopted it in respect of several products,
and I suggest that it might be applied to
wheat in western Canada; that the support
price be placed at a point where a reasonably
efficient farmer would be protected from loss
but not protected in profit. That would mean
a pretty low support price level. But the
present situation will never be cured unless
we get into complete regimentation, not only
here but elsewhere.
In the United States within the past 18
months the so-called soil bank plan has been
developed. What is a soil bank? Farmers al
over the country are told, "Cut down your
acreage of grains, put the land into grass, and
for every acre so converted into grassland
you will be paid a bonus." To this system
the fancy name of "soil bank" was applied.
The theory was that it would promote a
build-up of soil fertility. But what happened? I am told that a great many farmers
took out of production the poorest land they
had, put it into grass, received the soil bank
grants, and with the cash thus obtained
bought fertilizer, applied it to their good land,
and raised as large crops as ever. That, of
course, was the perfectly natural thing to do.
My suggestion of support prices may not
be workable, but this house, I suggest, might
be less profitably employed than in appointing, at another session, a small committee of
its members to inquire dispassionately into
the whole question. I am as convinced as
that I am talking to you now, that no answer
has yet been found to the problem, and that
if we continue as we are doing, and Providence is kind enough to favour us with
reasonably good crops, we shall land further
and further into the bog, and the federal
treasury will inevitably be called upon,
whether it responds or not.

FEBRUARY 20, 1957
farmers set up their own organizations. The
farmers of Saskatchewan organized the Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers
Limited, and I presume the farmers in Alberta
and Manitoba established similar organizations. Every farmer was asked to join one of
these associations, which were commonly
called wheat pools. About 50 or 60 per cent
of the farmers did join, and I was one of
thern. Things went along well from about
1924 to 1928 or 1929. The initial payment
was good, and the participation certificates
brought in a lot of money when the final
settlement was made for each year.
I would like to illustrate the success of
these wheat pools by recounting a little story.
Probably I have related it before in this
house, but some honourable members may
not have heard it. A Prairie farmer went to
his doctor one day to find out what was ailing
him. He told the doctor he thought there
was something wrong with his head for
every time he held onto his wheat the price
went down and whenever he sold his wheat
the price went up. The doctor said: "Now,
John, there is something wrong with your
brains. If you leave them with me for a
few days I'il look thern over. Come back in
a week or so and I'll tell you what your
trouble is."
However, John never came back. Then
one day the doctor met him on the street,
and said: "I examined your brains and now
I know what's wrong with them. Why didn't
you come back for them?" John replied, "Oh,
I don't need thern any more, Doctor; I have
joined a wheat pool." The farmer meant of
course that he no longer had to think about
selling his wheat, that everything was arranged for him and he was content to accept
the average price paid to the farmers.
The honourable senator from Churchill explained to the house what happened in the
latter part of 1929 and the early part of
1930. I do not want to go into that at all.
He told us all about John McFarland taking
over as chairman of the Wheat Board, and
I think he was accurate in his account of
what happened in 1935 when the Bennett
Government tried to bring in a compulsory
wheat pool. At that time a compromise was
reached by bringing in a voluntary pool.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: A voluntary board.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: After 1935 a farmer
could sell to the board if he wanted to or
he could sell on the open market. That
state of affairs continued until about 1943.
I am not clear about something the honourable senator said when he was discussing
the British Wheat Agreement. He led me
to believe that this agreement was the work
of the Canadian Wheat Board. I want to

say that the Canadian Wheat Board had nothing whatever to do with Canada entering
into that agreement. As a matter of fact, I
understand the board was against it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If I left that impression
it was a wholly erroneous one. The idea of
the United Kingdom Wheat Agreement of
1946 certainly did not originate with the
Canadian Wheat Board.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Thank you very much.
I wanted to get that clear. That was entirely
the work of the federal Government, which,
I admit, acted on the advice of the pools
in the western provinces.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I want to be fair about
the whole matter. The Wheat Board cannot
be blamed for that agreement, nor can it
be blamed for Canada entering into the
International Wheat Agreement. The board
had nothing to do with it either. It was
ratified by this house and the House of
Commons, just as the British Wheat Agreement was.
The honourable senator from Churchill
stated that from 1943 on every person growing wheat was obliged to deliver it to the
Wheat Board. The purpose of that law was
to hold the price down, not to hold it up;
and it did hold the price down, as the honourable senator has just said. In other words,
the object of the wheat board legislation
of 1935 was to boost the price if possible,
whereas in 1943 when the powers of the
Wheat Board were made absolute the object
was to keep the price down. The object of
the bill we are now dealing with is to keep
the price up. I only mention these facts because I do not like to see the Wheat Board
blamed for things that it is not responsible
for. The board has a very difficult problem
in the marketing of grain, and personally
I think it is doing a good job, and that at
the present time the continuation of its powers
is needed more than ever before.
The western farmers have a lot of wheat
piled up but they believe it will gradually
disappear if we have orderly marketing. I
have had grain piled up on my farms in the
past-for instance, in 1930 and 1940-and
many other farmers also had a good deal
on hand, but it all disappeared within a
short time. I am quite satisfied that the
present surplus will also disappear. We cannot expect to get bumper crops year after
year. This winter has been a mild one,
and drought is creeping up from the south.
Next year we may have a poor crop. I am
quite happy to have a lot of wheat in my
bins, for I think it will disappear gradually.
I think the Wheat Board provides a solution
to the problem.

of the Manitoba pool to about $3,500,000.
Why did they lose money? Because the
farmers refused to sell their grain at the current market price. They said they would
make the people of the world pay for it. We
in the Legislature told the farmers they could
not do it. They replied, "We have the grain,
and they will have to buy if."
Let me give an illustration. A man in
Saskatchewan, just over the line from
Dauphin, bought a piece of land on the crop
payment basis. He sent to me as the collector 2,500 bushels of wheat, which I sold
right away at the current market price of
about $1.25 a bushel. He wrote me a bitter
letter in which he said "You are like all the
other lawyers, you steal what we poor
farmers make." I wrote and told him that
our agreement provided that as soon as I
received the wheat I was to sell it and apply
so much against the interest and the balance
on the principal, which I did. That happened
in November. By the following April the
price had dropped to about 80 cents a bushel,
and he still held two-thirds of his crop. He
wrote me, telling me he could get only 80
cents for his wheat, and asked me if I could
still get $1.25 for it. I told him that I certainly could not. In the next five years that
farmer wrote me about the same time every
fall: "Is it the right time to sell my wheat?
Please let me know."
Honourable senators, it is impossible to
sell grain on a controlled market unless you
control the world supply. It cannot be done.
The most successful man who ever tried to
control the wheat market was Leiter. He
was one of the biggest buyers ever known
on the Chicago market, but eventually he lost
everything because he was unable to control
the world supply.
My honourable friend from Rosetown has
said that we will have to have a crop failure
in order to pull us out of this situation. Is
that the only solution? Surely it is not.
About four years ago, when I was riding
on the train to Winnipeg, I met a clergyman
from Regina. He asked me if I was a member of Parliament, and I told him that I happened to be a senator. He then asked me,
"What about the grain business?" I said
"What do you want to know?" He said the
fellows in Regina had told him that they
were going to make the British Government
pay the price the farmers wanted for their
wheat. He added that he had never heard
of that being done, and I told him, "You
won't hear of it being done in this case
either." The British Government offered $2
a bushel, and then dropped out.
My honourable friend from Rosetown says
the Government is responsible. I think it is
responsible, but I also think the system is at
82719-16

fault. My honourable friend complains that
Parliament did not put up much money. Let
me remind him that we put up $32 million
last year to help the Wheat Board, and we
will be asked to put up a similar amount this
year to help pay the storage costs on surplus
grain.
What I, and others who think as I do,
object to is that we do not see any prospect
of selling our surplus grain on the world
market at the present time. The United
States is unable to sell its surplus. What does
it do? Just recently it sold something like
400 million bushels to India, for which it
accepted rupees in payment, and then turned
around and lent the rupees to India to build
roads and bridges. Well, the United States
did not fool anybody by that procedure. It
simply gave the grain to India. The latest
report we hear in Winnipeg, which is a grain
city, is that the United States intends to continue in that policy to get rid of its surplus.
If we have a war we may get rid of our
grain; similarly, if we have a crop failure we
will get rid of some of it. But those are
disastrous events to have to look forward to
for a solution of our problem.
My honourable friend from Rosetown said
that the farmers got an initial payment of
$1.40 a bushel, out of which was taken 20
cents a bushel for transportation, leaving a
net of $1.20 for No. 2 wheat at the elevator.
It was pointed out that that was more than
twice what the farmer received when he got
only 50 cents a bushel. Let me say that 60
cents in 1935 would buy as much as $1.20
buys today. If the cost of living index were
calculated on the original basis that the
period 1935-39 equalled 100, it would today
stand at 193.4. That is an increase of almost
100 per cent. These are problems that our
present marketing system cannot overcome.
I have great admiration for my honourable
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), but
I fail to see how any member of the Liberal
party can stand up and support the compulsory features of this legislation. When I was
at school and later as a young man I was
always told that the Liberal party was composed of free traders, free this and free that.
Since I have come to Ottawa I have found
them to be leading the parade in promoting
compulsory legislation with respect to one of
the main commodities of our country. There
is no use in trying to fool ourselves, honourable senators: to Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta grain means more than all the rest
of the products of that part of Canada put
together. The successful production and
marketing of our grain means prosperity for
not only the three Prairie provinces, but for
the rest of Canada as well.

SENATE

The present system makes the life of the
farmer very discouraging. For instance, there
came to my office in October a man on whose
farm I make the collections. When I asked
him how he was getting along, he told me
he had received only two payments for wheat
at one bushel per acre. So from his 200 acres
he had received total payments of about $480.
Out of this, be told me, be had paid his bills
for groceries, gasoline and garage service, and
there was nothing left to pay interest, principal or taxes. He went on to say that be
would not be able to buy clothes this winter
for his children; that his wife had not had a
new coat for five years and would not be
getting one this year. This was the situation
in which be found himself, despite the fact
that be had a good crop: he grew as much as
30 bushels to the acre, but be could get no
money for it. These are facts, honourable
senators, not imagination. We frequently see
in our office poorly dressed men and women
who we know own half sections of beautiful
land and granaries full of grain. Some of
them have suggested that I come and get
their grain to pay fees owing to me. But what
good would the grain be to me? Nobody can
sell it. I believe things are getting worse
instead of better.
My friend the senior senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) said that more than 800
million bushels of grain are now in storage in
the central and local elevators and on the
farms. Our sales last year amounted to about
315 million bushels, so we now have on hand
practically as much as we sell in three years.
I certainly do not know where we could go
to sell this wheat. For instance, during the
past three or four years Sweden bas got into
the world market on hard wheat. France bas
soft wheat for sale, and if a buyer bas American currency and needs food badly be is going
to buy French wheat. It is a most discouraging situation.
If we took the world market prices each
year for the past ten years and added them
up, we would find that on the average our
farmers would have been better off under that
system. That is what we learn by looking
back over the past ten years.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
delay the bouse much longer. But this is a
problem very close to the people of Manitoba.
Our crop is harvested ten days earlier than
that of Saskatchewan, and we are 400 miles
nearer the seaboard; yet we do not gain anything by reason of our geographic location.
Perhaps we should have no advantage by
reason of it. But, as honourable senators
know, from a seaboard standpoint it is more
profitable to do business in Montreal than in
Toronto. We did at one time benefit by our
geographic advantage, but today it bas gone.

Be that as it may, the question remains, how
are we ever going to sell our surplus wheat
under our present marketing system, when
we have at least three years supply on hand?
I know of no solution.
No one can deny that the Americans are
shrewd businessmen. But they have adopted
the policy of giving their wheat away to
get rid of it, and we are faced with that kind
of competition in the world markets. What
possible solution is there for it? When I
return home in April the farmers in my province will ask me what happened to the Wheat
Board bill. I shall have to tell them that the
Senate voted to extend the board's powers for
another five years. When they ask me what
is the solution for the marketing tie-up, I
shall have to tell them I have none. I hope
that in the intervening five years-that is a
long time and some of us may not be here
five years from now-I hope that in that
period some of our members will study this
problem and convince the people of Canada
that we in this chamber believe the problem
cannot be solved by our present method, but
that grain bas to be sold as other commodities
are, on the world market, at the world price.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I have just a few remarks to make. First of
all, I want to say that I was somewhat
alarmed at the statement by the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
that all political parties supported the British
Wheat Agreement. I remember distinctly that
was not the case. The party that I have
the honour to support certainly opposed it,
and I opposed it here.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Will the honourable member permit an interruption? If I gave that
impression it was not what I wanted to convey. What I did wish to convey was this,
that all parties supported the incorporation
of the compulsory features in the Wheat
Board legislation.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is right, and I am
supporting the compulsory feature. Because
of the circumstances and the vast territory
of the west, farmers find it impossible to
organize by themselves. Wheat growing is
practically a new industry for many farmers
in western Canada. It would be the ideal
situation if the farmers were able to organize themselves and store every bushel of
their own grain at home on their farms. Then
if any snooper came around looking in a
farmer's storage bins trying to estimate their
contents, in order to shout the information
from the housetops, the farmer would have
a perfect right to order him off his land and
refuse to divulge any information whatever.
It also would be ideal if all farmers could
agree to sell at similar prices, as is done by

FEBRUARY 20, 1957
industry. Who ever heard of one implement
company selling a combine for $2,000 or
$3,000 and other companies selling the same
machine for $6,000? No, they all sell at the
same price. The farmers however, are not
in that fortunate position at present.
I would like to ask a question. If the
present control over the marketing of wheat
is a good thing, why is there not a similar
control over the sale of rye and flaxseed?
I may tell the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that rye mixed
with other grain forms a good feed, and rye
can be purchased outside the Wheat Board.
The same is true of flaxseed. A small quantity
of flaxseed mixed with other grain is better
than the same quantity of flaxseed alone.
You pay good money for oilcake, which is
made from flaxseed.
I would like to tell a story which points up
the strict honesty of a farmer I had to do
business with, a Doukhobor by the name of
John Pereversoff. In 1929 I sold him a
section of land, he to pay off a balance by
giving me a share of his wheat crop. At
that time the price of wheat was dropping.
I was then a strong supporter of the pool,
and I asked him that fall to deliver my share
of his crop of wheat to the pool elevator, as
I wanted to sell it to the pool. At that
particular time wheat was selling for $1.25
a bushel or better, and I sold mine at that
price, or thereabouts. John, however, delayed
selling his wheat and when he did sell he
only received 64 cents a bushel for it. In
talking to him later I said, "John, look here,
I feel that I should make an adjustment
with you and give you an allowance from
the higher price I got for my wheat." "Oh,
no, Mr. Horner," be said, "I too could have
sold my wheat last fall at $1.30 but instead
I held it and only got 64 cents for it, but
you don't need to mind." Now, I always
felt so grateful for that. He might have
said, yes, certainly, I am entitled to a credit
for $1.30 a bushel or whatever the price was
in the fall; but no, he did not ask me that.
That just serves to illustrate the unfortunate
position that farmers are placed in when
attempting to guess the proper time to sell
wheat under the open market system.
Honourable senators, as I have said before,
it is strange how quickly these apparent surpluses of wheat can disappear. Perhaps in
all the history of Prairie farming there has
never been such a period of continuous and
sufficient rainfall as there was in a great
part of that whole area during the past
seven years, and that is the reason we find
ourselves in our present position. Now, we
might very well be facing seven years of a
light crop, as Egypt did according to the
Biblical story, when seven fat years were
82719-16J

followed by seven lean years. It is a most
remarkable fact that in western Canada we
have had seven years of large crops, but I
can well remember the time when the crop
was so meagre that in order to get even a
bit of wheat or oats you would have to go
miles. I agree with the honourable senator
from Rosetown that the present surplus is
nothing to be alarmed at, and I think it might
very well turn out to be the most valuable
asset that Canada possesses.
Hon. J. Wesley S±ambaugh: Honourable
senators,Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I am not suggesting that the honourable senator should not speak, but there is a rule,
as we all know, that a senator can speak only
once on second reading. I did not interrupt
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) when he spoke and I am
not suggesting that the honourable senator
from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) should not
be allowed to speak, but I do feel that I
should bring the rule to the attention of the
bouse.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Honourable senators,
I did not speak before on this motion; I
simply made a remark while anotber senator
was speaking.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: You asked a question.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not suggesting
that the honourable senator should not speak,
but I think that for future occasions we
should remember the rule. As reported in
Hansard, the honourable senator began to
speak at page 203 and the record of his
remarks continues on the first column of 204,
with a few interruptions.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I do not think the
rule applies to a remark made by me while
someone else is speaking. Have I the consent
of the Senate to speak now?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I made it perfectly
clear that I was not rising to prevent the
honourable senator from addressing us, but to
remind the house of the rule.
Hon. Mr. Poulioi: I move that the honourable senator may speak.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And I would second
the motion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator
must have the unanimous consent of the
bouse to speak. A member who has already
taken part in a debate may not speak again
without unanimous consent.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I have not spoken in
this debate.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, you did. I myself
heard you speak.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: You have spoken
three or four times.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is not so.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: There is a
motion before the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I take objection to it. It is
out of order.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Can we agree that,
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) having spoken twice, the
honourable senator from Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh) shall be permitted to speak at
this time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not object at all to
his speaking, but it should be understood that
before any honourable senator speaks a second time he shall have the unanimous consent of the house.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I do not
think all this discussion is in order. I hope
that in future we shall follow the rules.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: May I point out that
when I rase before I did so to call to the
attention of the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that he had made
a mistake. He said he had not. What he said
was that all a farmer could sell was the
amount of his one-bushel or two-bushel quota.
I then pointed out that there is a unit
allowance above the quota. This he denied;
but the fact is that every farmer in western
Canada where the quota is in operation has
a unit. It is true that, to farmers in the
position of the honourable senator from
Rosetown, who has 40,000 or 50,000 bushels to
dispose of, the unit amounts to very little,
but it means something more to the average
farmer in the district where I live. It amounts
to 300 bushels of wheat, and I repeat that it
has no connection with the quota, it is known
as a unit. It includes 500 bushels of barley,
80 bushels of oats, 500 bushels of rye, which
the farmer is permitted to sell, and over and
above that is the amount of one, two, three
bushels, or whatever it is, on the cultivated
acreage. A producer with no more than 50 or
60 acres, perhaps less, under cultivation, is
in the same position in this respect as the
man who farms a thousand acres: he has that
unit to start with.
The honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) stated that upon the
death of a farmer, his heirs could not sell
more than the quota. That is not correct.
Admittedly what can be disposed of means
little to the farmer with 40,000 or 50,000 bushels, but a year or so ago I was an executor of

an estate whose assets included 2,000 bushels
over and above the man's quota, and upon
application to the wheat board we got permission to sell the whole amount. So the system
works out fairly well for the small farmer.
Hon. Sydney J. Smith: Honourable senators,
I have not spoken in this debate, nor had I
intended to do so until I felt that the point
so well made the other day by the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) had been more or less lost in the maze
of discussion which has taken place since. I
am not in disagreement with the purpose of
the bill, nor with most of the views presented
in the discussion, and I support the principle
of orderly marketing. I have been interested
in the production and marketing of grain
since 1909, when I homesteaded in Saskatchewan; and I still have a farm with many bins
bulging with grain, some of which has been
stored there for five years, so I know something about the problem of marketing. On
the Prairies the Provider of all good things
has made it possible for the farmer to raise
grain in abundance. Across the border between British Columbia and Alberta we are
favoured with conditions which produce the
finest bunch grass in the world, and the land
supports a tremendous beef industry, but we
do not produce the grain for finishing. In
this connection I should like to refer to the
example quoted by the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) of the two
farmers living within half a mile of the
boundary between Manitoba and Saskatchewan and being unable to transact a sale and
purchase of seed grain except through the
Wheat Board. The problem we face is similar,
in that our beef producers who are interested
in procuring feed grain are unable to obtain
it from the prairie provinces except through
the board. As a result, this winter trainloads
of feeder cattle have been shipped, for finishing, from the interior of British Columbia to
points in Alberta, but this has been done by
large outfits, financially able to carry out that
kind of project. I have been getting letters in
every mail-I received three this afternoonfrom beef producers protesting against having
to sell their beef in the condition it is when
their stock of feed is exhausted. In one case
the man had used up two carloads of grain
which cost him $56.25 a ton, and when it was
gone the cattle had to be sold at 17 cents a
pound. Surely there is a way for the Government to arrange for the sale of that grain
from a farmer or farm organization in Alberta
or Saskatchewan to a beef farmer or a cooperative or other organization in British
Columbia that wants it for feed. The difficulty is that the regulations do not permit
this transaction because the grain must cross
a provincial border.

FEBRUARY 20, 1957
As a supporter of orderly marketing of
grain I intend to support this bill. But the
smaller ranchers out in our country feel there
is something unreasonable in a situation
whereby some rancher who is financially able
to ship his cattle into Lethbridge or Medicine
Hat can finish them off on grain for which he
pays $16 to $20 a ton, and put them on the
market in competition with those who have
to import feed grain at a cost of $55 or
$60 a ton. I want to turn the spotlight on
that situation, because I know that the grain
farmer who is interested only in the marketing of his crop does not appreciate the problem which is faced by his brqther agriculturist
who produces beef instead of grain. I hope
that some solution will be worked out, for
where there is a will there is a way. Surely
those who can do something about it will
take action if they realize how serious this
matter is.
Here is another point that may interest
honourable members. A few weeks ago I
enjoyed a delicious steak dinner in a famous
Vancouver steakhouse which is known to
almost every person who has visited that city.
The proprietor came to our table afterwards
and when I asked him where he got his meat
from he replied, "I get it from Texas. It is
shipped up here in refrigerator cars."
I am not going to enlarge upon this situation, but it is sufficient to say there is a
market for surplus feed grain in British
Columbia. This market could be promoted
and built up if the boundary line regulations
prohibiting grain transactions between provinces could be overcome.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Norman
senators,-

P. Lambert:

Honourable

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, I would remind the house that if
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) speaks now he will close the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to detain the house at any
length. As the sponsor of this bill I certainly
welcome the discussion that has taken place,
and I think the specific problems that have
been raised, such as the ones just referred to
by the honourable gentleman from Kamloops
(Hon. Mr. Smith), indicate that many worthwhile questions will be asked of officials in
committee.
With respect to the liberty and freedom of
movement amongst farmers, I do not think
there is any doubt that a farmer living in,
say, Manitoba can buy or deliver grain to
another farmer without any permit at all or
without any resort to the Wheat Board.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If they live within the
same province.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am also under the
impression that a farmer living in Alberta,
for instance, can deal in the same way with
a farmer living in, say, British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They cannot do so.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is the information
I have.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is a closed corporation.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Well, this can be clarified in committee. What I really wanted to
say at this time is that this whole subject,
as I tried to suggest in the beginning, reaches
back a long way, and any discussion of
this legislation or of any phase of the Wheat
Board legislation is bound to give rise to
a good deal of historical references, the
good men who have been forgotten, and
such things as the British Wheat Agreement
and the $65 million award. It is said that
historians have a weakness for rubbing their
hands over the past and wringing them somewhat over the future, but at the same time
washing them of the mighty present.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I submit that this legislation amending the Wheat Board Act
represents a realistic bit of the mighty present,
which has evolved through the last twentyfive years to its present state, influenced
by events over which no government has
had very much control. The international
situation, the result of two world wars, the
disruption of exchanges and trade, which
have resulted in entirely new connections
for Canada's trade in grain and other commodities, together with the incalculable impact of Providence in showering the western
provinces with unprecedented harvests of
grain, have all created problems which I
submit no ordinary process of marketing can
remedy.
We like to think back sometimes. I remember the pleasure I used to get from
sending cablegrams at night giving quotations
on shipments of grain or flour within a fraction of a cent of the price that would be
acceptable the next morning. The day when
that could be done has gone, because of the
economic and financial disturbances that resulted from two world wars. As everyone
knows, in particular the economic upheaval
of the twenties and thirties, which marked
the period between the two wars, was clearly
as devastating as any war.
I do not intend to review the various steps
that have established this Wheat Board
method of marketing as virtually the only
practical device for bringing some kind of

CANADA COUNCIL BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 47, an Act for the establishment of a Canada Council for the encouragement of the arts, humanities and social
sciences.

He said: Honourable senators, as its title
states, this is a bill to establish a Canada
Council for the encouragement of the arts,
humanities and social sciences. I do not think
the bill will provoke any measure of surprise
among honourable senators, for the Canada
Council has been discussed by thoughtful
people throughout Canada for a number of
years and has already been the subject of
numerous articles in the press and in magazines. Its formation has been urged by many
organizations which are devoted to the
objects which will also be the objects of the
council, and indeed, its establishment was
one of the recommendations made by the
Massey Commission in its report of 1951.
Now that there has been ample occasion for
full consideration and discussion through
public media and by private groups, and since
it is clearly the wish of most thoughtful
people, it is the opinion of the Government,
that it would now be timely to establish the
council. The bill implements the Government's decision in that respect.
The arts, humanities and social sciences
with which this bill is concerned have been a
vital part of Canadian life since the development of this country began. Indeed, they
must be a vital part of the life of any country
which wishes to hold up its head in the community of nations. I think it speaks well of
Canada and of our people that while we have
wrested our wealth and national heritage
from the land to which our forefathers came,
we still have found occasion, through our
universities and through voluntary organizations operating across the country, not only
to keep alive but to cherish and develop our
spiritual growth as it is expressed in the arts,
humanities and social sciences.
Honourable senators will therefore appreciate that the purpose of this bill is not to
create in Canada some new or strange or
hitherto unexplored field of human endeavour.
It is designed to give some measure of effective encouragement to things which the Canadian people have already shown through
successive generations that they believe to
be of lasting value. This belief has been
expressed by the foundation and development
of our universities and by the work of
voluntary organizations at the national, provincial and local levels. But, as we know,
these organizations have worked sometimes
under the greatest difficulties and have been
sustained, I can safely say, only by the
devotion of their members. I believe the time
has come for the Government to provide
some assistance to these organizations in
order that in a rapidly expanding country
they can effectively continue this work
which, I repeat, has been going on for so
long.

SENATE
Therefore, as I have already said, there is
nothing essentially novel in the bill before
us. What is new is its provision for a carefully thought-out means whereby a small
part of our national wealth may be effectively channeled to stimulate the arts, humanities and social sciences in Canada.
The stature of our country is such that we
can no longer depend in this field upon
contributions from private persons, nor from
private foundations, many of which are
established in other countries. The time
has come when we must be prepared to help
ourselves. Although the method of support
envisaged in this bill is new to Canada, I
may perhaps be permitted to remind honourable senators that many of the countries
from which our people have come have
already taken steps to support the arts,
humanities and social sciences.
I might
mention a few of these countries: the United
Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. After
they became national entities many centuries
passed before they took steps to provide the
kind of support which they realized could
no longer be left to the great patrons of the
arts. Therefore, I think we may take some
pride in the fact that less than a century after
Confederation we come to consider a measure
of this kind.
Will honourable senators permit me to
survey briefly the purposes of the bill, and
the methods therein set forth to implement
them? Clauses 3 to 7 provide for the creation
of a Canada Council, which will consist of
21 members to be drawn from those many
Canadians who have already contributed with
distinction to the development of our country
or who stand in the forefront of the work
that has already been done to maintain the
arts, humanities and social sciences in Canada.
May I add that I have no doubt that in
choosing these persons due care will be
taken to ensure that they represent as far
as possible the different regions and the
major cultures of the country.
Clause 8 sets out the objects and powers
of the council.
The council will be required to administer
two funds for the encouragement of the arts,
humanities and social sciences.
Perhaps
honourable senators will refer to clauses 14
and 16. The first fund, as described in
clause 14, is an endowment fund of $50
million, the interest on which--I emphasize
the word "interest"-is to be devoted in
part to the provision of scholarships, awards
and loans in these fields. Since, as I have
emphasized, these things have already existed
for a long time in Canada, the purpose of
this fund will be to assist existing voluntary
organizations in universities in the same

way that assistance has been given by the
federal Government to stimulate our economie
development. In addition, this fund will also
be devoted to providing opportunities for
Canadian scholars to study abroad and for
foreign scholars to come to Canada. Clause
8 (1) (e) of the bill provides that the council
will act as a centre for the exchange of
information between organizations both in
and outside Canada and will be required to
see that the Canadian arts, humanities and
social sciences are represented, as appropriate,
in other countries. By clause 8 (2), the
council will have certain duties and functions
with relation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
the exact nature of which will be determined later.
It is, of course, essential that in our
universities the humanities and social sciences
must have the facilities which they need both
for present enrolment and for the anticipated
demands to be made upon them within less
than a decade. Provision is made in the bill
accordingly for a second fund of $50 million,
to be called the University Capital Grants
Fund. In this respect I would refer honourable senators to clause 17. The capital of
this fund-and in this respect I emphasize
the word "capital", as I did the word "interest" in the endowment fund-is to be
used under certain conditions for the construction of much needed buildings at Canadian universities throughout the country.
The terms under which these two funds are
to be established differ, as the purposes for
which the funds are intended differ. The
council will not be permitted to use the capital
of the endowment fund, but will use only the
fairly substantial annual income to be derived
from the investment of this money. I would
refer honourable senators to clause 16 (a) of
the bill. This fund therefore is designed to
provide a continuing income which the council will be permitted to disburse in the form
of scholarships, awards and loans over the
years for the encouragement of the arts,
humanities and social sciences. In order that
the council may enjoy the maximum income
which would be consistent with a prudent
investment of public funds, provision is made
by clause 18 of this bill for the creation of an
investment committee which will advise the
council as to how this fund may most efficiently be invested. In this way it is hoped
that the real income of the council will
remain at the high level that may be expected from an expanding economy such as
ours.
Now let me refer to the second fund, as
provided for by clause 17. It is described,
as I have said, as the University Capital
Grants Fund, and will be expended under

FEBRUARY 21, 1957
conditions laid down in the bill. Essentially
these conditions are, as provided in clause
17 (2) (b), that universities in the different
provinces will receive a share of the fund
equivalent to the proportion which the population of each province is to the population
of Canada as a whole.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Does
that refer only to existing universities?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At the present time
it would refer to existing universities. But
if a new university were established and
there were moneys in the fund, I presume
the newly created university could qualify
for its share.
Honourable senators, this provision will
ensure an equitable distribution of the funds
within all the provinces in Canada. In addition, as provided for in clause 17 (2) (a),
within this framework each university must
match the sum to be provided by the council
for any given construction project by an
equal sum to be provided from other sources.
In this way it is to be hoped that provincial
governments, private organizations and private benefactors may wish to associate themselves with this particular aspect of the
work of the council, and that the capital to
be expended by the council will attract an
equal amount of money from other sources.
May I draw the attention of honourable
senators to the specific provision made by
clause 20 under which the council may receive bequests, donations and gifts as a
charitable organization. Indeed, I hope, as
I am sure all honourable senators do, that
private persons and organizations of wealth
and substance may find in the council a central body to whose good offices they feel they
may with confidence make gifts or bequests
to be devoted with maximum efficiency to
the encouragement of the arts, humanities
and social sciences.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Would such gifts be free
of income tax?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Not entirely free of
income tax. Any gift would stand in the
same position with regard to income tax as
would a gift to a charitable organization.
The amount of money which a donor can
give free of tax is limited by the Income Tax
Act.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I understand that. However, I should have thought in a case such
as this some further exemption should be
made.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No provision is made
in the bill for any further exemption. As I
say, a gift to the council would be in the
same position as a gift to a charitable
organization.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: And it would be exempted from succession duties.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. I thank my
honourable friend. It would in that respect
be also in the same position as a gift to a
charitable organization.
Honourable senators, in closing may I say
that as far as I am concerned I have no fear,
such as has been freely and perhaps without
due consideration expressed elsewhere, that
the Canada Council as provided for in this
bill in any way represents state control of
the arts or "canned culture". Honourable
senators will note from clause 13 that the
council is not to be an agent of the crown.
It is to be largely an autonomous body designed not to control or interfere with but to
assist our universities and our voluntary
organizations which have already for generations, and frequently under great difficulties,
done such splendid work in these fields. The
bill makes provision for what I believe to be
a very real and growing need in our country.
It is a bill in which I have complete confidence, and I hope and trust honourable senators will give it theirs.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to speak at any length on this
bill. It has, however, given me cause for a
great deal of thought, because it deals essentially with the matter of education. While
the first part of the bill has to do with the
arts, humanities and social sciences, it primarily concerns the universities. The second
part of the bill deals purely with universities.
I would like to put this question to honourable senators: Out of every hundred children
attending public school in Canada today how
many do you think will ever go through to
university? Twenty-five years ago, when I
first made a speech on this issue, the proportion was 3 per cent; that is, three out of every
hundred public school children then reached
a university. The proportion may now be 4
per cent, but I doubt if it is any higher than
that.
We in this country are going through a
period the like of which we have never seen
before, and the uppermost question today is
the cost of primary education to the people.
Nothing in the world is so important as a
proper education for the boys and girls, the
young men and young women, of our country.
This education starts with the public school.
If you will look up the record I think you
will find that only about 10 per cent of those
who start at public school go on to high
school, or collegiate or whatever you may
call it, and graduate from there. That is all
very good.
The problem of education seems to be the
unwanted child of the governments of this

SENATE
country. In my province of Manitoba we have
been struggling desperately for the last four
or five years with the question of who will
help to pay the high and rising cost of
education.
No doubt the teaching profession is underpaid. Those of us who have been teachersI had the great honour of being one for about
five years-know that there is nothing more
important in any person's life than the impressions received from the teachers at school
and university. I have children of my own
who have gone through public school, high
school and university, and grandchildren who
are now in public school and high school, and
nothing has been more important in their
lives than the impressions given to them by
their teachers. It is all right to talk about
influence of parents at home. That is very
important, of course, but just observe how
implicit is the confidence placed by children
in their teachers at school. So when we engage in controversy about teachers' pay, let
us remember that a teacher contributes to
the boy and girl, the young man and woman,
something that no one else ever does.
I would now like to make some reference
to the University of Manitoba. As I have
mentioned previously, it is unique in that it
was established through the united action of
four outstanding religious denominations in
the community. So far as I am aware, it
was the first university to be formed on this
basis in Canada, and I do not know if such
a thing had been done before in even the
United States or Britain. But at any rate,
that is what was done at Winnipeg, some 85
or 87 years ago. The four denominations were
the Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist,
and Anglican. And right down through the
intervening years these four religious organizations have worked together on the university Senate, which sets the examinations
and programs of study, and never was there
a quarrel or dispute of any kind that was
not worked out within the confines of the
university. I will admit that the university
is not the largest nor the most important in
the dominion, but I believe its founding and
administration constitute the greatest instance
of co-operation between religious bodies that
our country has ever seen.
Now we need more building accommodation for that university. The Anglican Church
wants to erect a new building on the university site, as does the Roman Catholic Church.
The Methodists and Presbyterians, who
are now in the United Church, are debating
whether they too should build on the university site. The present United College
buildings have been in existence for very

many years. If I may make a personal reference I will mention that this spring I shall
have been a graduate of that university for
61 years.
The point I want to make is that universities located in the more newly-settled
provinces-Manitoba,
Saskatchewan
and
Alberta-and in Newfoundland require more
assistance than those in Ontario, Quebec
and other parts of the dominion where
academic facilities have been longer established and most of the major building
requirements have been provided for.
The bill, of course, relates only to the
development of the arts, humanities and
social sciences. There is here no provision
to assist the teaching of engineering and
many other sciences. But a knowledge of
departments of modern knowledge which lie
outside the scope of the bill is increasingly
demanded all over the country, and the
necessary facilities will cost a lot of money.
So it must be recognized that we are touching
here no more than the fringe of the whole
problem of education.
I do not say this in criticism of the bill.
I shall vote for it. This is not a political
question. I am indifferent to how anyone
else will vote; in fact I would support the
bill were I the only member of the chamber
to do so. In my position as chairman of a
college board I would act unreasonably toward that college if I did not support this
legislation, for I can see many benefits that
But I see difficulties as
will flow from it.
well.
The interest which will be derived from
the endowments is very small. The honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) touched on this point in what,
I think, was a pretty good speech. But the
fact remains that if you get as much as $2
million interest on an investment of $50
million you will be doing very well. It is
true that because of the tightness of money,
resulting, I must candidly remark, from
Government policy, the present interest rate
is up, but I hope that things will not always
remain that way and that interest will
revert to a more reasonable level. When
that day arrives, the return from this
endowment fund will certainly be less than
$2 million. However, whatever revenue is
obtained, I am convinced that it will do a
lot of good and that contributions from the
public will be encouraged by the Council's
activities.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that gifts to
institutions of learning should be exempt
from income tax. Money directed to purposes of this kind is not given to charity.

FEBRUARY 21, 1957
Charitable contributions are a form of protection provided by the contributor in his
own locality.
But money donated to
universities benefits the state because to the
extent that private persons contribute the
state is relieved from making grants. So, I
hold, the tax exemption should cover the
entire donation. If I give $50,000 to a college endowment fund I should be allowed
relief on my income tax that year in the
total amount that I have donated. In this
way people would be encouraged to support
their universities.
Today, $50 million will not go very far.
Building costs have at least doubled in 20
years. That means that new buildings will
cost a lot more money than they used to.
Take, for instance, the college of which I
have the honour to be the chairman. We
need a new building right now, and the
latest estimate of the cost is about $3 milThis year we are turning away
lion.
students because we cannot provide them
with accommodation, and had it not been
that the Government increased the grant
this year from 50 cents to $1 per head we
would have been unable to do anything for
the teaching staff of the college. The additional money, as I have previously mentioned, is being allocated to the increase of
salaries and endowments for professors, a
provision which must be made if these men
are to be retained in the positions they
occupy. Now under the proposed legislation
we have hope of a grant from the council
of one and a half million dollars; the
remainder of the $3 million must be raised in
our own province. But more money will
have to be found. The president of the
University of Toronto said the other day
that in the next 10 or 12 years at least $350
million should be spent on the universities
of this country if we are to provide adequately not only for those now living here
but for the immigrant population which is
needed if this country is to be adequately
settled and populated.
So, although I shall support the bill, I
have in mind other related considerations.
What I am about to say has a political
flavour and may offend some honourable
senators, but I am going to say it. I can
appreciate that in Quebec the provincial
Government has very strong views on its
responsibility in educational matters. They
are, in fact, the most important with which
the provinces have to deal. It seems to me
that the additional money needed by the
provincial universities should be raised by
the provinces themselves, not by the dominion
Government. That is, the tax base upon
which the dominion Government levies this
money should be shifted to the provinces,

so that it will be their function to determine
how, as between public schools, high schools,
and universities, the revenues should be
divided. This seems to me to be fundamental.
It was always understood that under the
British North America Act education would
be under the control of the provinces. I
am not taking sides in this issue; I know
how much dynamite it holds; but it is my
belief that Parliament, however right it may
be on many other issues, has been mistaken
in its handling of this question.
To repeat: I intend to vote for this legislation, but I am opposed to the bill in certain
particulars. I urge that total exemption from
income tax and succession duties be granted
in respect of moneys donated for purposes
such as are contemplated in the bill. If
this were done, I believe, a great deal of
money would be raised, but if the present
policy is continued the money must be
obtained from taxation. It is far better to get
it voluntarily.
I do not believe that the whole problem of
education in Canada has been properly investigated. The position of affairs in Manitoba is typical of the situation in the rest
of Canada. We need more public schools,
more high schools, and more university accommodation; we need to pay professors and
teachers more money so that we can attract
the men and women best fitted for this
work and qualified by their training and
experience to give something to humanity.
As long as I live I'1l never forget one of
my professors at the University of Manitoba.
He tought me something that was not in
the books and I have carried that teaching
with me all my life. You might say, "He
couldn't have made a very good impression,
because you are no great shakes yourself."
Well, I would have been much worse had
it not been for what that man taught me.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You would still have
been pretty good.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be. Some teachers
and professors instil in their students certain
things they never forget. These are the
men and women of our country who need
encouragement. Canada is a great nation and
is accepting immigrants from all over the
world, but these newcomers will never be
joined together here as one united people
until they learn what it is to be Canadians.
Their children will attend our schools and
colleges where our teachers and professors
will inculcate the spirit of Canadianism in
them. They will not get it from books.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I do not intend to take very much time,
but I do not think I would be true to the

SENATE
profession I have been working in for the
last twenty-five years if I did not say something about this very important milestone in
Canada's development which is represented
by the establishment of the Canada Council.
It will be one of the most important turning
points in the cultural growth and development of Canada.
The other day when I was in the House of
Commons gallery I was delighted to observe
that this bill was being piloted through that
house by the Prime Minister himself. I think
it is rather fitting that a measure of this
importance should have the attention and the
interest of the Prime Minister. It is also an
indication of his calibre as a man that he
has interested himself to the extent that he
has in this very important project.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron:

I happened to be in

Delhi when the announcement of the proposed

have a responsibility in this field. The writer
goes on in an attempt to define the responsibilities of the council, and I just want to
quote one more passage:
Its precise duties must be defined. They should
be based on the Massey Commission suggestions,
which outlined them in this way: To stimulate and
help voluntary organizations within the fields of
arts, letters, humanities and social sciences; to
foster Canada's relations abroad; to correlate and
stimulate Canada's relationship with UNESCO; and
to devise and administer a system of scholarships.
I think that is also a true statement.
Apropos the suggestion contained in that

editorial, I think it is important that the

council make adequate provision in personnel
at least for a UNESCO Commission.
This
organization, to which I referred in this house

some three weeks ago, will play an increas-

ingly important role in the life of the people
of Canada and of other nations. I would

I hope that the funds of this Canada Counthe purposes of the council, and if I may I cil will be used for the purpose of working
would like to quote from it. It commences: with and through existing agencies rather
There have been many memorable achievements
in the development of Canadian culture, but few
will rank with Prime Minister St. Laurent's announcement of his Government's intention to
establish a handsomely endowed Canada Council.
True, it bas been five years since such an organization was proposed by the Massey Commission ...

The writer goes on to say:
The endowment of $50 million will provide at
least $2 million annually to be distributed as the
council decides. Thus overnight, the climate for
the growth of those activities which are the mark
of a truly civilized nation bas been vastly
improved.

I must say I thoroughly agree with that statement. The article continues:
That climate bas been less than felicitous; culture
in this country has faced many difficulties in its
stubborn attempt to grow and flower. Buffeted by
the winds of indifference, stricken by the frost of
poverty, it bas nevertheless displayed enough
vigor to take root and in its growth attract increasing attention.
But this cultural development bas lagged far
behind our industrial achievements. We are known
internationally for our physical wealth, our
tremendous growth, our ability to tackle and solve
gigantic physical problems. Such things as the
St. Lawrence Seaway and the development of our
mineral wealth have properly caught the imagination of the world. Our cultural assets are less
known; many of them, in fact, are distressingly
unknown within our own borders. If the Canada
council achieves its purpose, it will make possible
the cultural equivalent of our physical feats.

I think that is a good summing up of the
situation and opens a challenge to those who

than for the purpose of starting new activ-

ities. The very fact these agencies have survived the buffeting of hard times and
indifference of the past and are making contributions in our communities today is
evidence that they have made a place for
themselves in their respective communities
and are the agencies which should receive
assistance.
Another point is that there should not be
too much artificial stimulation of the arts.
One of the most difficult tasks the members
of the council will have is in dealing with the
veritable blitz of proposals of every kind
and description that will be submitted to it.

The task of selecting those which are practical, fitting and fruitful will not be an easy
one. However, the council will not go far
wrong if it establishes the criterion that before being granted assistance an institution or
agency must first demonstrate that it is
satisfying a basic need.
I am delighted that provision has been
made for capital grants. As one of those who
have had to raise by private efforts most of
the money for the institution with which I
am associated, I know how difficult it is and
how ill-equipped the arts and the humanities
are to compete in this matter with the faculties of agriculture, medicine, engineering,
dentistry and so on. In a country that is
developing it is natural and obvious that the

FEBRUARY 21, 1957
basic requirements for training people in
agriculture, medicine, engineering and dentistry must be met. It was probably not
unreasonable that they should have first call
on the limited funds available. But this
recognition of the fact that the humanities
are a vital need should I think encourage
other governments, both municipal and provincial, to make larger grants for the
advancement of the humanities.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
labour the point now, but I wish to suggest
that one of the things to which we should
give some attention is a possible revision of
the Income Tax Act and the Sucession Duty
Act, with respect to charitable donations for
education purposes. That, however, is part
of another story.
I agree with the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that it is preferable that these funds should be contributed
voluntarily by individuals or corporations, or
groups who are in a position to give them,
rather than that the Government should provide the funds through taxation of the people.
However, unless a more liberal provision is
made to recognize charitable gifts the universities and related institutions will have to
come to governments for increasing amounts
of money.
Honourable senators, may I say in conclusion that I feel this is a red-letter day for the
arts and humanities of Canada. I compliment
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) upon his excellent
explanation of the bill. I look forward to
the new upsurge in the growth and development of the arts in Canada that will result
from this very generous and imaginative
grant made on the initiative of the Prime
Minister.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
have only a few words to say. Without
repeating what I said during the debate on
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, I wish to say that I am opposed to
establishment of the Canada Council at this
time, but perhaps for different reasons from
those already advanced. I will attempt to
name a few of them.
The honourable senator from Banff (Hon.
Mr. Cameron), who has just resumed his seat,
used the expression "artificial stimulation".
To my mind this whole idea is entirely artificial. I believe that art, together with everything pertaining to it, is something that
springs up in a person or nation in spite of
any obstacle.
It cannot be bought with
money. We have come to regard money as
the most important thing in life, and so long
as we remain in that state of mind we will
not advance in the arts or the humanities.

According to some interpretations it may be
that I do not appreciate art, but certain
objects that people call art I would not want
near my residence at all.
So far as the humanities are concerned,
we have arrived at a stage of development
where a man receiving a salary of $35,000 a
year, with an arrangement for an income
of $50,000 at retirement after five years'
service, takes advantage of his position to
obtain a quarter of a million dollars in a
stock deal, and the members of the cabinet
on behalf of the Government defend his
action on the ground that it is common practice in companies of that kind, because that
sort of thing is advantageous to the future
of a company. That is a bad state of affairs.
I think the ordinary taxpayer who is ground
down, and the wage earner who is not able
to buy a home or provide the necessities of
life, cannot view that sort of thing as a
very human proposition, any more than I
can. It occurs to me that the people who
made donations to the University of Saskatchewan were chiefly men who were too
busy in early life to complete even their high
school education.
I have in mind, for
instance, the late Senator Burns, and I could
name many others, who had to start earning
a livelihood at an early age, without having
had an opportunity of securing a university
education. Indeed, if they had had such a
university education they could not have
accomplished what they did, for it takes a
lot of training in various walks of life to
achieve such success as theirs.
A few years ago the late Angus L.
Macdonald made a statement, which was
supported by the Right Honourable Mr.
Meighen, that a large number of men crowding our universities would be happier in life
if they took hold of a coal shovel and went
to work in a coal mine. Men of experience
know that is true. Nowadays many people
speak as if everyone in the community
should complete a university education. Well,
honourable senators, that is just not possible
at the present time. Furthermore, in spite
of many handicaps, a great many people earn
their own way through life. They are the
ones who take full advantage of the little
education they have, but the ones who have
to be pushed along seldom value their
opportunities.
In the thirties, during the depression, I
shipped some horses up to Rouyn, Quebec,
where I met a fine man, a woodsman. He
himself had not had much education, but he
sent some of his children to university, with
the object of taking degrees. One day he
said to me, "A strange thing, which I cannot

SENATE
understand, is that the members of my family whom I put through university are the
very ones that cannot make a living for
themselves."
Honourable senators, as I read the bill I
understand that the council will be free to
invest the $50 million endowment fund or
gamble with it on the stock market, whereas
the money for university grants may only
be invested in bonds guaranteed by the
Government. Well, I hope the council will
not suffer the same losses as have people
who invested in Government bonds ten years
ago and can now get only 90 cents on the
dollar for them. Of course, if the bonds are
held until maturity they will be paid at par.
Honourable senators, I shall not delay the
proceedings of the house further. I trust that
I have made it at least partially clear why at
the moment I oppose the creation of the
Canada Council.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, may
I ask a question of the honourable Leader of
the Government? I understood him to say
that the council would be composed of 26
persons?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No; 21 persons.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is 21, plus the director
and associate director?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would suggest that another look be taken of subsection 3 of section 4. As I read it, it provides that a person
who has served two consecutive terms as
chairman of the council is not eligible after
a lapse of so many months for re-appointment. Subsection 1 of that section provides
that the chairman shall be appointed for
I am
terms not exceeding five years.
wondering how a chairman could be appointed for two consecutive terms, in view
of the provisions of subsection 3.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He could be reappointed at the end of his first term but
would not be eligible for reappointment during the twelve months following the completion of his second term.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think that matter should
be given further study in committee.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I wish I could be as happy and optimistic with regard to this council as is my friend
from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron). My purpose
in rising at this time is not to get a halo of
popularity, I can assure you. Those who
have in the past advocated economy have
never been popular. If one wishes to gain
public acclaim he must jump on the band
wagon and take part in the glamour of
largesse.

At the moment I do not feel like doing that;
indeed, I am rather inclined to be doubtful
as to the future of the Canada Council. And
of course one does not gain popularity when
he expresses doubt. I express both anxiety
and doubt with regard to the future of the
council and the public interests that are to
be guarded by it.
Our experiences of the past do not lead us
to favour the distribution of funds by irresponsible persons, without at least supervision by Parliament. I am sure I would be
happier if this money were to be expended
directly under the control of Parliament
rather than by irresponsible appointees who
are not even civil servants. Therefore, I
want to assure this council that their actions
will be watched most critically by persons
like myself, who are interested in the arts,
literature and the sciences, and that we will
particularly watch to see that little cliques
and favourites are not allowed to develop.
We will attempt to sec to it that the money is
spent in a broad-minded and fair way for
the purposes for which it is being granted.
Our experiences with bodies of this type
lead us to have some doubts.
In modern times the tendency has become
more and more common to depend upon the
support of governments, and sometimes upon
the largesse of big donators, rather than upon
one's own industry and enterprise. My friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) has
just expressed the thought that big things
have been accomplished by those who fought
against great difficulties. My friend from
Banff spoke about the blight of the frost
of poverty. Let me point out that the great
poets, painters, artists and writers of literature in the past were for the most part poor
men and women who struggled against
tremendous difficulties. They were not supported by any kind of government favour.
Dr. Johnson, who, as my honourable
friends know, wrote the first dictionary in
the English language, defined "pension" as
a payment to an individual for betraying
his country. That definition was rather too
severe, and Dr. Johnson himself later
accepted a pension from the British Government. But there was an element of truth
in the definition. There is nothing that so
blights great endeavours as does ease, comfort or luxury. Those things seem foreign
to the almost fanatical enthusiasm with
which great works of art have been produced.
Dr. Payne, author of a history of English
Literature, spoke about the exalted concentration that was necessary for the production of
such a work as that of the Bard of Avon.
Shakespeare was not a wealthy man. Indeed,
he held the gentlemen's horses or tied them
to hitching posts, in London, for a penny or

FEBRUARY 21, 1957
so. Goldsmith wrote in poverty; indeed, at
the time he produced The Deserted Village
he had scarcely enough to eat.
I am not advocating poverty, but I am
pointing out that the great works of art,
literature and science were for the most
part produced in poverty. They were the
result of an exalted concentration on the
part of the individual, rather than of government favour. To me, government favour
seems a blight, because people will work for
the favour rather than for the art itself.
My honourable friend from Banff (Hon.
Mr. Cameron) bas suggested that there will
be a veritable blitz of demands on this fund.
That is quite true. There is simply no limit
to what some persons will ask in support of
the work they are doing. Of course there will
be a blitz of demands on the fund. And
while the money may give assistance to some
artists and writers to produce something
worth while, it will mean only discouragement to vast sections of the community which
value their own efforts but will be excluded
from the benefits of the fund.
I am just as interested in art and literature as anybody who will be appointed to
this council, and just as anxious that our
artists and men of letters should succeed.
But in the broad picture I very much doubt
whether government money is the way to
secure that kind of success. I express these
doubts not because I am happy in doing so,
but rather because I would like the men and
women who will later become members of
this council to realize that we who are
interested in this field will be watching
them critically to see that the moneys are
distributed wisely, fairly and without favouritism.
I would like to have seen it provided that
these grants that are to be made shall appear year by year in the estimates, and be
publicly considered before being granted. I
think our chances of getting real results from
the expenditure of this public money would
be very much greater if from year to year
the civil servants who distribute it were
obliged to account for their actions to a
minister, and through him to the elected representatives of the country.
And just a word about the University
Grants Fund. I believe that the Fathers of
Confederation were wise when they gave
control of education into the hands of the
provinces, and I am quite sure that the
great majority of my fellow citizens will
agree with me in that statement. The reason
for the movement in the opposite direction
springs from the constant tendency of those
who pay taxes to shift the burden to somebody else. You find in the newspapers day

by day, month by month, this tendency,
this effort, on the part particularly of the
landed interests, to get out of paying the
municipal taxes which they ought to pay
for the support of education, and to shift
the tax burden over, first upon the shoulders
of the provincial Governments, and from the
provincial Governments upon the shoulders of the dominion Government, little realizing that the real problem is not that of
getting money free from the dominion Government, but rather which Government raises
the money with the lesser harm to those who
pay it.
The dominion Government has no money;
it merely spends the money of its taxpayers, and the problem is whether taxation
imposed by the dominion is less oppressive
and destructive than that imposed by the
province, or again than that imposed by the
local municipalities. My thought is that the
taxes best raised, and most effectively spent
are those raised by the municipalities and
the school boards, which are close to the
people, know what the people want and
answer directly to those who pay the money,
rather than this welter of taxes that we in
Parliament levy usually on the basis of the
most feathers for the least squawking, usually
indirect taxes paid by people who are not
conscious that they are paying them.
I see no advantage at all in shifting the
burden of taxes which go to the support of
education first from the local municipalities
to the province, and then from the province
to the dominion. I think the Fathers of
Confederation were quite wise in giving that
responsibility to the local municipalities and
imposing upon them the burden of raising
the money.
I suppose the granting of money to a university by the dominion through this roundabout method of the council and the University Capital Grants Fund is to sugar-coat
the pill for certain parties in the province
of Quebec. If that is the purpose it is a poor
purpose. I would rather we faced the problem courageously. Let us make the grants
directly or not make them at all, and if the
grants are not acceptable then let us drop
it at that, rather than hand out public money
through private individuals. It is a bad
principle.
As I say, I am not happy in making these
comments but I think they are appropriate at
this moment. I am not joining the band
wagon. I am not expressing delight in this
appropriation of $100 million of public money
and the placing of it in the hands of private
individuals. I very much doubt the longrange value of giving money in this way.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, as an educator I think I would be untrue
to my experience, to my hopes and my aspirations if I were not to express my welcome of
this leadership and assistance at the national
level to encourage the arts, the humanities
and the social sciences, and, as forecast in the
Speech from the Throne, to encourage technical education by larger grants to provinces.
If we accept the principle of national purposing in this important problem area, the
bill to me looks straightforward and comprehensive. I am wholeheartedly in support of
it as an exploratory and a real beginning in
helping the arts, the humanities and the social
sciences. I expect that the changing character
of our emerging needs will necessitate changes
to, perhaps even enlargements and extensions
of, this progressive and I believe well-timed
legislation, which I humbly suggest merits
the support of this honourable house. We
hope that doubts and uncertainties expressed
by some honourable senators will be resolved
by statesmanlike policies worked out by the
Canada Council.
In parenthesis, may I express my sincere
belief that continued study must be given to
the problem of overall effective distribution
of taxation revenues to and at the various
levels of government, where the character
and need of expenditure are changing at each
of the three levels.
I should like, without taxing your patience,
to make one or two observations concerning
the specifics of the bill. The membership of
the Canada Council is to be 21. I gather from
the speech of the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that it
is the Government's intention to reflect in the
actual membership of the council, by its representative character, the diversity of contributions and needs of the Canadian population. I quote his words,-I hope, correctly:
"Due care will be taken to ensure that those
chosen will represent different regions and
the major cultures". May I express the hope
that due regard will be given, other things
equal, to the existing cultural diversity in our
democratie milieu. I do not wish to enlarge
on that statement.
There is a University Capital Grants Fund
of $50 million to help in the construction of
buildings. I sat not long ago on the advisory
board of a college in Winnipeg, who were
then discussing how they could raise $500,000
to initiate the construction of the buildings
which are to be put up on the campus; and
a very real point in the discussion was the
expression of the hope for a contribution of
$100,000 from this capital grants fund. Indeed,
it was a very important factor in the advancement of the proposal to provide this very
necessary accommodation.

One of the purposes of the endowment
fund of $50 million is to provide scholarships.
It is my sincere hope that the amounts of the
scholarships will be substantial. Further, section 20 of the bill provides for the receipt of
donations and grants by the Canada Council.
I respectfully suggest that at the provincial
level a very real need exists for educational
endowment funds which would be a vehicle
for the donations of people with smaller
amounts to contribute. It may not be too
farfetched to suggest that in time the Canada
Council shall give leadership in the initiation
of such funds or assist the people who desire
to initiate such funds at the provincial level,
where money is very badly needed.
With these few remarks I shall close. Once
more I express my deep satisfaction that
this legislation is before us at this time. It is
well-timed and comprehensive, and I think
it merits the support of this honourable house.
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Fergusson, the
debate was adjourned.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, February 19, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bois,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops), for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McLean: -in rising I would like
to congratulate the mover and the seconder
of the Speech from the Throne. They did
very well indeed.
I feel I should say something on one or
two subjects on which there is a good deal
of controversy throughout the country, and
as they are rather technical I shall have to
stick rather closely to my notes.
First, I would like to speak on export
prices. This country is entitled to world
prices for the goods we export, but quite
often it seems we are not getting them, and
when export prices of certain commodities are
raised moderately to bring them in line with
world prices there is criticism in certain
quarters both at home and abroad.
Canada has a very large unfavourable trade
balance with the United States. It is estimated that for the year just closed this
unfavourable balance will amount to over a
billion and a quarter dollars. Now, the
only way a debtor country can pay a creditor
country is by exporting goods and services,
and if there ever was a time when Canada
should receive full value for her exports it
is now.
Recently, some of our pulp and paper
companies raised the price of newsprint $4
per ton, which was a very moderate raise
indeed in the circumstances. However, there
was an immediate outcry from some of the
publishing interests and politicians across
the border for an investigation of the
Canadian pulp and paper industry as to why
they have raised the prices of their own
product. Such talk does not make real sense.
As far as I know, our pulp and paper companies are not profiteering. Anyone who
takes the trouble to give the situation a little
study knows that the cost of manufacturing
newsprint has gone up considerably during
the last year, but the wonder of it is that

the increase has been so slight, as it is
difficult to figure out how this small advance
of $4 per ton will cover more than a portion
of the increased costs the manufacturers are
up against. Freight rates have gone up substantially in the last year; the discount on
the American dollar has doubled, and I could
name several other items that have contributed to increasing the costs of manufacturing newsprint. In the circumstances,
therefore, our Canadian paper manufacturers
have been very moderate indeed in raising
the price of their product by only a minimum
amount. I might say here I am speaking
from outside knowledge, as I have no special
interest in any pulp or paper company.
I believe another important product that
has been exported, considerably below world
prices during the past years is nickel. Canada
has a great storehouse of raw materials. It
costs our country considerable to conserve
such resources as our forests, et cetera, and
when we part with these valuable resources,
no matter in what form, whether in the raw
state, semi-manufactured, or as finished products, we should see that full market value
is received in the markets of the world, except, of course, in certain circumstances
where it is Government policy to render
material aid to friendly nations.
Outside companies operating in Canada
would do well to follow the suggestion made
by the Right Honourable C. D. Howe that
Canadians be given a broader opportunity
to become part of their set-up within Canada.
In fact, in some cases when an important
export is involved it would seem wise that
at least 50 per cent of the directors of companies controlled outside of Canada should
be Canadians, so that they could see to it
that full value was received for the companies'
products when sold in the export market.
Next I have something to say about the
present high interest rates and money squeeze
and their effect on the country, especially
on the small man and small business. The
bank rate is no cure-all for inflation; in fact,
a high bank rate is to a certain extent
inflationary within itself, and an unstable
bank rate is very upsetting to industrial
progress. We have at present what I would
call a jumping-jack bank rate. It has been
changed so many times I cannot take the
time to count them. The credits gained by
a high bank rate are minor indeed compared
to the debits, which run into hundreds of
millions, as I mentioned in this chamber
last year.
Over the years I have been interested in
world trade, which has covered a hundred
countries. This has kept me in close touch
with the progress and economy of many

SENATE

nations. Also, I have followed their monetary
policies to see how they have affected their
prosperity or non-prosperity.
As an easterner I know we have no inflation within the Maritimes, for the value of
the vast majority of our products is set by
export prices. The real cure for inflation
-if uncontrolled inflation exists in any part
of Canada-is greater productivity. Sometimes we hear it said that wages are inflated
in certain industries without a corresponding
return in increased production per unit of
labour. Be that as it may, if such conditions
exist the remedy is to help labour toward
attaining greater productivity by giving it
better tools to work with.
Across Canada today many hundreds of
millions of dollars could be well spent on
modernizing plants and factories-that is,
replacing old machines with modern ones and'
adopting the latest scientific processes. This
would help labour produce a greater quantity
of goods per man. How can this be don
under present credit restrictions? Money fo
such purposes is only available to the very\
rich corporations.
The ordinary or small
industry is simply out of the picture. If it
seeks to make itself more efficient through\
scientific means its hands are tied by an;
outdated monetary system that has one quack
monetary cure-all for everything, sound or.
unsound-high interest rates. As one outstanding writer bas put it-we burn down
the barn to kill a rat, or the pig sty to get
a roast of pork.
The man who desires to build even a
small home for his family, which I say is
a noble undertaking in any country, now
finds it next to impossible to raise the money
except at usurious rates, if in fact he can
get it at all. Yet there is certainly no
scarcity of lumber or land to build on in
this country. It costs no more today to issue
and circulate money than it did twenty years
ago, and although we have been becoming
richer and richer as a country we now have
the highest interest rates in a quarter of a
century. This has a serious effect on every
man, woman and child throughout Canada.
It came out in a recent congressional hearing at Washington that every 1 per cent raise
in interest rates meant $7 billion more burden for the American people. In itself this
is of course inflationary, for it adds just that
much more to the cost of living of the ordinary citizen. Thus inflation is being handed
out to cure inflation. In Canada the cost to
the taxpayer would be proportionately the
same.
I quite agree with J. Edouard Labelle, Q.C.,
President of the Provincial Bank of Canada,
when he warns that under present circumstances there is every chance that fear of

inflation might jeopardize progress. That is
exactly what is happening in our eastern
provinces, for as I have pointed out I can
find no inflation whatsoever within the
Maritime provinces. But the fear of inflation
is being spread there by some who have not
the facts nor the figures to back up such
harmful propaganda. Money that flows into
our economy has the same effect, as far as
inflation is concerned, no matter from what
source it comes.
The following table shows the amounts
Canada has borrowed from the United States
during the past few years in provincial government and provincially guaranteed loans,
along with municipal and corporation loans:
1953 ............. .$307,774,000
1954 ..............
184,281,659
1955 ..............
161,613,000
1956 ..............
425,000,000
So one can see we are steadily increasing
our overhead of foreign mortgage indebtedness across the border.
Our borrowings in the United States during
the four years mentioned amounted to well
over a billion dollars, and the interest on
this large sum of money has to be paid to
citizens of the United States and is not subject to ordinary taxes in our own country.
It is probably safe to say that the average
loan will run for about seventeen or eighteen
years and that the average rate of interest
will be something over 31 per cent per
annum. This means that Canadians will pay
to citizens of the United States around $650
million in interest alone, which should have
been paid to Canadian citizens or corporations and put in circulation here to stimulate
our own economy. The tax revenue would
help carry on the business of the country, but
as it is these interest payments will further
aggravate our deficit trade balance. That is
one of the penalties we pay because of the
monetary policy of our central bank, which
seems to have seceded from Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interrupt the
honourable senator to ask a question? In
what form does he think these interest payments owing by Canadians to citizens of the
United States should be made?
Hon. Mr. McLean: They will have to be
paid by exports. There will be no imports
returned for them.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The payments will have
to be in the form of exports.
Hon. Mr. McLean: We are short now in
our trade balance. We are paying interest
now and getting no imports in return.
When Canada borrows money from an
outside country we do not borrow gold. In

FEBRUARY 21, 1957

practice we simply borrow the goods and
services of that country at interest. Now
if more goods and services are needed in
Canada our brawn and brain should be
applied to the utmost to produce all we
possibly can of such needed goods and services within our country. What we, as a
people, produce from the land, sea and forest
provides us with our standard of living and
has to pay all our bills, both at home and
abroad as stated. Further, a greater production of goods and services is the only cure
for the so-called inflation, if such a thing
exists uncontrolled in any part of the
country. On a per capita basis, Canada has
far more land, sea and forest resources for
production of goods and services than has
any other country of the world.
In these circumstances does it not seem
a very strange doctrine indeed that the citizens of Canada are told by their top money
power that they are doing too much and are
advised to take a breathing spell-in other
words, rest on their oars or shovels and
slacken up on production for a bit? A slowdown is in order. It is like telling a farmer
who is in debt and needs all the production
from his farm that he can get to pay his bills
with, to lay down his tools for a while and
if he needs production in the meantime to
go and borrow some from a neighbour by
giving a mortgage on his possessions at
an extremely high interest rate. It is
self-evident that such a policy would be nonsensical. It is well to note that some communist countries are working long and hard
and their production rate is steadily
increasing.
Borrowing money by selling bonds in the
United States is entirely different in its
effect on the country from obtaining venture
capital which freely comes across the border
mostly of its own accord and brings "technical aid" and "know-how" along with it and
which to a very major extent comes without fixed charges.
The mines of our north country and the oil
industry of our western provinces are much
further advanced today owing to the large
financial investment that has come from the
United States for their development. For the
investments from the United States were
accompanied by technical skills and "knowhow" as to the way in which these properties could be developed promptly and
efficiently and by the best-known scientific
processes. With such aid given us it is
fair and just that the profits of the new
industries be shared with those who come
to our aid as a young nation.
But the situation is entirely different,
when, owing to an antiquated monetary

system, our provinces, municipalities, cities
and crown corporations, such as provincial
hydro, are forced to go to the United States
to borrow enormous sums of money to
carry on their ordinary affairs of government along with providing for essential
services. There is no "technical aid" or
"know-how" whatsoever given or needed in
connection with such borrowings. We can
operate our provincial Government services
just as well as the Governments of the different states of the Union can operate theirs.
The municipalities of Canada are just as
efficient in carrying on their affairs as are
those cross the border, and Ontario HydroElectric Power Commission leads America
in the operation of a public hydro-electric
enterprise.
During the great depression of the so-called "hungry thirties" a prominent American
public figure made a statement in Congress
deploring the fact that his generation could
not seem to pay for its own grub, for at that
time term interest-bearing bonds were being
issued to pay for the relief and soup kitchen
bills operated for the hungry and a large
portion of such indebtedness, when it
came due, would have to be paid for by
a future generation, including children then
unborn.
This was a statement of fact, and it caused
a good many people to realize that such
antiquated financing was really quite dishonest and entirely unfair to posterity. In
the light of these circumstances it might be
well to examine the situation which faces
this country at the present time.
During the last year or so, as stated, our
provincial and municipal governments have
been forced to go to the United States and
borrow hundreds of millions of dollars. Now,
just what do these governments borrow such
large sums for? Well, the cost of educating
our youth is one of the largest expenditures
that the local governments have to meet.
New and larger schools and hospitals are
continually needed throughout the country.
Expenditures on hospital upkeep for the sick
is another large expense and is steadily
increasing. Also, as the days of Indian trails
are long over, the upkeep and extension of
our public road system to take care of our
growing traffic takes very large sums of
money.
Now, does it not seem rather deplorable
that a great country like Canada, which
financed itself during a world war and lent
and gave billions of dollars to our allies, now
finds that, owing to an outdated monetary
system, its provinces and municipalities are
unable to provide enough money within the
country for the education of our children or

252

SENATE

the care of the sick? Does it not seem most
unreasonable to anyone who will give the
matter a litle study that we, a strong nation,
should have decreed on us a system of
finance whereby we are obliged to mortgage
our heritage and posterity's heritage to an
outside country for many years to come in
order to take care of the current legitimate
needs of our youth, to look after the unfortunate, and extend and maintain highways? Nevertheless, in my opinion, that is
the position our country has been placed
in today by the unwise action on the part
of our central bank in decreeing not only a
money squeeze but also in raising interest
rates much higher than they are across the
border. In the United States interest rates
are not only much lower than in Canada, but
enough money is kept in circulation so that
they are always able to lend billions to other
nations.
Our local governments are accountable to
their taxpayers, and if they can save money
themselves by borrowing at lower rates in
the United States they of course have a
perfect right to do so. But why should they
be placed in this position by a non-elective
body which has failed in its duty to provide
enough money at rates within reason, if at
all, for the important domestic needs I have
referred to? I feel that members of this
chamber could well give some careful thought
to the present monetary situation.
The following is an excerpt from the
preamble to the Bank of Canada Act:

price of $35. And when we compare a
thousand dollars in bills with a thousand
dollar Government bond, which is one of
the best securities in the world, we find bonds
selling at a discount of from 10 per cent to
15 per cent. Government securities are not
inflated, but the dollar certainly is, when
it takes only about $850 to buy a $1,000 bond.
It is easily seen that hundreds of millions
of dollars have been lost by those who save
and invest in Government bonds. Small
people especially invest in these bonds.
Take the dollar squeeze or tight money policy
forced on the chartered banks, making Canadian dollars scarce internally and high in
price. The Canadian banking system has
its back to the wall in trying to finance the
progress of the country and to fulfil the
legitimate financial needs of our citizens. In
fact, many needs are going unfulfilled. As
one bank says, money has been tighter during
the past year than at any time since the
Bank of Canada was established. However,
the policy of usurous interest rates and an
infiated bank rate that has been pressured
on our people in order to make the Canadian
dollar hard to get has been a bonanza to
those outside the domain of our central
bank. Hundreds of millions of dollars have
come into Canada on loan from New York.
Canadian borrowers of a high credit rating
have found funds readily available there.

$33.50 for an ounce of gold against the world A banking policy that contributes to the

FEBRUARY 21, 1957
conditions that I have referred to as prevailing in our national economy is in my opinion
quite contrary to the meaning of the preamble of the Bank of Canada Act.
It is possible to arouse criticism among
certain sections of people over an increase
in the cost of living, and the cry "inflation"
goes forth even in instances when it is
the logical and natural consequence of the
release of additional purchasing power put
into circulation for the benefit of the people
through higher remunerations and costlier
social services. When these benefits are not
followed by -a corresponding increase in production people must realize that in given
circumstances the higher cost of living is just
the other side of the same picture. The
tendency toward a welfare state is inflationary
in itself. The labour, profit and price spiral
is often inflationary. The bank rate has no
effect on either. Neither do high interest
rates increase our labour or material supply.
History over the centuries shows that we
have had creeping or controlled inflation
since the days of William the Conqueror,
when the price of gold was $8 or $9 an
ounce, and as far as I can see, we probably
always will have it, but this does not mean
uncontrolled inflation, of course.
There are several ways of attacking uncontrolled inflation, if such exists in any
part of the country. First, by fiscal policy,
that is, by using taxing power to curb personal and corporation spending. Second, by
placing direct controls on any fraction of
the nation's economy claimed unsound.
Third, by monetary policy, that is, by juggling
with the bank rate. Experience has shown
that at least in its present form the monetary
policy of raising interest rates is emerging
as by far the most dubious of all the
weapons known for defeating uncontrolled
inflation, for to be effective at all it must
cut down the volume of investment and
greatly slow up the rate of economic growth,
and as an aftermath it brings cries of distress
from weaker borrowers. Restrictive action
applied too long can be more serious than
no restriction; and, to quote a high authority
for whom I have great respect:

Hon. Mr. McLean: Well, this country was
able to finance a war at a cost of $5 billion
and it loaned or gave away another $5 billion.
The amounts now being borrowed are really
much less than that. We can increase the
circulation of money here. There is no reason
why we cannot keep pace with the United
States. It all depends on the interest rate.
Our municipalities find they are able to save
several hundreds of thousands of dollars by
borrowing in New York. But why should our
interest rates be higher than the rates in
New York?
When I was with the Unemployment Commission here in Ottawa, at the height of the
depression in the "hungry thirties", wheat
went down to 19 cents a bushel, the lowest
it had been since the time of Queen Elizabeth.
We then had a national income of about $3j
billion, including all the goods and services
produced from land, sea and forest, and the
national income of the United States at that
time was about $45 billion. If you multiply
each of those figures by nine you get a gross
national product of approximately $30 billion
for Canada and about $400 billion for the
United States. Now the United States figure
has gone up to $420 billion.
We are not on a gold standard; we are on
a paper standard.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: When it is boiled down
is not your proposition along the lines of the
Social Credit theories?
Hon. Mr. McLean: I do not think my friend
listened very closely to my remarks. It had
nothing to do with the Social Credit theories.
I have never studied those theories and I
know nothing about them.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
I do not propose to make any extensive
remarks. When the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) rose to ask
his question, I was about to put an identical
question to our honourable friend who is a
financial expert and has given us a fine discourse on the subject of inflation.
Speaking for myself, as an ordinary businessman who from time to time requires
money and has to go to the bank for it, I

went on to develop the thought that over a

SENATE
period of 18 years, at the rate of 3j per cent,
we would pay interest of about $650 million.
Now, honourable senators, I do not think
that is out of the way at all. For instance,
the financing of the Brooklyn Bridge was
carried over a number of years, and double
the cost of the bridge was paid in interest.
In ordinary business you cannot borrow
money unless you are prepared to pay for it.
In each and every case I venture ta say that
the borrowers who got money from the
United States first tried to get it in Canada;
they likely advertised in the Financial Post
and other newspapers for potential lenders;
but nowhere in Canada did they find as cheap
money as they could get in the United States.
I am sure my honourable friend from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean)
would agree that it is only common sense
that the borrowers went to the United States
for money because of the saving it meant to
them. I do not think we can find any fault
with them in that respect.
My honourable friend has expounded his
theory on previous occasions in this house.
As the honourable senior senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has suggested,
it is pretty close to the Social Credit theory,
which advocates a change in our monetary
system. Possibly many of the Social Credit
group have passed away, and it may be that
the honourable gentleman is a remaining
member of that group. I would not like to
see that theory seriously proposed again,
especially when we are fighting to control the
I do not think my
inflationary spiral.
honourable friend suggested anything here
today that will help us do that. Perhaps he
might state briefly how he would proceed to
overcome inflation.
Hon. Mr. McLean: According to what we
are told, the reason for this money squeeze
and high interest rates is inflation. Well, I
pointed out, and I think quite plainly, that
raising the bank rates did not affect more
than 10 per cent of the causes of inflation.
We have deliberately raised interest rates
here higher than they are in the United
States, and the reason given for so doing is
that there are too many dollars chasing too
few goods, but this has had no effect on inflation at all. My argument is against high
interest rates, which are affecting the small
business and the small businessman and driving our municipalities over ta the United
States to borrow what money they need. If
the rate of interest was the same in Canada
as it is in the United States there would be
no reason to borrow over there. Yet although the borrowers lose 4 per cent or 5
per cent on exchange, their actuaries tell
them they can amortize it and at the end of
fifteen or twenty years be several hundred

thousand dollars to the good. That is what
I am criticizing. What we are doing at the
present time is not restricting inflation, except to a very small extent.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: If we had followed your
theory we would not have borrowed the
billion dollars over the last four years and
so would not have been able to go ahead
with the projects which those loans made
possible and which, I contend, helped to bring
about the prosperity we enjoy today.
The Address was adopted.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Ordered that
the said Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General by such members
of this house as are members of the Honourable the Privy Council.
PRIVATE BILLS
GOVERNING COUNCILS OF SALVATION
ARMY-SECOND READING
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson moved the
second reading of Bill U-5, an Act respecting
the Governing Council of the Salvation Army,
Canada East, and the Governing Council of
the Salvation Army, Canada West.

She said: Madam Speaker, may I first
congratulate you on having been chosen to
act as Speaker pro tem, and also on the
charming, gracious and efficient manner in
which you have carried out the duties of the
Speaker.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
this bill was to have been introduced by the
honourable senator from Rockcliff e (Hon. Mrs.
Wilson), who is prevented from explaining
the bill today by an unfortunate accident

which I know we all regret very deeply.
Senator Wilson is on the Advisory Committee
of the Salvation Army in the city of Ottawa,
as she is on the board of so many organiza-

tions that contribute to welfare. She is much
interested in the work of the Salvation Army,
and in explaining this bill I am acting at
her request. I am indeed sorry that she is
not able to be present.
The explanatory notes to the bill give very
clearly the reasons for its introduction. A few
historical facts may not be inappropriate,
however.
The first Salvation Army meetings in Canada took place in 1882, and ever since then

the Salvation Army has carried on in Canada its work of religion, charity and benevolence. To carry on that work it necessarily
acquired property, and until 1909 any property held by the Salvation Army was controlled by the Territorial Commissioner.
Under Chapter 132 of the Statutes of Canada,
1909, the Salvation Army was incorporated,

FEBRUARY 21, 1957
and subsequent to that date its property was
controlled by the Governing Council of the
Salvation Army in Canada, known as the
Corporation. At about this time the Salvation Army, all over the world in the 53 countries and colonies where it was operating, was
taking steps to become incorporated in a
manner similar to that of the Established
Churches.
Due to the growth of the Salvation Army
after 1909, in 1916, by Chapters 63 and 64
of the Statutes of Canada, two corporations
were established to carry on the work.
Chapter 63 set up the Governing Council of
the Salvation Army, Canada East, which
was given authority to administer the property, business and other temporal affairs of
the Salvation Army in the provinces of
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The amending act provided that the annual value of
the real estate held by or in trust for the
corporation in Canada should not exceed
the sum of $350,000.
Chapter 64 of the Statutes of Canada, 1916,
set up the Governing Council of the Salvation
Army, Canada West, which was given authority to administer the property, business and
other temporal affairs of the Salvation Army
in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
Alberta and British Columbia, the Northwest
Territories and the Yukon Territory, and this
amending act set a limit of $200,000 on the
annual value of the real estate held by or in
trust for the corporation in Canada by the
Governing Council of the Salvation Army,
Canada West.
It is unnecessary for me to describe to
honourable senators the growth of the Salvation Army in Canada since that time. Government and citizens alike appreciate the
tremendous work done by the Salvation Army
during the wars amongst our men in Canada
and elsewhere, and also appreciate that the
Salvation Army is responsible for the largest
private social service endeavour in the country, including, as it does, maternity and other
hospitals, chiidren's homes, eventide homes
for aged men and women, and men's hostels
and other agencies of social work.
In vie& of the recognized position of the
Salvation Army in Canada now, it is difficult
to realize the tremendous opposition there
was in this country to the early work of
the Army and the objections that were often
made to Salvation Army processions and
open air meetings. Although he certainly was
not a member of the organization, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier supported very strongly its right to
hold these processions, and in the late 1880's
he said, "If need be, I am prepared to march
at their head to protect them."

The growth of the Salvation Army makes
the statutory limitation placed on the annual
value of its real estate unrealistic. In terms
of annual value the present holdings may
now exceed the statutory limitation; and certainly when the present program of extension
has been completed it will go beyond that
amount.
Recent private acts of the Parliament of
Canada incorporating religious organizations
placed no limit on the real property held by
such corporations; and the purpose of this
bill is to remove for the future, and retroactively, in case they have already exceeded it,
the monetary limitations on the annual values
of the real estate held by the Governing
Council of the Salvation Army, Canada East,
and on the annual value of the real estate
held by the Governing Council of the Salvation Army, Canada West.
If this bill receives second reading, honourable senators, I shall propose that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills. The Salvation Army
will have representatives present at the committee hearing to answer any questions which
it is desired to put to them.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Fergusson, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills.
CANADIAN CO-OPERATIVE CREDIT SOCIETY
LIMITED-SECOND READING
Hon. William M. Wall moved the second
reading of Bill V-5, an Act respecting Canadian Co-operative Credit Society Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, I shall be
as brief as I possibly can, but I should like
to present a little general background information before explaining the purpose of the
bill.
In 1953 Parliament passed an Act respecting
Co-operative Credit Associations, Chapter 28
of the federal statutes, 1952-53. This general
enabling legislation, which contains 85 sections, provided a legislative framework which
in effect permitted the incorporation of a
national credit association by subsequent
special act.
The Co-operative Credit Association Act
outlines the powers of such an association;
sets up for depositors and investors suitable
safeguards concerning loans, investments,
annual statements, audits and so on; and provides for inspection and supervision by the
Superintendent of Insurance, who is required
to report to the Minister of Finance annually
on the condition of the affairs of a national

SENATE

credit association when incorporated under
the provisions of this general act.
As I understand it, this act is enabling
legislation comparable to the Trust Companies
Act or the Loan Companies Act, and applies
to any organization incorporated by private
act as a credit society-which is what this is.
Sequentially the Canadian Co-operative
Credit Society Limited was incorporated by
private act in 1953, Chapter 58 of the Statutes
of 1952-53.
One special feature of this act of incorporation needs to be mentioned, namely, that it
included a schedule which named the provincial credit societies of seven provinces to
be eligible to become members of the
national credit society if they fulfilled certain
conditions set out, as the explanatory note
states, in section 80 of the Co-operative
Credit Associations Act which conditions
entitle them to a Treasury Board certificate;
and, secondly, if this eligibility was exercised
within a total period of three years. There
is reference in the explanatory notes to section 82 of this act concerning this point.
We now come to the purpose of Bill V-5.
In the initial three-year period the credit
societies of three provinces qualified for
registration and full participation in the
Canadian Co-operative Credit Society Limited, the petitioner, namely: British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario. The credit
societies of four other provinces did not
qualify, namely Alberta, Nova Scotia, Prince
Edward Island, and Manitoba. However,
several large
co-operative
organizations
operating on an interprovincial basis have
become members of this national Canadian
Co-operative Credit Society Limited: for
example, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the
Co-operative
Life
Insurance
Company,
Canadian Co-operative Implements Limited,
Interprovincial Co-operatives Limited, and
others.
The national organization, the Canadian
Co-operative Credit Society Limited, has not
yet commenced active operations. It has,
however, elected its officers and directors,
has accumulated substantial assets, and it
is confidently expected that it will commence active operations this year, particularly when it is joined by Manitoba, whose
eligibility, now in question, was automatically repealed by the operation of paragraph
(c) of section 82 of the act, as set out in the
explanatory notes.
Please note that the Co-operative Credit
Society of Manitoba Limited was registered
within the three-year period prescribed in
paragraph (a) of section 82-and it is still
registered as a shareholder on the books of
the Canadian Co-operative Credit Society

Limited-but it did not, within the statutory
three-year period, obtain from the Treasury
Board the necessary certificate authoritizing
it to carry on business under section 80.
You will note that the sole purpose of this
bill is to make the Co-operative Credit
Society of Manitoba Limited declared again
eligible to become a member of the Canadian Co-operative Credit Society Limited,
as provided in clause 1 of the bill.
Clause 2 states how this renewed eligibility
is to be repealed in accordance with the
provisions of the general Co-operative Credit
Associations Act.
If honourable senators see fit to give second
reading to this bill I will move that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where representatives of
both credit societies and the Superintendent
of Insurance will be available to answer
questions of a more comprehensive or technical nature.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Wall, the bill was

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators will already have noted with pleasure
an announcement which appeared recently in
the London Gazette that by virtue of letters
patent Her Majesty the Queen has conferred
upon His Royal Highness the Duke of
Edinburgh the style and dignity of a Prince
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland. This announcement further
indicates that it is Her Majesty's wish that
in future His Royal Highness should be
known as His Royal Highness the Prince
Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
I am sure all honourable members will
agree that the creation of His Royal Highness
as a Prince of the realm is a well-deserved
recognition of his devoted service to the
Commonwealth and the Crown. He has been
an exemplary figure as the representative of
Her Majesty in many parts of the world.
These duties are undertaken at great personal sacrifice when he must be absent from
his family and his home. I am sure that this
honour will find favour with all Canadians
and indeed in every part of the world where
allegiance is held to our beloved Sovereign.

WHEAT BOARD BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the third
reading of Bill 9, an Act to amend the
Canadian Wheat Board Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I want to
make just a few comments in moving the
third reading of this bill. I should like to
refer briefly to the discussion which took
place before our Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce last week, when
we had the benefit of the presence of Mr.
Sharp, the new Deputy Minister of the
Department of Trade and Commerce. I think
he was very helpful in enlarging our under-

standing of this bill. The point which received his consideration particularly was one
which had been raised in this house, and
also before the committee, by the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) with regard to the Wheat Board's ban
on the shipment of feed grain from one part
of British Columbia to another through a part
of the United States as the shortest route
between the two points. It was an exceptional
case in the experience of the board, and Mr.
Sharp undertook to do his best to supply
precise information about it. I called him
today, in view of the expected third reading
of the bill this evening, and he assured me
that his department was looking into this
problem and would eventually be able to
furnish the desired information. That is the
latest statement I could obtain on the matter.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time and passed.
CANADA COUNCIL BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 21, the adjourned debate on the motion

FEBRUARY 26, 1957
of Hon. Mr. Macdonald for the second reading of Bill 47, an Act for the establishment
of a Canada Council for the encouragement
of the arts, humanities and social sciences.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: -it was not my
intention to give more than passive approval
to the Canada Council Bill, as I expected it
would receive unanimous acclaim in this
house, but as some criticism of the bill has
been voiced I feel that I should like to
express my own wholehearted approval and
support of it and give some of the reasons
therefor.
For over a decade I have been a member
of the governing Board of Regents of Mount
Allison University in Sackville, situated on
the Chignecto Isthmus that connects New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and through this
association I am keenly aware of the real
economic crisis in the life of our Canadian
universities, and particularly of our small
universities which are not supported by Government funds. Owing probably to my association with this small university, where
the arts are considered of the greatest importance, where for years music and painting
have been and are now being taught to
Maritimers and many, many others, and
where the humanities and social sciences are
rated very highly on the curriculum, I am
deeply interested in the activities of the
Canada Council.
In 1948 the alumni of Mount Allison, under
the leadership of the Board of Regents,
started an annual fund which at the end of
1955, the latest year for which figures are
available, had raised $343,846. This fund has
helped to clear off the debt which existed in
1948, which was its first objective, but it is
not adequate to provide for the new buildings
which our growing registration demands.
Honourable senators, to show you that the
Mount Allison alumni are trying to help the
university, I should like to draw to your
attention an article which appeared in the
Financial Post of February 9 last about the
annual contributions made by Canadian
alumni to their colleges. It pointed out that
the annual donation per member of the
Mount Allison Alumni is $24.63, which is
considerably above the Canadian average of
$14.68 and is exceeded only by the annual
donation of Queen's Alumni. It is certainly
hoped and expected in the province of New
Brunswick that additional funds can be
raised by Mount Allison and our other small
universities, so that they can receive the
full amount of assistance by way of matching
82719-17j

grants to which they are entitled under the
University Capital Grants Fund.
Although I certainly do not agree with
the statement made last year by Mr. Alan
Jarvis, the newly appointed Director of the
National Gallery, after a tour of the Maritimes, that there was a general poverty of
social and cultural life in the Maritime provinces, I do acknowledge that to train many
of our talented young people and to make
possible among all our people a wider enjoyment of the arts, humanities and social
sciences, we in the Maritimes need the kind
of help which the Canada Council is being
created to provide.
It is hoped that the Canada Council will
give assistance and encouragement to the
Summer School of Arts held at Mount Allison.
Although on a much smaller scale than the
Banff School of Fine Arts, with which the
honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron) is connected and about which he
has recently written a book, entitled Campus
in the Clouds-on which I heartily congratulate him-Mount Allison's summer school is
bringing to the people of the Maritimes an
opportunity to study, enjoy and perhaps ta
produce works of art.
Honourable senators, I do not believe that
only under conditions of poverty can artists;
produce works of art. There are many in-stances of successful painters, musicians andwriters who grew up in homes of comfort
and even of luxury. I refer to such persons
as Albert Spalding, the outstanding Americaui
violinist, who came of a wealthy family; Lord
Byron; Ralph Waldo Emerson; Lord Robert
Cecil, who wrote the wonderful biography on
the life of Lord Melbourne; Dame Edith and
Sir Osbert Sitwell; and a very familiar example, Sir Winston Churchill. It is true that
while living in poverty some people have
produced masterpieces, but I think it can be
argued with justification that they did so in
spite of their poverty rather than because
of it.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: It is impossible to
tell how much more those same persons might
have left for posterity had it not been necessary for them to devote so much of their time
to the struggle for existence. We do not
know how many talented but poverty
stricken persons have had their talents
crushed and have produced nothing because
they were unable to develop while so
handicapped.
It is for that reason that financial support
for students is so important. From the time
of Pindar, the great lyric poet of ancient
Greece, down to the present day, musicians

SENATE
and artists have been subsidized by church
and state and private patrons. We can think
of Michelangelo, of Leonardo da Vinci,
Mozart, Haydn, and many others who
received such help, and they have added
much to the world's treasures. A great man
of the present day who was helped early in
his career by a scholarship is Albert
Schweitzer.
Therefore I support strongly the giving of
scholarships by the Canada Council. From
what I know of scholarship committees I
doubt very much if any such scholarships will
be given where they will permit the recipients
to live in the ease, comfort or luxury which
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) considers might blight
their endeavours.
My experience as a member of the War
Memorial Committee of the Imperial Order
of the Daughters of the Empire, which
grants a large number of overseas and other
scholarships annually, brought me in contact
with many eager and often brilliant young
people seeking further education. It was
gratifying to know that we could give them
some help, but frustrating to realize that
there were many other suitable and deserving
applicants who, through lack of scholarships,
were denied the chance to develop to their
maximum capacity.
A number of the men in Canadian public
life have been assisted in the beginning of
their careers by these I.O.D.E. Overseas
scholarships. Honourable senators may be
interested to know that among these are the
present Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, the Honourable Mr. Pickersgill; Dr.
A. W. Trueman, Commissioner of the National
Film Board; the late well known commentator
Matthew Halton; Dr. Watson Kirkconnell,
President of Acadia University, and many
others who have contributed much to Canada.
And of course winners of other scholarships,
such as the Rhodes Scholarships, are also
making important contributions to our public
life. One person who, I am sure, gives most
of us a great deal of pleasure is Lois Marshall
who was first started on ber way through
receiving such assistance.
The Canada Council Bill also provides for
the granting of scholarships to persons in
other countries for study and research in
Canada. Other nations have been generous
in providing scholarships for Canadians to
study abroad. Since 1945 France bas been
awarding scholarships every year for study
in France. These scholarships now number
40 each year and are available to the graduates of all Canadian universities. Sweden
and Brazil have been making similar awards;
and other countries, including Switzerland,
Norway, and West Germany, have indicated

their wish to grant such scholarships if
Canada will grant reciprocal ones. Honourable senators, there is no better way of promoting international friendship with these
countries than by having our students live
and study in them and by having their
students live and study in Canada, and it is
time that Canada was prepared to do her
share to promote good public relations in
this way.
Honourable senators, I am speaking longer
than I would wish,Hon. Senators: Go ahead.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: -but
before concluding I would like to express my pleasure
that the Canada Council will be able to
perform the functions of a national UNESCO
Commission. Many organizations of which I
am a member have for years regretted that
Canada has no national UNESCO Commission and have wished that such a commission
could be set up. I certainly welcome this
provision.
A suggestion has been made in this house
that it would be better if the responsibility
for education were given back to the local
municipalities, and if they had enjoined on
them at the same time the burden of raising
the necessary money. But surely, honourable
senators, our hope is to give every child in
Canada equal opportunities for education.
When we think of the drastic variations in
the financial resources of Canadian municipalities we realize that to give this responsibility back to the municipalities would
penalize children in the poorer provinces and
nullify the efforts that have been made
through family allowances and in other ways
to equalize opportunities for all Canadian
children.
Honourable senators, I view the forthcoming operations of the council with a sympathetic spirit of understanding for the complex
and difficult problems that it will necessarily
face, rather than with the attitude of doubt
and suspicion which the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity expressed on Thursday
last.
It seems to me that if many Canadians
plan to watch with latent criticism the activities of the Canada Council, obviously expecting it to make errors for which it will be
called to account before Parliament on the
first opportunity, the council will find itself
hampered in its work and unable to operate
with the freedom which I believe Parliament
intends to give it. The members of this
council will be human beings, subject to
error like all of us, but certainly everyone
chosen for a position on that body will have
shown unquestionable good will toward and
an interest in the arts, the humanities or

FEBRUARY 26, 1957
social sciences and will do his or her best
to see that the money at the disposal of the
Canada Council is spent wisely, fairly, without favouritism and in accordance with the
objectives of the bill.
It seems to me scarcely right to refer to
the council as an irresponsible body, as
was done earlier in this debate, for it is
obvious that section 23 of the act provides
adequate control by Parliament.
Honourable senators, I believe that the
results of the work of the Canada Council
will doubtless encourage the flowering of
Canadian genius. But even if the Council
should not be responsible for the production
of great Canadian artists, musicians or
painters, what is really more important is
that it will undoubtedly raise the level of
thought of the Canadian people. It will create
among our people a deeper and more widespread understanding and appreciation of
the arts, humanities and social sciences. It
will make it possible for more people to have
access to more culture, which will enrich their
lives and make Canada a better and a happier
country in which to live.
I heartily support the bill.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, for a lawyer to participate in a debate
on a measure to stimulate and encourage the
arts, the humanities and the social sciences
is a rather formidable task, particularly in
view of the number of experts in this field
who are in this chamber. And while I must
confess that before I heard the last speech
I had not numbered among these experts the
honourable senator who delivered it, I hastily
revise my opinion, and include her.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Broadly speaking, a
bill to provide for the encouragement and
stimulaton of the humanities is a new deIt is a modern
parture in this country.
development and device which has been adopted in recent years in the United Kingdom,
in France, in Italy, and also, I understand,
in Western Germany. The arts and the bumanities, of -course, have always needed financial support, and, as the honourable senator
from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) reminded us, support bas come and continues
to come from private agencies and wealthy
individuals. In the older days it was mainly
derived from royalty and the nobility. But
times have changed, and with them the scope
of tax legislation. Today there are severe
limitations on the accumulation of wealth.
I am not speaking critically, I am stating
a fact. Succession duty legislation restricts
the passing on of wealth from one generation

to another, and income tax legislation not
only takes a considerable portion of personal
incomes but a very large part of corporate
incomes. In Canada tax levy on the larger
corporations is approximately 49 per cent.
In addition, corporate giving is restricted,
as far as alleviation by way of allowance
is concerned, to 5 per cent of the total taxable
income.
While this bill is devised to assist and
will assist the arts and the humanities, I
think it is appropriate to point out that it
will not by any means fully meet requirements for the development of the humanities
in this country. As much as, if not more
than, the present sum-total of private giving
will be needed by the universities and lother
cultural agencies. A sense of social responsibility, and, too, the virtue of charity,
must continue to be cultivated. In other
words, agencies devoted to the humanities
must continue to be supported by voluntary
giving.
While this measure marks in some degree
a new departure for Canada, this is not by
any means the first time that assistance has
been given from the federal treasury to scholarship. Research has played a very important
part in our thinking, more particularly in
the last 25 or 30 years, and considerable
assistance has been made available from the
national treasury to applied science, both for
purposes of industry and of defence. During
the war, and since, we have learned how
important research is to both these pursuits.
We are told, for example, of a great shortage
of engineers in this country, and comparisons,
sometimes unfavourable, are made in this
respect between ourselves and the Russians.
We are continually hearing reports of shortages of technical personnel. However, in
looking at the estimates which are now
before us, I note that large amounts are
allocated for research and scentific purposes.
For example, this year's estimates provide
$2,300,000 for the National Research Couricil,
some $64 million for the Defence Research
Board, and nearly half a million dollars, in
addition to the vote for the work of Atomie
Energy of Canada, Ltd., for research in the
field of atomic energy.
Besides this measure of support from the
federal treasury, a good deal of money is
spent by industry in the field of applied
science, and of course a great deal of work
on similar lines is done by our universities.
Apart from financial assistance in the field
of applied sciences, much money is spent by
the federal treasury for general education
purposes. Grants this year to universities
will amount to approximately $16 million;
the vocational training program under the

SENATE

direction of the Department of Labour will
involve an expenditure of $10 million;
veterans' vocational training, about one and
a quarter million dollars; in addition to
which an extensive program of educational
assistance to veterans was provided for in
the general veterans' benefits which became
available after the late war. If, in the light
of this background, we consider the measure
before us, we may say that Canada has not
been unmindful of its human resources.
In 1951 the body known as the Massey
Commission issued a report, and supported it
with a most interesting volume of supplementary studies. I think it is of great benefit
to the Canadian Parliament and people to
have available to them this most valuable
and interesting document. It points up the
importance to a nation of the things of the
spirit. It was written in the background of
the obvious fact that Canada has been bountifully endowed by Providence, that Canada
is, relatively speaking, a wealthy country.
Pioneers pushed back the frontiers, and
pioneers are still pushing back geographical
frontiers in this country, particularly in the
north. But there are new horizons in industry and in commerce that are constantly
being opened up and enlarged by enterprising people in this nation. So we have this
of economic well-being all
background
around us. I do not say our economy is
perfect or that there may not be soft spots
in it. But we are experiencing economic
well-being, and in that respect we are the
envy of many other nations. It seems appropriate that in this background of economic well-being we have come to realizeand I think the Massey Report points this
up-that a nation, like an individual, does
not live by bread alone.
It has occurred to me there are many
parallels in history appropriate to guide us
in the way we should proceed, and perhaps
none is more appropriate than Victorian
England. Those were days of the power and
the glory, of the commercial and industrial
supremacy of that realm, and of the consolidation of empire.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And of the poverty of
the workers.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: That is very true. Yet
I think in that country, as in many others,
great strides have been made for the betterment of the worker and of the people generally. I think this measure emphasizes the
fact that strides can be made in the field of
the humanities too for the betterment of
all. But the strides taken in Victorian
England in the humanities were great, particularly in the field of letters. If I may be

so bold as to say so, I think that achievement
was a more enduring one than the industrial
and commercial supremacy built by the
people of that day.
In the field of letters they had poets like
Tennyson and Browning, historians like
Acton and Macaulay, scholars like Newman
and Darwin, and such women as Elizabeth
Barrett Browning, the Brontés and Eliot. In
fiction I wonder if we have as lovable characters in our writing of today as Sam Weller,
Mr. Micawber, Mr. Pickwick and even Long
John Silver. In the field of historical novels,
a little before the Victorians, there was the
work of Scott who changed his medium from
poetry to that of prose. Scott, a remarkable
person, has been a great figure in the literary
world. Amazing to relate, his earnings from
writing enabled him to pay off tremendous
personal debts and those of his publishers as
well.
Victorian writers had an audience which
was much more restricted than the audience
that is available to modern writers. Nowadays the audience is bigger because schooling
is wider. But today's audience is much more
distracted than its predecessor. The Victorian
audience did not have the motor car, the TV,
the radio, the movies, and the organized entertainment and sport of today. So the man
who was engaged in letters could cater to an
audience and expect it to react to him much
more actively than is the case at present. The
development in the field of the humanities in
those times was a most remarkable one, and
curiously enough it was provided with very
little sponsorship and certainly almost no
public sponsorship. Those literary people
were mainly self-sustaining. What I have
said about Victorian times could be said of
other times and of other countries. Perhaps
we need not go so far afield either.
In our own country university people have
dedicated their lives to the humanities, as
the honourable senator from Fredericton has
just pointed out. I think we might do well
to look at the achievements made by our
friends in the small colleges in the province
of Quebec, where the arts and the humanities
were, almost to the exclusion of the applied
sciences, the important features of their
system of higher education.
Honourable senators, I do not suggest that
we must emulate the Victorians in all things.
But I do say that what is proposed by this
measure is an investment in the things of the
spirit in a country and in a parliament that
have perhaps been more engaged with
material things than with those of the mind.
We should remember that what we provide
here are not ends in themselves, but are the
means with which to build a better type of
citizen and a better fabric of Canadian
citizenship.

FEBRUARY 26, 1957
I agree with the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that
proper management of the affairs of the
Canada Council will be important. I am glad
to see that a check is provided in that this
council must report to Parliament. I would
hope that political considerations would not
influence the activities of the council. I do
not say there may never be a danger of that,
and I would even suggest that in this chamber, where political feeling does not run deep,
we might have a special interest in seeing to
it that political considerations do not govern
in the direction of the affairs of the council.
Honourable senators, I have spoken a little
of Victorian times and perhaps at the risk
of being slightly out of order I could refer
to those times again, for this bill does deal
not only with the arts and the humanities,
but with the social sciences as well. One
social science which reached its apogee in
that period was the science of parliamentarianism, if I may call it that. The Victorian
age was the golden age of parliament and
it was so because it was created and sustained by the character and interests of the
people who were dominant on the parliamentary scene. Many, if not most, of those
men were the products of the two great
English universities of that time. I think of
men like Balfour, who was a prime minister
and yet a recognized figure anywhere in the
world in the field of philosophy; or of Gladstone, not only a great prime minister and
a great chancellor, but an authority in the
field of classical studies, and certainly a redoubtable opponent in the difficult field, for
a layman, of theological controversy; or
Disraeli, who took his first steps toward
prominence in public life as the result of
his work as a writer; and, finally, of Rosebery, Gladstone's successor-a man who,
perhaps more than any of the others, could
create the great occasion, whether parliamentary or historical or literary. He left
writings on men like Burns, Dr. Johnson,
Thackeray, Burke and Peel which are classics
in themselves. But there were others, not
prime ministers-men like Morley, Gladstone's biographer, who became a great
parliamentarian, and an expert in the theory
of parliamentary government; and Bryce, the
historian of the Holy Roman Empire, who
also wrote the classic work on the United
States Constitution and, as honourable
senators well know, the Bryce Report on
Second Chambers, the outstanding document
on the functions of second chambers in
parliamentary organization; and Justin McCarthy, a member of the Parnell party, and
also a member of Gladstone's party, who
wrote political sketches and reminiscences.
The men of whom I have spoken were, so

to speak, professional writers. But many
members of the British Parliament of that
time wrote biographies, memoirs, reminiscences and sketches of their contemporaries
in parliament and elsewhere in the public
life of that country. Their writings provided
the raw material of their national history.
They were the creators of an atmosphere for
the ideal operation of parliamentary institutions. They stimulated and encouraged young
men to enter public life. Honourable senators
are -probably familiar with Belloc's quatrain
about the politician, which runs this way:
Here, richly with ridiculous display
The politician's corpse was laid away.
While all of his acquaintance sneered and slanged
I wept, for I had. longed to see him hanged!

Now, that could not be said of the great
parliamentarians I have mentioned. It may
perhaps be true of some politicians since, but
not of them, I think.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Not of senators!
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Not of senators, I hope.
Perhaps some honourable senators have
read a recent contribution made to a learned
journal by the honourable gentleman from
Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power). In that most engaging
piece of work he described the change in the
character of the member of parliament.
Whether or not he would include senators in
his description, I do not know. But I do hope
that the change will not be so drastic that
the parliamentarian, either of today or of the
future, will ignore the principles of the Victorian parliamentary tradition, and particularly the literary side of that tradition.
Honourable senators, if I have a plea to
make, it would be that more of our parliamentarians contribute to that tradition, not
in the writing of encyclopaedic histories of
their time or of the country, but in memoirs,
reminiscences and sketches of people whom
they knew, and of parliamentary institutions
and parliamentary events. I think that would
provide a better atmosphere for the working of
the parliamentary process, and as well be an
inspiration for young men who might be induced to embrace public life. We have had
some of it in this country. Perhaps the outstanding figure in that respect was D'Arcy
McGee, who was not only a writer of great
prose, but a speaker of great prose. He was
also a writer of poetry. Mr. Meighen is also
an example of one who has published.
Honourable senators, without naming persons in this chamber, I may say that many
others have made fine contributions to our
history, but I submit that not enough have
done so. Senators, both past and present, have
written works on law, economics, and history.
Quite recently an excellent text was pubhished

SENATE

by one of our members on the grassroots
history of the southern part of one of our
western provinces. Others have contributed
substantially in the field of journalism. I
would plead for many more contributions of
this kind-and not only by gentlemen on the
front benches, although many of them are
eminently capable of making such contributions.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The back benchers are
doing all right this evening!
Hon. Mr. Connolly: The premature death
of an experienced public man is always a
national calamity. That was so true of the
friend of so many of us, the Honourable
Angus Macdonald. I have on the wall of rny
office a framed copy of three paragraphs
from the peroration of the last address he
delivered in the House of Commons in 1945,
as he left the Navy. The prose of those paragraphs is so excellent that it might well be
termed poetry. But I did not need this passage
to know how great was his literary talent.
Had he lived, his writings, I think, would
have been worthy of the great literary and
parliamentary tradition of which I have
spoken. If I may come back to my earlier
point, I hope we shall not have occasion to
say of many members of this chamber, after
they have gone, "What a pity they did not
write."
Hon. Senajors: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I think it is a matter of considerable temerity
for any honourable senator to attempt to
address this chamber this evening after the
two excellent addresses that we have just
heard. I would not have risen to take part
in this debate had it not been for the challenge which seemed to me to come from the
remarks of the two honourable senators who
spoke last Thursday, the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), both of whom opposed
this bill. I noticed that the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity took a great deal
of pride in the fact that he was not going
to jump on the band wagon and get the
kudos and prestige which he might thus
obtain by voting in favour of a public measure
of this kind. Well, I am going to jump
on the band wagon, however ill he may
consider that to be on my behalf,Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I wish you a good
time.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: -and I say to this
house that I strongly support the measure.
Speaking in a general way, honourable
senators, this measure seems to me to be

a step in the right direction.
We have
reached a stage in this country where for
many years past we have been very successfully engaged in the physical and material
development of the country; and the time has
now come when we should begin to pay
more attention to matters of the mind and
the spirit. That seems to me to be a basic
reason for my desire to support this bill.
Honourable senators who have preceded me
in the debate have said most of the things
that need to be said about the bill. I wish
to confine myself to one or two considerations
relating principally to the universities of the
country. The honourable senator from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Molson) and I happen to be governors of McGill University, and in speaking
for that university I have the very good
precedent of my honourable friend the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) who spoke
for the University of Manitoba, and the
honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson) who spoke for Mount Allison
University.
I believe one of the most valuable contributions to come out of the Canada Council will
be the granting of scholarships to bright
students who might not otherwise have the
chance to pursue a university career, and
those who will engage in research in the
fields of the arts and the humanities.
Generally speaking, there are in this
country very many fewer scholarships granted
than in other countries. The difference between Canada and Great Britain in that
respect is astounding. I do not know what
the proportion is, but certainly a very much
larger proportion of the students who attend
universities in Great Britain enjoy scholarships of one type or another than is the
case in Canada. In comparison with the
scholarships available to the intelligent in
England, we in Canada have so far fallen
lamentably behind. I believe that the income
from the fund to be set up under this bill,
if it does nothing else, will justify itself if
it provides additional scholarships for those
who intend to engage in the arts and humanities. Honourable senators well know that
it is much easier to obtain scholarships for
science and industry than it is for such purposes as this bill would cover; the field of
scientific research is wide open in the sense
that students engaged in this type of research
can obtain help from a large number of industries, and in many cases by way of grants
from provincial governments. So, in that
respect alone, the Canada Council will, I
think, justify itself if it increases the number
of scholarships available for the purposes
set out in the bill.

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act to amend the
Export and Import Permits Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very short bill and, on the face of it, a very
simple one, but there are some features of it
that require explanation. I may say that
I find myself a little embarrassed in dealing
with it at this late hour and after the most
interesting and eloquent speeches we have
had on another subject.
The bill is entitled "An Act to amend the
Export and Import Permits Act", and the
amendment proposed is that the operation of
this act be continued for another three years.
Without this amendment the act would expire sometime in the spring or early summer
of the present year.
This bill must be considered from two
standpoints. First, we must have some understanding of the underlying act itself which
we propose to extend, because otherwise
there would not be much sense in extending
it. In the second place, we must have some
appreciation of why a temporary statute
which had been originally passed as a wartime measure should be extended at the
present time.
As honourable senators know, the purpose
of the Export and Import Permits Act is to
control the export and import of certain
articles. This legislation was first dealt with
in war time under the War Measures Act and
later under the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act. Then in 1947 the Export
and Import Permits Act, similar to the act
now on the statute books was introduced
and passed. The present statute was enacted
in 1954, in substantially the same terms as
the 1947 act, but with some changes and
improvements. I want to explain very briefly
the provisions of the act of 1954 which it is
now proposed to continue for another three
years.
That act is divided into three parts. First,
it controls the exports of certain commodities,
and their export to certain countries, and
secondly, it controls the importation of certain enumerated commodities.
The third
part deals with the details and working out
of these provisions, including penalties. I
will indicate what is embraced in these three

FEBRUARY 26, 1957
divisions. First, the control of exports. You
will find these dealt with in three sections of
the 1954 act. First:
3. The Governor in Council may establish a list
of goods, to be called an Export Control List,
including therein any article the export of which
he deemsoit necessary to control for any of the
following purposes, namely,
(a) to ensure that arms, ammunition, implements
or munitions of war, naval, army or air stores-

and so on, may be controlled.
(b) to implement an intergovernmental arrangement or commitment; or
(c) to ensure that there Is an adequate supply
and distribution of such articles in Canada for
defence or other needs.

With these should be read sections 7, 13
and 15 of the act. Section 7 provides:
7. The Minister may issue
Canada applying therefore

Section 13 states:
13. No person shall export or attempt to export
any goods included in an Export Control List or
any goods to any country included in an Area
Control List except under the authority of and in
accordance with an export permit issued under this
act.

I wish now to call attention to section

4. The Governor in Council may establish a list
of countries, to be called an Area Control List,
including therein any country the export of any
goods to which he deems it necessary to control.

There is an order in council which deals
with articles the export of which is prohibited except under permit. It appears in the
Canada Gazette dated January 2, 1957, with
a group of articles which are called strategic,
and which are essentially concerned with war
measures and for the safety and protection of
the country. The articles which are deemed
necessary and may be utilized as instruments
of war if the occasion should arise are quite
numerous. Some of them may not seem of
much consequence, but I am instructed by
the department that their importance for the
purpose that I have mentioned is the basis
on which they have been selected and
enumerated. For instance, there are pneumatic tire cases which are not used for
ordinary commercial purposes at all, but are
essential in war production; there are boring
and drilling machines for the same purpose;
also lathes, other metal-working machinery,
vacuum pumps of a particular type, and so
on and so forth. In connection with the
same legislation there is published a list of
metals which in their natural state cannot be
used for strategic or military purposes, but
which are essential to the construction of
82719-18

machinery or other elements of war production. It includes magnesium, molybdenum,
nickel, titanium, tungsten, and various other
articles of that nature.
As regards the countries which are known
as "area controlled countries", there is quite
a list in another issue of the Canada Gazette,
dated January 26, 1955; it embraces only
Russia and its satellites.
As regards imports, which are dealt with
in section 5 of the act, I think I can limit
my reference to them by saying that the
only provision which is effective today is that
which empowers the prohibition of an article
the price of which is controlled by Canadjan
legislation; and I understand that the one
article so prohibited is butter.
Honourable senators will observe from
the provisions of this section that the Governor in Council may establish a list of goods
the importation of which it is deemed necessary to restrict. This purpose is achieved
by prohibition unless a permit has been obtained. In other words, the permit is the
basis upon which any exportation or any
importation
under
this
act shall be
permitted.
The only other item which I wish to mention has to do with penalties. The penalties
are very severe. Some of the fines are as
high as $25,000; and imprisonment, following
indictment and conviction, may be for as
long as five years. The maximum penalty
need not be imposed, but the threat is there,
and has been since the act became law. I
do not think I need concern myself any
longer with that matter. If the legislation
is good, these penalties are proper; if it is
not good it should be rejected.
With these observations I come to the
amendment contained in this bill, which provides simply that the act which was passed
in 1954 shall be continued in force for another
three years. That involves consideration of
two questions. First, should there be any
such legislation at all? Second, if there is
to be such legislation, should the powers
thereby vested in the Governor in Council
be continued for a further period?
In essence, the subject-matter is emergency
legislation, first adopted in wartime, when
the "hot war" was on. Three years ago this
house and the other place found it necessary
to continue the operation of the act because
it was felt that an emergency still existed;
and it is my submission to you that the
emergency of the "cold war" as it exists today is almost if not quite as serious as were
the wartime conditions which originated this
legislation. I do not suppose there is an
honourable senator here who, reading day by
day during the past weeks of what is going

SENATE
on abroad, is not gravely concerned about
the safety of the world, and the danger of
another and more grievous war than humanity has ever known.
So, honourable senators, I think we may
start with this proposition, that if the legislation we are considering was justified in
1947, if it was justified in 1954-and this
house, having considered the bill in committee, was satisfied that it was-it is no less,
and is probably more, timely now, in view
of the grave situations which threaten us at
present.
No other method of handling this kind of
legislation is possible. Last year some 10,700
penhits were required to be issued. In 1948
approximately 113,000 permits were issued
and by 1953 the number had been reduced to
26,600. As a result of better organization and
greater co-operation between merchants,
manufacturers and departments, the number
of permits required to be issued was reduced
to 10,700 in 1956. This does not mean that
control has been lessened; only that the requirenent for issuing permits has been
lessened.
It would be impossible for Parliament to
deal with even the minimum number of permits that have been issued in any one year,
namely, 10,700. The only thing is for Parliament to delegate this power for issuing permits, and the most responsible body to which
this power could be delegated is the Governor

in Council, who at all times is responsible
to Parliament. I submit that if three years
ago this house acted correctly in giving this
legislation almost unanimous approval, and
if the other house was right in endorsing it,

was in 1925. I was invited to address the there we had other priests who were sent

FEBRUARY 27, 1957
abroad and to various American universities
for post-graduate courses. There was Monsieur Lebon, afterwards a Superior of the
College, who studied philosophy at Louvain
University under the great Cardinal Mercier,
the Archbishop of Malines, as no doubt you
know; and there was Monseigneur Mercier, a
personal friend of mine, who went abroad to
study the languages and the humanities at
the Institut Catholique de Paris under Monsieur Beaudrillart, who was a Member of
the French Academy, and other distinguished
professors.
There were many men there who had
made the sacrifice of their lives to promote
education among youths. You may not be
astonished if, at times, a former student of
the province of Quebec in those colleges where
secondary education is given quotes incidentally some Greek or Latin texts. It is not
a pose on his part, it is just a remembrance,
a reminiscence of happier days. So that is
what happened in the province of Quebec
with regard to the teaching of humanities.
I know that it is not only in colleges under
the direction of priests that humanities are
taught. Instruction in them is given in many
other institutions in the province of Quebec
and in Canada at large. I may mention
McGill, and also Bishop's University at Lennoxville, whose head I call "my favourite
Chancellor". The study of the humanities
is not in its beginnings; it has existed for
nearly three centuries in the province of
Quebec, since the foundation of Quebec Seminary in the 17th ýcentury by Monseigneur
de Laval, and since the establishment of
the school directed by the Jesuit Fathers
and the Recollet Fathers in the city of Quebec,
and later on, in Montreal: and I must pay
homage to the Messieurs de St. Sulpice for
the magnificent work they have done in the
city of Montreal and its vicinity. They taught
not only the humanities, but philosophy and
theology. I am proud to say that His Eminence Cardinal McGuigan, who was born in
Prince Edward Island, completed his studies
in the Quebec Seminary, and under the tuition
of Monseigneur Paquet and other professors
to whom I referred a few moments ago.
That is the position in the province of
Quebec. I do not say that we do better
than is done anywhere else, but I do say
that our province has every reason to be as
proud as any other of its accomplishments
in matters of education.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I am grateful to the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) for the references he made
in his speech to the universities and to the
work of voluntary organizations on national,

provincial and local levels. On the national
level, students who do well in any of the
institutions of learning in Canada serve not
merely themselves, not merely their own
province, but our country, Canada, as a
whole. If that is the meaning the honourable
gentleman intended to convey when he spoke
about the national level, I agree with him.
There is one comment he made, however, that
should have special attention drawn to it. It
is this:
I think it speaks well of Canada and of our
people that while we have wrested our wealth and
national heritage from the land to which our forefathers came, we still have found occasion, through
our universities and through voluntary organizations operating across the country, not only to keep
alive but to cherish and develop our spiritual
growth as it is expressed in the arts, humanities
and social sciences.

Incidentally, I would put the term "social
sciences" in parentheses because I do not
believe in them. But that is a personal opinion. The honourable Leader of the Government went on to say:
This belief bas been expressed by the foundation
and development of our universities and by the
work of voluntary organizations at the national,
provincial and local levels.

This is very nice and I agree with it, but
with the reservation I have made. Later
the leader went on to comment:
I think we may take some pride in the fact that
less than a century after Confederation we come
to consider a measure of this kind.

I am sorry, but I cannot agree with the
honourable leader there, and I say so in
this chamber where freedom of speech is so
great.
I cannot quote the entire speeches of all
honourable senators who took part in this
debate, but I have underlined those parts
I consider to be vital and the most important
to draw to the attention of the house.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke as follows:
It seems to me that the additional money needed
by the provincial universities should be raised by
the provinces themselves, not by the dominion
Government. That is, the tax base upon which the
dominion Government levies this money should be
shifted to the provinces, so that it will be their
function to determine how, as between public
schools, high schools, and universities, the revenues
should be divided.
This seems to me to be
fundamental. It was always understood that under
the British North America Act education would be
under the control of the provinces. I am not taking
sides in this issue; I know how much dynamite it
holds; but it is my belief that Parliament, however
right it may be on many other issues, bas been
mistaken in its handling of this question.

I agree with that statement, but I am sorry
to have to disagree with the conclusion
reached by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition.
Next I want to refer to some remarks
made by the honourable senator from Banff

SENATE
(Hon. Mr. Cameron), who is Director of the
Department of Extension, University of
Alberta, and Director of the Banff School of
Fine Arts. He said, in part:
Another point is that there should not be too
much artificial stimulation of the arts. One of the
most difficult tasks the members of the council
will have is in dealing with the veritable blitz of
proposals of every kind and description that will
The task of selecting those
be submitted to it.
which are practical, fitting and fruitful will not
be an easy one.

I agree with that statement, but I am
sorry that I cannot agree with the following
statement he made:
I say in conclusion that I feel this is a redsetter day for the arts and humanities of Canada.

Then my honourable and congenial friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) spoke
in part as follows:
I believe that art, together with everything pertaining to it, is something that springs up in a
person or nation in spite of any obstacle. It cannot be bought with money.
We have come to
regard money as the most important thing in
life, and so long as we remain in that state of
mind we will not advance in the arts or the
humanities.

How true!
And then my honourable colleague from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) expressed his views. I cannot refer to everything he said, but I would quote these
remarks:
At the moment I do not feel like doing that;
indeed, I am rather inclined to be doubtful as to
the future of the Canada Council.

A little further on he stated:
I am sure I would be happier if this money were
to be expended directly under the control of
Parliament rather than by irresponsible appointees
who are not even civil servants.

I agree with him in that comment. However,
I have a certain doubt as to another part
of his speech, where he said:
I see no advantage at all in shifting the burden
of taxes which go to the support of education first
from the local municipalities to the province, and
then from the province to the dominion. I think
the Fathers of Confederation were quite wise in
giving that responsibility to the local municipalities and imposing upon them the burden of raising
the money.
That

statement

calls

for some

comment,

for according to our Constitution, the British
North America Act, the field of education
comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the

provinces.

In the first place, taxes levied for

education belong to the school boards, and if
the school boards cannot get enough money
from the taxpayers to meet their costs they
can then appeal to the provincial Government, which is supreme in matters of education.

With regard to their shifting from the

provinces to the dominion, I agree entirely
with the honourable gentleman.

It is very nice to be in a place where it
is possible to agree and to differ, and this
country will be a really civilized country as
long as it is possible to differ from someone
without insulting him.
My honourable and learned friend the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Wall) said something that I am very sorry
to be unable to agree with. He said:
We hope that doubts and uncertainties expressed
by some honourable senators will be resolved by
the statesmanlike policies worked out by the
Canada Council.

I do not believe that it can be done by the
Canada Council, and again I am very sorry

to have to differ with the honourable gentleman.

Now I come to our honourable and gracious
(Hon. Mrs.
colleague from Fredericton
Fergusson). She deserves the more recognition because she has been a member of the
governing Board of Regents of Mount Allison
University, in Sackville, for many years. I

listened to ber speech with deep interest, and
I agree entirely with this statement by her:
My experience as a member of the War Memorial
Committee of the Imperial Order of the Daughters
of the Empire, which grants a large number of
overseas and other scholarships annually, brought
me in contact with many eager and often brilliant
young people seeking further education. It was
gratifying to know that we could give them some
help, but frustrating to realize that there were
many other suitable and deserving applicants who,
through lack of scholarships, were denied the
chance to develop to their maximum capacity.

I must quote here a sentence from a speech
made in the House of Commons by the Prime
Minister, to be found on pages 977 and 978
of the House of Commons Hansard, in which

he candidly admitted that it was impossible
to provide scholarships for every one of the
applicants. That is pure common sense.
Honourable senators, I am not familiar yet
with all the rules and practices of the Senate.
but in the House of Commons we were not
allowed to quote verbatim from the Senate,
and I presume the same applies here,
although the rules will have to be modified
in due course. However, I wish to quote
further from the speech of our honourable

and gracious friend from Fredericton.
said:

A number of the men in Canadian public life

other organizations which have provided

A little further on the honourable lady
said:
Many organizations of which I am a member have

UNESCO Commission and have wished that such
a commission could be set up. I certainly welcome
this provision.

FEBRUARY 27. 1957
Opinions are free, and I am sorry to have
to disagree with the honourable lady.
I come now to our honourable and eloquent
friend the senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly). He made a splendid speech,
and I listened to him with interest and
admiration, but I regret to be unable to
agree with all that he said. He mentioned
Victorian England as an example. I think
that he should have mentioned Canada during the Victorian era. He referred to Balfour,
and he forgot to say that Balfour was an
artist, who, when fed up with politics, played
the piano-pianissimo and fortissimo. He also
spoke of Peel, and others. And he mentioned
three famous Canadians: first, D'Arcy McGee,
and I agree with him to a certain extent,
because I have a few drops of Irish blood
in my veins; then Mr. Arthur Meighen, with
whom I disagreed all the time that he was in
politics, from the time that I was elected, but
I cannot prevent anyone from saying that he
was a first-class debater in the Senate as
well as in the House of Commons; and finally my friend mentioned his former chief,
the late Angus L. Macdonald, who was a very
popular premier of the great province of
Nova Scotia. It is not necessary to mention
the dead. I believe that the living should be
praised for their accomplishments. It is not
flattery, it is just giving one what belongs to
him.
In that connection, two of the most eloquent
speeches that were ever heard in this capital
city of Ottawa were made on the 15th of this
month by the Prime Minister of Canada and
one of his colleagues. I refer to the very
excellent speech that was delivered by the
Prime Minister of Canada in the Railway
Committee room of the House of Commons
when he addressed the students who were
here in Ottawa from all parts of Canada. On
the same date the students gathered to listen
to a speech by the Honourable Hugues
Lapointe, Minister of Veterans Affairs and
Postmaster General, son of the Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe, who in his lifetime was
the right hand of the late Prime Minister of
Canada. Mr. Lapointe gave one of the best
definitions of liberalism and freedom of
speech. Here is what he said:
(Translation):
The Liberal party's ideal has always been to do
everything it possibly could to improve the lot of
Canadians in the various walks of life, and this
without infringing upon the freedom of eîther
individuals or groups.
For our party bas always been and remains the
strongest defender of fundamental freedoms, the
party which has done the most ta give Canadians
the greatest possible measure of freedom.
This sound policy of a truly democratic government, in accordance with Liberal ideals, bends all
the strength of the state to the service of the
citizen.
The Liberal party, which Is the party of freedom,
bas made of Canada the land of freedom.
It is

responsible for Canada's constant development
towards increasing autonomy, to the point where
it is now with complete independence that we act
in the community of nations.
And because of our party's loyalty to the
principles of individual, economic and political
freedom, millions of Canadians have shown their
unreserved faith in it and supported the policies
of the St. Laurent Government.

(Text):
Well, honourable senators, there was a definition of "liberty" as understood by the
Liberal party, and it is in conformity with
the teachings of the great Laurier, Mackenzie
King, my honourable friend from Gulf (Hon.
Mr. Power), the honourable Leader of the
Government in this house
(Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), and all the great leaders of the
Liberal party.
Another speech that deserves special recognition is one which was delivered to the
Canadian Club of Montreal on February 4
last by no less a person than Monseigneur
Lussier, the Rector of the University of
Montreal. In that speech he stated:
Security is nothing without freedom.

I must continue to refer to the very interesting speeches that were delivered by my
distinguished colleagues.
The honourable
senator for Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
said:
In comparison with the scholarships available to
the intelligent in England, we in Canada have so
far fallen Iamentably behind.

I am sorry to have to disagree with my
honourable friend. The idea of scholarships
is not new. To mention a scholarship which
has done a lot of good for students, I would
recall to my honourable friend the memory
of a great humanist, a personal friend of his
and a colleague in this chamber for many
years. Indeed, I wonder if they were not
appointed to this chamber at the same time.
I refer to the late Senator Athanase David, a
former Provincial Secretary of the province
of Quebec, who founded le Prix David, an
institution to encourage youths who had an
inclination for music, painting, the arts in
general, and writing, to do their very best to
improve their natural inclination. Le Prix
David was given to authors and those with
an artistic disposition, and it has done a lot
of good. I am surprised that nobody has
mentioned the fact that the late Senator
David of the province of Quebec was, like
Cecil Rhodes, a pioneer in promoting education, humanism ain the letters and in the arts.
He was second best to Cecil Rhodes, who did
what he did for political motives. There were
no strings attached to the scholarships
awarded by the provincial Government then,
as there are none now. But there are many
young people, boys and girls, who have taken
advantage of those scholarships to complete

SENATE

their studies in Europe, in the United States
and all over the world. The late senator
deserves special mention.
But there is more to it. If we look at the
Canada Year Book we will see that the
province of Quebec is not alone in the
awarding of scholarships. It is done throughout the land by private individuals, who
could be compared with Maecenas, and by
provincial governments which are interested
in gifted boys and girls. May I quote this
list from the Canada Year Book, 1955, at
pages 347 and 348. It is more complete in
the Canadian Almanac of this year:
There are also schools of art not requiring any
fixed academic standing for admission,

Mark that, honourable senators.
as they are concerned more with the technical
development of the artist. The most widely known
of these are:
Nova Scotia College of Art, Halifax, N.S.
Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Quebec, Quebec.
Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Montreal, Quebec.
School of Art and Design, Montreal.
Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal, Quebec.
Ontario College of Art, Toronto, Ontario.
University of Manitoba School of Art, Winnipeg,
Manitoba.
Provincial Institute of Technology and Art,
afFiliated with the University
of Alberta,
Calgary, Alberta. (Summer session at Banff,
Alberta.)
Vancouver School of Art, Vancouver, British
Columbia.

I could mention also Mount Allison University.

But that is not all. There are many art
galleries throughout this land, and we find a

list of them in the Canada Year Book and
the Canadian Almanac. The principal art
galleries and museums are:
New Brunswick

of the accomplishments of those institutions.
But those institutions have existed for a long
time. They do honour to Canada, and we
must be proud of them and encourage them
to the utmost.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Now, there are other

art organizations. I quote from page 350 of
the Canada Year Book, 1955:
The leading art organizations of national scope,
exclusive of museums and art galleries, include the
following:
Association of Canadian Industrial Designers.
Canadian Arts Council.
Canadian Group of Painters.
Canadian Guild of Potters.
Canadian Handicrafts Guild.
Canadian Museums Association.
Canadian Society of Graphic Arts.
Canadian Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers.
Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour.
Canadian Society of Landscape Architects and
Townplanners.
Community Planning Association of Canada.
Federation of Canadian Artists.
Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.
Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.
Sculptors Society of Canada.

And there are more:
La Société des Ecrivains Canadiens.
The Canadian Ballet Festival Association.
The National Ballet Guild of Canada.

and so on.

Are you not satisfied, honourable senators,
with the accomplishments of Canada in the
domain of arts and the humanities? You have
the record, a record of which we can boast.

It cannot be ignored.
What has been done by the proud provinces
through private initiative and through taxation to help education and to give postgraduate courses is more than the sum that is
mentioned in this bill.
Now I wish to quote an interesting exchange between the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen):
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: . . . What I criticized was
the proposed means by which public money would
be handed out by private individuals. So far, no
one has justified the proposed action in that
respect.

I agree with him on that: it is clear. And
then:
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I may have misread my
honourable friend's remarks.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I spoke about the advantage
of leaving education in the hands of the provinces.
I still maintain that belief, and it is pretty well
acknowledged in our whole community.

That is quite an imposing list. It is a list
that would do honour to any civilized coun- In Toronto, in Greater Toronto, and the provtry of the world. Naturally we must look at ince of Ontario. Then, a little further on:
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that not an argument for
encyclopedias like Canada and Its Provinces,
equalization of grants as between the provinces
which was published by Dr. Doughty and rather than for appointment of a council to do the
other prominent scholars, to know the details job of equalizing?

FEBRUARY 27, 1957
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am afraid I do not quite
understand what my honourable friend means. If
he means that the federal authorities should give
equalization grants to the provinces to equalize
their revenues, there may be an argument for that;
but what we are particularly interested in, in this
case, is the support of university education, and a
mere generalized grant to the provinces without
any indication of where it is to go would not
achieve that purpose.

party, having won the election, was again
in power. I thought that we had to do a
spring cleaning of the statute book; and
when I introduced a bill to get rid of Mr.
Bennett's Economic Council of Canada Act
I spoke as follows, as reported in the House
of Commons Hansard of February 24, 1936,
pages 436-7:

I agree with the last part of that sentence.

Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to explain the
purpose of this bill. It is to put the axe of parliamentary control to a dry branch of the dead tree
of so-called social legislation.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck:
I did not use the term
"generalized grant".
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In any event, I must say
that I think this University Capital Grants Fund
will be of great utility. It will help our universities
to meet an urgent capital need, and for my own
part I am very strongly in favour of the bill and
particularly of that section of it.

As regards the statement of the honourable
senator from Inkerman, "If he means that
the federal authorities should give equalization grants to the provinces to equalize their
revenues, there may be an argument for
that", I will go further. I say that the
grants made to the provinces should be earmarked for scholarships, on the same
principle, let us say, as the taxes on two
estates are earmarked for the fund which
is to be administered by the Canada Council.
I say that, as the council is provided with
money which was so earmarked, I would
earmark it for the use of the provinces with
the stipulation that it shall be used for
scholarships. That is a point of view and
a consideration which I submit to the attention of honourable senators. To do this
would be in conformity with section 93 of
the Constitution, the first lines of which
read as follows:

The motion was then agreed to and the
bill was read the first time.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What has this got to
do with the bill?

In and for each province the Legislature may
exclusively make Laws in relation to education ...

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I will satisfy my honourable friend's curiosity. That was a prolegomenon to a magnificent speech delivered
at that time by the then Prime Minister of
Canada, and which unfortunately has not
been referred to by those who have spoken
before me in this debate. That is the reason
why I have referred to it.
As I have said, I am not too familiar with
practices in the Senate. I have great respect
for the views of others and I do not want to
interfere. But it was rather typical that after
a barrage at the caucus meeting in the morning, the discussion during the second reading,
the committee stage, third reading and the
passing of the bill took less than two pages of
Hansard. The only one to oppose the bill
was the late Mr. Woodsworth. But here is
the speech that was delivered on that occasion by Mr. Mackenzie King, the then Prime
Minister:

With regard to the capital grants, is it
not astonishing that we speak of music and
the arts in this city of Ottawa where, although
so many buildings have been erected by the
federal Government, there is no concert
hall? This strikes me as something very
queer. If artists of note come to Ottawa they
can give concerts only in a local moving picture theatre, if it is made available. In what
other capital city of the world is there no
hall for concerts or no hall where great
artists can perform occasionally, even though
the city cannot sustain a regular opera company comparable to the Metropolitan and
other like institutions?
All these considerations have impressed
me very deeply. There are many question
marks in my mind.
It is with peculiar satisfaction that I
address honourable senators today, because of
what happened 21 years ago, on February
27, 1936, in the House of Commons. It was
during the first session after the defeat of
The Liberal
the previous Government.

The measure comes under the Prime Minister.
The act provides for the appointment of an economic council to advise the Prime Minister. I am
auite satisfied with my own council; I do not think
I need an economic council to tell the present
Government what is necessary in the way of legislation. The Government at all times is in a position
to command the services of any members of the
public service. It seems to me wholly superfluous
ta have on the statute book a law which obligates
the Government to bring together a number of the
members of the public service and constitute them
into an advisory council, when members of the
public service have enough to do in their own
departments if they are doing their work properly.
It is prodigal to add to public expenditures to the
extent necessitated by this act. I think the Government made its attitude toward the legislation clear
when we did not place in the estimates an appropriation for the legislation, and I do not think it
is necessary for us to say anything more about it.
It is superfluous legislation, and our attitude towards it when the late Government introduced the
measure was that it was superfluous. However,
being a part of the new deal which was being tried
out it was allowed to pass. The public has since
expressed its view with respect to much of the
late Government's legislation and made clear its
attitude towards some of these measures. The
present Government does not feel it in the public
interest to continue the legislation.

COMMITTEE EMPOWERED TO MAKE INQUIRY

PACIFIC GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

That the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic
be empowered to inquire into and report upon
the activities of the various agencies concerned
with promoting tourist travel in Canada, and that
the committee be authorized to send for persons
and records.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I refer to an inquiry that was made by
the honourable member for New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) on February 20 respecting a
press dispatch to the effect that the president
of the Canadian National Railways was interested in buying the British Columbia
Government-owned Pacifie Great Eastern
Railway. At that time he wished to know
whether there was any truth in this report.
I made inquiries of the Department of
Transport and have been advised that the
department has no knowledge other than the
speculation contained in several news reports.
I have a copy of one of these news reports
which appeared in the Vancouver Province.
Apparently Mr. Gordon made the following
statement on the subject to that paper:
My talk with Premier Bennett was a private
conversation which ranged over a variety of subjects. My understanding was that there would be
no comment to the press except to make it clear
that no sale of the P.G.E. was in contemplation or
discussion between us. Accordingly that is all I
have to say.

a sitting next week?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I had hoped to be
able to arrange for a meeting of the committee next week. However, I now find that
this would not be convenient for a number
of members of the committee, so I intend to
suggest that the meeting should be held the
following week.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I thank you. Although
I am not a member of the committee I would

TOURIST TRAFFIC
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor moved:

He said: Honourable senators, this motion
was placed before the committee on February
6 by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck); and perhaps I
may be permitted to pause and, on behalf of
the committee and on your behalf, extend to
him on this, his birthday, our very best
wishes.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I hope he may long be
spared to devote his unselfish energies to
our work and to offer us the independent
thoughts which he so often places before us,
though we do not always agree with them.
In speaking to this motion, may I be permitted to recall briefiy what occurred 23
years ago, in 1934, when the Special Committee on Tourist Traffic met at the request
of the then Government leader in the Senate,
the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen, who
later made a motion in this chamber for the
setting up of a standing committee to deal
with the very important subject of tourist
trade. If I remember rightly, it was composed of nine members, the names of three
of whom are quite familiar to most of us.
I allude to the late Honourable W. H. Dennis,
the first chairman of the standing committee,
and to his successor as chairman, the late
Honourable W. A. Buchanan, both of whom
recently left our ranks and passed to the
Great Beyond; and the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), who
happily is still with us.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: For 23 years the honourable senator from Blaine Lake has taken a
very active interest in the subject of tourist
trade and the work of this particular committee. His interest continues right to the
present time. In fact, as a member of the
steering committee, he continues to display
as much interest as ever in this important
subject.
I realize that there are other important
matters to come before the chamber today,
and, to judge from what the honourable
Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) has said, he is anxious to proceed to the final reading of the Canada
Council Bill.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would not want
my honourable friend to shorten his remarks
because of anything I have said. I am sure
we are all extremely interested in the subject
upon which he is addressing the house.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I was going to say that I
would endeavour to make my remarks as
brief as possible so as to give other honourable senators more time to speak on other
matters.
We are very happy to have on the Tourist
Committee representatives from every province in Canada, from Newfoundland in the
east to British Columbia in the west. Canada
is a wonderful country, and I know honourable senators will listen with keen interest to
the comments that will be made by the representatives of the various provinces.
Honourable senators, in 1934 I represented
the Nova Scotia Legislature before the House
of Commons Special Committee on Tourist
Traffic, which at that time was presided over
by the Honourable Mr. Manion, Minister of
Railways. I made several recommendations
to the committee, some of which have since
been implemented, and I believe the country
is enjoying the benefit of them. One of my
major recommendations was that Americans
visiling Canada should be allowed to take
home duty free $200 worth of merchandise
per person, and that our Government should
try to arrange a reciprocal arrangement with
respect to Canadians travelling in the United
States. That recommendation has been implemented and I am sure that it bas been
of real benefit to everyone concerned.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The Senate's Standing
Committee on Tourist Traffic, under the
chairmanship of the late Senator Dennis,
selected Leo Dolan as the first Director of
the Canadian Government Travel Bureau.
I am sure everyone will agree that Mr. Dolan
was very successful in building up our tourist
industry. He did a splendid amount of good
in selling Canada to the rest of the world.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: A couple of years ago Mr.
Dolan made a trip to Japan, which be reported on to the Tourist Traffic Committee
last year. He is known throughout the whole
of North America as "Mr. Canada". I believe
there is only one other name that will go
down in history with Mr. Dolan's in this
respect, and that is the name of John W.
Fisher. Incidentally, I have been very sorry to
learn that his enjoyable Canadian Broadcasting Corporation network program is to be
discontinued. It is regrettable that such a
program should be discontinued by this Government agency. I think the C.B.C. should

extend its radio and television programs to
promote this important part of our national
work, the tourist industry.
A short time ago I was interested to read
a magazine article entitled "Foolish Travellers" by Bruce Hutchison. He wanted to
know why Canadians insisted on taking
their holidays in the United States and other
countries instead of seeing Canada first. He
referred to the many scenic beauties of each
province, and those of Alberta in particular.
Had I been the writer I would of course
have referred to the beautiful ocean playground of Nova Scotia. However, he wrote
fairly about each section of the country. He
wondered why it is that so many people
from central Canada who have travelled in
the United States or abroad have never spent
any time in eastern or western Canada. It
was his opinion that if more Canadians
travelled about in their own country our
tourist trade would show a surplus rather
than a growing deficit as at present.
There must be reasons for this deficit, and
we all have our own ideas on the subject,
but I hesitate to offer mine. Have we given
this wonderful country of ours, which
extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Ocean, the publicity which it

have a good product we advertise it. I
admit that within their means our provinces
have done a great deal to publicize their
holiday resorts and other places which appeal
to visitors. Many fine pamphlets have been
published, and as chairman of the Senate's
Tourist Traffic Committee I have received
them from every province in Canada. These
pamphlets have also been sent into the
United States and abroad. There is no doubt
that our provincial tourist bureaus are
endeavouring to do a good job through the
medium of advertising, but perhaps they have
not been able to put their finger on the
important thing. It may be that we are not
hospitable enough, or that we do not feed
foreign tourists enough of our native foods,
or perhaps we should not fly American flags.
I am not prepared to say what the trouble
is, but I hope that the Senate's Tourist
Traffic Committee and the various tourist
agencies throughout the country will increase
their activities through the medium of publicity and thereby do justice to a really
important Canadian industry.
After 23 years of faithful service Mr. Leo
Dolan was recently appointed Canadian
Consul General at Los Angeles. We wish
him every success in his new post. His
place as Director of the Canadian Government Travel Bureau is being taken over by
Mr. Alan Field, who bas been transferred
from the bureau's New York office to Ottawa.

FEBRUARY 28, 1957
Mr. Field is an outstanding personality, well
qualified to follow in the footsteps of his
predecessor, and I am sure that he will do
an equally good job.
I am going to take the liberty today of
placing a few suggestions on record in the
hope that Mr. Field will pick them up and
use them if he considers them to be worth
while. I was impressed by a tourist advertisement that I saw in a magazine just yesterday. There were illustrations of some of our
lakes, mountains, beaches, and so on, and
comments like these: "Canada has more than
one million lakes. It has 20,000 square miles
of national parks. It has 59,000 miles of
scenic coastline. It has superb holiday sites.
What a country for the tourist, and what
scenery!" Honourable senators, I think that
advertisement tells my story in a very few
words. We have a wonderful country, with
everything needed to please the tourist, and
if we properly publicize these attractions
they should draw visitors in large numbers,
many of whom will come back again and
again. I refer to such attractions as our
mountains, our fishing and our beaches. We
should tell the prospective tourist of the delight of motoring through towns that time
has coloured kindly in soft mellow shades,
and of golfing in national parks with courses
so beautiful that he won't care what happens
to his score. I feel sure that if that thought
could be sold to our friends in the United
States and elsewhere our tourist traffic would
be greatly increased.
Tourists set a new record in 1955 by spending $329 million in Canada, and it is an
astounding fact that $304 million of that
amount came from United States visitors. However, Canadians spent $441 million on travel
in other countries, of which $361 million was
spent in the United States. I think that is
where our deficit arises. We can overcome
that deficit only by a united effort; every
one of us should make known to friends in
the United States and elsewhere throughout
the world the wonderful attractions we have
to offer them if they will only come and stay
with us for a while.
The purpose of our committee is to sell the
attractions of Canada, first to the United
States, our big customer, and then to other
parts of the world, so that they will become
better acquainted with our natural resources
and possibilities. We must get to know one
another. That applies especially to our own
people. We must urge our fellow Canadians
to travel in different parts of the dominion.
Those living in the extreme west might perhaps be induced to visit central Canada first,
and then they could be urged to travel right
across the country to the Atlantic coast. We

want people in Ontario to visit Quebec, and
we want the people of Ontario and Quebec
to visit the Maritimes. Of course, in the
Maritimes we do get a large number of
tourists from Ontario and Quebec and so
we have an opportunity to become acquainted
with them. It is a good thing for the people
in our provinces to get to know one another
better, and that is one of the great advantages
of travelling within our own country.
The tourist trade in Canada, I believe, is
capable of greater expansion, and the present
deficit existing between Canada and the
United States could be changed into a favourable surplus. I feel that Mr. Field has before
him a real challenge to overcome that deficit.
I come to my next point. Honourable
senators, I believe that the Trans-Canada
Highway should be used to the fullest possible
extent by Canadians in travelling between
points in our country. This is important. I
think it is safe to say that practically 90
per cent of the people who motor from
Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba to western or
eastern Canada travel part of the way over
United States highways. It may be said that
the American roads are better than ours. On
the other hand, one is compensated here by
the beautiful scenery-for example, in
Quebec, in driving along the St. Lawrence,
or the Gaspé coast, and in the Maritimes.
What a wonderful opportunity the tourist has
in these parts of the country to see nature
at its grandest! I urge that instead of driving
into the United States Canadians should use
the Trans-Canada Highway either east or
west from any central point.
May I return to the point I mentioned a
few moments ago, co-operation of other
government agencies? I refer especially to
the C.B.C., and I suggest that that body
should .co-operate to a greater extent than
at present with the Government Travel
Bureau by means of radio and television.
Also I feel that there should be closer cooperation between the Government Travel
Bureau and the National Film Board in the
distribution of national films. Those two
agencies are already set up to be used. Of
course, they are used to a certain extent for
tourist publicity purposes, but not, I think,
to their fullest capacity. If we make greater
use of these and other existing agencies we
are bound to increase our tourist industry.
I now -have a suggestion to make to the
customs officials. I would like to see special
attention given by them to people entering
or leaving Canada at border points between
this country and the United States. At St.
Stephen, at least, and at eastern points, generally, the officials are exceptionally courteous,
but one often hears -complaints by visitors

SENATE
Committee, I approve the motion of the
honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) and I do so with great
pleasure because I know what great attractions Quebec has to offer the tourists who
visit our province.
The charming villages of the north, in their
Laurentian mountains setting, offer an enchanting scenery which changes with every
season. And the old city of Quebec, so full
of memories, with its streets lined with artcraft displays for the benefit of those who
go by in old fashioned "calèches", has a
character all its own, which never fails to
amaze strangers.
Winter carnivals delight spectators everywhere. So do the enchanting sites of all the
villages dotting the shores of the great St.
Lawrence River as far as Gaspé, where the
scenery well deserves to be publicized. But
Quebec's most notable characteristics are its
mentality, its faithfully preserved customs,
and the truly French hospitality with which
it welcomes visitors.
Montreal, the second French-speaking metropolis of the world, beautifully built on
the flanks of Mount Royal, also commands
the admiration of its visitors.
I could develop at length the reasons why
the province of Quebec should be the centre
of Canada's tourist trade.
(Text):
But I am certain that most English-speaking senators are familiar with the beautiful
province of Quebec. If I cannot express in
English all that I would like to say about
that province, I invite you to come and see
for yourself how beautiful it is. I hope that
many organizations will be formed to encourage tourists to come to the province of
Quebec, which is so full of "souvenirs".
Honourable senators, I am in favour of this
motion.
May I take this opportunity to extend to
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) sincere wishes for a
bonne et heureuse fête.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I feel I should say a few words in support
of the remarks made by the Chairman of the
Tourist Traffic Committee (Hon. Mr. Isnor).
He is a hard working chairman, and the
committee should bring about some good
results.
For my part I am somewhat disappointed
in the extent to which American tourists
visit Canada. I am bold enough to say exactly
what seems to me to be the trouble: How
can we expect our neighbours from the south
to visit us when their dollar is worth only
(Translation):
95 cents in Canada? That seems to be one
Hon. Mariana B. Jodoin: Honourable sen- of the main reasons why Americans do not

of being held up for what appears to be
unnecessary examination and questioning. I
think they should be greeted with a smile and
sent home with a smile; they would then
carry away a good impression of their visit
to Canada. I pass that suggestion on for
what it is worth.
I come now to a subject in which the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) and others are deeply interested, that
is, our national parks. I think an increased
effort might be made by those in charge of
national parks, such as Jasper and Banff, to
urge tourists in the west to visit other parts
of Canada, especially the east.
A further suggestion I wish to offer is
that we should increase our highway direction
signs. Often when travelling we wonder
how to get to the next point of interest. It
might be said that these signs are a provincial
responsibility, and of course they are, but I
felt that by mentioning the point today it
might be picked up and result in the erection
of more direction signs for the assistance of
motorists, especially those using the TransCanada Highway.
May I now touch upon a matter that is
not entirely within our scope? I realize that
we have no control over the charges made by
motels and resorts, but I suggest that uniformity in rates would be advantageous in
attracting tourists. I am sure the Canadian
Tourist Association and other such organizations could very well confer with one another
in an effort to make sure that visitors are
not charged more in one section than in
another. Generally speaking, I do not think
they are overcharged, but sometimes one hears
complaints of excessive charges by this or
that motel, and it would be well if a visitor
from the United States could know that for
Class A accommodation, or Class AA, as the
case might be, he would find uniform rates
all across the country. I think that is worthy
of serious consideration.
Honourable senators, I have spoken longer
than I should in introducing a motion of this
kind. I conclude by leaving this thought with
you, that if we can sell the idea to all
Canadians, including all travel agencies, automobile manufacturers, and others interested
in transportation, that they should see
Canada-not necessarily see Canada first, but
at least see Canada-and if we can impress
upon the minds of people taking vacations the
fact that to tour Canada is a real pleasure,
we shall be doing a worth while job for
Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

FEBRUARY 28, 1957
side of the picture, Florida is today so
crowded that tourists have to sleep in cars,
jails and any place they can find. The reason
for the influx of Canadians there is that our
dollar is at a premium of 5 per cent in terms
of American currency.
My interest in our attracting American
tourists is not only from a business point
of view. I think there is great advantage
on both sides for us to get to know one another better.
I notice that it is the intention of the
Government to spend an additional $l
million on tourist advertising. To me, that
is not necessary at all. A better plan would
be to have every Canadian hotel keeper,
motel owner and restaurateur say to his
American patrons that he will accept their
dollar at par. There is not one of these
persons who could not afford to make that
concession and still realize a profit on his
tourist business. To my way of thinking,
that would do more to encourage visitors
to this country than would any amount of
advertising. I have visited the United States
when the exchange feature worked the other
way, and I know how I felt when my dollar
was discounted. I headed back for the Canadian border as fast as I could.
There is still another reason why Americans do not visit Canada in greater numbers.
I may have told the house on a previous
occasion of my experience in hotels on my
return trip from Florida, but perhaps it would
bear repeating. For the most part I found the
hotel rates in the southern United States
about half of what they are in Canada. For
instance, in Jacksonville, Florida, I got for
$3 a large hotel room with a bath, which
would have cost $6 in Canada.
Another source of dissatisfaction among
tourists is the quality of the meals they get
in Canada. Irrespective of our abundance of
beef, fish and wheat, many of our restaurants
and hotels not only serve an insufficient quantity of food, but charge excessive prices.
There is no necessity to treat visitors in that
way. Tourists travelling through the United
States find that every effort is made to welcome them, to see that they have the best of
food and plenty of it.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that
unless we correct some of these faults we
cannot hope to gain any real benefits from
additional spending on advertising in magazines and periodicals. It is the responsibility
of every Canadian to see that he is a good
host to our visitors. In other words, we
should each go out of our way to welcome
them.
The honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) spoke of the
advantage of good road markings and signs
to tourists in all parts of Canada. We all

know what a help and satisfaction it is, when
driving on an unfamiliar route, to see from
time to time signs giving the distance to the
next town, the population and other information. I have noticed that throughout northern
Ontario there are highway signs which give
the population of the town you are approaching and the distance to the next town.
It is always a surprise to me to hear that
some people do not know that we now have
a Trans-Canada highway, and that we can
travel by car from coast to coast through
Canada. The road through northern Ontario
to western Canada has been in very good
condition for the past nine or ten years; it
is now almost entirely paved, and offers to
the motorists good scenery, up-to-date camping accommodation, good fishing and many
other attractions. In the summer it is a
beautiful picture, with tall evergreen trees
lining the road.
Looking at the map one might believe that
by going south of Lake Superior the distance
from the east to Winnipeg or Regina would
be shortened, but that is not the case at all.
I have motored over both routes, and the
route through Canada is the shorter.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: By about a hundred
miles.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, that is right.
It is a pleasant run from Longlac through
Geraldton and Beardmore, and on to Nipigon,
a distance of about 100 miles. The road itself
is in first-class condition. When I first
travelled over that highway it was not too
well gravelled, but now it is paved all the
way to Nipigon. As you motor along the
highway the trees change from softwoods to
hardwoods, to mixed woods, and to poplars
-great, beautiful tall trees. The soil must
be really good, although the territory seems
to be rocky.
About thirty miles south of Nipigon there
is beautiful Black Lake, with a little park
and a huge mountain behind it. At the time
I was there last the place seemed to be well
patronized by Americans. As to fishing, well
you could catch fish by throwing a line out
of your cabin door. On the huge mountain
is located a nice level camping ground, and
tumbling down from the mountain there is
a small waterfall, the sound of which at night
just lulls you to sleep. There are many
equally pretty places along the road.
In my own province of Saskatchewan we
have the Prince Albert National Park, which
is a wonderful drawing card for Americans.
They love to go there: first, because of the
fishing; and secondly, to get away from the
oppressive summer heat in some of the central
parts of the United States. It is always cool
and fresh in the area of that park.

SENATE

A road has been built from Lake Waskesiu
to Lac La Ronge, a lake abounding in fishin fact, a fisherman's paradise. Later on a
highway will be built to Lac La Plonge,
another lake just teeming with fish.
In the Prince Albert National Park is a
golf course, which golfers who have played
on some of the best courses in the world
claim is the equal of any they have seen. It
really is a beauty. Some of the greens overlook Lake Waskesiu, and the variety of trees
growing in the woods along each fairway are
beautiful. Of course, there are other parts
of Saskatchewan equally beautiful. The
Cypress Hills Park is a lovely spot: there too
you will find excellent fishing and a wellplanned golf course.
To return to the motion before the chamber,
Each one of us has to put forward an effort
to develop tourist traffic; it is in our own
interest to do so. Let us forget about the
money point of view for a while, and invite
Americans to come to Canada so that we
will get to know one another better. If we
make them feel welcome on their visits to
Canada, that will be the best advertising we
can have.
Hon. Nancy Hodges: Honourable senators,
I did not intend to speak on this motion,
but I must say to the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) that if
I were to start discussing the attractions
and beauties of British Columbia I would
keep him here for a week.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: By way of reply to
the plea of the honourable senator that we
invite Americans to come up here and
accept their dollar at par, I would remind
him that it was not so very many years ago
when we Canadians had to pay a premium of
17 cents on our dollar when travelling in the
United States. It is well to remember those
things.
I quite agree with what was said by the
honourable senator who presented the motion (Hon. Mr. Isnor) about selling Canada
to the Americans, but I would like to
emphasize what he said about selling
Canada to the Canadians. If we were to get
somewhere in a domestic way we would be
doing a real selling job. For instance, if I
had my way no one would be elected a
member of Parliament until he or she had
travelled across Canada-I mean from Newfoundland to Victoria, British Columbia-at
at least once.
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators,
rising at this time I wish to heartily support
the motion of the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor). Tourism is beginning to be big business in Canada,

amd each province has its own appeal for
the tourist. Speaking of my own province,
I firmly believe that if we could increase the
number of tourists to our island much of our
farm produce would be used at home, and
thus we would to some extent solve export
and trade problems. I believe also that
greater advertising of our fishing, hunting
and bathing facilities would be of help in
selling our province as a vacationland. Even
at the present time it is rated third among
our industries in Prince Edward Island.
As "Islanders" we are noted for being
very modest about our island and our
achievements with regard to it. But we
must not hide our light under a bushel, and
I would ask your attention for a few minutes
while I tell you something of our tourist
attractions and why we feel we have some
very special features to offer our summer
visitors.
Prince Edward Island may truly be called
the unspoiled holiday paradise of the Atlantic seacoast. It is a land full of rural charm
and unsurpassed pastoral beauty. It is also
known as the birthplace of Canada, and as
such must have a very special interest for
Canadians from other provinces as well as
for visitors from far-away places.
There are several ways of reaching the
island. You may fly, if that is the way you
like to travel; or you can come by train or by
automobile to Cape Tormentine, on the New
Brunswick side of the Strait of Northumberland, and cross by a palatial ferry to Borden,
on the Prince Edward Island side. By the
way, the ferry also carries the train. Or you
can motor down to Caribou, near Pictou, in
Nova Scotia, with beautiful scenery all the
way, and cross by the ferry there to Wood
Islands, Prince Edward Island.
The province now yearly welcomes and
receives thousands of tourists from different
parts of Canada, and from other countries,
especially the United States; but we could
accommodate thousands more. The Island's
fame as a vacationland has spread far and
wide. We have over 3,000 miles of highway,
and most of the main roads are now paved.
To honourable senators from other and larger
provinces that may not seem very much, but
as our island extends only 130 to 140 miles
from tip to tip, that is relatively a lot of
pavement. Other roads are gravelled or hard
dirt roads. I admit that we have no mountainous scenery; I believe our highest elevation is about 500 feet; but since the day when
the Indians peered through the trees at the
strange boats which brought Cartier and his
men to our shores, Prince Edward Island has
smiled her welcome to visitors and has remained a land of enchantment and romance.

FEBRUARY 28, 1957
The rich red soil, in contrast to the brilliant
shades of green, is a picture most pleasing
to see. Beautiful trees and exquisite flower
gardens are everywhere part of the rolling
countryside which has been landscaped by
nature herself. Prince Edward Island is practically ragweed-free, so that sufferers from
hay fever can enjoy a holiday there in
comfort.
No part of the island is very far from
the water; and our beaches are the finest in
eastern Canada. As we say, "Every mile a
beach, and every beach a mile". Large
areas patrolled by lifeguards make bathing
and swimming safe in most places. The
water near the shores is shallow enough for
small children to play in with safety. There
is no danger in leaving them by themselves.
And the waters which roll over these sandy
beaches are warm, averaging about 70 degrees in July and August. Almost everywhere along the coast there is surf bathing,
and for those who prefer quiet waters there
are sheltered bays and coves. You may even
have a whole beach to yourself if you wish to
be alone. None of the beaches are ever
crowded. There is room for everybody.
There are many well-equipped trailer
parks operated on the Island which are a
great boon to the tourist travelling with a
trailer.
Our trout fishing is supposed to be, and of
course I think it is, the best to be found in
Canada. At the end of the day one hears
a great many "fish stories" and naturally I
believe them! Our deep sea fishing is a
great attraction to tourists. If I may be
permitted to relate a little personal experience I would like to tell of my first attempt
at deep sea fishing. The first fish I caught
was a cod, and for a little while I wondered
if the fish was going to get in the boat with
me, or whether I was going to join it somewhere at the bottom of the Gulf of St.
Lawrence 15 miles offshore. Finally, I landed
the fish and, much to my surprise, found that
it was as long as I am. That, honourable
senators, is my fish story.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Inman: Prince Edward Island
has three good golf courses. The one at Green
Gables, in the National Park, is supposed to
be as fine as any to be found in Canada. We,
too, have horse-racing; yachting-in small
boats, if one wishes-and boating of the
ordinary kind. There are numerous summer
hotels, cabins and motels along the beautiful
shores, where the bright skies and cool
breezes from the seas bring health and enjoyment to those who visit this fertile and
scenic little island.
An afternoon on the sand dunes is one of
healthful enjoyment. How deep the blue of

the water flecked with foam and dotted with
the boats of those who gather their harvest
from the sea. You sit on the sands and hear
the ceaseless lapping of the waters at your
feet. And the little sandpipers whisper at
your side, the seagulls circle overhead, a flock
of wild mallards feeds in the silvery lagoon
nearby. You look at the foam and the dark
sea billows, at the picture of the rolling green
meadows and well-cared-for homes, at the
glossy streams that mirror the cloudless
heaven of blue, and acknowledge the beauty
and serenity that dwells in this fair island,
this land of sun, sand and surf, a paradise for
relaxation, where quiet and peace prevail.
The welcome mat is always out and the door
of hospitality ever open.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I wish to say a few words about the province
of Alberta.
Our province depicts on its crest a range
of snow-capped mountains, a range of green
hills and a harvest scene, with the Cross of
St. George above it, and the blue sky over
the mountains. Alberta, indeed, is noted for
its skies. Morning and evening the heavens
glow with beautiful colours, at sunrise and
sunset.
But Alberta has advantages other than blue
skies and strikingly beautiful scenery. The
province is dotted with derricks which indicate the location of oil wells. Every day of
the year, summer and winter, 450,000 barrels
of oil are taken from the ground. The provincial conservation board believes that we
have in reserve some 18 trillion cubic feet of
gas. More is being discovered all the time
and the greatness of this resource can be
realized from the statement that four and a
half trillion cubic feet will supply the needs
of Alberta for 25 years.
We have heard something lately about pipe
lines which are being built east and west from
Alberta so that others in Canada can share
the benefits of this cheap and easily-controlled
fuel. There is enough coal underground in
Alberta to last the dominion of Canada, at
the present rate of consumption, a thousand
years. About one million acres of land are
irrigated by the rivers and streams which
flow down the eastern slopes of the Rockies;
and three large beet sugar factories are engaged in processing the great crops of sugar
beets, high in sugar content, which may be
seen from the roadside during the season.
These crops 'have a high sugar content on
account of the moisture and sunshine and
the long frost-free season.
Tourists travelling west in one of the dome
cars of The Canadian will see boundless and

SENATE
beautiful level areas for which the English
language has no name-the Prairies. Here
and there on the Prairies, both in summer
and in winter, large herds of white-faced
cattle can be seen grazing and fattening up
on the nutritious natural grasses.
As the travellers journey farther west they
will pass through rich foothill country, and
finally they will come upon the great Rocky
Mountains, whose scenery is world famous.
They will see the impressive Castle Mountain,
now .called Mount Eisenhower, which in the
distance looks like some great structure built
by human hands. It is surrounded by scenery
which is just as lovely as the landscape might
be in any dream.
Then the tourist will see Mount Rundle,
which was named after an early missionary
who made his contribution in that country
before having to leave because of sickness.
For many years after his departure the Indian
people continued to sing the charming Sunday
School songs he had taught them. Those
Indians said of Mr. Rundle, "Poor he came
among us; poor he went away, leaving us
rich."
When we visit Banff, Jasper, Waterton and
the ranges we find nature in all its original
beauty, a beauty that brings contentment and
peace. As someone has said:
I am tired of the sights of the city's bright lights,
I long for the peace of the range.
The spell of the mountains, majestic and grand,
The nights that are peaceful and strange.

I never think of Waterton National Park
without remembering the late Senator Buchanan, one of the founders of this park, which
is located in southern Alberta along the eastern slope of the Rockies. It is actually the
northern projection of the National Glacier
Park of the United States of America, whose
full name is Waterton Glacier International
Peace Park. As the name implies, it is a
favorite place for international meetings of
service clubs and good will meetings of people
of the United States and Canada.
In the valley of the Red Deer, between
Drumheller and Steveville there lies the
great Bad Lands of Alberta. This is truly
a fearsome and frightening place, and it is
the only attraction of its kind in Canada.
There are canyon walls 500 feet high, and
deep valleys that seern to have been gouged
out by prehistoric monsters. The bones of
reptiles that roamed that area sixty million
years ago are still to be found there, for
it is the graveyard of the dinosaurs that
lived and played and perished there so long
ago. Thirty complete dinosaur skeletons have
been carted away from the valley, and one
of them stands in the National Museum of
Canada. It is indeed a colossal structure.
People who like unusual things can tour
the Bad Lands and see petrified wood, fruits,

shells and bones of these prehistoric giants
who once wallowed in this area. If a museum
were established there, with good roads running to it, I am sure it would become a place
of great interest, because of these attractions
which are unavailable elsewhere.
The
Trans-Canada
Highway
running
through Alberta is a wide, hard-surfaced
road.
Accommodation along the way is
good, and western hospitality is extended to
all by a neighbourly people. Albertans are
not afraid to venture into the unknown; they
are not afraid of the untried. Someone bas
said that their particular characteristics can
be expressed in these words:
Ask why the eagle soars in the air,
And builds on high his craggy nest;
Ask why the fisheS swim so deep,
Then ask me why I love the West!
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
we are indebted to the honourable gentleman
frorn Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor)
for bringing forward this motion. It is timely

that he should do so. Our tourist traffic
industry is one of substantial importance,
even today, and is one with almost unlimited
possibilities of development. It is important
in several ways.

Some honourable senators who have spoken
this afternoon have emphasized the importance of Canadians getting better acquainted
with one another. I am all in favour of
that. I am in favour, for instance, of my
fellow Manitobans going down to the native
province of the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth and seeing some of the
historic landmarks of our country, visiting
beautiful Cape Breton Island and its lovely
Bras d'Or Lakes, and enjoying the splendid
scenery of the green-clad hills.
When we move from one province to another we educate ourselves but we do not
become greatly enriched, in the economic

sense, for we do not grow richer by taking
in each other's washing, which is about what

we do when we visit back and forth from
one province to another. But when we get
foreign visitors to come and see the varied
scenic characteristics of our own country we
are in effect exporting these scenic attractions.
If a foreign tourist spends $1,000 in
Canada it means that we have gained this
revenue by merely exporting our attractions.
Therefore, in the economic sense-and it is
from that point of view that I wish to speak
for a few moments-this industry can be
made of very great value to Canada.
In order to build up a good tourist industry
a few things are necessary. Most people travel
by motor car today. About twenty years ago,
when I happened to have the responsibility

FEBRUARY 28, 1957
of a department of government, we built a
road across 100 miles of wilderness from the
Swan River valley in Manitoba to the town
of Le Pas in northern Manitoba, which was
then regarded pretty much as only a trappers'
town, although it had a population of several
thousand. The road, which was opened in the
summer of 1938, as I recall, was built
jointly by the Province of Manitoba
and the federal Government. In the
following autumn I was in Le Pas. The
evenings were still fairly long, and one day
after my evening meal I walked down the
main street and counted 21 motor cars. Four
months earlier those cars could not have
reached Le Pas unless they had been transported by railway car. Of these cars, 19 were
American, and one was from far-distant San
Francisco. That was a very direct object
lesson to me of the value of roads. Nothing
will pay better than good roads in Canada.
Another thing that is essential, and whicb
has been alluded to this afternoon, is good
accommodation for tourists that is clean and
not too costly, with food that is simple, wholesome, well prepared and served, though not
necessarily expensive. By these means we can
increase our tourist traffic immensely. Honourable senators, alongside our country, for
3,000 miles or more, is a country with a population of some 170 million, rated as the
richest country in the world. Its people love
to travel, and when on vacation they like to
go to some unknown place. I was particularly
struck with that fact many years ago in
Manitoba, where we have some real tourist
attractions that I shall mention in a moment.
When I visited the national park on one
occasion there were a number of American
visitors, and I remember seeing two cars from
the State of Kentucky. At that time I had
the responsibility of the parks administration, and I was anxious to look around to
see how everything was being done. With the
superintendent of the park I went out several
miles to see a herd of 80 or 90 buffalo which
were in a fenced enclosure. The occupants of
the cars from Kentucky were taking pictures
of the buffalo, and they were having an exciting time. I have not the slightest doubt that
when those tourists returned to their home
state they told all their friends about the
wonders of the national park in Manitoba,
and showed the pictures to them; and it is
altogether likely that they told some tall
stories about their experiences-which would
not hurt at all.
Honourable senators, our scenery across
Canada is probably more varied and more
attractive in its completeness than that of
any other country in the world. We have the
attractions of the old province of Quebec
and of the Maritime provinces and the

attractions of Ontario, especially its northern
lakes, forests and hills.
It is true that the Prairies are not regarded
as attractive, but that impression is left
mainly because the railways traversing the
Prairie provinces do not touch the really
scenic places there. When travelling by
train from, say, Winnipeg to Calgary, one
is apt to get the impression that this is nothing but level, bald-headed prairie, and that
every eight or ten miles one comes across
a not very attractive looking village. On
more than one occasion I have heard
European visitors speak of the dreary
journey across the Prairies. Yet when one
moves into other parts of any of the three
Prairie provinces interesting and beautiful
spots are to be found. For instance, in the
province of Manitoba we have a national
park, in which is not only a herd of 80 to
100 buffalo living under natural conditions,
but also probably the largest herd of wild
elk anywhere on the North American continent. The park is extensive in area, embracing over 1,600 square miles, and contains
a beautiful lake nine miles long by three
miles wide at its widest point. The interesting point about this lake is that there is
not a single stream of water flowing into
it, although a very substantial amount of
water flows out of it. The explanation is
that all the water in the lake comes from
springs, except that which is derived from
rainfall; springs gush and bubble up from
the sand and flow into the lake, with
the result that the water is so clear that one
can see down to the pebbles, a depth of
twelve to fifteen feet. This is a most
attractive place situated in a hilly country,
and every year hundreds of tourists visit
there, particularly .from the Dakotas. The
same can be said of the Waskesiu Park in
northern Saskatchewan. These are attractions which are very real to many people.
When one considers that in many parts of
North Dakota, for instance, water is not too
plentiful and there is not a native spring or
a conifer tree, excepting those that have been
planted, it can be realized that the attractions
of which I speak draw many tourists. Like
attractions are to be found all across Canada.
Honourable senators, the purpose of this
motion is that we shall examine further this
matter of the promotion of tourist travel,
that we shall call in those people of the
provinces who are interested in the development of our tourist business. I really think
that nothing but good can come out of that.
One of the greatest misfortunes in this
country, probably on account of its size, is
the duplication of effort not only in the
federal, provincial and muncipal fields, but
in other fields as well. The sensible thing

SENATE
to do is to try to co-ordinate these efforts,
to forget about the things that may at times
divide us and concentrate upon those on
which we can become united.
This motion, which I trust will receive
the unanimous support of this house, could
lead to very useful results for the economy
of Canada.
We have a great country and a great
people. It is our responsibility in Parliament to give them the very best guidance
and assistance we can, to provide them with
good laws and to stimulate their imagination
as to the possibilities of their country. If
we do that, honourable senators, I -am convinced that within ten years we can make
our tourist business worth at least half a
billion dollars annually to the economy of
Canada.
Hon. Harold Connolly: Honourable senators,
many years ago, as a young newspaperman,
I sat in the dingy news-room of a Halifax
newspaper, where an older associate, with
the two-finger typist method, common to
most newspapermen, sat down and typed out
what I have always regard as the finest bit
of poetic prose I have ever read. He addressed it to the people of Nova Scotia, and
he entitled it simply Nova Scotia. This is
what he wrote:
Did it ever occur to you that the Creator may
have left this little sea-girt peninsula until the last?
That He may have reserved for it many of the
treasures of His workshop?
That after He had finished His great masterpiece
He may have spent eons in moulding those features
of the province which possess such delicacy of
beauty, such subtlety of charm that, search the
world over, we find them unexcelled and without
peer?
Did you ever think that when the world was
coming out of chaos the Creator may have set
aside ever so little of the congealing mass upon
which to mold His own special design?
Have you not thought of the divine hand pressing
a finger into the soft clay, and behold a valley
here, another there?
Have you not seen in the contour of the hills
and mountains of this land the divine imagery of
what hills and mountains should be?
Have you not heard in the murmur of its surf,
the babble of its brooks, the roar of its tide, the
music of the divine choir that sang praises while
the Creator worked?
Have you not heard through the forest, over
fields and meadows, the breath that gave it life?
Did it never seem strange to you that this land
is without tempest, or drought, or flood, or gale,
or pestilence?
Well, if it did, did you ever think the reason
may have been that it is God's island?

I recite that bit of poetic prose, honourable
senators, not to suggest for one moment that

we in that little peninsula have God-like
qualities which are not possessed by other
provinces in Canada.

I mention it because

the writer of those lines, the late Horatio
C. Crowell, was a great Canadian who felt,
as I am sure all honourable senators feel,

that the people of Canada ought to get to
know one another better. Like most Canadians, I agree with that philosophy. But I
should like to remind honourable senators
that the primary motive of the tourist industry is-and it was referred to by the
honourable senator who preceded me (Hon.
Mr. Crerar)-to bring into this country newfound dollars. And Canada's greatest potential tourist customers are to be found in the
country to the south of our borders, where
there live some 180 million people.
I listened while the Chairman of the
Tourist Traffic Committee (Hon. Mr. Isnor)
referred to the great work done by Mr. Leo
Dolan, the former Director of the Canadian
Travel Bureau. May I with all deference
point out that this was not the first body
instituted to improve the tourist endeavour
in Canada, nor was Mr. Dolan the first chief
of a travel bureau in this country. As a
matter of fact, the origin of tourist promotion
within Canada goes back more than 100
years. The first director, self appointed, of
a travel bureau was a poet in New England
by the name of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,
who wrote a gem entitled Evangeline, based
on the expulsion of the Acadian people from
Nova Scotia. As a result of that masterpiece
of poetic effort, during all the long years
since then the greatest number of tourists
to Nova Scotia have come from New York
and Massachusetts.
Now, there is nothing strange to me in the
fact that the people of Nova Scotia, much
as they would like to learn more about
British Columbia, find it very difficult to do
so, and the people of British Columbia cannot easily get to know Nova Scotians. It is
simply a matter of economics. As I listened
for the past several days to the debate on
the Canada Council Bill, with its recommendations with respect to the arts, humanities and sciences, I wondered whether or not
the aspect of tourist travel should not come
within the purview of those who will constitute that council. I ask honourable senators to note that the motion before the house
asks that the Tourist Traffic committee be
". . . empowered to inquire into and report
upon the activities of the various agencies
concerned with promoting tourist travel in
Canada." I do not wish to decry the motion,
but simply for the record may I point out
that every year for many years past the
provincial tourist agencies in Canada have
met with the minister at Ottawa responsible
for tourist endeavours. These meetings have
revealed that while there may be some little
overlapping of services, the objective of the
Canadian Government Travel Bureau has
always been, and I think properly so, to
focus attention of tourists not upon certain

FEBRUARY 28, 1957
sections of the country but upon Canada
as a whole, believing that it is the duty of
each province to utilize its own resources
to improve its own economy.
Now, honourable senators, I do not propose
to do other than vote for the motion. But
I think it would be a mistake if we became
so engrossed with the thought that Canadian
people should get to know each other better
that we completely forgot our potential customers to the south. If we are to bring
into Canada the tourist dollars which we
require, and which our trade balance shows
are most urgently needed, we must always
remember that no matter how patriotic it
may be to encourage our citizens to visit one
another, the people upon whom we must
focus our attention are the 180 million Americans who have already proved beyond a
shadow of a doubt that they are this country's most valuable tourist customers.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, -

Hon Mr. Pouliot: Happy birthday to you.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you. The mover
of this resolution (Hon. Mr. Isnor) did me
the honour of asking me to second it. Although he had to leave the chamber to catch
a train to his home, I will nevertheless thank
him, and I trust he will read my remarks in
Hansard. I also take the opportunity to
thank him for the congratulations which he
extended to me for having drawn out this
long-extended youth of mine to a certain
degree of maturity. I have been highly
pleased and deeply moved by the many
messages of good will and congratulations
that have come to me, not the least of which
was the one I just received from the honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot).
I acknowledge gratefully good
wishes of the honourable lady from Sorel
(Hon. Mrs. Jodoin), the Prime Minister, the
Leader of this bouse, and many others.
It is almost worth while to grow old just
to receive these kind expressions of friendship, good fellowship and good wishes. I am
sometimes tempted to think that the record
must be wrong, so far as I am concerned,
but the fact is that my being able to maintain so long the activities of youth bas been
largely a matter of good luck. As one reaches
the meridian of life and travels down the
other side, the hope and the wish always
is to retain the strength to continue and to
take a part in the activities of his generation.
That strength has been accorded to me, not
because of any virtue on my part but just
as a matter of good luck which I have not
been foolish enough to destroy.
I thank every one who has congratulated
me on this day.
82719-19

Now, honourable senators, turning to the
resolution itself, it is not feasible for me or
desirable at this late hour to compete with
the wonderful literary efforts that I have
heard this afternoon, in which poetry and
imagery were employed to extol the scenic
beauties and other attractions of the various
speakers' provinces. I do wish that all Canada
could have been listening to what has been
said on the fioor of this house this afternoon.
I am not going to say much on behalf of
the province of Ontario, and perhaps it is
not necessary that I should, for after all
there is no attraction anywhere in the
dominion that cannot be equalled in the
province of Ontario.
One of the great wonders of the world is
Niagara Falls. He who has not looked up at
that towering fountain of water bas something well worth seeing before he departs
this world. And let us not forget that our
national capital, Ottawa, is in the province
of Ontario. I have seen many of the capitals
of the world, but I think I am safe in saying
that none of them excels this capital of ours
in natural beauty and architectural loveliness. And, of course, my own great city of
Toronto, with its splendid bay and all its
facilities for entertainment and comfort, is
as fine a city as can be found anywhere. And
I must not overlook the golf courses.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In the course of my
golfing experience I have heard a good many
alibis, but we got a new one today from
the mover of this resolution (Hon. Mr. Isnor)
when he suggested that if any tourist visiting
Nova Scotia finds his score not exactly as
he would like it, it is likely that he has been
overcome by the beauties of the scenery
around him. That is a new one. Perhaps it
provides a clue to what has been affecting
my own score for so long.
It is true, as was said by my honourable
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
that the tourist industry is of great economic
importance, but let him not consider only the
question of currency and finance. He said
we will not create wealth by taking in each
other's washing. Well, that is what we are
doing on all hands-we are increasing the
wealth of this country by the work that we
do, by the effort we apply to the natural
resources of our country. Certainly if we
take in our neighbours' washing it will result
at least in our having clean clothes which
previously were dirty, and that surely will be
an addition to our wealth. But no doubt
what my friend had in mind was that it does
not help our international balance of currency when we travel in our own country,
whereas it does help us materially when

SENATE
somebody from the United States comes here
and gives us the opportunity to provide him
with comforts from the wealth of the land,
for which he leaves us his money in return.
It is too bad that there is so much misconception over the exchange value of currency. The American tourists who finds that
his dollar is worth only 95 cents or so in
Canada should remember that its purchasing
power is less than that of our dollar, and that
be got it more easily in consequence. When
he exchanges his dollar for ours be acquires
more purchasing power.
Before closing I would like to pay tribute
to the Chairman of the Standing Committee
We
on Tourist Traffic (Hon. Mr. Isnor).
have no finer chairman or better host in the
Parliament of Canada than the chairman of
this committee.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He has set an example
to all other chairmen in that he invites the
members of his committee to dinner once
a year. On the last occasion at least, if
not on others, he served one of the most
delicious steaks that I ever ate. I think he
is an ideal chairman, though not for that
reason alone, by any means. I call attention
to the energy with which be pursues the task
of promoting tourist trade in Canada. His
knowledge, his enthusiasm, and bis constant
effort are devoted to the work. I wish him
long life and continued success in this
endeavour.
I heartily approve of this motion to empower the committee to inquire into and
report upon the activities of the various
agencies concerned with promoting tourist
travel in Canada. The purpose of the contact
with the other organizations is to urge then
to do something in this regard. One thinks
of the old saying that it is easier to get 10
men to do 10 men's work than it is to do
10 men's work yourself. The way to promote
our tourist trade, like almost everything else,
is to get a large number of people interested
in it and put them all to work.
Honourable senators, I have pleasure in
seconding this motion.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to prolong this
panegyric of our great natural beauties, but
simply to say that I am sure the response
which bas been given to the present motion
is not only a compliment to the newly-appointed chairman and his seconder, but
augurs well for the development of the field
to which, in the months ahead, the cornmittee will give its attention. My specific
purpose in rising is to thank the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) for referring to the fact that in

Canada we have a capital city. Most of us
who live here the year round have some
reason to know its powers of attraction, for
the number of tourists who come to Ottawa
from all parts of the United States as well as
Canada probably exceeds the flow of visitors
to any other place in this country. It is not
unusual, each day during the months between
sessions of Parliament, to have as many as
5,000 people passing through these halls and
around these buildings. Even during the
parliamentary sessions the interest which is
refiected in the crowds of people who travel
through the corridors each day is obvious.
Representative officials who relate to them
something of the historic background of this
building and this country can give eloquent
testimony on this feature of their work.
In this connection I should like to suggest
to the chairman of the Tourist Traffic Committee that he review some of the matters
which were discussed at some length, last
year, by the Joint Committee of the House
of Commons and the Senate with reference
to the development of the federal district
and the city of Ottawa, with the very purpose in mind which has been accentuated and
emphasized here today. The making of this
capital centre of Canada the attractive place
which nature has done so much to create
for us is closely related to the value of the
tourist industry to this country.
I shall not attempt to rival in poetic reference my honourable friends from Nova Scotia
(Hon. Mr. Connolly), Prince Edward Island
(Hon. Mrs. Inman) and Alberta (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw), in relation to the endowments of
their particular provinces. May I just say that
those who have had the opportunity of seeing
something of the Laurentian hills to the north
of us, and the Gatineau hills near by, and
to know the great possibilities of the Ottawa
River once it has been purified, will I think
agree with me that the committee could well
afford to have before it, at an early date,
officials from the Federal District Commission
and the City of Ottawa. Improvement of conditions which will extend the beautification
and facilities of this capital centre as envisaged in the Greber plan, is certainly pertinent to the work of our tourist committee.
I say this because, as I have already pointed
out, the presence of thousands of tourists,
especially during the summer and fall months,
is evidence of the interest which is shown
in Canada's capital city and justifies every
effort to make it more and more the national
centre of this country.
Hon. Muriel McG. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, I do not intend to give you any
poetic description of our province of New
Brunswick; but I am fortunate enough to be
a member of the Standing Committee on

FEBRUARY 28, 1957
Tourist Traffic and I was asked by the chairman to say a word or two about my province.
So I feel that, although the hour is late, I
would not be doing my duty to New Brunswick, about which I had intended to speak at
rather greater length, if I did not say a few
words. I shall limit myself to drawing to
your attention some attractions which New
Brunswick possesses and which, perhaps, are
not to be found in other parts of Canada, although I believe the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) claims
that anything to be found elsewhere may be
found in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And better!
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Let me mention some
things about New Brunswick which I do not
believe can be equalled in any other province,
even Ontario. First I would refer to one of
our fellow citizens, Mr. Leo Dolan, who comes
from my own city of Fredericton, and of
whom we are very proud. His fellow citizens
have watched his career with the greatest
interest and admiration. We feel he has done
a very great deal to make Canada known
throughout the world, and we wish him success in his future activities. We are sorry
that in his new sphere he will be away from
us and that we shall see him less often.
In some tourist literature New Brunswick
is referred to as "the picture province", and
I think the term is very apt, because within
very short distances a great variety of picturesque scenes can be found. One may start
at the Quebec border and follow the beautiful Saint John River down its course. For
many years, as honourable senators know, it
has been known as "the Rhine of America".
The scenes along the river are extremely
varied, ranging from the turbulent Grand
Falls, near the head, down to the wide placid
reaches of the river at Fredericton, where it
is bordered by meadows.
I intended to make reference to some of our
historic buildings, because we are an old
province, but time is short, and the only one
I would mention is Christ Church Cathedral,
which, I believe, embodies the most perfect
Gothic architecture in America.
Following the Saint John river to its mouth,
one comes to the Reversing Falls, a phenomenon not to be found in many other
places, and very interesting to tourists. You
can travel the shore to the United States
border from Saint John, or you can start from
that old grey city and drive to Moncton, which
has the second largest population in the province. On the way, by making a slight detour,
one can visit the spectacular Fundy Park. I
had forgotten, until someone reminded me,
that we have there a very fine golf course,
which our visitors extol very highly indeed.
Another great attraction is the coastal scenery
82719-19j

in and around Fundy Park, which, I do not
think anyone can deny, is as fine as anything
in the world. At Moncton can be seen a tidal
bore, a wall of water rising sometimes three
to five feet, which comes roaring up the
Petitcodiac River and fills the creeks and
little rivers which fiow into it.
Then there is the widely-known Magnetic
Hill, near Moncton. It is visited annually by
thousands and thousands of people. They
come in a doubting mood, but when they park
their cars on the hill they find that they back
up. Many of them go 'away as puzzled as
when they came. It is a terrific attraction.
If you wish you can travel forty miles
from Moncton to the Nova Scotia border, or
you can go to Northumberland Strait and
follow the shoreline past beautiful beaches of
white sand where the bathing is unexcelled.
Then you can journey past rugged fishing
villages on the way to the Bay of Chaleur.
I am taking honourable senators on this
imaginary journey to show you why we in
New Brunswick believe that nowhere else
can you travel 'approximately 600 miles and
see such a great variety of beautiful scenery.
There are many other attractions about
which I would like to speak if time permitted,
but I cannot conclude my remarks without
referring to our wonderful salmon fishing on the famous Restigouche and Miramichi rivers and their tributaries. Each fall
our hunting facilities attract people from great
distances to our almost unlimited forests.
As we have all these attractions for tourists,
we in New Brunswick are deeply interested
in the activities of agencies which encourage
tourist travel. I therefore support this motion
wholeheartedly.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
PÈRES OBLATS DE L'IMMACULÉE
CONCEPTION-SECOND READING

Hon. J. J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill 1-7, an Act respecting Les
Révérends Pères Oblats de l'Immaculée Conception de Marie.
He said: Honourable senators, I need not
detain you for more than a few minutes with
reference to this measure. This corporation
was originally established by statute in the
year 1849 by the former Province of Canada.
Th Oblate Order itself was founded in
France in 1816, and Oblate Fathers first
came to Canada in the early 1840's and
established themselves in eastern Canada
and, being missionaries, they also went to
the western part of this country.
Before dealing with the legal problems
presented by this measure it may be worth
while to mention some of the people who

SENATE
were associated with the development of the
work of the Order.
One of the best known
of these was Father Lacombe, whose readable
biography, written by Mrs. Katherine Hughes,
discloses some interesting stories about the
early phases of the development of western
Canada. It has been said that Father Lacombe was president of the Canadian Pacific
Railway for one hour. He was in his ninetieth
year when he died, in 1916, and I am sure
there are gentlemen in this house who knew
him personally.
Another member of the Order who was
probably well known to people in the west
was Bishop Breynat, popularly known as
the "Flying bishop of the Arctic". He died
in France about four years ago.
Then there was Father Broulliard, now a
military chaplain, who wrote Inuk, an
interesting book about the habits and customs of the Eskimo.
The reason for changing the name of this
religous organization is explained by the
fact that it is a missionary Order, although
it does some work in the education field. The
new name points up the fact that it is a
missionary Order, and I am informed that
the word "oblate" means a person dedicated
to a religious purpose. The members of
this organization are missionary oblates.
This is not an unusual bill in any way,
and it follows the lines of similar legislation
incorporating religious organizations. Section 2 of the bill provides that the head
office will be in Montreal. Section 3 sets
forth the objects of the corporation, which
are appropriate to an organization of this
kind. Section 4 empowers the corporation
to acquire and hold real property; section 5
empowers it to borrow money, and section
6 empowers it to invest its funds.
The corporation's power to hold real estate
is subject to the mortmain laws of the
provinces in which it will operate, and, like
other corporate bodies of this kind, it is to
be governed by a council of administi-ation,
which is similar to a board of directors in a
commercial corporation.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): What
power has the corporation to sell real estate?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): I am
glad the honourable senator asked that question, for it concerns a problem which confronted me when I was studying the bill.
I admit the legislation might be defective in
this respect. The corporation should be empowered to dispose of real estate, for from
time to time it finds it necessary to do so.
This provision could be added to the bill in
committee. I would point out that it was
contained in similar legislation passed by
this house not too long ago.

In the original act of incorporation, passed
in 1849, certain restrictions were made as to
tl· e manner in which the assets of the Order
could be disposed of, and there may be an
implied power in those sections for disposing
of real estate; but they are really anachronisms. The Order might be willed certain
properties and, according to the act of incorporation, if it should be disbanded those
properties would be returned to the estates
of the persons who willed them. Of course,
that is the kind of thing that cannot be
worked out in practice today, after so many
years, and 1 think there is a rather interesting sidelight to be looked at by the committee
in those sections which are now to be repealed.
I should also add that in 1875 and 1888
bills were passed in the Quebec Legislature
which purported to amend the original incorporating act, and in 1901 and 1933 bills
were passed in the Ontario Legislature to
the sane effect. Strictly speaking, I think
that the measures passed by the two provincial houses were not effective to change
the original act of incorporation passed by
the Parliament of the United Province of
Canada, but they may perhaps have conferred certain powers which could be exercised by the corporation within two provincial
jurisdictions.
For the purpose of gathering all these
various enactments together, not only is the
original act incorporating the organization
made a schedule to this bill but the two
measures passed by the two provinces are
also added as schedules.
At the present time the Order operates in
most, if not all, of the provinces of Canada.
From time to time various divisions have
been created for the better administration
of the Order's activities. For example, it
has a subdivision called the Province of
St. Peter, which serves the purpose of the
English-speaking portion of the population,
so-called. A bill of incorporation was passed
in this chamber not long ago for the establishment of Assumption Province, whose
work is mainly with the Polish people. Another subdivision is St. Mary's, of Regina,
which looks after the requirements of the
German-speaking population in certain parts
of Canada.
In addition to the work of the Order in
the provinces themselves there are seven
divisions of its work in the far-flung reaches
of the north country. Altogether there are
some 6,000 members of the Order, both priests
and lay brothers, doing work in Canada;
they do not only missionary and religious
work, but also educational work, and the

FEBRUARY 28, 1957
Order is now, and has been for many years,
in charge of the 'University of Ottawa.
Personaliy, I have a great deal to thank
the Oblates for, in that most of my education
was received at their hands, in the University
of Ottawa-although I must confess I arn
flot a very good example of the kind of
product they turn out.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We do flot agree with
that statement.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Thank you.
Honourable senators, if the bill receives
second reading, 1 will move that it be referred
to the Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bis.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourabie
senators, before this bill is referred to a committee I must say that the Order of Oblates
deserves the respect and admiration of the
people of Canada for the magnificent educational work it has done and for its missionary work in the north. I had a ciassmate,
who is now an Oblate Father in the north
of Saskatchewan. He has spent most of bis
time witb the Indians; he tries to do bis best
for them, and has sacrificed himself on their
behaîf.
I could make a long speech about the
founder of the University of Ottawa, the
Reverend Father Tabaret, who bas been
rector of tbat institution for over 35 years,
and about ail the professors of tbat splendid
institution. It is now divided into St. Patrick's
College as well as the University of Ottawa.
The Oblates have been interested not only in
education, but aiso temperance. In Quebec
City there was a Father Lelièvre, who was
known tbroughout the whole province, and
who did a lot ta improve conditions witb
regard ta temperance.
Honourable senators, I cannot close my
remarks without making special mention of
a man who was a religious of that Order,
and who was born at Rivière-du-Loup, where
I live; I mean, Monseigneur Alexandre-Antanin Taché, who was Archbishop of St.
Boniface. He was such a remarkable man
that it was said during bis lifetime that he
was qualifled ta be Prime Minister of Canada.
I bow ta ail the great men who belong
to this Order. Tbey are great Canadians. If
they need same kind of legisiation ta promate
the excellent work they do, I arn ail for it.

Hon. Senalors: Hear, bear.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.

West), the bill was referred ta the Standing

CANADA COUNCIL BILL

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,

motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald for the second
reading of Bill 47, an Act for the establishment of a Canada Council for the encouragement of the arts, humanities and social
sciences.
Hon. G. Percival Burchili: Honourable
senators, after listening to the excellent
speeches which have been made by the
honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson) and the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), who
are members respectively of the governing
bodies of Mount Allison University and
McGill, I felt I should add something in
support of this legislation.
I have had many years' association with
some of the universities in the Maritime
provinces. I have had the honour and distinction of being for many years a member
of the Senate of the University of New Brunswick, and of being on the board of governors
of King's College, in Halifax, so I know something of the problems which face Canadian
universities at the present time and have
confronted them for some years past.
Before I go further, let me say that I do
not think that the honourable senator from
Fredericton overstated the case for Mount
Allison Art School.
I would even be tempted-and I hope I am
not offending my honourable friend from
Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron)-to say that there
are a great many people who regard the
Mount Allison Art School as the best art
school in Canada. At least, I can say that it
has a national reputation.
The next thing I would like to remind
honourable senators of-and I hope they have
not overlooked this-is that the two estates
which my honourable friend from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) told the house
were earmarked for this capital sum were
the estates of two distinguished sons of the
Maritime provinces.
By their industry,
ability and courage they accumulated during
their lifetime the estates which are providing the moneys to be set aside for this worthwhile purpose.
When I first heard of this legislation my
mind went back to a very eloquent speech
which was delivered in this chamber by the
late Honourable Senator David on June 19,
1946. Those of us who were present on that
occasion will perhaps recall that address,
which I consider to be one of the most outstanding addresses I have ever heard here.
Honourable members who have come to the

SENATE
Senate since that time would do well to read
the report of that speech in Hansard. In my
opinion it is one of the finest speeches ever
made on Canadian literature, and I think
that copies of it should be distributed to
every student in arts in Canada. The honourable senator was pleading in support of a
resolution which be moved expressing the
wish that it might please the Government to
foster the production of literary, scientific,
economic and social works in this country
and create a prize in literature to be awarded
by a jury selected by the Government. In
summing up, near the end of his very able
speech, he said:
We must remember that literature and the arts
are the real and durable foundation of national
greatness. . . . The greatness of a nation resides
in the minds of its people.

And in his final paragraph he quoted from
Wilfred Eggleston, Honorary Secretary of the

Canadian Writers' Foundation, these words:
The creative energy that flows in artistic channels
bas characteristics peculiarly its own. In its highest
manifestation it can confer more glory upon a
nation than any other form of human activity.

Senator David's resolution was passed
unanimously by the Senate. I am quite sure
that if he were with us tonight he would
endorse the legislation now before the house
and agree with me that there is no better
way to foster the arts, humanities and social
sciences than by the granting of scholarships.
Those of us who are associated or connected
with a university are aware of the large
number of applications by students for
scholarships. Young men and women in
almost every community across Canada are
unable to enter college without some form
of financial assistance. If for lack of
scholarships or student loans a potential
leader in any of the professional fields of
medicine, law, education or other field is
denied a university education because his
own province is not in a position to provide
that financial assistance, what is the alternative? He will probably go to the United
States on a scholarship from an American
university, as a great many Canadians have
been forced to do, and become an American
citizen. Many such people have become
leaders in American life. In fact, throughout the United States Canadians are found
as leaders in every field of human endeavour.
The second part of this proposed legislation, namely, the capital grants to universities, is a recognition by the top level of
Government of the contribution our universities are making toward building a better
Canada. Perhaps it would not be amiss at
this time to remind ourselves just what are
the functions of Canadian universities. For

my part, I can think of no better conception
of a Canadian university than the description which that eminent Canadian John
Bassett gave on the occasion of his installation as Chancellor of Bishop's university,
Lennoxville. Surrounded by such an eminent
group of men on the platform as Premier
Duplessis, Sir James Dunn, the Honourable
Mr. Justice Abbott, Lord Beaverbrook, the
Honourable Ray Lawson, the great playwright Robert E. Sherwood, and many others
composing a distinguished company, he
declared:
Our universities must be, above all else, places
where the spirit may be fortified for life's hard
journey and where the aspect of ancient truth,
that is the most necessary for that journey, be
cherished and imparted: and what truth is most
necessary for our age? May I suggest to you that
it is the ancient truth spoken by Pericles some
2,400 years ago when he said "The secret of freeThat secret was never more
dom is courage".
needed than it is today and it is needed not only
that we may be of good heart amidst the world's
anxieties; it is needed also because there are so
many persons and so many groups seeking to
preach the gospel of dependence and self distrust.
The mind formed by the university should be one
strengthened to resist those who cleverly seek to
discredit individual effort and make of dependence
almost a social virtue. All this is a fallacy that
our universities should be resolute to expose.
The need for self-reliance arises from the fact
that no man can ever escape, that in all the
ultimate things of life and experience, the thinga
that make thought and decision and faith, man is
alone with himself. A Canadian university bas a
special obligation to teach the freedom of courage.
Much bas been said in this land about security
but Canada must seek security as a reward rather
than as an escape.

But there is another function which our

Canadian universities are performing at the
present time: they are preserving our Canadian unity. Honourable senators, do you
realize they are one of the few influences
in Canada that are holding us together? We
are becoming alarmingly sectional. Our approach to every measure is sectional, and
for every speech one hears on Canadianism,
one hears a dozen on provincialism. Economics
is pulling us apart, and the faster the wheel
of business whirls, the higher our national
income mounts, the greater the strain on
our national unity. There are no provincial
boundaries or barriers to the culture and
knowledge which flows from our halls of
learning. We at the University of New
Brunswick have sent, and are sending,
foresters to British Columbia. My late classmate Peter Z. Caverhill was one of the
pioneers, and became British Columbia's
chief forester. The chief forester of British
Columbia today is another graduate of the
University of New Brunswick. In fact, whereever there is the smoke of a paper mill or
pulp mill across Canada, you will find
foresters trained at the University of New
We have sent geologists to
Brunswick.

MARCH 5, 1957
Alberta and Ontario, and educationalists to
Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In turn, we
have received distinguished people from other
provinces. We have to thank British Columbia for sending us Dr. Argue, Dean of the
Faculty of Science at the University of New
Brunswick; he has made a notable contribution to our university and to our province.
What I have said about the University of
New Brunswick can be applied to every university in Canada. This habit of interchange
is as it should be, and I hope that it will
ever continue, for it binds together this great
dominion of ours. I submit that that in itself
is a sufficient reason for Canadian universities
to look to the Dominion treasury for help
in their problems-and they have many of
them. The problems that have confronted
Canadian universities in the past ten years
have been colossal. I speak of the University
of New Brunswick, and what I say applies
to any university in Canada. The President
and Senate there have been beset with the
difficulty of finding accommodation facilities
for the large number of students who desire
to enrol, and this, notwithstanding the generosity of our great benefactor, the honorary
chancellor, that illustrious son of New Brunswick, Lord Beaverbrook, who, among his
many gifts, has presented the university with
a men's residence, in memory of Lady
Beaverbrook; a gymnasium not equalled in
eastern Canada, nor indeed anywhere in
Canada; a library which houses among its
treasures the private papers and documents
of the late Right Honourable Andrew Bonar
Law and the late Right Honourable David
Lloyd George; a modern rink; a women's
residence; a law library in the city of Saint
John, completely furnished; and an art centre
in Fredericton, which is now in course of
construction.
In addition to all this, the provincial Govemnment and the alumni and alumnae associations, and friends of the university have
made available in the last ten years upwards
of $2 million which has been used in the
erection of new buildings, laboratories and
equipment. Notwithstanding all this, the
problems ahead loom large.
Last year the president of the university
appointed a committee of the faculty to study
the situation and potential growth over the
next ten years. I have a copy of their report
in my hand, and its recommendations as to
what will be needed in capital expansion to
take care of an expected enrolment of 2,200
students is staggering. At the present time
the enrolment is 1,286, of which 65 per cent
only is from New Brunswick, the balance
being from all over the world. The list is impressive. The students come from: New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Prince
82719-20

Edward Island, Newfoundland, Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia,
North West Territories, the United States,
the British West Indies, Great Britain, British
Guiana, Eire, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Formosa,
Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Brazil, Holland, the
Antilles, France, Germany,
Netherlands
Greece, Italy, Indonesia, Lebanon, Nigeria and
India.
Honourable senators, surely I have said
enough to show that the University of New
Brunswick and similar institutions are no
longer provincial but national and, as such,
have a claim on the dominion treasury.
My honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is doubtful of
the efficiency of the machinery which is being
set up to administer this fund. I do not like
to disagree with my honourable friend, for
he is the greatest artist among us. If anyone
doubts my words, let him pay a visit to my
friend's studio and see the works of art which
he has created. If the Right Honourable Sir
Winston Churchill, as a British statesman,
has won renown as a landscape painter, then
my honourable friend, as a Canadian statesman, is in the front rank as a portrait painter.
However, in this instance, like my honourable
friend from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot) on another occasion, I shall have to
enjoy the luxury of disagreeing with the
senator from Toronto-Trinity. This legislation is based on the pattern which has been
tried and proven in England. There the
Arts Council, appointed by the Government,
supplements the work of local and voluntary
associations by bestowing government grants.
It is interesting to note that in the report of
the council for 1953-1954 they made this
statement:
If half a million pounds of the public money
now invested annually, by the Arts Council and
local authorities, in opera, ballet, theatre and
music were withdrawn, nearly ail the national
institutions of music and drama in this country
would have to close down. Convent Garden, Sadler's
Wells and the Old Vic would be "dark"; such
famous orchestras as the Halle, Liverpool Philharmonic, Yorkshire Symphony, City of Birmingham,
London Philharmonic and Scottish National would
forthwith be disbanded. Every single body receiving a grant from the Arts Council, whether it be
the Royal Opera House or a modest music society
in a small village, is wholly self-governing in all

its affairs.
This is the principle which has been
affirmed by Lord Beveridge, the father of
social insurance, after a lifetime of study,
that goverment grants alone are not sufficient,
but that room, opportunity and encouragement must be kept for voluntary action in
seeking new ways of social advance. Fruitful
co-operation between public authorities and
voluntary agencies-that is the important
thing! And, that is what I would look to the
Canada Council to promote.

SENATE
My honourable friend from TorontoTrinity suggests there is a danger that irresponsible men may be appointed to the council.
I do not think "irresponsible" is the right
word. I have for about fifteen years been a
member of a committee charged with the
responsibility of administering university
entrance scholarships and overseas scholarships donated by Lord Beaverbrook. All are
very valuable. Last fall, I recall, we had 115
applications for 15 scholarships. The members
of that committee have over those years given
of their best most conscientiously and zealously, using every possible yardstick of fairness and justice in an attempt to carry out
the terms of the trust to which we the members were committed. No group of men could
have been more meticulous in their care to
see that the best interests of all were served
in the selection of applicants for scholarships.
I think of the Canada Council as being composed of the same calibre of men, and I feel
satisfied that they will carry out, in an
acceptable manner, the trust committed to
them.
Last fall, at the University of New Brunswick, it was imperative to find living quarters for our students. The residence was
full, and appeals to the householders of
Fredericton revealed that every available
place was occupied. Our Chancellor, Lord
Beaverbrook, made an appeal to the citizens
of the province for money to start the first
wing of an additional men's residence. That
great philanthropist of Montreal, Mr. J. W.
McConnell, started the fund with $100,000; the
Province of New Brunswick followed suit;
and cities and towns, municipalities, corporations and individuals responded so generously to the Chancellor's appeal that over
$400,000 was subscribed and the building
became a reality.
I have no hesitation in supporting this
legislation. I think it is sound and progressive. If the response of the citizens of
New Brunswick to the appeal of Lord
Beaverbrook last fall for funds to erect a
students' residence at the University of New
Brunswick is any indication of how they feel
about education, I believe they would support this legislation too.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators,
it is with some hesitation that I follow the
honourable senator from NorthumberlandMiramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill), because of
the excellence of his speech and the manner
in which he has discussed the subject before
the bouse. I do not intend to engage your
attention for very long, but I did feel that
there were several things which I should
say in this debate; and I might add that I
am saying them because I think that what I
have to say will interest the people in my

province-more perhaps than those who live
in other parts of Canada.
I think it is fitting, honourable senators,
that we should be discussing the bill at the
present time. This is education week, and
here are we in the Senate talking about
education. I am reminded of a slogan in
common use some years ago, that "education
is everybody's business". Well, we are
making it our business here tonight, and at
the same time reminding ourselves and
others that education is everybody's business
every day.
Unlike the honourable senator from Northumberland-Miramichi, I do not intend to
refer to what has been said previously in
the debate. There have been some opinions
expressed with which I cannot agree and
others with which I am in accord. In any
case I respect those who hold views divergent
from my own.
I am glad to note that in the other place,
when this bill was being discussed, no real
difference of opinion developed among the
major parties on the principle of the legislation. The Government supporters were joined
by members of the official Opposition and the
C.C.F. party in endorsing the setting up of
the Canada Council. I believe it is also noteworthy that for several years members of the
official Opposition in the other place have
been in the forefront of those pressing the
Government to adopt the recommendation of
the Massey Commission and bring forward
legislation to set up the Canada Council.
I do not believe that at this point in the
debate it is necessary for me to review the
contents of the bill, but for the purpose of
what I am going to say in a moment I should
like to point out that it provides that allocation of the funds shall be made in a manner
that takes that allocation out of politics, and
removes the fear of the possibility of political
control of the arts and cultural activities.
The bill provides that the membership of
the council will be constantly changing. It
provides for an annual report to Parliament,
so that we may make an examination of its
activities. In connection with the setting up
the council, the provision of funds does not
constitute a continuing budgetary requirement. In my opinion, all this adds up to good
legislation.
It has been mentioned before, but may I
repeat, that due to the receipt of unforeseen
succession duties from two very large estates,
the Government has been able to provide $100
million for the purposes of the council. Of
this sum, $50 million is provided for allocation to universities and colleges to assist them
in their future construction programs. In
addition, $50 million is to be held by the

MARCH 5, 1957
council as an endowment fund, the income
only to be used to encourage the arts, humanities and social sciences. That is to say, about
$2 million per annum will be available for
this purpose.
There have been distorted conclusions expressed, though not in this chamber, concerning the effects of this bill, and I am sure
some misconception and misunderstanding
exists because instances have been reported
to me as emanating from people in my own
province.
It has been said outside Parliament, and
perhaps it will be repeated with more emphasis during the next few months, and
particularly until the month of June is past,
that we are proposing to spend $100 million of
the people's money to promote the painting of
pretty pictures while other needs of the
Canadian people are not being attended to.
Of course that is nonsense, and completely
untrue. It will be deplorable if such things
are said by responsible people-and such
things are a commentary on the type of person
who would repeat them although knowing
them to be untrue. I might add that as the
spokesmen for the major political parties have
endorsed the proposal of an endowed Canada
Council, no doubt they will dissociate themselves from any within their ranks who would
voice these untruths and distortions.
It occurs to me that Nova Scotians may
be wondering what this bill will do for their
province, and I suppose what I say here will
be applicable to any province in Canada but
in varying degrees, depending on the population of each province. First, in Nova Scotia
a sum estimated at $2 million will be available for the construction programs of our
universities, provided the amount is matched
by contributions from other sources. Here
surely is an opportunity for those who have
had some financial success in the business
world, whether they be Nova Scotians, exNova Scotians, or other Canadians, and who
recognize the contribution made to Canadian
life by our relatively small universities, to
assist in providing these matching amounts.
Here also is a challenge to all alumni to do
something for those universities which have
made such an important contribution to their
personal success in life and to do it at only
a fraction of the cost of providing them with
their education. This may be the time for
many to consider paying a substantial instalment on their personal debt to their Alma
Mater.
Another question that might be asked is,
what can be done with Nova Scotia's share
of the general fund of $50 million to carry on
the work of the council? Not so long ago
someone from another part of Canada was
82719-20

quoted as saying that Nova Scotia was without culture. From the reaction of the press
to that statement, that person now knows of
our college of art, our drama societies, our
symphony orchestra and so on. Here, certainly, is an opportunity, through the activities of the Canada Council, to stimulate and
encourage such culture activities as I have
just mentioned.
There is another field of cultural expression
in this old region of Canada to which, I hope,
the Canada Council will give consideration. I
refer to the field of local history. In this field
great work has been done in recording the
detailed history, the old folk songs and the
true tales of the sea, but it will need assistance if a complete record of the early culture of this part of Canada is to be secured.
The time is fast running out when sources of
original folk songs and sea shanties and
stories of our life on the sea will be available. A great debt of gratitude is owing to
those who, at considerable personal sacrifice
of time and money, have succeeded in recording a part of our early cultural activities, as
well as the details of our history, and have
made such records available for future use.
Such contributions should be encouraged by
the Canada Council in the future.
Now, a word regarding scholarships for
our students. When one recalls the limited
economic opportunities available in the past
in Nova Scotia, it is refreshing to reflect on
the great numbers of our people who have
been able to struggle through our universities. At the same time one cannot reflect
without sadness on how many young men
have tried, but in vain, to secure a college
education. I know of cases where sheer
poverty and hunger have forced them to
abandon their university studies. One man
told me that, during his college days, on his
way from part-time work to his lodging, he
would pause and look in a restaurant window
at the food on display until tears blurred his
vision. Such was his hunger! This man was
ultimately forced to abandon his studies
and enter the business world. Later he settled
in Ontario, where he became an outstanding
success in his second-choice field. He is now
seeing to it that others are enabled to obtain
higher education without having to endure
hunger in the pursuit of it.
This leads me to my final point. I hope
that in setting up scholarships the Canada
Council will give suitable recognition to
talented and brilliant young Canadians, particularly those who should be encouraged
to continue with postgraduate studies. But,
as well, I hope that special recognition will
be given to the financial position of those
students with demonstrated ability and capacity who cannot finish undergraduate studies

SENATE
without assistance in the form of scholarships. Canada's future in the arts, humanities and social sciences will surely suffer
unless the Canada Council sets an example
for others to follow in filling this need of
financial assistance.
Another way in which financial assistance
could be rendered to deserving students is
through the establishment of students' loan
funds. Such loans are now available in most
universities, but the funds do not begin to
meet the need.
In order to establish such
revolving funds which would meet the need
in a substantial measure, the Canada Council
could consider setting up a system of matching grants to universities for this purpose,
so that private individuals would be encouraged to do more than they have done in the
past in this field.
Finally, I am hopeful that this bill to set
up the Canada Council, and the debate on
it, will result in a general public awareness
of the problems of higher education. I trust
too that Canadians will have reason some
day to be proud of the way in which these
problems have been met and that Canada's
cultural activities will keep pace with our
national growth and development in other
fields.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators,-

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I would draw
to the attention of the house the fact that
if the honourable Leader of the Government,
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) speaks now he will
close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I am sure you will agree that it is not necessary for me to make a long address in
closing this debate. The discussion throughout has been on a very high level; all the
speeches have been excellent. Nor has there
been a great difference of opinion. The only
point on which some disagreement has been
expressed is with regard to the method by
which the arts, humanities and social sciences
should be developed. It is not my recollection that any honourable senator wishes to
leave the impression that he was adverse to
the main purposes of the bill. So, I repeat,
the discussion has been maintained on a very
high plane, as it should be when the subjects
dealt with are music, drama, painting, literature-things of lasting and abiding value,
not the fleeting pursuits which occupy the
minds of men from day to day.
I have been very pleased, as I am sure all
honourable senators have been, with the tone
of the debate. It is not my intention to
comment individually on these admirable
addresses, but if time permitted I would be

pleased to do so and to congratulate in turn
each honourable member who bas spoken.
While no one bas questioned the value
of the arts, the humanities and the social
sciences, one honourable senator expressed
the opinion that financial aid should not be
extended under the bill to the social sciences.
I do not know why be took that stand, since
be approves of assistance in the proper direction to the arts and the humanities. I understand the term "social sciences" to mean the
study of anthropology, economics, geography,
law, political science, psychology, sociology
and related subjects. Why they should be
excluded from the purview of the bill I do
not know.
This evening the honourable senator who
preceded me referred to the fact that we have
in our midst an artist of unusual ability.
Any honourable senator who doubts this, he
said, should go to the office of the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and see his work. Now I would like
to add an invitation to all honourable members to come to my office after we rise this
evening and see the portrait which the
honourable gentleman made of a very difficult
subject. I refer to the painting he did of me.
It is indeed an excellent portrait. Incidentally, I did not have even one sitting for it.
In fact, I did not know it was being done,
and one day my honourable friend asked me
into his office to see something. I walked in
and stood for a while admiring a landscape,
and when I turned around I was face to face
with a portrait of myself. I hope all honourable senators will come into my office this
evening, or on the earliest occasion afterwards, and see this excellent work of art.
And may I take this opportunity of expressing publicly the thanks that I have
already expressed privately to the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
it was suggested at one time during this
debate that the Government was endeavouring to introduce something new into the
educational life of Canada. Well, I tried to
make it abundantly clear when I introduced
this bill that it did not create anything new.
I endeavoured to leave the impression that
since the development of this country began
our people, through our universities, have
been very successful in developing the arts,
humanities and social sciences. This bill,
therefore, will not create anything new; it
will merely encourage this development.
May I read a portion of the speech I made
when moving the second reading of this bill?
I said:
Honourable senators will therefore appreciate that
the purpose of this bill is not to create in Canada

MARCH 5, 1957
some new or strange or hitherto unexplored field
of human endeavour. It is designed to give some
measure of effective encouragement to things whieh
the Canadian people have already shown through
successive generations that they believe to be of
lasting value.

I repeat tonight that the purpose of this
bill is to encourage rather than to create
anything new in the development of the arts,
humanities and social sciences.
I think I can safely say the only objection
may be to the method by which this encouragement is being given. It has been
suggested that the distribution of the money
should be made by the provinces. This
money is being contributed, as an honourable
senator has said earlier this evening, to help
all universities in Canada. It is a national
effort and not a provincial one. The reason
why the Council is being set up to administer
these funds, rather than having them administered by provincial Governments, is to
keep the matter away from politics. It is
hoped that the Canada Council will be far
removed from the political scene. The Council
will not be responsible to the Government,
and it will only be responsible to Parliament in that it will have to give an annual
report of its expenditures to Parliament.
I do not believe any honourable senator
would suggest that universities do not need
assistance. In this -connection may I refer
to a resolution which was unanimously
passed during a national conference on
"Canada's Crisis in Higher Education", which
was held in Ottawa last November. In this
resolution the conference expressed:
Their considered opinion that it was their urgent
duty to warn the people of Canada that the problem
of universities has become an emergency of national
concern to the certain disadvantage of our progress
and standing as a nation, and can only be solved
by the energetic and immediate assistance and
co-operation of all governments in Canada, of
business and industry and of private benefactors.

Honourable senators, that sets forth my
view as to the necessity of this Council. I
would emphasize that statement that the
problem "can only be solved by the energetic
and immediate assistance and co-operation
of all governments in Canada, of business
and industry and of private benefactors."
It will be recalled that this bill provides
for an outright contribution of $50 million
to be distributed to the universities in
Canada by this organization. The other $50
million is set up as an- endowment fund. It
is not an annual grant whi-ch must be spent
in any one fiscal year, but it is hoped that
the fund will not remain at $50 million.
Governments, business and individuals have
been invited to contribute to the fund so that
a sum vastly in excess of $50 million may be
established. The money will not be used to

assist students in any one college. It has
been suggested that the money should be
distributed in equal parts among the ten
provinces. Well, the fund will be used to
help citizens everywhere in Canada, so that
students from the smallest province will be
eligible to receive the same assistance as
students from the largest province.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The word "humanities"
as it is used here bas rather intrigued me.
How all-embracing is it?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would say that the
word "humanities" is taken to mean the
study of history, literature, foreign languages,
philosophy and related subjects.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Humanities would
include the studies one follows when taking
an arts course at a university. The point I
want to make is that it is wise to have this
$50 million fund, which is designed to assist
Canadian university students irrespective of
where they live, administered by a central
organization such as the Canada Council.
Honourable senators, this is a new venture;
we hope it will be successful and that it will
aid and encourage what has been done so
well in the past; we also hope it will be done
even better in the future. Although there are
differences of opinion as to the method by
which the arts, humanities and social sciences
should be developed, I trust that advantage
will be taken of the opportunity to launch
this new venture, and that the bill will receive the unanimous support of the house.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? I understand that the bill
provided for an advance of $100 million, of
which $50 million is to be an immediate contribution-I suppose without any strings
attached-to the universities; and the remaining $50 million is to be in the. form of
an endowment. Is it proposed that the $50
million grant to the universities is to be an
annual contribution?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No; the $50 nmillion
ends the grant to the universities at least for
the time being. If there is to be a future
grant, this bill would. have to be amended

SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second

Territorial Lands Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
short bill. Perhaps if I read the explanatory
note, which sets forth the purpose of the bill,
it will be the simplest way to follow the
amendment. It reads as follows:
This act refers in sections 15 and 17 to a

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time and passed.
CANADA SHIPPING BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Donald Smith moved the second reading of Bill G, an Act to amend the Canada
Shipping Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple bill, which I think requires a
short and simple explanation.

Under section 493 of the Canada Shipping
Act, which is the penailty section, the owner
or master of any Canadian ship is liable to a
fine for violation of safety regulations made
The term
under this part of the act.
"Canadian ship" is defined in the act as
meaning a ship registered in Canada; therefore, it has been found impossible to prosecute successfully for violation of safety
regulations in cases where the Canadian ship
involved is not registered in Canada.
Section 8 of the act, as amended last year,
provides that ships and yachts not exceeding
15 tons register tonnage are exempted from
registry under the Canada Shipping Act but
a very large number of ships which it was
intended to regulate in so far as safety
measures are concerned cannot be so regulated, because of the wording of the penalty
section.
It is my information that prosecutions
attempted have been unsuccessful, and
Department of Justice officials have advised
that this situation is rightly so. Therefore,
to carry out the intention of the legislation
in the interests of safety it is necessary to
change the expression "any Canadian ship"
to read "any ship".
The word "ship", as defined in the act
"includes every description of vessel used in
navigation not propelled by oars".
The word "vessel", in turn, as defined in
the act, "includes any ship or boat or any
other description of vessel used or designed
to be used in navigation".
Honourable senators, I will leave it to my
lawyer friends in this house to judge whether
the penalty clause will be sufficiently
strengthened by the proposed amendment.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator what is the reason for striking out
the words "Canadian ship" and substituting
"any ship"?
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queen-Shelburne): As I
mentioned in my explanation, the real purpose of the amendment is to change the
wording of the act from "Canadian ship" to
"ship". Under the act "Canadian ship" is
defined as meaning a ship registered in
Canada; whereas the use of the general
term "ship", which includes vessels of all
kinds, whether registered in Canada or not,
would bring all ships within the jurisdiction
of the safety regulations of the Canada
Shipping Act. In the circumstances, it became desirable to ask Parliament to amend
the act to accomplish this purpose.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not quite understand
why a ship which is not registered in Canada
should come within the jurisdiction of the

MARCH 5, 1957

Canada Shipping Act. Would a vessel from
the United States, for instance, become
subject to our regulations?

pleased to hear another honourable senator

SENATE
speak tonight of his native province. This
is my opportunity to speak of my native city.
My association with Windsor is a long and
memorable one. I came there as an infant
immigrant in 1905. Twenty-five years later
the people of that city elected me as their
mayor, and they repeated the performance
many times. They also elected me to the
Ontario Legislature, and repeated that performance. I left Windsor in 1939, when I
joined the army, and I did not return there
after the war. I now live in Toronto, and
spend the required time in Ottawa, but my
"heart belongs to Windsor". For me, the
citizens of Windsor are a people apart. I
shall always feel grateful to them for the
doors of opportunity which they opened for
me.
This bill seeks to establish the Windsor
Harbour Commission in the same way as
Parliament bas on other occasions established
harbour commissions in Toronto, Hamilton,
Belleville, Trenton, Winnipeg, New Westminster and other parts of the country. By
this step Windsor is planning for the future.
Situated at the junction of the lower and
upper Great Lakes, the most heavily travelled
waterway in the world, Windsor is in a
position to benefit from the good that will
flow from the St. Lawrence waterway. Business at present in existence and contemplated
cannot be handled with existing facilities.
The port facilities which Windsor needs
will serve the surrounding region and the
Detroit River area. Windsor now bas available land at the waterfront which, if wisely
utilized, can bring great profit, because there
is a lack of waterfront facilities of Detroit,
Cleveland and Toledo.
Aside entirely from these considerations,
the great potential of the Detroit River area
warrants the taking by the city of Windsor
of the necessary steps in order to develop
up-to-date facilities for a real port. This is
an opportunity to fill the vacuum that now
exists in the Windsor area.
The immediate need and purpose of the
bill is to preserve all existing deep-water
frontages available for maritime purposes;
to zone, rehabilitate, acquire, plan to
handle, and benefit from foreign business; to
ensure the orderly development of waterfront property and to assure the availability
of suitable property for harbour development
in the future. Even now, as I have indicated,
there is a lack of facilities. The port of
Windsor bas a great economic potential. To do
nothing now would be to lose a very great
opportunity.
With the opening of the St. Lawrence
waterway there will be in our country a
revolution in transportation and trade patterns that will be felt not only in Montreal,

Toronto and Fort William, but Windsor-and
Windsor wants to benefit from it.
The port at Windsor will serve an area
having a radius of about 25 miles and a
present population of 250,000.
I have the 1956 figures for the movement
of ships in and out of the port of Windsor,
and I believe they will be of interest: there
were 720 ships which picked up or discharged
cargo, an increase of 105 over the previous
year. Of those, 530 were Canadian ships.
This project was originally sponsored by
the very active Junior Chamber of Commerce
and later adopted by the City Council. A
committee was established, and some waterfront land bas already been acquired. A study
made by competent people indicated that
benefits would fiow from the development, and
in their report, they enumerated them as
follows:
1. Lower consumer costs reflected from
lower freight costs on import and export
products.
2. A direct benefit to the community from
a new major industry.
3. Direct and indirect benefit from attracting new secondary industries.
Windsor has one of the finest waterfronts
anywhere and wants to benefit from it, and
so asks support for this bill.
I cannot pass up the opportunity to associate with this project the name of a
man who is known to many in this bouse, the
late Oscar Fleming. He was the originator
of the concept of the St. Lawrence waterway
and was the first president of the association
made up of municipal representatives, Board
of Trade and other forward-looking citizens
to further its development. He did not live
to see its fruition, but I am pleased to recall
and to record his devoted and public spirited
efforts made in another day and in another
generation.
So, honourable senators, I ask your support for this bill. Undoubtedly you will
want it to be sent to the appropriate
committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would like to ask my
honourable friend a question. Why are some
harbours, like that of Vancouver, under the
control of the National Harbours Board while
other cities have harbour commissions of
their own?
Hon. Mr. Croll: The honourable senator is
perhaps better able to answer that question
than I am. I suppose the National Harbours
Board is primarily concerned with harbour
facilities for international traffic.
Hon. Mr. Farris: New Westminster has its
own harbour commission.

MARCH 5, 1957
Hon. Mr. Croll: New Westminster is not
in the class of Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, New
Westminster is the only city in Canada that
spent its own money-$500,000-to build its
own wharves. That in part explains the
reason why the harbour in that city was not
placed under control of the National Harbours
Board. I demanded that the Minister of
Trade and Commerce pay back that $500,000
to the City of New Westminster and take the
harbour into the National Harbours Board
set-up; but that amount was not paid, and
the New Westminster harbour was left out
of that organization. It is pretty well pleased
with the arrangement.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, since
we are in more or less of an atmosphere of
personal reminiscences in connection with
this bill I have to take issue with one statement made by my friend from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Crohl), that the agitation
for the development of the great waterway
on the St. Lawrence originated in Windsor.
My recollection is that the man who initiated
the subject was D. B. Detweiler, of Kitchener,
Ontario, the father of hydro-electric power
development in Ontario, later taken up by
Sir Adam Beck. I can well recall that the
first meeting in connection with the advancement of the great project on the St. Lawrence
River was held in Kitchener, and that I, as
mayor of the city, presided.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I bow to the superior
knowledge and information of my honourable friend from Waterloo. Although I recollect the name of Detweiler, in my earlier
days I associated the development with Oscar
Fleming of Windsor. I stand corrected.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): Honourable senators, it is obvious that, under this
bill, the Windsor Harbour Commissioners will
be completely outside the jurisdiction of the
National Harbours Board. That means that
the commission is in a position to compete
with any and all of the harbours in Canada
which are under the control of the board,
while those harbours, by virtue of the national tie-up, are precluded from entering into
competition with any other harbour. Is that
not so?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Certainly. The purpose of
the bill is stated on the first page, and it
was introduced after consultation with the
Minister of Transport and the Government,
by whom al these matters were taken into
consideration.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Section 5 states that the
corporation shal consist of three commissioners, "one of whom shall be appointed

by the Council of the City of Windsor". By
section 6 it is provided that "no member of
the Council of the City of Windsor is eligible
to be a commissioner". There seems to be
a direct contradiction here.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Oh, no. For instance, if I
were living in Windsor and the council were
looking for a fine young man to appoint as
commissioner, perhaps they would appoint
me, but not if I were a member of the council.
No member of the Windsor City Council is
eligible for appointment, and that provision,
I think, is quite proper.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Croll, the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
PRIVATE BILL
NORTH WATERLOO FARMERS MUTUAL
INSURANCE COMPANY-SECOND
READING

Hon. W. D. Euler moved the second reading
of Bill W-7, an Act to incorporate The North
Waterloo Farmers Mutual Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
brought on behalf of The North Waterloo
Farmers Mutual Insurance Company, whose
head office is in the city of Waterloo, and is,
I am informed, the oldest-and it certainly
is the largest-insurance company of its
kind in Ontario, and probably in the dominion

time, is of very fine repute, and is financially
and in every other way responsible. I am
personally acquainted with the president of
the company, a man of the good old Mennonite Pennsylvania Dutch extraction, named
Shantz, and-since we have had some personal reminiscences here tonight, I may express the hope that neither he as president
nor the company itself is prejudiced by the
fact that he was at one time a pupil of mine.
The company has been operating for many
years under provincial charter. It now desires federal incorporation in order to extend
its field to operations other than fire insurance, and to gain certain powers which
under the provincial charter are not available. Perhaps the chief reason for asking
for the new powers, which are listed in
section 4, is that most of the companies writing fire insurance, and also engaging in
accident, aircraft, automobile and other kinds
of insurance, are now issuing, and have done
so for two or three years, what is known
as a composite policy-a type probably well
known to members of this house-under

SENATE

which they can issue one single policy to
cover a number of risks, and with the added
advantage to the insured of reducing his
premium as much as 10 per cent. Since this
company has been limited to the issue of fire
policies it cannot issue composite policies, and
it is therefore greatly handicapped in competition with those who are able to make
such contracts. That, as I have already
indicated, is one of the reasons why it seeks
the power to make contracts of insurance in
all the branches which are mentioned on
page 2 of the bill.
There is also provision in the bill for the
elimination from the title of the word "fire",
so that the company shall be called "The
North Waterloo Farmers Mutual Insurance
Company". The reason is that if the word
"fire" alone is mentioned, the inference may
be that is the only class of insurance in which
it can deal.
Mr. MacGregor, the Superintendent of
Insurance, has discussed the bill with officials
of the company, and informs me that, far
from having any objection, he is quite in
favour of it.
If the bill should receive second reading
I shall move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, before whom officials of the company
will attend to answer any questions it may be
desired to ask them.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

EASTERN ROCKY MOUNTAIN FOREST
CONSERVATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. James A. MacKinnon moved the
second reading of Bill X-7, an Act to amend
the Eastern Rocky Mountain Forest Conservation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Eastern
Rocky Mountain Forest Conservation Act,
which was passed in 1947, confirmed an agreement with the Province of Alberta whereby

federal assistance would be extended to
capital and maintenance works on the eastern
slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta.
The act established the Eastern Rockies
Forest Conservation Board to administer the
eastern slopes area defined in the agreement.
The chairman and one member were appointed by the federal Government, and one
member was appointed by the provincial
Government.
The purpose and function of the board is
to construct all projects and facilities required
to protect the forests of the eastern slopes
area from fire, insects and disease, and to
conserve, develop, maintain and manage the
forests with a view to obtaining the greatest
possible flow of water in the Saskatchewan
River and its tributaries.
The federal interest in this work rested
in the immense importance to all the Prairie
provinces and to Canada generally of the
waters flowing from the eastern slopes area
located in the province of Alberta.
The act and agreement provided for the
federal Government paying $6,300,000 toward
capital expenditures required. This was paid
out over a period of about seven years-from
1948 to 1955-as work progressed. The act
and agreement also provided for federal contributions toward maintenance costs, with
provision for reduction of this contribution
as revenues from the operations of the board
rose above certain levels. The board has
continued its work since 1947 to the satisfaction of both governments concerned.
In 1952 an amendment to the act was
passed, approving the revision in the original
agreement. The revised agreement provided
for increased annual expenditures by the
board on maintenance programs, and, as the
revenues had risen substantially, also provided
for discontinuance of federal contributions
towards maintenance.
As Alberta was thereby agreeing to cover
all maintenance costs, and as the federal
capital contributions were almost completed,
the act further provided that in future the
province would appoint two members and
choose the chairman, and the federal Government would appoint one member.
In
practice, Major General Howard Kennedy,
who has been chairman of the board since its
inception, continued as federal member after
the passage of this amendment and, with the
approval of the province, he also continued
as chairman.
The amendments now proposed are of a
simple nature. The first change is to authorize the official audit of the board's expenditures to be made by the Provincial Auditor
rather than by the Auditor General of
Canada. As all maintenance costs are borne

MARCH 5, 1957
by the provincial Government of Alberta,
and as Canada's capital contributions have
been completed, this is a logical change.
The original agreement and the amendment of 1952 both set certain limitations on
the maintenance program with the intention
of ensuring that a program of reasonable
size was carried out. By the 1952 amendment the province was limited in its maintenance expenditures to $450,000 per annum.
Mainly because of statutory salary increases,
the province's maintenance budget for 1957-58
will, of necessity, exceed $450,000. This is
the reason for the urgent necessity of legislation this year. It is now considered that
the board's work has reached the stage where
no specific limitations should be imposed,
particularly in view of the fact that the
province is entirely responsible for maintenance costs. The second change in the amendment now being proposed would remove
these limitations.
A third change deals with fire-fighting
costs. The original agreement provided that
if the board's forest fire-fighting costs exceeded $10,000 in any one year, the excess
would be borne on an equal share basis by
Both the federal
the two governments.
Government and Alberta agree that this provision should be eliminated in view of the
recent offer under the Canada Forestry Act
of federal assistance to all provinces in forest
fire protection. The proposed amendment
would delete this provision which is out of
line with, and, to some extent, duplicates the
new federal offer.
The last change proposed is in section
20(b) of the original agreement. This subsection provided that all property of the
board apart from improvements, works and
land would belong to the federal Government
on the expiration of the agreement. As the
agreement does not expire until at least 1973,
and the federal capital contributions ended in
1955, all items covered by the subsection and
towards which federal contributions had
been made would almost certainly have depreciated to the point where they were
almost valueless.
As the board's work will be a continuing
provincial responsibility, it seems reasonable
to amend the subsection to provide that the
items in question should belong to the province on the expiration of the agreement.
Honourable senators, I have outlined the
simple amendments contained in this bill,
and in preparing this explanation I endeavoured to anticipate any questions which
might be asked on this matter. I do not see
any necessity for referring this bill to
committee.

Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I hope that these proposed changes will not
in any way limit certain activities which
have taken place in recent years on the east
slope of the Rockies. It is more important
than ever that the water flowing from these
slopes be preserved. There are a million
acres under irrigation now out there, and
another two million acres might be under
the ditch and be suitable for irrigation.
A few years ago before this commission
started its work the forests in that region
were partially destroyed by fire and insects,
and the cutting of timber did not help matters. All this had its effect on the surface
soil, which was no longer able to hold the
water to any extent. In the springtime the
flood waters came down heavily from the
eastern slope of the Rockies, but during the
remainder of the year the flow was limited.
With a new forest growth this bed of soil
is being built up again and is better able
to hold the water. This has resulted in a
more constant flow of water supply for the
large reservoirs which control irrigation.
I hope the amendments proposed in this
bill will not in any way limit the watchfulness or the good work which has taken place
to check the water flow for the irrigation
system which is so badly needed in that
country.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I agree that it should not be necessary to
send this bill to committee. However, I
should like to emphasize, as did the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw), that the care which has been
exercised recently should in no way be diminished. I know of no more important area
in Canada than the eastern slopes of the
Rockies, which requires conservation of timber for the purpose of conserving water. I
believe there is no area in Canada where
timber growth is so rapid. The Government
of Alberta should be very careful to see that
timber is not cut down to the extent that
it has been in the past. Of course, the help
given jointly in the past was for the purpose
of building roads, to make difficult places
accessible for flre-fighting equipment, and
that sort of thing. The honourable senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) has
explained that these changes were bound to
come about. For that reason, I do not think
it is necessary to send the bill to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the honour.
able senator from Edmonton how much timber is involved in the area?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Honourable senators,
I have a map of the Eastern Rocky Mountain
Forest Conservation area before me.
I
familiarized myself with the number of square

SENATE
miles in the area, but I do not have the
figures of the amount of timber standing.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: How many square miles
are involved?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: I have not the exact
number of square miles; but it covers a very
large area, running from a limit southeast
of Edmonton pretty well down to the south
of the province.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And to a depth right
ba.ck to Jasper; it is an immense area.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Yes, it is an immense
area.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I understand that the
ownership of that large area of land is not
being abandoned by the Province of Alberta?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: It belongs to the
province of Alberta.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Is it under the administration of the Canadian Government?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: It is under the administration of a committee which at the present
time consists of two members appointed by
the Province of Alberta and one member
appointed by the federal Government. The
dominion member has been appointed chairman with the consent of the province. I was
glad to hear the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) mention
that this committee has done excellent work,
for I know that he is familiar with the
district.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable senator
who sponsored this bill (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon)
attempted to answer two questions in
advance. I fancy he did not take into
account the lack of knowledge of people like
myself who are not familiar with this
locality. I should like to have a little
further information.
I understood the
honourable senator to say that the dominion
Government has invested some $6 million?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: $6,300,000.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you. I suppose
that amount is in plant of some kind. At all
events, there may be continuing assets. Is
there any revenue to be derived by the board
from these assets?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: These are continuing
assets; they consist largely of roads. As I
mentioned, there are substantial and increasing revenues.
Perhaps I should explain that this proposed legislation was due, in the first place,
to the anxiety of the people of Manitoba land
Saskatchewan to see that nothing would be
allowed to interfere with the eastern slope,
the headwaters of the Saskatchewan River

system, consisting of the North and South
Saskatchewan Rivers land tributaries. It is for
that reason that the dominion Government
enters into this project with the province of
Alberta, which owns the land and has administered the territory.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then there are continuing revenues to which the dominion
Government has contributed by way of this
$6 million for grants?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Well, there are no
revenues directly from the dominion Government's contribution. The dominion contribution has made possible revenues to the commission which is carrying on this work under
the committee that has been in charge of
the work and has done a splendid job.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Are the expenditures
more than the revenues?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: At the time the
organization was formed there was anxiety in
the province of Alberta, which of course was
not as wealthy as it is today, that the maintenance charges would become too great a
burden on them, and the province asked that
there be a ceiling on the maintenance charges.
Now, the reason for this proposed legislation
is that the maintenance charges are getting
above the ceiling that was agreed upon at
that time, and in order to enable the
province to make the larger expenditures it
is asking that the ceiling be removed.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? Am I to understand that
the respective interests of the provinces of
Manitoba and Saskatchewan in conservation
of water and water control will continue to
be protected by the continued interest of the
federal Government through one member
of this board in the future, who may or may
not continue to be the chairman of the board?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: It will be the duty
of the chairman of the board to see that
the interests of the dominion Government
are fully protected. Major General Howard
Kennedy tas been chairman of the board since
its inception, and his services are highly acceptable to the Province of Alberta. Provision
has been made to enable another federal
official to act in the absence of Major General
Kennedy.
Hon. Mr. Wall: And will that person be
the next chairman?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Not necessarily so.
Hon. Mr. Wall: The bill contains no guarantee that the national representative would
continue to be chairman.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: There is no thought
of that being necessary.

MARCH 5. 1957
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
am wondering why several senators have
remarked that it is unnecessary to send this
bill to a committee. This seems to me to
be a decidedly complicated bill, which involves a subject which has a history behind
it and a future ahead of it. The measure
has certain remarkable features. For instance, it involves the investment of a large
sum of money from the federal treasury, and
it contributes in some degree to continuing
revenues. The bill also involves the withdrawal of the supervision of the Auditor
General, and the transfer of his duties to
the provincial authority. Further, the bill
would apparently transfer in 1975 certain
federal assets to the provinces. If the bill
passes, those assets-and there will be some
value attached to them-will eventually pass
to the province.
I am not criticizing this proposed legislation. I am merely pointing out that the

bill contains some remarkable and far-reaching provisions, and certain proposals are
somewhat obscure. It involves an agreement
which none of us have seen. Therefore, I
do not think the measure should be passed
over lightly with as little understanding as I,
at least, have of it. I would suggest that
it be referred to committee.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: I have no objection
to its being referred to committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. MacKinnon, the
bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Natural Resources.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

MARCH 5, 1957
has been dedicated to the same cause and
your name has become associated with the
momentous decisions which have led to the
establishment of new relationships between
your country and important North African
peoples. You are one of the promoters of
the renewed and determined attempt which
is now being made to reorganize Europe, that
great, that unique reservoir of experience
which free men throughout the world have
come to consider as part of their heritage and
which has played such a vital role in the
expansion of civilization.
The success of your several endeavours is
a matter of direct interest to us. We hope
that this great effort in political reconstruction will result in a further strengthening of
our Atlantic community and of the free
world generally.
Your visit, Mr. Prime Minister, gives us
a welcome opportunity to pay tribute to the
dynamic role which you, personally, and
your country are playing in the affairs of
the world. The conversations which we have
had during the last few days have also made
it possible for us to gain a better understanding of our mutual objectives and policies. In this fashion, your visit will affirm
once again the close bonds which unite our
countries and provide an illustration of the
relationship which common endeavours within the Atlantic family can promote between
Europe and North America for the lasting
benefit of the whole free world.
Your Excellencies, Members of Parliament,
and distinguished guests, it is my privilege
now to invite Monsieur Guy Mollet, the
Prime Minister of France, to address you.
(Translation):
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour
to introduce to you the President of the
Council of the French Republic.
(Translation continued):
Mr. Guy Mollet
(Prime Minister of
France): Mr. Prime Minister, the words which
you have addressed, with so much sincerity
and sympathy, to my country have touched
me profoundly and they will go right to the
heart of the French people. You have expressed in these words, on such an elevated
plane of thought, the significance of my visit
here and the nature of the relations, so
intimate and direct, which have never ceased
to exist between France and Canada
since the beginning of your country's history.
For all this I should like to offer my warmest
thanks, and also for the remerks, so full of
friendship, which you have directed to me
personally. No token of esteem could be
more precious to me.

Mr. Speaker, members of the Houses of
Parliament, it is a very great honour for me
to be able to transmit today to the honourable members of the Parliament of Canada
the message of warm friendship which my
country bas asked me to deliver. I should
like to do it at this time with all my heart
and all my conviction. During these much
too brief days which I have spent in your
country, I have felt, profoundly, the rare
quality
of Franco-Canadian
friendship,
the strength of the bonds between us
tightened by the battles we have fought side
by side during two world wars. In the invitation which you addressed to me I saw a
new manifestation of this friendship and I
was proud to accept.
In recalling some of the great tasks undertaken by France, Mr. St. Laurent himself
prompted me to tell you, in a few words,
something of the achievements of French
policy, something of our worries and concerns
which, I know, are often much the same as
your own.
To achieve the unification of Europe is
one of our main objectives. I have striven
to establish it upon a solid Franco-German
entente, and I have felt a similar determination in Chancellor Adenauer and in the
German Government. We were thus able to
reach an equitable solution of the problems
which had long made relations so difficult
between our two countries. Today FrancoGerman rivalry no longer exists; there is
instead a confident co-operation which permits the establishment of ever closer ties.
With the way thus open to a needed
European Union, we have been able to make
decisive progress in the economic integration
of the continent, in bringing to successful
conclusion the treaties which will establish
the European Atomic Community-Euratom-and the Common European Market.
Their signing will take place within a few
weeks.
By Euratom, the six countries of the European continent will pool their atomic destinies. Their atomic industry, the expansion
of which is already very promising, will be
founded immediately on a European basis
and may look forward to launching programs on a scale to which none of them,
by itself, could have aspired. As for the
Common European Market, it is designed to
abolish customs barriers, harmonize social
legislation and co-ordinate economic policies
in a way that will constitute a vast market
of 160 million consumers where the wealth,
the merchandise and the people will circulate
freely.
You can well imagine that the drawing up
of these treaties, which will bind the future

SENATE
of our countries for generations, has been
particularly delicate. I am not unaware that
your country has expressed certain reservations about some of the clauses of the Treaty
of the Common Market. This would not be
the place to discuss the details. But the point
I should like to stress in particular is that,
within a few months, a living and ever developing and expanding reality will have
been created, the European Economic Community, the presence of which will profoundly modify present basic conditions. The
prospects of commercial exchanges with a
united Europe, in full development, will be
radically different from those with our isolated countries and, no doubt, will be greatly
expanded. So I beg you to have confidence in
the dynamism of the new organizations, so
that in their very working and operation the
imperfections you criticize may be corrected.
Europe is the only way for the countries of
that continent to recover true independence.
It is the only way to guarantee a solid and
enduring Atlantic Alliance. The relations between the European and North American
continents can then develop on the basis of
true equality. There is nothing durable in
the world if it is not founded on equality and
on free co-operation.
Beyond the Iron Curtain, the union of the
European peoples will also be a symbol of
hope for all men living under oppression
who have not lost their will to liberty.
Two weeks ago six European prime ministers met in Paris, on the invitation of
France, to take a major decision, that of
associating with Europe the African territories
today linked with Belgium and France.
As soon as it was formed, the European
Community decided to play the card of
Africa. The industrial power of the whole of
Europe will be mobilized to assure the technical equipment and social progress of Africa.
I shall not conceal the fact that this historic
step is largely due to the tenacious insistence
of France.
The decision which I have just recalled is
in line with the new policy that my Government is applying in Africa-a policy which is,
I fear, too little known outside my own
country. Will you permit me to outline it
briefly?
We are making almost revolutionary transformations in our overseas territories. The
peoples are receiving the right to manage
their own affairs democratically within the
framework of union with France, to which
they have freely consented. On March 31
next, this very month, single college elections
will permit the populations of all French
Africa to choose their own representativesin full liberty-in the territorial assemblies,
which will appoint, in turn, the ministers in
charge of administering the territories.

Similar reforms recently led to the creation
of the autonomous Republic of Togo, and
long discussions in the United Nations on this
question have revealed their work and their
democratic nature.
France has refused to make a "closed preserve" of the African territories. That is why
she has opened their doors to Europe, which
will give them their greatest chance. Over the
next five years, the European effort in aid of
Africa will exceed five hundred million dollars, in addition to a French effort which will,
no doubt, exceed two billion dollars.
These figures speak for themselves. They
show our resolve to apply in Africa the only
possible remedy to those accomplices, blind
nationalism and communism: to build a
Eurafrican group, a vast union of free peoples,
efficiently helping one another, to their
mutual benefit and their common prosperity.
[Text]:
I reminded you a little earlier that a
European union would guarantee the consolidation of the Atlantic alliance. This consideration weighed heavily in. our decision
to construct Europe. The Atlantic alliance
is one of the cornerstones of French policy,
as it is of the policy of Canada. I should like
here to pay homage to the eminent role that
the Secretary of State for External Affairs of
Canada, Mr. Lester B. Pearson, has not ceased
to play in all the work of the Atlantic
organization.
Besides its important contribution to the
defence of the North American continent,
your country-and it is not one of the lesser
reasons for our gratitude-has accepted to
take an active part in the defence of the
European continent. To help balance the
enormous mass of Soviet divisions, Canada,
like the United States and Great Britain, has
stationed a part of ber armed forces on the
European peninsula. The presence of your
soldiers on our soil imposes a sacrifice upon
you for which I wish to thank you in the
name of France. It is of exceptional importance to us.
In fact, in 1914, as in 1939, if there had
been some thousands of British, American
and Canadian soldiers in Europe, neither
William II nor Hitler would have gone to war.
They would have known that, from the very
first moment, an immense coalition would be
raised against them. Today, because of the
physical presence of your soldiers and the
British and American soldiers, the Soviet
Union cannot have the slightest doubt about
the consequences to herself of any aggression.
The presence of these soldiers is a type of
"'deterrent" policy of the Atlantic Pact.
The Atlantic alliance seems to me even
more important today than it was eight

MARCH 5, 1957
years ago at the moment of its creation.
Also, it imposes, perhaps more than ever,
a perfect entente among the allied nations
on the stratetgic and tactical planes. It is
necessary that these decisions be taken in
common when it comes to effectives and
armaments, and if technical developments
raise new problems, in this domain, they
must be resolved in common. I insist upon
solemnly recalling these requirements before
you.
I shall say a few words to you now on
a purely French problem but which is such
a grave one for us that I want to tell you
about it personally. It has to do with Algeria.
Your Government in the course of the
debate in the United Nations has accorded
us the loyal and unfailing support which we
have asked of it, and I shall like to express
to it here the thanks of France.
The Algerian problem, unhappily, is too
little known outside of France. In completely good faith, many of our friends think
that our policy is nothing more than
a manifestation of obsolete colonialism. I
shall speak to you quite frankly and quite
directly. In my eyes, what is most essential
in the Algerian affair is not to maintain the
links between Algeria and France. That is
far too much in the interests of Algeria to
be seriously questioned. The aid which
France bas given to Algeria since the Second
World War, to cite only one figure, represents
twice the sum of all the moneys France herself received under the Marshall Plan.
The fundamental element in the Algerian
problem is the presence in the country of
two groups, each distinct from the other,
both important and each indispensable to the
life of the other-1,200,000 Algerians of
European origin on one side and eight
million Moslems on the other.
The Algerians of European origin began to
settle there in 1830. They have their families
in Algeria and they have their dead. Algeria
is their country-their patrie-and, for the
most part, it is their toil which has developed
its resources.They feel like pioneers, and that
that is what they are. It is not acceptable
that they be oppressed or chased out today
by the mass of the Moslems, any more than
it is acceptable that they profit by temporary
economic advantages to oppress the Moslems.
The key to the Algerian problem is to obtain,
at one and the same time, full equality of
rights for all the inhabitants of Algeriaeconomic as well as political rights-and the
co-existence of the group of European origin
and of Moslem origin, without either being
able to oppress the other. The first step
toward any settlement is that violence cease.
Also, France has proposed a "cease-fire"

without any political "strings". To settle the
general conditions, the French Government
is ready to make direct and official contact
with those who are fighting.
Within three months of a return to peace
free, single college elections will be organized.
Each will be able to vote according to his
conscience. We invite the democratic nations
to send their representatives to Algeria so
they may observe the proper procedure of
the vote.
It is with these elected representatives of
Algeria, whatever their political opinions, that
we would discuss the future organization of
Algeria. It will result in the agreement of all
the interested parties, that is to say, the
populations of Algeria and the populations of
France.
This is the contents of the French program
for Algeria. You will agree with me that it
conforms to the principles of democracy. The
play is now to our adversaries. We offer
them a cease-fire. Are they ready to renounce
violence? We propose free elections, held
under the eyes of representatives of the democratic countries, and immediate discussion
with the elected representatives of the Algerian populations. Why have they refused up
to now? France is not discouraged. She will
multiply, tirelessly, the efforts to convince all
the inhabitants of Algeria of ber will to peace
and justice.
You may be surprised that I have not taken
advantage of this political survey to say a
few words to you about another problem,
namely, the situation in the Middle East.
Whatever may have been our disagreements
at one moment, I must underline the positive
character and the extreme usefulness of the
initiatives taken by the Canadian government,
how its interventions, always animated by
the most friendly spirit, have often been
decisive.
An important step has been taken in the
Middle East toward the restoration of an
enduring peace, founded on justice and
respect for international law, which is the
common aim of our countries. France has not
been a stranger to the agreements which have
been made, and I have the right to say that
she has considerably aided in their conclusion.
The retreat of Israel from Gaza and the
straits of Sharm al-Shaikh does not constitute an end. The intervention of the United
Nations Emergency Force makes it possible to
avoid a return, pure and simple, to the
original situation. It is indispensable that
we profit by its presence to conclude a general
peace settlement. A partial or provisional
settlement in the Middle East will always be
a bad solution. Our peoples will not permit
us to allow the situation to deteriorate again

SENATE
as it did in the past eight years when, under
the cover of an armistice, the disorders were
perpetuated and a state of masked warfare
was finally established while, at the same
time, the resolutions passed by the United
Nations were constantly being violated.
We must attack the basic causes of the
tensions in the Middle East. I should like to
enumerate for you some of those which seem
to me to be the principal ones. Some of them
are "geographic" and others are purely
"political".
The first of the "geographic" causes is the
frontiers of Israel and, in fact, the existence
of the state of Israel itself. The conclusion
of a peace treaty between Israel and her
Arab neighbours, fixing her frontiers and
guaranteeing the integrity of her territory, is
an absolute necessity. I am very happy that
the representatives of the great countries expressed their determination in the general
assembly of the United Nations that this
treaty will be interposed as soon as possible.
I am happy that the big nations have declared their insistence that free passage of
ships in the international waters of the gulf
of Aqaba shall be respected.
The Suez Canal is also one of the
"geographic" causes of tension. Its sabotage
by Egypt without any military motive to
justify it, and the blackmail exercised since
then over the pace of clearing and opening
the canal, shows the little confidence merited
by the Government of Egypt. As was stipulated before the Security Council, the Suez
Canal must be "withdrawn from the political
policies of every country" and, in particular,
from that of Egypt. The economic equilibrium of Europe and the countries of Southeast
Asia cannot depend solely on the good will
of a commonplace Egyptian dictator.
Still more vital are the causes which I
have called "political", and it is upon the
attitude which will be taken about them that
will depend the definite settlement of other
problems. I am speaking of the Pan-Arab
manoeuvres of Egypt and the Soviet infiltration of the Middle East.
The Pan-Arab dreams of Colonel Nasser
are defined with brutal clarity in his book,
"The Philosophy of Revolution". He himself
has declared his determination to organize
around a "hero"-that is the way in which he
speaks of himself-a united Arab world
"from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf". In
order to achieve it he plans to utilize, as a
means of pressure on the West, the oil of the
Middle East and the geographic position of his
own country-that is to say, the Suez Canal.
We now know that they were not idle threats.
To denounce Pan-Arabism does not signify
an attack on the Arab world. Pan-Arabism

is not the expression of a people's national
feeling. It is, as Pan-Germanism and PanSlavism have been in the past, a myth in
whose name a people's independence is
attacked.
It is the duty of the free nations to oppose
a united front to the subversive actions of
Pan-Arabism, to see that provocation does
not pay, and that there can be no transactions
whatsoever which do not respect international obligations. Such an attitude is
even more necessary since Pan-Arabism is
the best vehicle for communist infiltration.
Faithful to Lenin's directives, the Soviet
leaders are systematically supporting ultranationalism.
Cairo and Damascus, the
sources of Pan-Arabism, have thus become
the strongest bridgeheads of the U.S.S.R.
From this point of view the declaration of
President Eisenhower assumes great importance. The Soviet Union has been, in the
past, attentive to such warnings. I shall add
that any split in the united front of the free
nations, in the Middle East, will be exploited
by the Soviet Union. It is therefore our duty
to put into effect in this part of the world a
concerted, long-range policy.
That is what I have expressed to the Canadian Government, as well as to the President
of the United States, and I believe-let me say
I am sure-that my visits will have favoured
the first steps.
(Translation):

The problems of which I have been speaking to you have been, as you may imagine,
the object of thorough discussions with the
Prime Minister of Canada. I was pleased to
note the large area of agreement between us.
I am certain that in these next weeks France
and Canada will find themselves side by side
in the international meetings, in common
defence of the same causes and in seeking
solutions in harmony with law and justice.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Prime Minister, members
of the Houses of Parliament, in a few hours
my friend Mr. Pineau, our assistants and myself will be leaving your magnificent country.
The memory of the hours we have spent in it,
the memory of the simplicity and fraternal
warmth of your welcome, will remain with
us. I shall take testimony of it to the French
people. I shall tell them that, in dark days
and fair, they can rely on the friendship and
the support of this great people in full
expansion.
To you, also, I should like to say that you
may rely on the French people and on the
youth of France. By their labour they have
overcome the destruction of the war, they
have confidence in the future of their country,
they are ready to face the challenging tasks

MARCH 5, 1957
which lie before them-the construction of
Europe, the development of the Sahara, the
building of Eurafrica. Yes, at your side, in
all just and generous undertakings, you will
always find "la France éternelle".
(Text):
Hon. Arthur L. Beaubien (Acting Speaker
of the Senate): May I, monsieur le Président
du Conseil de France, on behalf of the
Senate of Canada, thank you for your
visit and for the eloquent and inspiring
address which you have just delivered. It is
always a pleasure to welcome the leaders
of great nations with whom we have had so
many memorable associations. It is particularly so as we welcome you, sir, as the
eminent representative of a people to whom
so many Canadians trace back their racial
origin. We are happy and gratified to have
been able, in Canada, to demonstrate that
peoples of different racial origins can live
together in peace and harmony.
May we respectfully ask you to convey our
greetings to the members of your Conseil de
la République and of your National Assembly.
(Translation):
Mr. President of the French Council of
Ministers, you are doing us a great honour
and giving us great pleasure in visiting us
today, and we sincerely hope that you may
come back soon.
(Text):
In wishing you Godspeed, we pray Divine
Providence to bless all your endeavours.
(Translation):
Hon. L. René Beaudoin (Speaker of the
House of Coimons): Mr. President of the
Council, the Canadian House of Commons
joins the Senate in greeting you as the
representative of the glorious French nation
and in extending its most cordial welcome
on behalf of the people of Canada. We are
also happy to greet at the same time Mr.
Christian Pineau, your Minister of Foreign
Affairs, and His Excellency Mr. Francis
Lacoste, Ambassador of France to Canada.
Our century is overburdened with problems
whose solution must logically be entrusted to
exceptionally gifted leaders. Each international crisis is a test for the initiative and

courage of a few outstanding men who must
be able to overcome all obstacles. We are
pleased to note, Mr. President of the Council,
that your name bas already a place in the
history of contemporary diplomacy, and
Canadian parliamentarians-more especially
those whose language is French and who look
upon France as their mother country-are
particularly proud of the important part you
are playing on the international scene in
order to ensure the triumph of justice, to
guarantee universal peace and defend democratic principles.
Your visit will serve to strengthen the spirit
of co-operation and solidarity which bas
long characterized the relations between
Canada and civilizing France, the France
which has always upheld the cause of the
noblest liberties.
(Text):
In April 1951 this Parliament had the great
honour of welcoming Mr. Vincent Auriol, the
then President of the French Republic. On
that occasion, Mr. Auriol brought the affectionate message of France to this very Hill,
which he called "the meeting place of forces
young and eager, English and French, the
union of which bas created this nation, thus
constituting an immense human treasure for
the future."
And he added, "Sons of the British Isles,
Sons of France, what a magnificent example
you are giving to the world, what a long path
you have travelled together!"
In welcoming you today, and after listening to your eloquent address, we could not
but recall those complimentary remarks
which, like your own words, filled us
with emotion and pride.
Life bas a habit of repeating itself and, for
this reason, we hope that we have remained
worthy of, and still possess, the virtues inherited from our British and our French
ancestors.
(Translation):
Mr. President of the Council, your visit
is indeed very gratifying to us. It affords
us a further opportunity to proclaim the
heartfelt friendship of all Canadians for
France, and we continue to pay homage to
the mission which ideals have clearly
assigned to her.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There has been no

custom, when a bill is reported without amendment, to pass it the same day, if the house
agrees. I have no objection to having the
third reading stand until tomorrow.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: If the work of the house
is so pressing, I have no objection to third
reading today-if the honourable Leader of
the Government desires to push the bill
through.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My friend is mistaken: the leader has no desire whatever to
give the bill third reading today. An honourable senator moved that it should have third
reading, and I did not oppose it, but if there
is an objection to immediate reading I would
support the objection.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is there a rule covering this
point?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, there is the rule
that the two stages of adoption of a committee's report on a bill, and the third reading,
cannot be taken on the same day. But I repeat that if a bill is reported from committee
without amendment it has been customary,
with unanimous consent, to waive this rule.
However, if there is any objection the house
should not agree to the bill being read the

Honourable senators, I do not intend to
read all the various news items about this
subject which I have before me. Some of
the headings however are as follows:
U.K. Expert urges free drug issue for addicts.
Choke off Source, say drug probers.
Supplies at cost for drug addicts?

MARCH 6, 1957
Under the heading "Death penalty urged
for dope peddlers", one paragraph reads:
Surely the authorities should be convinced by
now that some other approach should be tried.
The illegal traffie in dope would die out in a month
if narcotics were obtainable at government clinies
at cost price.

It is that kind of statement that leads people
to believe that the free distribution of drugs
is the answer to the problem.
Then there is the question of whether we
should imprison all offenders for life or on
the other hand set up clinics and supply
them with drugs. I go back to my former
statement: jailing the offender may not be a
cure. Nevertheless, in my opinion free drugs
might very well only increase drug addiction
and so increase the problem.
With that background, honourable senators,
I come to the bill itself. In substantiation of
what I said in my opening remarks, that the
Government is prepared to accept in toto the
recommendations of the Senate Committee on
the traffic in narcotic drugs, I should like
to point out some of the things which the
committee advocated and which support the
present bill.
The report of the Senate committee in
dealing with matters connected with the
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, pointed out
that vigorous enforcement, more severe
penalties and a realistic recognition by judicial and other authorities of the extent and
nature of the evil of trafficking would do
much to reduce the incidence of drug addiction in Canada.
A great deal of evidence was given to the
committee regarding the large profits made
by people engaged in the drug traffic, and
there were various suggestions as to how this
profit could be eliminated. It was the considered opinion of the committee, however,
that the most effective way of taking the
profit out of the traffic was by making all
trafficking a most hazardous and costly undertaking, in terms of penalties, to the trafficker.
The committee recommended that penalties
for trafficking-regardless of the trafficker's
purpose or motive, or of the amount involved,
and irrespective of whether the trafficker was
or was not an addict-should be more severe,
with a compulsory lengthy minimum sentence, and an increased minimum sentence
for a second or subsequent offence, and possibly a maximum of life imprisonment.
The committee also dealt with the question
of drug importation, which constitutes the
source of the illicit supplies in Canada. The
committee pointed out that the traffickerimporter seldom has physical possession of
the drugs for which he is responsible, and
that he himself is rarely addicted to their

use. It was the committee's recommendation
that a special offence be created for importation of drugs into Canada, with a penalty of
the utmost severity. It was felt by the
committee that persons who engaged in importation for the benefit of the traffickerimporter would thus be deterred from
asuming the heavy risks which increased
penalties would involve.
The committee
finally recommended that since trafficking
had become a mobile industry, courts should
withdraw motor vehicle driving privileges for
long periods of time from those convicted of
an offence of trafficking.
A further recommendation of the committee dealt with the proof of conspiracy to
commit an offence under the act.
These constituted the major recommendations of the committee in so far as they pertain to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.
In looking at the bill, it will be seen that
all these recommendations have been implemented. I will refer to them in the order in
which they appear in the report.
Section 4 makes express provision for a
lengthy minimum and maximum term of
imprisonment for a second and a third offence
of trafficking. A second offence will carry a
minimum sentence of not less than ten years,
with a maximum of twenty years; and for a
third and subsequent offence the minimum
sentence will be not less than twenty years,
with a maximum of life imprisonment.
In this connection, section 4(3) becomes of
great importance. It provides that a conviction for trafficking under the present Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act will constitute a
conviction for trafficking under the proposed
new act. Thus if any trafficker who has
already been convicted of trafficking in
Canada is convicted under the new legislation, he will be dealt with as a person guilty
of a second offence and subjected to the very
heavy penalty provided for it. I understand
that no traffickers have already been convicted twice under the present act, so the
maximum penalty of life imprisonment will
not have any application for the time being.
It will be noted that while minimum
penalties are provided for a second and third
offence, there is no minimum for a first
offence. It was thought appropriate to give
to the court complete discretion in the matter
of an appropriate penalty for a first offence,
but at the same time to fix a maximum high
enough to enable the court to deal severely
with a first offender, if the circumstances so
required.
May I here interject the hope that judges
and magistrates who are called upon to deal
with cases under this act will realize that
they are dealing with an extremely serious

SENATE
problem and that it is their bounden duty
to see that the full measure of the law is
enforced in handing out sentences.
The Senate committee made no recommendation with respect to illegal possession of
drugs. The provisions of the bill, therefore,
do not change the law in that regard.
Section 5 establishes a special offence of
importing narcotics into Canada. It provides
a penalty for a first offence of not less than
ten years' imprisonment with a maximum of
twenty years' imprisonment, with a maximum
up to life imprisonment. These penalties
compare with those provided for a second and
This
subsequent offence for trafficking.
offence, with the penalties it carries, implements the recommendation made by the
Senate committee for some effective deterrent
to the illicit importation of drugs into Canada.
The next provision of the bill which is of
interest in terms of the committee's recommendations is section 11, which authorizes the
court to prohibit a convicted trafficker from
driving a motor vehicle for any period that
the court considers proper. This is intended
to curtail the mobility of the trafficker as far
as possible, by forcing him either to adopt
some other means of reaching his customers
or to employ a confederate to operate a
vehicle for him. If the latter course is followed, the confederate will be equally guilty
of the offence if caught and convicted. Thus
a very heavy deterrent is provided for a
confederate who takes the risk of driving a
car for the convenience of a drug trafficker.
This penalty is new, and it will of course
be some time before its value can be assessed.
Obviously, any period of prohibition of driving a motor vehicle would need to be over
and above the period of imprisonment, during
which time the trafficker would automatically
be denied driving privileges. It will be some
years, perhaps, before the value of this section
will be apparent.
These are the provisions of the bill implementing the Senate committee's report. They
would seem, in all respect, to carry out
fully the committee's intent in making its
recommendations.
With increased penalties of the kind provided in this bill, and with the quality of the
enforcement that has been maintained in
Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police and other enforcement agencies, it is
to be hoped that the courts will take cognizance of the purpose for which these
amendments are made, and thus fulfil the
hopes of the committee as expressed in the
first paragraph of its recommendations dealing with penalties for drug trafficking.
The bill introduces a somewhat new procedure, in that it transfers to the regulationmaking section the authority to provide for

the legal manufacture, distribution and use
of narcotic drugs. The regulations, therefore,
will set forth a complete code to cover all
legal dealings in and uses of drugs. The
regulation-making section, which is No. 16,
sets out full authority to provide, by regulation, for everything that need be done to
ensure that narcotic drugs will be available
for medical and scientific purposes.
The remainder of the bill substantially
provides for various matters which are contained in the present Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act, and it does not require any detailed
explanation.
Honourable senators, that is a brief explanation of the purposes of the bill. You
will notice that the act has been given a new
title, "An Act to provide for the control of
narcotic drugs."
If the bill is given second reading I will
move that it be sent to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where
more information will be available, and
where the various clauses of the bill can be
looked into in detail.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I rise to speak on this occasion for two
reasons: one, that I am heartily in support of
the bill before us; and second, that having
been a member of the committee which inquired into its subject-matter, I wish to voice
in the presence of honourable senators my
great appreciation of the great driving power
and energetic and very laborious work of the
chairman (Hon. Mr. Reid), in the conduct of
the hearings and also in the preparation of
the report.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Now that the report has
been written into history-for it was presented in 1955-I think I can say that I was
probably the most stubborn member of the
whole committee in the matter of the penalties which I thought should be applicable. I
felt they should be the most severe that could
possibly be pronounced, but the other members of the committee would not go that far.
For that reason I want to explain very briefly
my view of the problem of control of narcotic
drugs and how I think it should be
approached.
The three offences are, of course, possession of drugs, trafficking in drugs, and importation of drugs. Now, as to trafficking in
drugs and importation of drugs for that purpose by persons who are not themselves drug
addicts, I would provide, if I could write the
law, for a penalty of life imprisonment, but
as a compromise I might agree to a sentence
ranging from ten years to life imprisonment.
It strikes me as completely unrealistic to
show any consideration at all for people who

MARCH 6, 1957
for profit are trafficking in drugs and delivering thern to poor human wrecks who have
acquired the drug habit. As far as the traffickers are concerned I would not provide, as
this bill does, for three different offences,
with life imprisonment not imposable until
the third conviction.
Then, in dealing with the question of possession, it seems to me that there are two
categories of offence: one, possession by a
drug addict; and the other, possession by a
person who is not a drug addict. In the
case of possession of a drug by a person who
is not an addict and who has no explanation
which would justify his possession of
the drug, I would assume he had possession
for the purpose of trafficking, and I would
visit the extreme penalty of the law upon
him.
As to those persons who are drug addicts,
in the committee's discussions before the
report was drafted I urged that drug addiction should be made an offence, but I did
not succeed in convincing the committee.
It seems to me that making drug addiction
itself an offence, so that you can get at
the addict and take him out of circulation
for an indefinite period, would be an excellent
way to develop real control of addiction.
For a drug addict who is found in possession
of drugs I would provide a sentence of imprisonment for an indefinite period. Then
he would be tucked away for a while, and
part of the market for drugs and certainly
one element of drug addiction would disappear. All that would then be left for the
time being would be the recruitment of new
drug addicts, and the way to prevent that
would be to make the penalty so severe that
the traffic would lose its attractiveness. That
course may seern very harsh and tough, but,
after all, most people who become drug addicts are ruined; their lives are destroyed;
their condition affects their immediate family
and others and imposes a responsibility on
society. So, I think, society in its own best
interests should take the most drastic steps
not only to control but to try to eliminate
drug addiction; and, as I have said, drastic
penalties are necessary to achieve that end.
I do not suppose the bill will be amended
at this time in accordance with my views,
but I am expressing them now because I
believe that ultimately, if the habit and
the traffic are to be really controlled, we
shall have to come to the stage of administration which I have outlined.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
one difficulty I see about the suggestion for
dealing with a non-addict trafficker is that it
would be possible for him to sham addiction.
He could even go to the extent of carrying
82719-21

what the addict requires for his own inoculation, although it may be that the fraud could
be detected by medical tests. But I am reminded of what bootleggers used to do in the
dry days: They would pretend to drink their
own whisky when it was of very doubtful
quality.
My impression of what we learned about
methods in vogue in England is that the
British systern of tracing the sales of drugs
and their distribution is a good one; that a
doctor who was found to be using too large
a quantity will find himself in trouble. A
medical man from the Old Country, who had
practised for a number of years before coming
to Vancouver, told the committee that in
Britain medical men were permitted to administer narcotics to those who needed them,
but that addiction was not a problem because,
as I recall, strict control was maintained over
the sources of supply. Our situation may be
more difficult, but one would suppose that
the reverse would be true, because Britain
is one of the centres of world traffic. But
whether or not we believe there are no more
than 300 addicts in the United Kingdom, it is
evident that that number is greatly exceeded
in some Canadian cities. Climate may have
something to do with it.
It would be instructive to be able to follow
up the histories of some of the very interesting addicts who appeared before our cornmittee. For instance, I wonder what became
of the man in his sixties who told us, at
Vancouver, that he had been an addict for 49
years. He explained how he was able to indulge in the habit and carry on with his
work. In reply to one of the members of the
comnittee he said that at one time, finding
that he craved larger doses, he applied at one
and the same time for supplies to no less than
nine doctors. He was a plausible talker, and,
I suppose, managed to conceal from each of
them that he was in contact with any of the
others. So he drew a large quantity in small
amounts, on the pretext of relieving some pain
which he claimed was troubling him.
Years ago, in China, the number of users
of narcotics had become so great that desperate measures were put in force. Some
curative treatment was provided, and addicts
who relapsed were shot. The authorities regarded them as a danger to the state and
simply put them out of business. It is difficult
to contemplate adoption of such measures in
this country; we sympathize in some degree
with a person in this condition. But the fact
remains that he must have the dope he is
accustomed to, and in order to get money to
supply himself with it he goes out and peddles
the drug. Addicts will tell you that they do
not convert others to this vice, but this is not

SENATE

so. I am firmly convinced that there are
cases where, in order to create customers,
they induce youngsters to start on this dangerous road. The odd individual of rugged character may withstand the temptation to do so,
but the great majority of these people are a
menace to others; so that, so far as increasing
the severity of penalties to people of this kind,
I am in entire agreement with the bill.
Hon. John P. Howden: Honourable senators, this matter of drug addiction has
occupied much of my attention for a long
time. I have finally come to the conclusion,
after a good deal of doubt, that it can be
cured, and in a very short time, if the right
action is taken with energy and persistence.
Dr. Isabel, a medical man from one of the
American institutions-it may have been
Washington-gave us complete and satisfying
evidence on this matter. He cited a number
of cases that had been cured-that is, so far
as it is possible to cure anyone of anything.
Hundreds, if not thousands, were restored to
a condition in which they did not want the
drug; in fact they could not be persuaded to
take it. It is just like feeding a cat or a dog
something that stales its appetite: you will
cure the animal if you force it to take the
substance until becoming sick. Similarly
you can bring addicts to the point where they
will run away to escape having to take a
drug. Undoubtedly this method will work,
but its application requires a lot of attention.
There is little evidence that anybody except the people at an institution in the southern states wants to give these addicts proper
attention. A number of drugs besides morphine and opium give a pleasant sensation
and are habit forming, and this American
institution has definitely shown they can cure
alcoholics and drug addicts of all kinds. The
sure-fire methods is to keep pushing a little
bit of one of these drugs into them until they
abhor it and dread the very thought of taking it. It is no easy trick, but a few institutions in the United States have tried it.
We hear a lot of talk about curing drug
addiction but little has been done about it.
Governments and other institutions are reluctant to provide funds for looking after
addicts, because it is felt there is no cure for
them. I have had a lot of experience in dealing with drug addiction, and I know it can
be cured, for I have cured it myself.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable sena-

tors, I would like to add a word because we
have in the gallery today a large delegation

from the city of Montreal, and I wish to show
them that in this house French is both spoken
and understood.
I congratulate the mover of this legislation,
the honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) upon the splendid work he
has been doing for some time in the field
of narcotics, in an effort to prevent addiction
and to stop the degradation of the terribly
large number of Canadians who have developed a taste for narcotics. The honourable
senator lives near Vancouver and he may
have exaggerated a bit when he claimed
that Vancouver has the largest number of
addicts. The survey made in Montreal, as
the honourable senators will recall, indicated
that there is unfortunately a very large
number of addicts in that city. That is because
major seaports lend themselves to this type
of business.
But I do not entirely agree with the honourable senator when he finds the law too harsh
on the non-addicts who only peddle narcotics.
According to the experience I have had in
my small community, which is situated near
the United States border, some people who
have never used narcotics but only peddle
them can do very quickly a great deal of
harm to our youth. In my opinion, those
responsible for this traffic are guiltier than
anyone else and should be treated even more
severely than the addicts.
I extend my congratulations to the senator
from New Westminster upon his report and
I am glad to hear that the drug traffic has
not increased since he started his inquiry
two years ago. That, in itself, is a victory.
Providing we educate our young people, this
act should be even more effective, even more
social, I might say, and should produce better
results than the former one.

MARCH 6, 1957
ROYAL CANADIAN

MOUNTED POLICE

BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second reading of Bill E, an Act to amend
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
a very short one and its subject matter is
simple. Its background, however, is very
great indeed and would fill a large book. It
springs in the first place from the ancient
principle that the Crown can do no wrong.
Like the "divinity that doth hedge a king",
this principle has cast its shadow over
thousands of our civil servants, and so strong
has popular opinion against it become that
it has been virtually negated throughout
Canada. The idea that the Crown can do no
wrong and is not under any obligation to
answer for wrongs committed in the Crown's
name or by Crown officials has been pretty
well abolished.
Honourable senators will no doubt remember that in 1953 we passed the Crown
Liability Act, which will be found in the
Statutes of Canada, 1952-53, chapter 30. The
vital clause of the statute is this:

by him by virtue of his office and, unless he is
acting in execution of a warrant lawfully issued,
can only be exercised on his own responsibility.

That is the common law with respect a
member of the police force and it still
applies, in large measure, at least, to the
ordinary policeman of our municipalities.
He acts not as a servant of the municipality
or of the commission, but rather on his own
responsibility as the holder of a public
office.
Paragraph 531 in the same volume of Halsbury says:
The relation of the police authority to the
individual constable is not that of master and
servant and the police authority are not liable
for wrongful acts committed by a constable in the
exercise of his duty.

That has always been the common law.
It was thought by our Department of Justice that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
differed from the ordinary constable in that
it is organized on a military basis; therefore
it was believed that the section which I read,
making possible an action by or against the
Crown, applied to the R.C.M.P. as well as
to the army, the navy and the air force. On
that understanding actions have been brought
by the Crown, and against the Crown, quite
freely for torts committed by members of

for which, if it were a private person of full age the R.C.M.P. or torts against the interests

The police force involved in that case is
in its organization almost exactly the same as
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. So the
assumption on which we have been working
in recent years evidently is wrong, in that
the common law still applies to our dominion
police force.
In order to make it entirely clear that our
police force should not rely upon the ancient
idea that it is not liable for its acts, the
explanatory note to the bill states:
For the purpose of determining liability, members of the R.C.M.P. have always been regarded as
servants of the Crown . . .

In other words, they are just not office holders
who act on their own responsibility, but are
servants of the Crown. This means that the
principle of master and servant applies, and
the Crown is liable for wrongs committed by
its servant just as is any other master, if
those wrongs are committed in the course of
employment. The master is of course not
responsible for injury or accident if the
servant goes off on a joy ride. But if in the
course of his duties for the Dominion of
Canada, a constable of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police does some unlawful act by
which others are injured, the Crown will be
liable to pay damages. On the other hand, if
in such circumstances a third party commits
a tortious act as a result of which a constable
is injured and the Crown loses the services
for which he is paid a salary or pension, or
if Crown property is damaged, Her Majesty
has a right of action against that third party
to collect damages.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable senator permit a question? Would the situation
be any different in a municipality in British
Columbia, for instance, where the R.C.M.P.
are on loan to the municipality and are not
directly under the federal authority?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor), sitting behind
me, points out that the R.C.M.P. in those circumstances are under contract. While I do
not want to place any legal opinions on
Hansard-I saw this bill only this morning,
so I have not had time to give it any special
consideration-my first thought is that the
Crown would be liable.
Hon. Mr. Farris: By "Crown" do you mean
dominion or provincial?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Or municipal?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: This would be the
dominion Crown. The dominion Government
takes over the policing of a municipality and
pays its officers. Under this bill the Crown
would be liable for the tortious acts of its
officers doing police work for a municipality.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Would that be the case
whether or not the whole province is policed
by the R.C.M.P.?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would think so.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It would be a matter of
contract.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. But let us get
away from the Crown for a moment. and
consider the problem on the basis of the
principle of master and servant. If a servant
employed and paid by me works for the
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
under contract between myself and him, and
does some tortious act, I think I as the master
am liable.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What I was suggesting
was that whether or not a municipality is
liable would be a matter of contract between
the municipality and the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Quite so. It might be
that under the contract the Crown would
have to claim over against the municipality.
But let me repeat what I said earlier: I have
not given this matter any special consideration, and I do not propose to give legal
advice to possible litigants from British
Columbia.
The bill is in line with what we have been
doing in this particular jurisdiction for a
number of years, that of placing the Crown
on the same basis, with respect to enforcement and liability arising from wrongs, as
the individual. That I think is modern thinking. As I mentioned at the outset, the old
idea of hiding behind the "divinity that doth
hedge a king" is outmoded, as it should be.
Clarification of the statute by the passage
of this bill will place the members of the
R.C.M.P. in the same position as the members of the navy, army and air force.

the department is more interested in the
fact that this bill would give the Crown
the right of action agaînst a third party. I
believe there are several such cases pending. The bill is flot retroactive, and wîll
come into force only on proclamation. However, 1 am assured that any case which
would be governed by the provisions of this
bill, had the law in effect been as we thought
it was, will be deait with ex gratia, and the
rights of the parties will be acknowledged
by the law department.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: Am I right in my understanding that passage of this bill will mean
no change in the present practice?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It will mean no change.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: The bill merely clarifies
the practice that has been followed for some
time?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right. The bill
merely clarifies a practice which we thought
was sound until the Australian case which
I mentioned was taken before the Privy
Council.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, to summarize this legisiation as I
understand it, it should be mentioned that
the Commissioner of the Mounted Police
should not consider his men above the law.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Very often we have ta
discuss matters of this kind with the Mounted
Police and we find that they are infalliblethey neyer make a mistake, they are always
right, and the poor people who are run down
by the Mounties are always in the wraong. I
would say, though, there was one exception:
some years ago it happened that a car driven
by a Mountie struck another car. It was a
clear case of negligence on the part of the
Mountie. I toak the case up with Commissioner Wood, who was in charge at the time,

and he ordered the constable ta pay the repair
bill. There was no law suit; it ended thereit was a case of swift and sure justice. It
would seem that Commissianer Wood did not
hold the view that politicians were always
wrong in defending. the rights of the people.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May 1 ask the honourable senator how long aga that was?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: That happened many
years ago. Since then it has been impossible
to discuss certain matters wîth the Mounted
Police. I do not like ta make any complaints
against anyone who cannot defend himself in
the Senate, but I shahl say haw I view this
bill. What is the use of passing legislation if
it is interpreted wrangly by those in office?
I will be very tolerant: I will close my eyes
to this legishation and believe what my
honourable friend from. Taronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Raebuck) has said. He may be right or
hie may be wrong. But my experience is that
the Mounties are neyer wrong, accarding to
the dictates of their superior officers.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hanourable senators,
the constable in that case whlch. arase some
years aga was personally hiable and the
Crown, his employer, was nat. That is why
the Commissioner told the canstable ta pay
the dlaim and did nat acknowledge any
respansibility on the part of the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Well, I have other cases
that I could mention. I know af a mounted
policeman who was driving along the highway in a storm, going very fast behind another car, and using his siren ta frighten
innocent people driving on that road. An
accident happened, but the Mounties were
said ta be ln the rîght and nothing could be
done.
Last night some of aur colleagues indulged
in personal reminiscences. I might do the
sanie, but as I have many, and might detain
the house too long, I will stop.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald moved the third reading af Bill 47, an Act for the establishment of

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, on the third reading of this bill I
could make another long speech, but I wifl
abstain.

SENATE
On the motion for second reading I registered my protest against a bill of this kind,
which I find untimely and uncalled for. I
do not see why we are passing such legislation, because education is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the provinces. We have to
take it for granted that each province has
the right to choose its own Government.
Even when a provincial Government does not
agree with the views of the central Government here at Ottawa, it must be remembered
that the provincial Government has been
chosen by the majority of the people within
the province to administer the affairs of the
province during the term of the Legislature.
I have already expressed myself clearlyI do not see why we should appoint a council
to administer moneys for the building of new
university projects or for the awarding of
scholarships. Naturally, expectations will be
greater than the number of students who will
receive those scholarships, and many students
will be disappointed. My main objection to
this kind of legislation is that members of the
Canada Council will not be in a position to
tell the universities what they shall do in
matters of education. The members will be
prevented by the Constitution from making
their awards as useful as they would be if
the council had the authority and the jurisdiction to deal fully with the matter.
Now, honourable senators, the majority of
the Senate is in favour of this legislation
and I bow to the majority. We are in a
democratic country, and you are for the legislation, so let us have it. But you will take
the responsibility for the whole thing and
you will never be able to blame me for not
having warned you about the results of this
legislation, if it is unsatisfactory. I do not
hope it will be unsatisfactory. I hope that
the members of the council will be well
qualified, and that they will succeed in their
administration. But if you wish them to be
successful they must be independent of all
the universities, so that they may be fair in
their dealings with the universities themselves.
Before concluding, honourable senators, I
must also remind you that several heads of
universities have refused to accept university
grants from Ottawa. I shall not specify them,
but the facts are on record; they are known
to anyone who reads the newspapers or
listens to the radio.
So, let us hope for the best-or for the
better. Let us see how this works.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I disagree with my honourable friend
from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) as
regards the Canada Council. He claims that

education is reserved to the provinces. That
is precisely why the Government has organized this Canada Council, so that the Council
can distribute scholarships, just as the Royal
Society of Canada is doing at the present
time. It is not the first time that the Government has given money to independent bodies.
Every year the Royal Society of Canada
gives scholarships to professors of Laval
University, the University of Montreal and
elsewhere, so that they may study abroad
and obtain further training. Our universities
receive scholarships from the Carnegie
Ford Foundation, the
Foundation, the
Rockefeller Foundation and others, and
these scholarships are given under clearly
specified conditions. This money comes from
foreign organizations. In other words, because these scholarships do not come from
the federal Government, they are accepted.
The federal Government wants to do the same
thing, not in order to interfere, but to endow
an autonomous body so that the money may
be distributed for the improvement of teaching and to help the poorer and more gifted
students who could not go on with their
studies without such help.
Let us take the case of family allowances;
the mother will only receive those allowances
if her school-age child attends school up to
the age of sixteen. But the child is not
obliged to follow any particular textbook or
course. The idea is to give him the opportunity of obtaining a better education or
further training.
In this case, the grants will be made to an
autonomous body, which will have to give a
yearly account of its expenses to Parliament,
just as the universities have to account for
the money given to them by the Foundations
of which I have spoken.
That is why the Prime Minister of Canada,

speech. It is that if I disagree with the
Prime Minister in connection with this bill
it does not mean that I have less respect for
him, or that I no longer consider myself as
one of his supporters.

PRIVATE BILL
EQUITABLE FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY
OF CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri moved the second
reading of Bill K-8, an Act respecting Equitable Fire Insurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to5 extend the period during
which the Minister of Finance may grant a
permit of opei'ation to this insurance firm,
and to change its name to Equitable General
Insurance Company of Canada.
The Equitable Fire Insurance Company of
Canada was granted a federal charter in
1952, by chapter 61 of the statutes of that
year. This federal company is to replace
the company bearing the same name which
has been in operation since 1901 under a
provincial charter. That is, it is intended
to transfer the operations of the Equitable
Fire Insurance Company from a provincial
to a federal charter.
This bill is similar to other bills which
were passed in similar circumstances.
I
refer honourable senators to 11-12 George VI,
chapter 86, and 14 George VI, chapter 58.
Paragraph 2 of section 4 of the Canadian
and British Insurance Company Act states
that a charter granted to an insurance company shall expire unless the licence of operation be obtained within two years from the
date upon which the charter was granted.
In this case the extension of time had
already been granted, through a private bill
passed in 1955, but this extension expired
on June 18, 1956. In order to transfer its
charter, the company waited until the amendment of income tax law whereunder the
service of the provincial company to be transferred to the federal company would not be
charged as a dividend against the shareholders, -and the .capital to be reimbursed
to the shareholders would not be so charged
against them.
The Income Tax Act has been changed in
this respect. This amendment was assented
to on August 14, 1956, and is now paragraph
3 of Section 22 of Chapter 39 of the 1956
Statutes. Now that this amendment has been
adopted, the transfer from a provincial charter
to a federal charter can be affected without

the shareholders being penalized by paying
income tax on amounts which they will not
receive.
This bill has been approved by the Superintendent of Insurance.
It is also provided in the bill that the
name Equitable Fire Insurance Company of
Canada be changed to Equitable General
Insurance Company of Canada. There is a
company bearing the name Equitable Fire
and Marine Insurance Company, and the
similarity of this name with that of the
company petitioning for the bill bas caused
some confusion. I know that still another
company, the Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada with head office at Waterloo,
Ontario, is opposed to the changing of the
petitioning company's name to Equitable
General Insurance Company of Canada. However, I do not think it would be difficult to
reach some satisfactory arrangement as to
the name when the bill is before the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
when I declined to second the motion for
the second reading of this bill it was not
because I have any definite objection to the
main object of the bill, but there is one
clause in it to which I do make a tentative
objection. I could not very well object to
the proposal to substitute a federal charter
for the existing provincial charter under
which this company bas been operating for
a good many years, for as late as last night
I proposed the very same thing with respect
to another company from the city of Waterloo.
Perhaps I might review very briefly the
history of the Equitable Fire Insurance Company of Canada. As my friend from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) bas stated, this company has been operating under provincial
charter in the province of Quebec. In 1952 it
came before Parliament for the purpose of
being reincorporated as a dominion company.
Amending legislation was passed and the
name of the new dominion company was
"Equitable Fire Insurance Company of Canada". The Equitable Life Insurance Company,
whose head office is at Waterloo, Ontario, had
no objection whatsoever to this. However, the
new Equitable Fire Insurance Company of
Canada did not become registered within the
necessary two years of the passing of its act
of incorporation, and the act expired. It was
revived in 1955, under the same name, the
Equitable Fire Insurance Company of Canada,
but the act expired again in 1956.
Now the company is before Parliament with
this bill, proposing to get a federal charter.
I do not object to this at all, but the bill also
proposes that the name of the company be
changed to Equitable General Insurance Cornpany of Canada. It is to this name that I make

SENATE
a tentative objection on behalf of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, of Waterloo,
Ontario.
The whole matter of changing the name of
the petitioning company must of necessity lie
with our Banking and Commerce Committee,
but I wanted to place the views of the officials
of the Equitable Life Insurance Company of
Waterloo before the Senate.
When the company made application for
this bill Mr. K. R. MacGregor, the Superintendent of Insurance, wrote to Mr. M. J.
Smith, General Manager of the Equitable Life
Insurance Company of Waterloo. I might perhaps quote from his letter:

other, there would be no great confusion.
Mr. Smith added:
We trust that you can give consideration to our
views. We realize we cannot complain about the
word "Equitable" which was in the original name
of the company. We would continue to make no
objection to the word "Fire", nor would we object

to "Equitable Fire and General Insurance Company
of Canada". I may say that in addition to our
Life business we are in the process of asking for
authority to write Sickness and Accident business;
therefore since both of us might be in general
lines, it would seem to us best to make the distinction between companies as clear as possible.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
Dear Mr. de Billy:
You will recall that a number of years ago we
had correspondence about the federal reincorporation of the Equitable Fire Insurance Company, but
omitting the word "Fire". At the time we felt
that the proposed name would lead to confusion
affecting both that company and our own, and it
was then agreed that the word "Fire" would be
retained in the title, which was satisfactory to us.
I understand that it is now proposed to have
the name changed to Equitable General Insurance
Company of Canada.
We are disturbed by this
proposal because it breaks down the distinction
between Life and Fire which our name and the
agreed-upon name would have retained. Even at
that our two names would have been quite
similar.

That might possibly have led to a little
confusion, but so long as the word "Fire"

WESTERN ASSURANCE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill L-8, an Act respecting The
Western Assurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
deals solely with the change in the manner
in which the directors of the company shall
qualify as directors. The bill provides that

MARCH B, 1957
they must be shareholders. The incorporating
statute, which was enacted by Parliament in
1920, provided that the directors should hold
for their own use 250 shares of the company,
which at par value of $10 each, meant that
an investment of $2,500 was required. The
market price is now $110 per share, which
means that to qualify as a director a person
must make an investment of about $27,000.
It becomes increasingly difficult to provide for
directors when the qualification is expressed
in that way. The qualification is even greater
than for directors of a bank, under the Bank
Act. The maximum amount stated in the
Bank Act is not less than $5,000 where the
capital of the bank is in excess of $3 million.
Yet to become a director of this company,
which has a smaller operation, one is required
to expend, as I say, about $27,000. The
proposed amendment changes the wording of
the section providing for the qualification of
a director and requires that he must own in
his own right 100 shares, which he must buy
on the market at the prevailing price.
That is the only proposal of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

BRITISH AMERICA ASSURANCE
SECOND READING

COMPANY-

Hon. Mr. Hayden moved the second reading of Bill M-8, an Act respecting The British
America Assurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is a
comkanion bill, so to speak, to the one I have
just explained. The majority of the directors
and shareholders are the same in each of the
companies, and substantially the same kind
of business is carried on. The same qualificatioi provision is contained also in the original
special act of 1920 incorporating this company. That is to say, a director is required
to hold 250 shares of the company, which are
of a par value of $10 each. But the value of
these shares has enhanced considerably and
in order to become a director today a person
would be required to invest considerably
more than $2,500.
The proposed amendment provides that a director must hold
100 fully paid shares of the company, and
limits him to that number of shares.
Clause 1 of the bill deals with the time
of calling the annual meeting. Since there
is a similar shareholding relationship in this
company to that of The Western Assurance
Company, it has been found difficult to
adjust the times of their annual meetings in
accordance with the requirements of the
82719-22

statute. At present the statute requires that
the annual meeting be held on such day in
each year, not later than the last day of the
month of March. Section 1 of the bill, as
amended, reads as follows:
The annual meeting of the shareholders shall
be held at the head office of the Company on such
day in each year as shall from time to time be
fixed by resolution of the directors.

In other words, a little more flexibility is
provided so that the company may arrange to
hold its meeting at a convenient date, rather
than being obliged to hold it not later than
the end of March, whether that happens to
be a convenient time or not.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

GHANA
CELEBRATION

OF INDEPENDENCE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I wish to draw the attention of the
house to a matter of some importance. As
we all know, Ghana, formerly known as the
Gold Coast Colony, recently celebrated its
national independence and entry into the
Commonwealth-and I am sure we welcome
her as a sister nation. I notice that a
Canadian cabinet minister and his lady

MARCH 7, 1957
attended the ceremonies, but there was no
representation of Her Majesty's loyal Canadian Opposition. I think the Opposition
should have been represented. Of course,
had it been represented by a senator the
Opposition ranks in this bouse would have
been weakened, but in the other house they
would have remained strong.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I am happy to associate myself
with the acting leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Horner) in congratulating and welcoming
in our midst the new member of the
Commonwealth.
Those who heard the Queen's Christmas
message remember that she spoke both as
the Queen and as the mother of a f amily.
She made a parallel between her family life
and that of the Commonwealth and compared
the members of the Commonwealth to the
members of her family, who may sometimes
differ but who, eventually always manage to
agree in the interest of the whole family.
MONTREAL NORTH BUSINESSMEN'S
ASSOCIATION
It also gives me pleasure to greet the large
delegation from the Montreal North Businessmen's Association which I see in the galleries
of the bouse and to prove to them that in this
bouse, just as in the other place, it is possible
to make oneself understood in French as well
as in English.

CURRENCY,

MINT AND EXCHANGE
FUND BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Joseph A. Bradette moved the second
reading of Bill H, an Act to amend the Currency, Mint and Exchange Fund Act.
He said: Honourable senators, it will readily
be seen that this is a simple bill, with no
complications. It consists of only two clauses.
Clause 1 reads as follows:
Part II of the Schedule to the Currency, Mint
and Exchange Fund Act is amended by striking
out the remedy allowance of 3.00 grains for a group
of one dollar's worth (ten pieces) of coins of the
denomination of ten cents, and substituting therefor
the remedy allowance of 15.00 grains.

Perhaps honourable senators will permit
me to read the explanatory note also:
The purpose of this bill Is to increase the remedy
allowance for ten-cent pieces. The new high, speed
rolling mills, which were installed in the Mint
early in 1956, cannot give as precise a thickness as
former mills. The proposed new remedy allowance
is the same as that in the United States.

Honourable senators, in order to understand
the meaning and purport of the bill I had an
interview yesterday with Mr. Williams,
Master of the Mint, and other officials, from
whom I learned that the new machines are
necessary to take care of the increased proDIVORCE BILLS
duction. I was informed that a ten-cent piece
weighs 36 grains, and that the tolerance is

would like to have it referred to the Banking

hands of the house in that respect.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator what precious metal is used for the
coins? Is it nickel or silver?
Hon. Mr. Bradeite: It is an alloy of silver,
but I believe there is a small amount of
nickel in it. The proportions of metals in the
alloy are not being changed at all; the bill
simply increases the remedy allowance for
ten-cent coins.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I understood that an amendment was to be
proposed to this bill for the purpose of bringing the amendment into effect earlier than
January 1, 1957. With the permission of the
honourable senator from Cochrane (Hon. Mr.
Bradette) I would move the adjournment of
the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the debate was adjourned.
EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 160, an Act to amend the
Exchequer Court Act.
He said: Honourable senators this is a
simple bill. It would make two changes in
the Exchequer Court Act with respect to the
Registrar of that court. First, it would remove
the statutory limitation of $7,500 on the annual salary of the Registrar. Secondly, it
would remove the requirement that he reside
in the city of Ottawa, and allow him to live
within five miles of the city.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
there can be no objection to the change permitting the Registrar to reside within five
miles of the city of Ottawa. That I think
is entirely normal and quite in order. But
there is a question in my mind as to the
wisdom of removing the limitation on salary
and leaving it to be fixed by the Governor
in Council. All through our history, I think,
the practice has been to fix by statute the
salaries of important officials. I trust the
bill will go to a committee where we may
get more enlightenment on the proposed
change. The limitation of $7,500 on the
Registrar's salary may be outdated; if so,
would it not be possible to specify a larger
maximum in the act? That would accord
with what has been done in the cases of many
other senior members of the Civil Service.
Hon. Thomas Reid: May I ask the honourable Leader of the Government why it is
proposed to limit the distance at which the
Registrar may live outside Ottawa to five

miles? In these days of high-speed cars, a
person living five miles away is barely outside the city. I am not in favour of such an
official living outside Ottawa, but if there is
to be an amendment of this kind why make
the limit five miles instead of ten or fifteen
miles?
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I had not intended to say anything
about this bill, but the observation of the
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) has rather intrigued me. There is
nothing inherent in the position or work of
the Registrar of the Exchequer Court that
requires him to live close to the chamber
where he performs his duties. He is not like
a fireman, who must be right next door to
the facilities which he is to use in case of
a fire. I can assure my honourable friends
that there are no fires in the Exchequer
Court. But sometimes the officers of the
court have so much work to do that they are
not able to dispose of it as quickly as they
would like to. The Registrar is an administrative officer of the court; he is charged with
the various processes in connection with the
proceedings that commence in the court and
he attends at court when the sittings are in
Ottawa. He has deputy registrars who accompany the judges when they go out on circuit
to various parts of Canada. I take it that
the only necessary requirement as to the
residence of the Registrar is that he should
live within an area that would enable him
te be reasonably available for the day to day
discharge of his duties, and I think a provision to that effect would be sufficient. The
limitation of five miles outside the city is
unrealistic today.
While I am on my feet, may I say a word
about the salary? The act at prescrit says
it shall not exceed $7,500. The position is not
one of those in the top bracket, for which
the salaries ordinarily are or should be fixed
by Parliament. It is an administrative office,
and I think there should be some latitude as
to the salary, so that the Governor in Council
in the exercise of his discretion from time
to time may pay the proper going salary without having to wait for the machinery of
Parliament to function and determine the
amount.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
would like an answer to the question that I
asked a moment ago.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I would
remind the house that if the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) speaks now he
will close the debate.

MARCH 7. 1957
Hon. Mr. Reid: I amn wondering if I could
have an answer to my question.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I will answer the question asked by the
honourable senator from New Westminster.
Five miles from Ottawa was thought to be
a reasonable limit. The honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) suggested
we might substitute for "Ifive miles" the
words "within a reasonable distance". Well,
who would decide whether a certain distance
was reasonable or flot?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I believe the Registrar
himself could do that. If he carnies out his
duties, that is the main thing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Registrar might
have an idea different from that of a .Tudge
as to what distance was reasonable. I do
not think that would be a happy condition.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What is the limitation
on a Judge as to residence?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have not that information at hand, but my impression is that
a Judge is required to live within the city
of Ottawa. However, that information can
be obtained when the bull is in committee. I
thought my honourable friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) would be
famiiliar with that requirement as to Judges
of the Exchequer Court, since he appears
before that court quite often.
Hon. Mr. Farris: They are aIways in court
when I get there.

of the Income Tax Appeal Board and memnbers of the Tariff Board are fixed by statute.
Honourable senators, I think it is unnecessary for me to say any more at this
time. It has been suggested that the bill be
refenred to a commnittee, and I have no
objection to that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question of
the leader? Who is the present Registrar of
the Exchequer Court and where does he
live?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn informed by
the honourable senator from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) that the present Registrar
is Mr. Gabriel Belleau, Q.C.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.

THE LATE SENATOR DAIGLE
TRIBUTES

TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with, may I say we were all deeply
shocked to hear on Friday last that one of
our colleagues, Senator Daigle, had passed
away in Florida. His passing was a great
loss not only to the country at large, but
to many of us personally. He was a very
dear and close personal friend to me. From
the time he entered the Senate be took an
interest in the work I was then doing in
the House of Commons. I was quite impressed that a member of the Upper Chamber
should interest himself in the work of one
of the members of the other house. It was
my privilege to become better acquainted
with him over the years, and to visit in his
horme. Ie had a charming wife and a lovely
family, consisting of three daughters and
five sons. His was a typically fine Canadian
tamily, indeed one of which Canadians could
be proud.
As I said, Senator Daigle took an interest
in the work I was doing in the House of
Commons. He was particularly interested in
my efforts to speak the French language. I
think, therefore, I should say a few words
this evening in his native tongue.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, Senator Daigle took an
interest in my efforts to learn French. He
encouraged me heartily in my endeavour and
was not upset by the mistakes I made in
speaking that language.
Thanks to the
patience which Senator Daigle and others
have had with me in that respect, I have been
enabled to speak better French in this house.
(Text):
Senator Daigle was born on May 16, 1892,
at St. Roch Sur Richelieu, Quebec, to
Theodore Daigle and Celina Colette. I may
say that the late senator and I were
practically the same age. I was born December 25, 1891, just a few months before his
birth.
Our late colleague received his education
at Mont Saint Bernard College, in Sorel,
and immediately launched on a business
career which led him to eminence in his
native province.
Senator Daigle was an executive of several
large insurance companies and business

enterprises. He was President of General
Security Insurance Company of Canada and
a director of Page-Hersey Tubes Limited,
R.C.A. Victor Company Limited, Montreal
Life Insurance Company, Administration
Trust Company, Canadian Brewers Limited
and Windsor Hotel Limited.
Notwithstanding his many business activities he still found time for community
projects. He was a member of the Montreal
Board of Trade, the Canadian Chamber of
Construction
Canadian
the
Commerce,
Association and the Montreal Reform Club.
He was an ardent Liberal, and in this chamber represented Mille Isles, Quebec.
In the field of public service to his province
he was President of the Committee on Forest
Products of the Province of Quebec from
1931 to 1936, and represented the Province
of Quebec at the Imperial Conference in
Ottawa in 1932. He was summoned to the
Senate of Canada in 1944.
To his widow and his five sons and three
daughters he has left a memory of a devoted
husband and father. To us in this chamber
he has left memories which will be ever
green, and to Canadians generally be has
left an example of public service and
achievement in the business world of the
nation.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I had the pleasure of knowing the late Senator
Daigle quite well. I can remember that
with you, Mr. Speaker, he visited New York
when we were delegates to the United Nations. He and his dear wife were guests of
ourselves on that occasion. He was interested
in all branches of the United Nations, and be
apparently went there in order that be might
fully understand the operations of that organization, what it stood for and what it was
trying to do, and to listen to the debates
on some of the important questions then
before it.
His long service in this house gave me,
as it did others, a chance to know him quite
well. Our late colleague was very kind
hearted and friendly-I think every one of
us can say that he was a true friend of ours.
I visited his home. I knew his wife and
some of his family. On behalf of our party
I wish to express the deep sympathy that we
feel for his widow and family. May they flnd
some consolation in thinking on the great contribution that he made to Canada.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
would like to say a few words in eulogy of
the late Senator Armand Daigle, who was a
very, very good friend of mine. He was
born in the Richelieu Valley, in 1892. He
was one of my contemporaries, and I knew
him for the greater part of my life. He was
very successful in business, and was a member

MARCH 12, 1957
of the boards of directors of many companies.
He was above all a man of good counsel.
He had a clear and sound judgment. He was
a most courteous gentleman and it was simply
delightful to do business with him.
For at least four years he knew that he
was seriously ill, that he had only a few
years at most to live and that he might die
at 'any moment, but he kept his smiling philosophy. He would say to me "Well, you know,
I will just fade away." I will cherish his
memory and I will for ever remain grateful
for his friendship. Whenever I asked for
his guidance he gave it to me in a very wise
way.
The Liberal party owes a really grçat debt
of gratitude to Armand Daigle. He was most
devoted to our leader, and fully worthy of the
trust which the Prime Minister always placed
in him.
Armand Daigle was a good citizen, he
was very -charitable, always willing to help.
He was sincere in his political convictions;
he remained faithful to them not only when
the wind was favourable but even under the
most difficult circumstances.
For his sincerity, for his faithfulness, for
all the work which he carried on so well,
without any publicity, I wish to say "Thank
you" to this very, very dear friend. He
leaves a very fine family. He was a good
husband and father, and a charming grandfather. To his widow, his children, and
grandchildren I offer the expression of my
heartfelt sympathy.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, on behalf of the countless friends of
the late Senator Daigle I wish to convey
heartfelt sympathy to his widow and his
children. I have known him, as you have,
as a great gentleman and a great Canadian.
He was essentially kindly; and in the hearts
of his former colleagues of the Senate his
memory will live forever.

I knew our friend very well and was
aware of his political affiliations as well as
of his business interests. I deem it my duty
today to recall before my colleagues the
examples of charity and of friendship he has
left us. He was a great man who rendered
great service to his fellow citizens.
To his wife and to the members of his
family, I wish to offer the tribute of a friend
who appreciated him. At my age, one feels
deeply the loss of an old friend. I would
like to pay sincere tribute to his memory and
to voice the admiration which we had for
his constant devotion to duty.
To Madame Daigle and the members of her
family, I extend my sincere condolences.

through the regular and well-established
and well-tried machinery of the schools or
as a favour from the Canada Council.
And what about the loans? How are they
going to be distributed? It is perfectly clear
there will not be sufficient money for the
imaking of loans to all who may apply. Who
is to get them and who is not to get them?
Who is to decide this question? Will it be
determined by private individuals?
It has been said that we are to bring students
here from foreign lands, and that we are to
send students abroad so that they may study
in other countries and be emissaries of good
will. That is a fine thing. Students are to
come here and go from here at Government
expense. I ask my fellow senators in all
good reason: is it unreasonable that we who
are responsible for the expenditure and
the guardianship of public funds should want
to know how these beneficiaries are to be
chosen? The honourable senator from Ottawa
West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) expressed the
opinion that politics would not enter into the
selection. I rather agree with him. I do not
suppose the Canada Council would care very
much about politics. I do not think politics
will be one of the factors in the making of
selections, but how about the influence of
cliques, circles and classes, which results in
favouritism? I am not afraid of politics, but
I do fear there will be a favouritism that is
quite a good deal worse than politics. I do
not see how the Canada Council is going to
avoid this. It bas not been avoided in the
past under somewhat similar circumstances,
and it is not likely to be avoided in the
future.
The honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) told us that
the Canada Council is not to be an agent of
the Crown in the distribution of public
money. It is to be an autonomous body, acting on its own behalf and by its own right.
Therefore I suppose it is going to treat this
very large sum of money as its own. Yet
honourable senators complained when I referred to the body as irresponsible. Will it
not be irresponsible? Its members are to
be kings and queens of culture, for they are
to be endowed with the privilege of spending the taxpayers' money, which is the chief
prerogative of Parliament. Further, it would
seem from what I hear and read that these
kings and queens of culture are to function
in relation to the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization. In this
connection I would quote the following statement from the excellent address by the
honourable Leader of the Government:
By clause 8 (2), the council will have certain
duties and functions with relation to the United

Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the exact nature of which will be deterined
later.

So you have the delightful prospect of
these crowned heads of culture setting up
another Canadian Government at New York,
performing functions yet undetermined but
which involve the expenditure of public
money.
I was taken to task in a most delightful
manner by the charming and brilliant lady
from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) because of the attitude of doubt and suspicion
which, she said, I adopted. Well, I do
not know about the suspicion, but I plead
guilty to the doubt; I have expressed doubt
before, and I express it again now. She
said that she viewed the prospective operations of the council with a sympathetic understanding. Since she is a member of the
governing board of Mount Allison University,
at Sackville, and is hoping for money from
the council for the university's Summer School
of Art, she had better be sympathetic. The
honourable senator is a very fine lady, and
she made a very fine speech. I thoroughly
and heartily agreed with many of her statements, as, for instance, the little argument
she gave me about masterpieces being produced in poverty-produced, as she said, in
spite of rather than because of poverty. If
I have said anything that would lead anybody
to suppose that I am an advocate of poverty,
I wish to correct that impression right now.
May I also add that if great works of art,
such as painting and literature, have been
produced in an atmosphere of unearned
wealth and luxury, it was not because of
unearned wealth but in spite of it. Personally, I like the norm, the mean between
poverty, on the one hand, and unearned
wealth on the other, where works of art are
of commercial value, cherished by the gefieration in which they are produced, and in that
way are a normal function of the human
race.
But, honourable senators, it was the member from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) who
slapped me down most severely. He said
that he would not have spoken at all had it
not been for the challenge from the senators
from Blaine Lake and Toronto-Trinity. My
compliments to the senator from Blaine Lake!
The senator from Inkerman told us that he
is a governor of McGill University, Montreal,
that he anticipates being faced with immense
capital expenditures in the not far distant
future, and that he is looking for grants and
scholarships. In his capacity as a governor
of McGill, he has every reason to be hungry
for money.

Hon. Mr. Reid: They are all looking for a
handout.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He need not be so
utterly ravenous for money, however, as to
overlook and disregard completely the means
whereby he hopes to achieve that end. He
frankly admits that he is going to jump on
the bandwagon. That is all right in one
meaning of the phrase, but I do not approve
of it in the other meaning.
Honourable senators, the expenditure of
public money is the main function of government, and has been all down through the
ages. In the British parliamentary system
the control of the purse strings has been
the toe-hold of Parliament in its battle against
arbitrary rule by the monarchy. The most
important function which our Parliament performs is the expenditure, control and raising
of money. The senator from Inkerman is
a great parliamentarian; I say that seriously,
and I mean it; yet he willingly consents,
apparently, to the transfer of this vital funetion to private individuals, on the off chance
that his university will get some of the
money. Now, if the principle of passing out
public money to private individuals for
distribution is so good, why not let us extend
the idea? Why not handle our expenditures on
social security in the same way that we
now propose to handle our expenditures on
education, that is, pass the money out to
some private individuals, call them a council,
and let them spend it? And why not abolish
vile politics from our military expenditures
by simply handing a few millions of dollars
to an autonomous board, in that way avoiding all the fuss and difficulties of debate in
the House of Commons and here? The principle would be just the same. Or why not
carry it to a logical conclusion and pass all
our parliamentary affairs over to appointed
boards, and get rid of politicians altogether
in this country? Perhaps we could carry it
one step further, as has been done in some
other lands, by delegating our authority and
our powers to spend public money to a
dictator. I think this business of giving the
taxpayers' money to the Canada Council to
distribute according to its own sweet will is
neither good parliamentary custom nor
according to British methods. Nor is it
Liberalism as I was taught and understand it.
Honourable senators, I am proud of the
distinguished part led in higher education
by so many of my fellow members of the
Senate. For instance, the senior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) is Chairman
of the Board of Regents of the United College,
which is affiliated with the University of
Manitoba; the junior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Wall) is on the advisory board of
a college there; my colleague from Banff
(Hon. Mr. Cameron) is Director of the Banff
School of Fine Arts; the member from
Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) is on the

Board of Governors of Mount Allison University; the senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) is on the Board of Governors
of McGill University; the senator from
Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill) is a member of the Senate of the University of New Brunswick, and a governor
of King's College in Halifax. I am proud of
that record of public service without the
walls of this 'chamber. I am sure there are
others here who play an important part in
higher education, although off-hand I cannot
name them. I myself am a Bencher of the
Law Society of Upper Canada, which operates
a very fine and costly law school at Toronto.
I suppose nobody would have the hardihood
to accuse me of serving my own purpose in
this speech.
The senator from Northumberland-Miramichi, with whom I have so often had
the pleasure of agreement, took me to task
for suggesting that irresponsible men may
be appointed to the Canada Council.
I
voiced no disparagement of persons yet to
be appointed, and whose very names are so
far not known. I am quite sure that the
appointees will be very worthy persons indeed. But obviously I was not referring to
the character of the individuals when I
talked about irresponsible persons; my
reference rather was to the irresponsible
position in which they are to be placed. I
consulted the dictionary, and I find the word
"irresponsible" to mean "not answerable".
Does anyone suggest that the members of the
Canada Council will be answerable to the
people whose money they will spend? They
will not be answerable, and in that sense
they will be irresponsible.
Honourable senators, our Constitution carefully guards the right of the elected
representatives of the people in their control
of the taxpayers' money. None of us in this
house .can initiate the expenditure of one
single dollar of public money, because we
are in that regard irresponsible to the people
who furnish the money. In other words, we
are not answerable to the electors, as are
the members of the House of Commons and
the Government of our country. Yet it is
proposed to hand $100 million of public
money over to an autonomous board composed of private individuals who are not
members of Parliament, and not even civil
servants.
I know honourable senators were rather
horrified that a parliamentarian of some little
experience was so impolite as to disagree
with a popular issue and fail to jump on the
band wagon. As a matter of fact, I am
rather shocked at my own temerity in this
matter, particularly when I contemplate that
eminent and distinguished senators, who are

MARCH
governors of universities, are standing around
with their hands out like Oliver Twist asking
for more.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Let me recapitulate my
statement, and in all seriousness. I am not opposed to scholarships; I am in favour of them.
I am not opposed to Government grants for
higher education, but I think they should be
made by the provinces and not by the dominion. I am unalterably opposed to the
transfer of the control over the expenditure
of public money from the responsible representatives of the taxpayer to an irresponsible
body of appointees, such as the proposed
Canada Council, or any other such body for
any other equally good purpose. I am opposed to that, honourable senators, on the
basis of sound parliamentary principles which
we have no right to violate. In due season,
I think, results will justify the doubt that I
have expressed in the course of this debate.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I did not participate in this debate
earlier. My justification for taking part in it
now is that my friend the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has provoked me into saying something. Yesterday,
when I heard he intended to speak this eveing, I told him this might happen.
In order that there rnay be no doubt about
my qualifications-since apparently if one is
a member of the staff of or a governor of a
university he is disqualified from speaking
without prejudice-I hasten to assure the
Senate .that I am not identified in any way
with any institution of learning, except by
way of having been a student a good many
years ago at some institutions of learning
from which, in the course of time, I
graduated.
I also hasten to correct an impression that
one might gather from what my honourable
friend bas said. If any one concluded that it
took my honourable friend 17 years to get
through law school, I would say that is untrue. Knowing my friend's intelligence and
capacity as I do, I am sure he meant to say
that the lapse of time between when he entered law school and the time when he concluded his course was 17 years.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Had a body such as the
Canada Council been in existence at that time
my friend might have completed his course
in a much shorter time. But had he graduated earlier he might not have done a lot of
other things that he did in the meantime.
Moreover, he might have been prevented from
following the course which ultimately led him
to become Attorney Gèeral for the province

of Ontario, in which office he had put into
his hands a certain measure of the taxpayers'
money in that province, and he direàted the
spending. True, he was responsible to the
people, but there were organizations and
groups in Ontario which spent money provided by the people of that province and
were not in a direct sense responsible
to the people. Nevertheless, the whole operation seemed to function very well.
With respect to my friend's remark about
the Canada Council being composed of irresponsible persons, I find in the bill the
same provisions that I find in similar bills
covering, for instance, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a number of other
institutions which operate as Crown companies on behalf of the Government and
receive contributions out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund. This council will not be
an irresponsible body. It will be required,
just as are these other Crown organizations,
to report to Parliament, to give an accounting, and to be subject to audit at each and
every session. I refer honourable senators
to sections 22 and 23 of the bill.
I was quite amused by some of the things
my friend from Toronto-Trinity said this
evening. I havé seen my friend in many
capacities, almost too numerous to mention,
and he always performs in an excellent
way, no matter what cape he puts on for
the occasion. I would remind him that he
and I, have exchanged words very often,
yet we remain the best of friends. I do not
know what right he has to say that in this
debate he is indulging himself in the luxury
of. disagreement. I would say that his treatment of this measure is the regular bill of
fare. My friend usually disagrees, and most
of the time he has proper reasons for doing
so. Usually his disagreement adds to the
tone and consideration of the matter before
us. In fairness I think I can say that his
attitude has been one of disagreement to
many of the matters which have come before
this house. In that regard his disagreement
bas been no more disinterested than the
support which some honourable senators
have given to this bill, and of which he
seems a bit critical tonight. I would strongly
suspect that on numerous occasions in the
past when my honourable friend has either
supported or disagreed with some particular
proposal, deep down inside he had a great
personal interest-and I use that word in its
proper sense-in one side or the other of the
issue. I do not think it can be suggested
with respect to any of the senators who spoke
in favour of the Canada Council bill, and who
were identified with a university, that their
personal interest in and support of the bill
was any stronger than. was the position
taken by my honourable friend on numerous

SENATE
occasions in the past when he manifested
agreement or disagreement with a particular
measure. I do not think the attitude on the
part of these honourable senators either adds
to or takes from the consideration of the
question in the debate. To search in a facetious way for some explanation as to why
some honourable senators would want to
support this bill, or to suggest, even facetiously, that they might be gaining something
by speaking in favour of the bill, and be
standing in line with their hands out for
a donation, does not add to the discussion
of the subject. As humour, perhaps there
is some justification for it, but as argument
I do not think it has any value at all.
My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
said that he had great doubts about the future
of this council. To me, that is an unusal
position for my friend to take. It is the first
time I have known him to have any doubts
of any kind. Indeed, I have always found him
to be a person who felt justified in his view,
and I have liked and appreciated his clearcut and definite attitude towards matters
generally. I venture to say that if he has any
doubts about this subject, he is very positive
in his doubts.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: So far as this bill is
concerned, I find it difficult to appreciate any
objections on the basis of the argument we
have heard. True, the Government is contributing money to this council, because it
provides machinery for more efficient administration of the money granted for scholarships
to encourage study and research. Why we
should be critical because the members of the
council will not be civil servants, I do not
know. I trust and expect that the Government
will appoint capable men, who have had
experience in public life or in business and
professional life, and who will be able to
appreciate what the needs are and know how
to get the greatest value for the money they
spend. And remember, their report must come
before Parliament each year. In any event,
there will be at least as many critical people
watching the expenditures of this Canada
Council as are expecting to qualify for or to
receive grants from it. This will be a wellwatched operation, so well watched that I
am satisfied it will be carefully and properly
conducted. I think it is a step in the right
direction; I think it collects in one place an
efficient administration of the expenditure of
public moneys for a purpose that is in the
best interest of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, could I add just a few words, not by
way of being critical of opinions expressed

by the member from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) but rather perhaps to follow
what the honourable gentleman from Toronto.
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) has just said.
It does seem to me that to be as critical
of the proposed establishment of the Canada
Council as the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity has been is perhaps unwarranted in one respect at least, and that
is that the National Research Council, which
has been functioning now for some 25 or
more years, and operating generally in the
same field, is performing and has performed
in a most creditable way for that time in the
field of science what is now proposed in the
field of arts, the humanities and the social
sciences.
Since the bill received second reading I
have had occasion to make inquiry as to just
what might be expected of the council in a
practical way, and I find that the two
agencies which are not really subsidiary to
the National Conference of Canadian Universities but work in association with the
organization of that body have been doing
work which will, I think, ultimately be done
on a larger scale by the Canada Council.
Those agencies are the Canadian Social
Science Research Council and the Humanities
Research Council of Canada.
The Canadian Social Science Research
Council has been in existence for some 15 or
16 years. Between 1940 and 1956 it received
approximately $600,000 for its purposes, and
I think honourable senators will be interested
in the source of these funds: from the Rockefeller Foundation there came some $482,000;
from the Carnegie Foundation, some $61,000;
from private Canadian sources, individuals,
corporations and the like, some $31,000; and
the Canadian universities themselves contributed in that 16-year period approximately
$24,000, mainly for the purpose of assisting
the council in its administrative work, holding meetings and so on.
With that money that council has established or contributed to pre-doctoral and
post-doctoral fellowships for Canadian students; it has given grants in aid of research;
it has arranged for leave for professors from
their duties at universities to do advanced
studies, and it has helped in the publication
of technical and scientific works in the arts,
humanities and social sciences. I am impressed by my informant by this fact, that
only about one-third of the people who
require this kind of assistance get it from
the council, and then only in a limited
measure.
The Humanities Research Council of Canada has not been in existence so long. I
understand it has recently issued its fifth
annual report, and that from 1953 to 1956
it has spent about $161,000. Where did it

MARCH 12, 1957
get it? From almost the same sources: the
Rockefeller Foundation, over $80,000; the
Carnegie Foundation, $48,000; private Canadian sources, some $19,000; and the universities, for administrative expenses and so
on, some $30,000. The purposes to which
this money was devoted were the same as
those to which the money was devoted by
the Social Science Research Council.
Realizing that such a vast proportion of
this money has come from private foundations outside our country, especially from
the United States-and we shall be eternally
grateful to these foundations for their generosity and understanding help-and realizing also, as I am informed is the case, that
the source of this money is now drying up
to the point where these foundations will
not continue their support, I think it is clear
that something must be done.
It is only fair to say that this is not a local
problem. This is a national problem. It is
just as important for our people to have
good students of the humanities and of the
arts and of the social sciences, in which are
included economics and the political sciences,
as it is for us to have engineers. In one of
the most recent years in the operation of
the National Research Council some $2.5
million was provided for assistance to students in the field of science.
This is not a new problem: it has faced
this country and the people of this country
from the beginning. Honourable senators
may not be astonished to hear that recently,
because of the season of the year and a
celebration associated with it, I have been
looking at some of the speeches of Thomas
D'Arcy McGee. In November, 1867, almost
on the eve of the assembly of the first Parliament of Canada, he made a speech before
the Montreal Literary Club entitled "The
Mental Outfit of the New Dominion". I was
startled to read these sentences:
Most of our industrial and classical colleges . . .
owe their origin to some such acts of private
beneficence;
but the
number of scholarships
founded by wealthy individuals, who have made
large fortunes in this country, might, I fear, be
reckoned on the fingers of one hand. It were
perhaps to be wished that the whole subject of
superior education had remained in some sort
subject to Federal care and superintendence. under
a Federal Minister of Education, capable and
devoted to the task. But the honourable rivalries
of local administrations may be trusted as preventatives against stagnation and exclusiveness.

May I quote another short passage from
one of McGee's speeches which, in fact, was
reproduced in a speech made in 1925 by
Sir Edward Beatty, then President of the
Canadian Pacific Railway Company. McGee
was speaking in 1862 to the Irish Protestant
Society in Quebec, and I think that what he
said then is in the minds of people who are
in favour of the encouragement which through

gleam of authorship, to honour every acquirement
and every natural gift, to lift ourselves to the level
of our destinies.

I think that, in view of the difficulty of
providing the kind of encouragement needed
by people who wish to devote their lives to
the arts, the humanities and the social sciences, a measure of this kind becomes a
national necessity.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the motion is for the third reading of
Bill 47, an Act for the establishment of a
Canada Council for the encouragement of
the arts, humanities and social sciences. Is
it your pleasure to pass the motion?
Hon. Mr. Horner: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed, on
division.
CURRENCY, MINT AND EXCHANGE
FUND BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
March 7, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Honourable Mr. Bradette for the second
reading of Bill H, an Act to amend the Currency, Mint and Exchange Fund Act.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I adjourned the debate on this bill in order
to ascertain whether it would be advisable
to send the bill to committee. I have looked
into this question, and personally I would
like to have the bill referred to committee,
because I believe the date set forth in the bill
for it to be brought into effect is not the
correct date.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO

COMMITTEE

On motion of Honourable Mr. Bradette,
the bill was referred to the Standing Commitee on Banking and Commerce.
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY TRAFFIC BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill Y-7, an Act to amend the
Government Property Traffic Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is not
a lengthy bill. The Government Property
Traffic Act, chapter 324 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, deals with the control of

SENATE

traffic on lands belonging to or occupied by
the Crown in the right of Canada, and it
empowers the Governor in Council to make
regulations with respect to the speed, the
parking, direction of traffic, obstructions to
traffic, and the prohibition of unnecessary
noise. It makes provision for the prescribing of fines and of penalties and for the classification of vehicles. It contains other
provisions. For example, the question of
what constitutes ownership of the Crown
in Crown property may be determined by a
certificate of the Deputy Minister of Public
Works. At the present time the regulations
with reference to traffic on Government
property exclude five different classes of property, namely, the national parks, the territorial lands as defined in the Territorial
Lands Act, Indian reserves, property under
the control of the Federal District Commission, and property to which the airport ve-

hicle control regulations apply.
I wondered what property was left to be
governed by the regulations under this bill,
but I am informed that they will relate, for
example, to roads in military camps, such as
Petawawa, Barriefield and Gagetown, generally army camps throughout the country,
parking in Government properties in Ottawa,
and properties of that kind.
At present the regulations governing the
licensing and operation of vehicles operating
in these Government-owned areas are determined by the provisions of the provincial
law where the properties are located. However, the penalty sections of the regulations
are much more restrictive than the comparable penal sections in the corresponding
provincial laws. The purpose of this amendment is to bring the regulations into line
with the provincial penalty sections. For example, under the existing regulations the
maximum fine which can be imposed is $50,
and the maximum jail sentence which can be
imposed is two months. It is proposed that
the maximum fine be $500 and that the
maximum jail sentence be six months. It is
also provided that under the regulations the
magistrate be empowered to suspend a licence
for a year in an appropriate case. Provision
is also made for the voluntary payment of
fines. In the case of fines or imprisonment the
regulations would provide that the penalty
be the maximum which prevails under provincial law or the maximum which would be
allowed to be applied under this law, whichever is the lesser. The same is true in respect
to the period of suspension of the licence. The
provincial law being the same, then the
maximum suspension would be that provided
for in this section; but if the provincial law
has a larger maximum period of suspension,
then under this regulation the maximum

suspension which could be provided would
be for a period of one year.
The bill is not a difficult one and seems to
be in accord with the type of legislation that
is being passed in the provinces with respect
to the control of traffic and the imposition of
fines and of penalties for traffic violations. It
may be that some honourable senators would
like to have the bill go to committee, where
further information could be obtained from
appropriate officials. If that desire is expressed, I would be glad to move that the
bill be referred to committee.
Hon. Thomas Reid: I for one would like to
see this bill go to committee. There seems to
be a tendency today in certain municipalities
throughout Canada that when a motorist is
alleged to have violated a traffic regulation
a police officer will come along and give him
a ticket. The officer may tell him that if he
wants to be a good fellow he can go down to
police headquarters and pay an automatic
fine. Then he will not have to go into court.
This fine may be $25. On the other hand, if
the motorist feels he has not violated any
traffic regulation and decides to fight the case
in court, he is liable, if found guilty, to be
fined $50 for the same offence.
Up to now there has been no provision for
voluntary payment of fines for breaches of
any traffic regulations on Government property. Now we are making this provision,
and at the same time we are providing for
a fine of $500 or a term of imprisonment not
exceeding six months. There is no provision,
however, as to whether it is to be a fine or
an imprisonment, and apparently it is left
to the police officer to decide whether the
motorist can make a voluntary payment of
a fine.
I would like to see this bill go to committee where I could ask questions regarding
this matter, for it seems to me that we are
embodying an entirely new principle in
federal legislation.
Hon. Jean-François Poulio: Honourable
senators, I am sorry to say it but this bill
seems foggy to me. The honourable senator
from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) has
given an interesting explanation, but it would
seem from what he has said that this is a
kind of conflicting legislation. It conflicts
with other statutes. He has not said why the
maximum penalty has been increased tenfold,
from $50 to $500.
The amendment provides for something
much more drastic than the legislation now
in force. If this bill provides for control
of all Government property, I wonder what
it has to do with the Federal District Commission whose grounds surround the Parliament Buildings. ' My honourable colleague
from Ottawa West knows what was contended

MARCH 12, 1957
by the representatives of the Federal
District Commission when they appeared
before a committee of the Senate. They were
adamant and they were stupid. They wanted
the personnel of the Senate to park their
cars under the Plaza Bridge, when there
was good space near the Parliament Buildings.
Finally the views of the committee prevailed
and the Federal District people had to
acknowledge that it was only pure common
sense to allow the Senate employees to park
their cars near the Parliamentary Library,
north of the Parliament Buildings.
Honourable senators, I am not making a
speech; this is just a preamble to some
questions I wished to ask the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa West, in view of the
generous offer he has made to us. In the
first place, what is the reason behind the
tenfold increase in the penalty section of
this bill? I did not have time to read
Chapter 324 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada but my second question is this. Does
Bill Y-7 apply to the grounds under the
control of the Federal District Commission?
Those are my first questions, and if the
honourable gentleman who explained this
bill will be kind enough to answer them I
will have more questions to put to him.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask the sponsor
of this bill if this provision applies to driving and parking on Parliament Hill? Does
he mean to say that if I drive my car up
here and park it in the wrong place I may
be fined $500, or sent to jail; or be obliged to
go somewhere else and told to pay $300 or
$400? I think that is ridiculous.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
want to be honest with you. I find this is
a kind of legislation that does not satisfy
the mind, that one who reads this bill will
not know what it means; it is not selfexplanatory. What are the present regulations which have been adopted in virtue of
Chapter 324, of the Revised Statutes? It
seems only fair to ask the honourable gentleman to give us an idea of the regulations
which prescribe penalties that are being so
greatly increased. It is an enormous increase
in the fine, from $50 to $500. And that is
not all; the amendment is still more drastic;
it authorizes the Governor in Council to make
regulations
providing for the voluntary payment of fines and
for prohibiting persons who have violated any
regulation from driving a vehicle on such lands
for any period not exceeding one year.

It is the first time I have read such a
provision in a statute. There is serious
doubt in my mind, and I am sure in the
minds of other senators, about this legislation; it is new and different from all traffic
legislation in the past, and therefore I hope

that the honourable gentleman will be kind
enough to read to us the regulations which
have been passed in virtue of this legislation
under Chapter 324.
I was rather surprised the other day when
the Narcotics bill was sent to the Banking
and Commerce Committee. We have a
Public Health and Welfare Committee, with
doctors among its members, yet that bill
was sent to the Banking and Commerce
Committee. In my view, all the committees
could be very useful to the Senate, and that
is the reason for their being appointed. If,
therefore, the present bill is sent to a committee, I hope it will be to the Committee on
Transport and Communication and not to
the Committee on Banking and Commercenor to the Divorce Committee! And I hope
that all suggestions will be considered.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I ask the honourable gentleman who introduced the bill if he will consent to have
the bill sent to committee, where we can discuss it, for I am afraid there is going to be
some opposition to the measure.
The
honourable member from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) fears that if he drives his car
into the grounds of the Parliament Buildings
and parks it in a wrong place some official
can come along and fine him $500. If that
is so, I for one am not going to vote for the
bill. I have been on the Committee of Public Buildings and Grounds continuously, and
we have had an awful lot of trouble in regard
to parking space. I think the very least we
can do is to make sure that senators and
members of the other house have first claim
to parking on the grounds, and we should not
make ourselves ridiculous by providing
that a man can be fined $500 for parking in
a wrong place. It may be said that such
a person would not be fined, but it is quite
possible that a magistate would fine him. I
have been practising law for 53 years, and I
have known certain magistrates before whom
I would hate to appear on a question of this
kind, for they would be quite likely to impose
a fine. In Manitoba we had a judge of that
kind in our courts. Any person who appeared
before him charged with a driving offence
would be beaten before he started. We
lawyers would say to such a client, "I am
very sorry, but you will have to agree to the
expense of going to the Court of Appeal
before you start; if not, we will not take
your case." In such cases we always had
to go to the Court of Appeal, and we were
always in the wrong-they always threw us
out.
Honourable senators, I suggest that this
bill go to committee and that officials be
brought to satisfy the honourable member
from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot)

SENATE
and the rest of us, on this matter, for personally I am greatly opposed to this kind of
thing in an official way. It should not be
possible that one who drives his car into the
Parliament Buildings grounds might leave
himself open to a fine of $500, and I am
certainly not going to allow that to happen
if I can prevent it.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: This is not an invitation
to visit the national parks.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: May I remind the
bouse that if the honourable senator speaks
now he will close the debate?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I thank honourable
senators for the contribution they have made.
I do not propose to try to answer all the questions that have been asked, but perhaps I
might tell the honourable gentleman from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot), in the
first place, who asked me to read the regulations, that they are very lengthy. They are
to be found in P.C. 4076, dated September
17, 1952, and will be available at the committee, if the bill is referred to a committee.
With reference to the question of a $500
fine, let me say that in Ontario at the present
time any person racing a vehicle on a highway
is liable on the first offence to a penalty of
not less than $25 and not more than $100,
and for any subsequent offence to a penalty
of not less than $100 and not more than $500,
and also to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. In Quebec a person convicted of racing a motor vehicle on a highway is liable on the first offence to a penalty
of not less than $100 and not more than
$200, and for any subsequent offence, not less
than $300 and not more than $500, and also
to imprisonment for a term of not less than
a month and nor more than three months.
These are the several types of offences to
which the maximum penalty might apply,
depending on what the provincial law in
the circumstances might be.
I give those to honourable senators as
examples only, because I think the full explanation might better be given in committee.
There is one other point I should mention.
A question has been raised about Federal
District Commission driveways in Ottawa,
and whether these regulations apply to them.
I am informed they do not. Actually, the
regulations specifically exempt those properties. But I am also informed that the
Federal District Commission have their own
regulations with reference to traffic on their
property. Parliament Hill is another question.
But I think after this matter has been considered in comittee it will be abundantly

clear to us all that we do not run a risk of
a fine of $500 for parking in the wrong place
on Parliament Hill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa
West), the bill was referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 46, an Act to amend the Export
Credits Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill proposes certain amendments to the Export
Credits Insurance Act, which was passed by
Parliament at the 1944-45 session.
This act was designed for the purpose of
enabling the Canadian exporter of goods to
a foreign country to insure himself against
the possibility of loss through non-payment
of the selling price by the foreign buyer. At
the conclusion of the Second World War there
were many risks in the export of goods from
Canada, and for an adequate premium this
corporation would provide the necessary
coverage. It will be observed that the scope
of authority of the corporation was only as
to goods which had been sold.
The bill now before us deals with four
matters. First, it extends the scope of the
insurance coverage, as set out in paragraph
3 of the bill. An exporter who ships goods
abroad for exhibition purposes and then decides to sell them in a foreign country rather
than return them to Canada can be covered
by insurance. In other words, if the exporter
does not receive his selling price, the corporation will reimburse him to that extent.
Secondly, it is designed to cover goods
shipped abroad on consignment and subsequently sold in a foreign country.
The third situation which this bill is designed to cover is where a manufacturing
company in Canada ships Canadian goods to
its wholly owned subsidiary abroad, which
in turn sells the goods. Such goods are now
brought within the provisions of the act. For
the purposes of the Export Credit Insurance
Corporation such a transaction is regarded as
a direct transaction between a Canadian exporter and a foreign purchaser.
A fourth matter which the amendments
would cover is services. As honourable
senators know, Canadian firms which supply
and
technical
construction,
engineering,
similar services sometimes spend a good deal
of time and money in the preparation of

MARCH 12, 1957
plans and engineering data for construction
enterprises being carried on in foreign countries. This bill is designed to permit such
people to insure their services in the forn of
engineering material, plans, et cetera, to the
extent of the contract for payment of those
services in the foreign country.
Honourable senators, those are the extensions of the scope of the insurance authority of the corporation by these proposed
amendments.
There is another feature to the bill. When
the corporation was set up the practice had
been to provide annual reserves out of surplus
of revenue over expenditures against the
liability that might follow in subsequent
years. At the 1952-53 session Parliament
amended the act, and gave statutory sanction
to the setting up of such reserve to the limit
of $5 million. Significantly, the statute provided that the surplus of revenue over expenses and losses was to be added to this
reserve each year until it reached $5 million.
However, in that year sorne amendments were
made to the Financial Administration Act of
1952, one of which was to list Crown companies in different categories. We put what
are called proprietary Crown companies in
Schedule D to that act. And in an amendment
to the Income Tax Act we provided that
Crown companies in Schedule D of the Financial Administration Act were subject to income tax in the sarne way as any other
corporation.
As you can see, Parliament had intended
that this corporation should set up a reserve
of a certain amount out of surplus over
revenue and expenditures; yet the rather unfortunate language of the Income Tax Act
prevented that kind of reserve being set up.
The corporation, in respect of its earnings,
became subject to income tax before it could
set aside anything by way of reserve. Of
course the cost of administration and insurance would be substantially increased if
that condition existed for very long.
Secondly, this kind of insurance is a service which is being given to exporters from
various other countries. Surely Canadian
exporters are entitled to the same kind of
service at as reasonable a cost as possible.
For that reason it is felt that a clarification
of the act is now needed.
The amendment in section 2, on page 2
of the bill, Is for the purpose of saying that
moneys which are put into the reserve
fund should not be subject to tax until
such time as the fund has reached $5
million. When that amount has been reached
the corporation carries on in the same way
as any other corporation.
Before sitting down, honourable senators,
I should perhaps tell you how well this

corporation has been doing. It wrote its first
policy in September 1945.
During its 11
years of operation, up to September 30, 1956,
it has insured export sales totalling $350
million, for which it charged a premium of
$3.2 million. That is an average premium
cost of less than 1 per cent. The gross claims
paid to policy holders total $7.7 million;
recoveries up to this time amount to $4.3
million; there have been write-offs of only
$176,000. At the present time there are outstanding claims totalling $3.3 million, of
which we hope to make substantial recoveries. That situation exists mainly because
certain funds have from time to time become
blocked in various countries; the exporter
is paid, and the corporation, which is in a
better position to wait, has to wait until the
funds become free.
Honourable senators, this would seem to
me to be the type of bill which, when it
receives second reading, should be referred
to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Have there been any
serious losses suffered under this act already?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The only loss is the
write-offs of $176,000.
There are unpaid
balances of $3.3 million which the corporation
still expects to collect.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand that one
country has refused to pay?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not so informed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand one country
has refused to pay, and it is for that reason
this legislation is brought before us.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I may say to my friend
that there can be no relationship between the
suggestion that one country has refused to
pay, and the proposed amendments. The
purpose of this bill bas to do with the
financial condition of the corporation. The
bill relates mainly to extending the insuring
authority of the corporation to cover additional transactions beyond the actual sales of
goods. My honourable friend's statement
may be true, but I say to him I am not so
informed. I have no information as to
whether there is a loss or not. Al I do know
is that the only write-offs that have been
made to date amount to $176,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand that Turkey
has not made any payments on its contracts,
and that the loss in that case is estimated
at $4 million.
However, what I object to in this bill is the
relief that this Government corporation is
going to receive in connection with incorne
tax. Al private corporations have to pay

SENATE
corporation income tax, while this corporation is to be shown special consideration.
Why should this Government corporation not
pay income tax on the same basis as private
companies?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, this
bill deals with a matter of trade and also of
finance. I am wondering to which committee
it will be sent. Will it be the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade Relations or the
Standing Committee on Finance? Would the
honourable gentleman inform us as to that?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, as
far as I am concerned it is not within my
authority to move that this bill be sent to any
particular committee. It is a Government
bill, and it is up to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to
state to which committee he proposes to send
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Then I direct the question to the honourable leader.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I have not given a great deal of consideration
to the question, but I would think this is an
appropriate bill to go to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon Mr. Pouliot: That seems to be the
omnibus committee; everything apparently
goes to that committee. One might imagine
that there is a pipe line through which all
bills are directed to the Banking and Commerce committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Not all bills are
referred to that committee. One bill tonight
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications. It is up to
the house to decide, but I would suggest that
the Banking and Commerce Committee would
be the appropriate one for this bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

NARCOTIC CONTROL BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendment made by the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to
Bill D, an Act to provide for the control of
narcotic drugs.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden m'oved that the
amendment be concurred in.
He said: Honourable senators, may I tell
you that the amendment was simply to provide that the act, when passed by Parliament,
will come into force on Royal Proclamation.
In the form in which the bill was before us,
with no date stated, it would have come into
force on Royal Assent, but the department
requested this provision so that it would have
time to prepare the regulations and also to
acquaint the people throughout the country
who operate under the provisions of the act
what the changes will be.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendment was concurred in.

TAXES COLLECTED IN NEWFOUNDLAND
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Calveri C. Prat: Honourable senators,
I would like to give notice of the following
question of the Government:
What are the total amounts of sales taxes and
excise taxes collected within the province of Newfoundland for the last fiscal year, and how much
of each of those taxes are on
(a) Goods imported into Newfoundland.
(b) Goods manufactured in Newfoundland.
Also what is the amount within each of those
categories collected on
(1) Tobacco and tobacco products;
(2) Alcoholic beverages;
(3) Non-alcoholic beverages;
(4) Ten other leading items of importation and
manufacture?

Apart from the general interest in having
these figures I would like the information for
the purpose of appraising their effect on
manufacturing industries in the province of
Newfoundland. With the constantly increasing freight rates to our province these taxes
become an increasingly adverse factor in
competitive costs with industries in the central
provinces.
INTERNAL ECONOMY
COMMITTEE MEETING

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I would be thankful to the honourable Leader of the Government if he would
tell us if the Internal Economy Committee
will be meeting soon. I would like to know
because I am running short of a stationery
supply. I did not make any requisition since
the 11th of January.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I am sure that if the honourable senator will
make a request he will obtain whatever
stationery he requires. I can guarantee him
that.
I think I can also give him a guarantee
that there will soon be a meeting of the
Internal Economy Committee. I expect it
will be held next week. Some further developments have occurred in connection with
the installation of an amplification system in
the chamber, and when that information is
available I shall have it presented to the
Internal Economy Committee. I think it is
better to defer the meeting of the committee
until that information is obtained.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I thank the honourable
gentleman, and taking into consideration his
encouraging reply I shall put aside the question I intended to ask today about the sittings
of the committee, and keep it for a further
emergency.

MARCH 13, 1957
DIVORCE STATISTICS
NOTICE OF INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
wish to give notice of the following inquiry
for Wednesday, March 20:
1. What was the population of Canada at the
time of Confederation (1867) and what is it now?
2. How many divorce cases have been heard by
the Divorce Committee of the Senate during each
parliamentary session
(a) from 1867 to 1872 inclusive, and
(b) from 1952 to 1957 inclusive?
3. What was the average proportion of divorce
cases heard by the Senate Divorce Committee, in
relation to the population of Canada,
(a) from 1867 to 1872 inclusive, and
(b) from 1952 to date?

If any honourable senators wish to know
why I ask these questions, it is because at
the time of Confederation the number of
divorce cases was much smaller than it is
now; and if we multiply the number of
divorce cases during the first period after
Confederation, and, in accordance with the
spirit of the Fathers of Confederation, the
lawmakers, multiply that number by four,
equivalent to the increased population, we
could set a limit on this basis to the number
of divorce cases to be heard in any year, and
additional petitions could be put on a waiting list to be heard at subsequent sessions.
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS
HIGHWAY, RAILWAY AND AIRNOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
give notice of the following further inquiry
for Wednesday, March 20:
During each one of the last ten years:
1. How many persons have been killed or injured
in Canada
(a) in collisions between motor vehicles and
trains,
(b) in other railway accidents,
(c) in other motor vehicle accidents, and
(d) in airplane accidents?
2. What was the total approximate amount of the
losses suffered thereby
(a) by the owners of motor vehicles,
(b) by the railway companies,
(c) by the airplane companies,
(d) by the insurance companies?
3. Is it the intention of the Senate to instruct
the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications of the Senate to investigate the loss
of lives due to collisions between motor vehicles and
trains and other railway and motor vehicle accidents
as well as airplane accidents and make recommendations to reduce the number of such losses
of lives?
4. If so, when?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not see how it is
possible to answer the third question of the
honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot). He wants to know if it
is the intention of the Senate to instruct
the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications to make an investigation. I
do not know who is in a position to answer
the question. I cannot answer it.

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I would ask the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to please
give me the answers he can. My impression
is that, as always, I will be satisfied with
them.
DOMINION CURLING CHAMPIONSHIPS
TRIBUTES TO COMPETING RINKS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with may I take a few minutes to explain
my absence from this chamber last week.
I was in the city of Kingston, Ontario, helping
the Dominion Curling Association decide
which province in Canada has the finest curling rink. I might say quite candidly that
this rink would also be the finest in the world,
for there are no curlers anywhere comparable
to the finalists for the MacDonald's Brier
Tankard, symbolic of the Dominion Curling
Championships.
This year the competing teams came from
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Manitoba, northern Ontario, "old" Ontario,
Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland,
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
These
championships have spanned thirty-one years
-they were not held for three years during
World War II-and I have had the honour
of being present at twenty-six. As Chairman
of the Board of Trustees of the trophy, I have
had quite a bit to do with the arrangements
for these championships.
I think the competition and the whole
tournament at Kingston was just about the
best in the history of the Canadian game.
Before congratulating the winning rink I
would like to pay special tribute to the young
rink from Prince Edward Island. Their progress over the preceding year was the greatest
shown by any provincial rink, and was the
Island's finest representation in twenty-eight
years. The young men on the rink are a
great credit to their province, and even the
top-notch rinks had to play their last rock
on the last end before beating them out.
Curling has become one of our great
national games. There are in this country
nearly four times as many women curlers
and twice as many male curlers as there were
thirty years ago. During the past winter
representatives from the Royal Caledonian
Curling Club of Scotland, the mother of
curling, and representatives from the leading
curling association in the United States, met
in Canada for the first time with Canadian
curling officials. The Scots and the Americans
acknowledged that Canada is now the greatest
curling centre in the world. Various rules
and regulations were discussed, and with two
small exceptions the Scottish and American

SENATE
curlers decided to accept our rules, which, of
course, were originally based on those of
Scotland.
As honourable senators are probably aware,
the Alberta rink captured the coveted MacDonald's Brier Tankard and became the
twenty-ninth possessor of this trophy which

through the competition without a loss. I
must tell you a little story about this rink. It
was so much ahead in the last game that the
skip, Matt Baldwin, did not need to throw
his own two rocks. But when he threw the
first one he jumped on it and rode it halfway down the ice until it came to a stop. The
spectators, not having seen anything like
that before in curling competition, were
simply amazed, and when he came to throw
his second rock they yelled "Ride it out.
Ride it out." So he jumped on it and rode
it clear down to the tee in the middle of the
rings. I had never heard of such a thing,
and it shows the calibre of curling displayed
in those competitions. It was simply magnificent. Frequently one shot in one end
decided a game. The Campbell brothers from
Avonlea, Saskatchewan, placed second, and
the Stone rink from British Columbia placed
third. The Manitoba rink finished fourth.
The people of Kingston deserve a great
deal of credit for the wonderful reception
they gave the curlers and officials. Their
hospitality exceeded anything we had ever
experienced before. They even went so far
as to make your humble servant an honorary
member of the City Council and gave me a
key to the city. I thought I might have to
use it for my honourable friend to my left
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), but I kept him under close
observation and so did not have to get him
out of any place.
Perhaps I should not say this, but I will.
I spoke six times at public meetings in
the first three days, and at the conclusion of
my last speech a lady came up to me and
said, "Senator Haig, I don't think we will
abolish the Senate". So the Senate is safe
for another year anyway.
Next winter the Dominion Curling Championships will be held in Victoria, British
Columbia, and will help that province celebrate its centennial. The competitors will
travel on dome trains through the Rocky
Mountains from Calgary to Vancouver.
Honourable senators, I was never so proud
to be a Canadian as when I watched the
various provincial curling rinks, representing
the young manhood of our country, stepping
out on the ice to play this strictly amateur
sport. They are not professional athletes;
they .play for the love of the game. Both on

and off the ice they were a credit to their
provinces and to their country, and I want
to congratulate them on their magnificent
showing. I am sure that next year they will
do even better. I congratulate Alberta as
the winner, and also Prince Edward Island
on the wonderful progress that small province has made since it became active in
this organization ten years ago.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators, I greatly admire contestants who take
part in the game of curling, and I can well
understand the enthusiasm of the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) for
that game. However, it is a little amusing
to me that the game requires four men and
two brooms on each side, whereas the game
that I play, and in which I am an expert,
requires only one man on each side-and
without brooms. I am speaking of billiards.
My friend should not forget as long as I
am at my desk here, that I am a champion.
I am proud to stand here and say that I am
undefeated amateur billiards champion of
Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to say to the honourable
senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte)
that we rejoice in his accomplishments over
the years, and we hope that he will remain
the undefeated billiards champion. He set
a very high standard, and it is doubtful if
anyone else will ever attain to it.
I am sure I express the feeling of all
present when I say how happy we were that
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
was able to be present at the MacDonald's
Brier competition in Kingston last week. We
missed him in the house very much and we
missed his speeches, but we were glad that
the citizens of Kingston had an opportunity
to hear the fine style of oratory he displays
in this chamber from day to day. May I add
that the Senate is proud that the Leader
of the Opposition has held such an important
office in curling for so many years; it is an
office that requires the confidence of the
curlers of Canada, and he has carried out his
duties with great distinction and complete
fairness. Next year the MacDonald's Brier
championships will be played in Victoria and
we all hope that upon his return from them
he will give us another stirring account of the
competing rinks and their plays.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.

SECOND READING

SENATE
I am sure, honourable senators, we all
realize that agriculture, as one of the very
important branches of our economy, has not
shared in the general prosperity of our
country as it should have done. The prices
for what our farmers have had to sell have
been low in comparison with the cost of the
commodities they have had to buy; perhaps
this is one of the reasons why our agriculturists find it so difficult to borrow funds in
order to carry on their farm operations.
In view of this situation which we know
does exist, I feel sure we will all welcome
this amendment, as it will make available
additional funds for the Farm Loair Board
to carry out the intentions of the Canadian
Farm Loan Act, passed by Parliament some
28 years ago.
The interest rate on loans at the present
time is 5 per cent. At one time the mortgage
term was 25 years; now it is 30 years. However, payments are on an amortized scheme,
so the borrower pays so much on interest
and capital each year. If the borrower wishes
to pay on a 10-, 15- or 20-year scheme, that
can be arranged, and if he wishes to pay
semi-annually he can do so.
During the years the act has been in operation there have been times when a loss has
been shown in the board's operation. Recently
there has been a small profit. The profit
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1956 was
$173,175 after taxes.
No dividend has been paid on the capital
stock.
This amending bill has only one clause,
and its purpose is to increase the capital of
the board from $3 million to $4 million.
Honourable senators, I commend this bill
to your favourable consideration.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
we have heard a full explanation of this
bill by the senator from HuronPerth (Hon.
Mr. Golding), and I am sure we are all
pleased that the scope of operations of the
Canadian Farm Loan Board is to be increased.
However, I have heard a good deal of
complaint in the area from which I come
that the board has failed to perform the
function it was intended to fulfil. It may
be that the board has been unduly cautious
in the placing of loans. I have heard farmers
complain that even when they made application for a loan and asked to have their assets
appraised, weeks and months passed before
a representative of the board would call to
advise them of the action to be taken or
even to value their assets. That type of
complaint seems to be quite general.
A further complaint against the board is
that in the placing of loans it would seem

to discriminate against certain parts of the
For instance, that part of the
country.
west known as the dried-out or burned-out
area seems to have been entirely excluded
from the board's assistance. Any farmer from
that area who writes in for a loan is usually
told that the board is not making loans in
that locality. Such a refusal not only is discouraging to the applicant, but it hurts his
feelings, because there are in the locality
successful farmers who would be worthy at
least of having their assets valued and of
receiving assistance by way of a loan.
In the so-called dried-out area there are
farmers who operate on irrigated land. They
too seem to be excluded from consideration
by members of the board. These farmers
for the most part have valuable assets, good
pasture and fodder for their stock, and they
may at times require some capital to make
better use of the assets they have. Notwithstanding that, if they are on irrigated land
they do not seem to be able to get a farm
loan.
I voice these complaints, honourable senators, because I have heard them so often,
and because I feel the farmers in the dry
and irrigated areas have a right to receive
assistance from the Canadian Farm Loan
Board.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to delay the house long. Generally speaking, I lend my support to a measure
of this kind. In this instance, I am well
acquainted with the Chairman of the Farm
Loan Board and know him to be a most
capable man.
But I can understand how there is some
hesitation on the part of the board to place
money in dried-out areas; and I can understand its reluctance to lend money to farmers
who operate on irrigated land. These may
be questions of board policy, about which I
know nothing. Perhaps they should be gone
into with a view to testing their justification.
A committee has been set up, of which the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner), is a member, which investigates
the problems of the farmers all over the
country. When the report of that committee
is received I am sure we will be better able
to offer suggestions for the correction of
present problems.
I know the board's manager at Winnipeg.
He is a very able man, brought up in one of
our best farming communities-GladstoneNeepawa. The honourable member from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) will know where
that is. He is a capable young farmer, I
would say about forty. I went through university with his uncle, so I have had an
opportunity of knowing the family for a good

MARCH 13, 1957
many years. This man enjoys meeting the
f armers and going out and investigating their
problems, and he is really good at it.
I will now discuss the point that my
honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) and myself are equally critical
of. When the board makes a loan to a farmer
it places a lien on everything he owns, not
only a mortgage on his farm, but a chattel.
mortgage on his machinery and equipment.
That policy creates a lot of difficulty for the
farmer. It may be the policy of the Government-I do not know-it may be policy which
the board is carrying out under instructions,
but it certainly is not a good policy, for the
effect of it is that when the farmer urgently
needs ready money he finds himself in the
greatest difficulty. As I said, the board not
only takes a mortgage on his land, but it also
takes a chattel mortgage on all his machinery
and equipment. That may be a way of keeping the farmer from getting into additional
debt through borrowing money from other
sources, but at the same time it does tie him
up badly. During the parliamentary recess,
when I am back home, five or six farmers a
month will come in to ask me to see if something cannot be done for them by way of
lifting these mortgages.
Originally, the board lent money on the
security of the land only, but with increased
borrowings the land did not provide enough
security to permit lending the increased
amounts, so the farmers had to borrow from
other people, probably paying an interest rate
of one or one and a half per cent higher for
the accommodation. However, they were
willing to pay a higher rate to obtain money
to discharge their obligations.
I would suggest to the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
that some investigation should be made by
the Government as to whether it is necessary
to place these chattel mortgages on a
farmer's equipment when he obtains a loan
from the Farm Loan Board.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That practice has been
done away with.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I am certainly glad
to hear that. But it must have been done
away with only recently.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine:
year.

It was dropped last

Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I thought, it
was done away with only recently.
However, the same criticism applies to the
case of a loan made under the Farm Improvement Loans Act, where a farmer on a
loan from a bank, buys a tractor, for instance,
and gives the bank a mortgage on it. The
Government guarantees such loans to a certain degree, but here again I would suggest
82719-23j

that a change be made. I do not think that
arrangement helps the farmer a bit. I know,
because I deal with dozens of these cases in
the province of Manitoba.
Under this
arrangement the farmers are right up against
it. A farm cannot be run without machinery,
yet the banks are in a opsition to say, "If you
do not pay your loan we will have to take the
machinery away"; and the Farm Loan Board
on the other hand, says, "If you do not pay
the mortgage debt on the farm we will take
the farm." What is the farmer to do in
between the two fires?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That is not done very
much.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, no? It is just starting.
Evidently you do not have to deal with these
matters as I do. For instance, recently a
farmer went into a bank where a relative
of mine happens to be manager, and in the
discussion the manager advised the farmer
he would have to pay off his loan. The
farmer said, "Well, if that's the attitude you
take I will have to go and see Senator Haig
about this." Then he added "By the way,
your name is Haig, are you a relative of the
senator?" The manager replied, "Yes, he is
my dad." The farmer retorted, "Well, he is
not half as hard to deal with as you are."
The bank was pressing for repayment. Al
the banks are doing that today, and if the
loan is not repaid the bank has to get an
extension of the guarantee from the Government, failing which the Government cannot
be held to the guarantee. It is this sort of
thing that I am critical of.
Honourable senators, I did not know that
the Farm Loan Board had discarded the system that I have been criticizing until my
honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) told me about it just now, but I
may say that while it was in operation it
posed a terrible problem. As late as last
summer a number of cases were going
through my office, and I got discharges of
some chattel mortgages.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Those must have
been on loans made some time ago.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be so. This was
in April or May last year.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: They were probably old
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would like to see these
things changed, especially the provision
whereby the farmer's machinery is mortgaged to the bank. It makes for a very
difficult proposition for the farmer.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I have just a few words to say. The honourable senator who explained this bill (Hon.

SENATE
Mr. Golding) said that the valuation of a farm
for loan purposes is set at 65 per cent of its
true value, but I would point out that that
is only one man's opinion. In some cases the
land is valued at the municipality's assessed
value, although land in the vicinity has been
selling at prices double the assessed value
and is really worth it. I would point out
that assessments vary from municipality to
municipality throughout the west. They are
not all equalized as between one municipality and another, for one municipality may
have a low assessment value and a high mill
rate while an adjacent municipality has a
high assessment and a low mill rate. That
state of affairs leads to confusion in
determining the value of farms for loan
purposes.
I listened to the complaint of the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw). The trouble is that the board ties
a farmer up completely, and thereby he becomes a poor risk for a bank, so that in times
when he needs a few dollars urgently he is
unable to borrow.
As a general rule I am strongly opposed
to long-term loans, and I would advise
farmers not to enter into them if they possibly can avoid doing so. To place a mortgage on your land for 30 years is, to me,
the same as entering into a long term of
bondage.
Another thought which occurs to me is that
there are favoured districts where loans can
be secured easily, and other districts where
the board will refuse to lend at all. Anyone
who has had experience of conditions in
western Canada knows that there are farmers
who, although everything seems to be against
them, are a good risk. Though they live in
a dry area they can manage to make a good
living. So I do not believe that any hard
and fast rule should be applied, or injustice
will be done by the refusal of loans to some
who, although their land may not be of first
quality, are capable of making repayment.
I recall many cases in which I preferred
to lend money to a man on poor land than
to one whose property, from a mortgage point
of view, was excellent. My point is that
inspectors and valuators could avoid a lot
of criticism by adopting a more realistic view
of the situation and, instead of barring out
certain areas, considering an applicant on
the basis of his record and reputation.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Ronourable senators,
I spoke on this subject when it was before
us last year. The criticism put forward by
the honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) is not especially applicable to the part of Saskatchewan in which
I live. What we are concerned about is a
situation of another kind. If a farmer who

owns a half-section clear of encumbrance,
and another half-section with a mortgage,
makes application to the board for a mortgage
on his clear half-section he cannot obtain it
unless he includes the other half-section as
security, and all his debts must be paid off
or he cannot get five cents. So, though his
land may be valuable, if the encumbrances
on it are considerable a farmer finds it almost
impossible to borrow money from the board.
Another consideration is that by accepting
one of these mortgages his credit is gone; he
cannot borrow any money from a bank.
His land assets are tied up, and banks will
not lend on a chattel mortgage. So all his
security is held by the Farm Loan Board,
and he is in a more difficult position than
if he had no loan at all.
Hon T. A. Crerar: The honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) said that
a farmer who has two half-sections of land,
one mortgaged and the other with a clear
title, is unable to borrow from the Farm
Loan Board on the half-section which had a
clear title. In the case of the half-section
which was mortgaged, would he not have
covenanted to pay that debt, and would not
that covenant put a cloud on the title of the
second half-section?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. In the province
of Saskatchewan, at any rate, a judgment
cannot be had on a covenant under an agreement for sale or a mortgage. You cannot
sue on a covenant there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Nor in Manitoba.

EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Macdonald, for Hon. Mr. Hayden,
moved the third reading of Bill 46, an Act
to amend the Export Credits Insurance Act.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
as I had yesterday expressed a wish to say
a few words about this bill, I appreciate the
opportunity afforded to me by the sponsor,
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden), who asked that the motion for
third reading be postponed until today. I
do not intend to make any extended references to the subject-matter, but there are a
few points which I should like to bring out
and which I hope will be useful.
I believe that the corporation which was
established under this Export Credits Insurance Act now up for amendment is one of
whose importance the public is largely unaware. It is tied in very closely with Canada's export trade. The possibilities before
it and its potential usefulness are, to my
mind, much greater than has been demonstrated since its organization. It is well
managed and has been set up to do a good
job, but like all export credit insurance
agencies it is of recent creation and it will
take time before it can fully take part in the
business life of the country.
As honourable senators know, last year Canada's export trade amounted to $4,789,000,000,
of which amount our trade to the United States

accounted for something over $2,800,000,000.
We now have a severe deficit in our trade
balance, so I am sure we are all aware of the
importance of building up our export trade.
The average Canadian businessman is not
export-minded, and this is a natural thing.
Some provinces live mostly by exports, but
in other provinces the people do not focus
their minds on export trade. Their interests
revolve around local issues. Many firms find
it a lot more hazardous to carry on an export
trade than to do business around their own
localities. I am thinking not of the large
companies or the well-organized firms that
have sales offices, export departments and
so on, but rather of the smaller firms that
manufacture products which could be exported rather than sold for home consumption only.
One of the leading facilities for helping
to reduce the hazards of export trade-and
what is of greatest importance, the enlargement of the scope of that trade-is export
credits insurance. The organization which we
have in Canada not only can take care of
insurance against bad debts arising in
foreign markets, but it can also extend such
facilities as obtaining credit references,
checking on the desirability of customers,
protect in a measure foreign exchange risks,
and so forth. This is all part and parcel of
the function of such an export insurance
agency.
Credit export insurance in Canada covers
only 1¼ per cent of our total exports. It is
true that the Export Credits Insurance
Corporation does not cover exports to the
United States, which constitute nearly 60
per cent of our total export trade, but 40
per cent of our exports go to other countries
where such insurance can be a helpful factor.
In England a government agency takes care
of export credits. This agency is a branch
of the Board of Trade, which is the equivalent of our Department of Trade and Commerce. The United Kingdom export credits
insurance organization is authorized to insure up to a limit of £500 million, and that
authority was recently increased to £750
million. The amount underwritten, I am informed, is somewhere between 8 and 12
per cent of the total exports of Great
Britain. Allowances have to be made in
calculating these percentages for some overlapping between the customers who are insured as, say, manufacturers, export agents,
and so forth.
In Canada, as I said, export insurance
amounts to a total of only 1* per cent of
the total exports. The exporters who are insured share a part of the risk. In this case,
the risk is 85 per cent on the Insurance
Corporation, and 15 per cent on the insuring

SENATE

exporter. In that way there is an obligation
on the exporter to be alert-to be on his
toes to see that he does good business and
sells to responsible customers. I cannot think
of anything fundamentally sourider than that
approach. Business done by letters of credit,
which really means establishing the funds
here before shipment, is not covered.
In what I have learned from the consultations I have had about export credits insurance conducted in Canada, I have reason to
believe that those who handle it know their
business and are out to give good service
to the public. I really think, however, that
they may be a bit too cramped, partly by
reason of an inadequate financial set-up,
and partly by self-imposed and somewhat
rigid restrictions in the interest of safe,
conservative business handling. Do not misunderstand me, honourable senators. I am
not suggesting for one moment that such an
organization should enlarge itself, and be
hampered by undue red tape; but an organization of its kind, to be effective, must be
able to extend itself widely in the business
of accepting risks, in the interests of the
exporting business of the country; and it
can do this better than any one individual
can do it. Of course, the very essence of
insurance is meeting risks.
Honourable senators, I have been looking
through some of the figures of this corporation
in regard to what it has been insuring, and I
have found that insurance for some branches
of trade is practically non-existent. Last year
iron and iron ore products took up 56 per
cent of the total of the amount that was insured by this organization; agricultural products only 1.6 per cent; fishing products, less
than 1 per cent, although fish in relation to
the sum total of production has probably the
highest percentages of exporting value of the
industries of Canada.
I do not know why the limitations have
been set, except that this organization is in
a period of growth. Britain has had an experience of 25 years duration in the field of export credits insurance, but Canada is in the
initial growth stage.
I observe that about one-third of all this
insurance agency's coverage is in commonwealth countries, which accounts for about
$20 million. Canada's exports to the British
West Indies last year amounted to about $40
million, which was covered by this insurance
in the amount of $1.6 million; Latin America
took about one-third of the total, or roughly
about $20 million, and the rest of the world
took approximately one-third. The point I
wish to stress is that there are areas of the
world where the problems of foreign currency
are not so acute as to make coverage by insurance a poor proposition altogether, yet

I think that a great deal of the export trade
to these areas is retarded because the average
businessman-not so much the big corporation, because it can to a degree look after
itself-is not closely enough in touch with the
problems. A recognized leadership in the nature of a progressive credit insurance agency
plan such as this can be of great help in these
circumstances.
I made some inquiries today and received
a bit of information which I think will be of
interest. Members of the committee listened
yesterday to the very fine explanation given
by the president of this organization. It will
be recalled that he referred to claims outstanding, and said that owing to currency
clearance difficulties there is an outstanding
claim against interests in Turkey of $4,700,000,
after eight years of trading, totalling altogether about $35 million. I learned this morning-and I was told that I could pass on the
information-that $1 million of that amount
has been paid today.
It should be stated that only 190 Canadian
exporters took advantage of this insurance
service last year. The Canadian directory of
exporters lists some 3,000 exporters. Now, if
we took even half of that total list as being
persons requiring coverage, 190 represents a
small percentage to take advantage of it.
I believe a great deal can yet be done to
build up the interest of exporters generally
in this agency, which undoubtedly has much
to offer for the advancement of the Canadian
export business.
The honourable senator who explained this
bill on second reading (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
made reference to the capital authorization of
the corporation, which is $15 million, of which
$5 million is capital issued by the Government, and there is a capital surplus of $5
million. In addition there is an earned
capital surplus of $1.5 million.
The Export Credits Insurance Corporation,
being a Crown corporation, is subject to corporation tax. But I would point out that
this institution, in its operation, purposes and
affiliations differs generally from other Crown
corporations, and I can see no good reason
for a corporation tax being applied to it.
1 do not make that observation merely because
this body is exercising a sound public service,
but because it is just not good practical sense
to reduce its surplus by taxation. If the
corporation is able to build up a surplus by
charging fair and proper rates that the trade
can stand, that will be reflected in the rates
and services to be extended to the export
business. The savings which the corporation
can thereby pass on to other corporations in
the export business, by reduced rates, will be
taxed in the hands of those other corporations. So the public treasury would not

MARCH 14, 1957
suffer by reason of tax relief at this source.
Further, such relief would mean that the
corporation by building up its own resources
could extend its services to trading under
more hazardous conditions in the export field
and thus increase its total volume of exports.
I refer particularly to instances where the
problem of foreign exchange clearances may
be a serious source of loss.
I urge therefore that this corporation be
excluded from the application of corporation
tax and be allowed to use its earnings to
build up an adequate surplus, so as to be able
to reduce its rates and extend its facilities
to supply an overall insurance coverage to
Canada's forign trade. An appropriate substitute for corporation profits tax would be,
I suggest, a charge for interest on the capital
supplied, such charge to be at the Government bond rate.
As I have said, these credit insurance
benefits apply now to about 1k per cent of
our export trade, whereas the United Kingdom, with about 25 years experience, extends
the service to between 8 and 12 per cent
of its exports.
I thought these few points would be of interest to honourable senators.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, before this bill is passed I should
like to commend the honourable senator
from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) on
his interesting and informative remarks this
afternoon.

revise his percentage figure if those two
points were taken into consideration.
The main purpose for my rising at this
time is to say how much I deplore the fact
that interesting and informative speeches,
such as the honourable senator from St.
John's West delivered this afternoon, are
inadequately reported to the public at large.
We have in this chamber leaders in industry,
law, education and all the main branches of
life in Canada, and many excellent addresses
are heard. But the public does not benefit
by them. I know of no institution about
which there is greater ignorance than the
Senate of Canada. Perhaps that is our own
fault, but it is a matter that should receive
serious consideration.
We listened the other evening to two or
three speeches on the Canada Council bill.
Many interesting points were raised by the
honourable senators from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), which should at least
be placed before the public. Yet, in no section of the Canadian press which I read was
there any report of that debate. It is a
serious loss to the Canadian public that wider
coverage is not given to the proceedings of
this chamber.
My honourable friend from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) has given notice of
motion for revision of the rules of the Senate
and in particular for reduction of membership of the standing committees, so as to
afford honourable members "an opportunity
to give the full measure of their talents".
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
I do not know what his ideas are, but I hope

SENATE
figures I quoted for Great Britain are also
all-embracing, so the comparison should be
approximately correct.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to deal with the address
given by the honourable senator from St.
John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt). I just want to
refer to the remarks made by my honourable
friend from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon.
Mr. Burchil) as to why more publicity is
not given to our proceedings.
I happen to know a little about newspaper
work, as one of my sisters is connected with
one of the large newspapers and she occasionally talks about this lack of publicity.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: She wrote a very
good booklet too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: She tells me that the
newspapers always publish items that are of
interest to the public. But how can the
Senate create any public interest when out
of a chamber of 86 members, 81 are on the
Government side and only five on the Opposition side? It is beyond my comprehension.
I sat in a legislature where we had about
twenty members on the Opposition and some
thirty members on the Government side, and
although that house was in one of the
smaller provinces our activities were given a
good deal of publicity in the newspapers.
They told the people what was going on.
If you look at the newspaper reports of any
legislature that has an Opposition of reasonable size you will find plenty of discussion
reported. But that cannot be said of this
house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask the honourable Leader of the Opposition a question?
Was there more publicity given to the
speeches in the Senate when the house was
more evenly divided?
Hon. Mr. Horner: There is a puzzler for
you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am glad you asked that
question. I may say that, for six or seven
years after I came to this house the late
Senator Dandurand was Leader of the Government and the Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen was Leader of the Opposition. They
were outstanding debaters, and they had a
peculiar habit of speaking as often as they
liked on every motion. Senator Dandurand
would speak three or four times on a motion
and Mr. Meighen would speak three or four
times on the same motion, and neither objected to the number of times the other one
spoke. I was curious enough to ask, "What
is the rule that allows you to do that?" and
they both told me that that was the practice
in this chamber. I told them that I could
not find provision for it in the rules.

The Senate did get publicity then, but
after they left the publicity seemed to drop.
If there were, say, 25 Opposition members in
the Senate you would find it to be an altogether different house. For example, I know
a little about law-not a great deal-and my
honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) knows a lot about farming, and
others are well informed on other subjects,
but if we had 25 members on the Opposition
side there would be a much greater variety
of opinion.
My honourable friend from St. John's West
(Hon. Mr. Pratt) spoke on the subject of
trade. I know a little bit about trade and
I am not sure that this country should go too
far with legislation of this kind. I will say
no more than that.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake that it would be good to see the
independents in this house vote against the
Government once in a while. If they would
just do it once we would know that they
could do it. I have seen some Government
supporters vote against the Government on
certain measures, and I do hope that at
some time we will see the independents do
the same.
Honourable senators, my point is this: give
us 25 Opposition members in this house and
you will see a great increase in public
interest in what we do here. Certain members of this chamber never make a speech
at all. They are good speakers, they are
well educated and could make good speeches,
but they hear someone discussing a subject
that they are familiar with and they say,
"that is enough on the matter." If I make
a speech I can be quite sure that my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
will follow me, and probably the honourable
member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), as
well as the senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) and the senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). If I speak first they
will follow, but we have too few members
in the Opposition to reply to arguments
against my speech. The honourable member
for Toronto-Trinity spoke a few days ago
on the Canada Council Bill, and the honourable member from Toronto criticized him.
That was a good debate. But we will never
have really spirited debate in this house
and we will never arouse much public interest
in our proceedings until the Opposition forms
a more reasonable proportion of the Senate's
membership. I sat in a legislature when
there were only three C.C.F. members, and
I sat in the same legislature when there were
ten members of that party; and, believe me,
when there were ten C.C.F.'ers there was real
interest in their propaganda and policy, and
we who did not agree with what they stood

MARCH 14, 1957
for had to put up a good fight in order
to counteract it. But that kind of situation
does not exist here. If I make a speech in
criticism of the Government on any issue,
I shall be followed by at least a dozen
speakers attacking my views from every
angle. I cannot reply to them; I am precluded
from doing so.
I think this serves to indicate why the
public takes so little interest in our proceedings. When the late Honourable John Hackett
was appointed to this house I thought it was
the beginning of a new era, in which the
Opposition would have a sufficient number
of members to enable it to take a proper
share in the handling of public busines. Mr.
Hackett has passed on, and no one has
taken his place. There are 16 vacancies,
all of which, I have no doubt, will be filled
either with Liberals or with independents who
somehow always find themselves able to vote
Liberal-and in doing so they may be right;
that is their business, not mine. If the
honourable senators from NorthumberlandMiramichi and St. John's West want their
speeches to be criticized, let the Opposition be
increased to, say, 25 members, and there
will be no lack of criticism. But unless the
Conservative representation is enlarged, criticism will be lacking, and without it, no
matter how good the quality of individual
speeches, they will not receive much attention
from the press. In short, if a public demand
exists, speeches will be reported; if it is
lacking, they will not. In the House of
Commons there is a diversity of speeches
which arouse public attention, and so, day by
day, the newspapers carry reports of the
proceedings.
From time to time demands are made that
the Senate shall be changed or abolished, but
hardly anyone is interested enough in the
question to utter a word of comment. I said
something on the matter at the Conservative
convention, but nobody seemed to care. Some
of my fellow senators were kind enough to
compliment me, and I appreciated their words
very much. But I repeat that there should
be in this house an Opposition group of at
least 25 members. If the Government is
changed, what will happen? After ten years
the balance will be reversed. When I came
to this chamber it contained 64 Conservatives.
We know how the representation has changed
since then. In those days practically all the
debating was done by two senators, but they
were men of outstanding ability.
I suggest to the honourable Leader of the
Government in this house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that he bring to the attention of the
cabinet my request that when the 17 vacant
seats are filled, enough Conservatives shall
be appointed to give some semblance of
82719-241

strength to the Opposition. Let it not be forgotten that there is an Opposition sentiment
in the country. I will not say that after the
coming general election the Conservative
party will be in power, but at least it will
be more largely represented in Parliament
than it is now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We shall remember
that prediction.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In saying that the Opposition will be larger than it is now, I point out
that, irrespective of differences on policies,
public opinion is swayed against a party with
too large a majority. People feel that the
representation is too one-sided. As regards
the Senate, the popular impression is that it
is, in effect, a one-person bouse; and so long
as that idea exists there will be criticism of
this chamber, no matter what we do or do
not do.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, if I correctly understood what the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) said, it was to the effect that when
the house was more evenly divided, great
publicity was given to the speeches of two
of its members,Hon. Mr. Haig: Two outstanding members.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -and none to the
speeches of other honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, my honourable
friend said that two members of this house
did all the speaking.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They did a great deal of it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: So, if they did all
the speaking, they were the only ones who
could get any publicity.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is not what I said.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It follows that the
publicity which the Senate received in those
days was not due to a more even division of
the membership, but rather to the quality of
the leadership.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Unfortunately, present leadership does not possess that quality,
but I think it exists among other members of
the house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We have good leadership, too.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Many distinguished
members are excellent speakers. It is not
necessarily the case that when an honourable
senator speaks against some motion presented
on behalf of the Government he obtains much
press attention. For instance, last Tuesday

SENATE
evening the eminent honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) made
an outstanding address in opposition to a
Government bill. What publicity did he get?
I did not even see his name in the paper,Hon. Mr. Haig: I saw it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And this, as I say,
in spite of the excellence of his speech.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: There was a brief report
in the papers.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The notice must have
been very small, for I did not see it, and I
read the newspapers quite carefully.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There was some press
notice.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The only conclusion
I can come to is that it does not necessarily
follow that speeches in opposition to legislation get publicity, but only those contributions
which, in the opinion of the press, are of
interest to the public. That is a question
which the newspapers themselves must
decide. You and I are not newspapermen;
and we do not know-at any rate I do not
know-what particular material is of special
news value. So I do not agree with the statement that, merely by increasing the number
of Opposition members, more newspaper
publicity will be assured for our proceedings
in this chamber. As I have said, there have
been utterances of outstanding ability by
honourable senators who frequently deliver
speeches opposed to the policy of the Government, but of which no notice appears in the
press.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
rise not to controvert the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) but to propound a question to him which may add a
little to the gaiety of our proceedings. My
honourable friend asked, or rather asserted,
that if there were 25 Opposition members in
this house our sittings would be much more
lively and that, therefore, the gentlemen who
sit in the press gallery would probably consider them much more worth reporting. If
that remark carries any implication-and I
think it does-it is that the honourable Leader
of the Opposition would favour carrying the
controversies of the House of Commons, where
political controversy is perfectly proper, into
this house. I do not think that political contention is a function of this house.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not believe that
those who framed our Constitution intended
that we should import into the Senate all
the conflicts and political manouvring that go
on in the House of Commons. Most assuredly,
if we look back on the record of the Senate

and of its leaders in the past, that was not
their view of the responsibilities of this house.
I recall leaders in the Senate who, because
they did not agree with Government legislation, definitely opposed the Government to
which they gave nominal support. In my
opinion, that is the sort of thing we are here
for. It has often been said that the main function of the Senate is to examine legislation
from a non-political viewpoint. It may be that
in the heat of party controversy the other
house will pass on to us some proposed legislation that sober second thought would not
approve. In my humble judgment, it is the
responsibility of this house to examine such
legislation dispassionately from the point of
view of the welfare of the whole nation. That
is the essential function of this house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon Mr. Crerar: Now I come to the question that I wish to address to the Leader of
the Opposition. What I have said so far has
been a rather lengthy preamble to it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): But a
useful one.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The question is this: Does
he consider it would be a good thing to increase the Opposition to 25 members, with
the implication that the Opposition would
then be in a better position to wage party
controversies such as take place in the House
of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say anything
about party controversies. I did say, though,
that I knew my honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) would get up
and speak after I addressed the house. Every
time I speak, if I put a certain emphasis in
the right places, I can get him to rise to his
feet like a jack-in-the-box. My point is
that our Opposition group consisting of five
members is not always equipped to adequately debate subjects after they have been
introduced in this house. We could be, though,
if we had 25 members.
My honourable friend from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill) is a
businessman and so was able to comment on
the address made this afternoon by the
honourable senator from St. John's West
(Hon. Mr. Pratt). If someone were to make
a speech involving law I could depend on
my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) to make a reply along with
me. If the subject involved farming I could
depend on my colleague from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner), and perhaps a little on
my colleague from Rosetown.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

MARCH 14, 1957
Hon. Mr. Haig: My point is that in a membership of five we have not enough diversity
of opinion on any one subject to permit us
to make a real debate. I do not care about
politics; I don't have to get elected.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators, I have listened with a great deal of
interest to the addresses which have been
made this afternoon. Some years ago, when
His Honour the Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson) was Leader of the Government in the
Senate, there were 15 Opposition members.
I made a suggestion then that at no time
should the Opposition party in the Senate
have a membership of less than 15. My
suggestion was made in good faith with no
thought of trying to hold up Government
legislation, for an Opposition of that size
could never upset the Government on any
issue. At any rate, His Honour the Speaker
later-while he still was Government leader
-suggested
an alteration to my proposal,
stating that the Opposition group should
never be left with fewer than 12 members.
The senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) has known my views on publicizing what we do here, but he has opposed
them. It will be recalled that for a number
of years the Senate appointed two men to
bring our debates to the attention of the
public. These appointments are no longer
made.
Honourable senators, I have been in this
chamber a long time and I have always
closely followed everything that has taken
place here. I think I can say that I am a
senator in the true sense of the word and
that I have always examined legislation with
a non-political approach. I have no apologies
to off er anyone for this.
I will not say that the Opposition in this
house bas failed in its job of opposing legislation. But we are not here to oppose. We are
here to consider and examine legislation that
is placed before us. This is what we have
taken our oath to do. If the Senate wants
publicity let it be worthy of it. Let it do
something extraordinary. For example, had
this bouse killed the recent $100 million bill
it would have gotten all kinds of publicity.
I wish I had been able to take part in that
debate, but I was warned by my doctors
not to do so. They have cautioned me against
excitement, and because I prefer keeping
my eyesight and staying alive I did not speak
on that important measure. Tomorrow I am
going to get new glasses, and then I shall
be able to see my colleagues properly. Incidentally, I am pleased to be able to say
that I have no better friends in this bouse

than the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) and the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Honourable senators, we know the purpose
for which the Senate was created. To criticize
is easy, but a reason should be given for the
criticism.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I think it would be rather difficult
to say whether or not the publicity that the
Senate might receive from the discussion
that bas taken place in the past ten or fifteen
minutes, following the admirable dissertation
by the honourable senator from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt), will prove to be desirable. I doubt very much if the discussion
will get much publicity, anyway. However,
having had some part in giving publicity to
the activities of people and also in reflecting
it for others, may I say that I think the
remarks that have been made here about
words, and about the publicity that is given
to those words outside of this house, and
consequent comments in the press, have been
rather fruitless and futile.
Shortly after I came to this chamber I heard
the then Leader of the Opposition, the Right
Honourable Mr. Meighen, make what I
thought was a true statement about the
Senate: he said that it was a workshop, not
a theatre-or at least, that it should be a
workshop. In other words, he meant that
the accomplishments of the Senate most
worthy of publicity were achieved in committees, and not in words uttered in full-dress
debate in this house. Indeed, from my own
observations, any worth-while publicity that
the Senate has received at any time since I
came here, and prior to that time, bas definitely been connected with its achievements in
special and standing committees on very
important matters, such as railway transportation, income tax, various outstanding bills,
and so on. Anything said in this house afterwards bas always been a mere reflection of
the work and accomplishments in committee
rooms of this building. If the committees of
the Senate were doing the work they should
be doing-and I submit very definitely they
have not been doing the work they might have
been doing-we would not need to waste time
here talking about how much publicity we
are getting in the press. Deeds, not words,
will establish the usefulness of this branch of
Parliament.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

SENATE
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY TRAFFIC BILL

MOTION FOR THIRD READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I am very sorry I was unable to attend at
the committee, but I was somewhat intrigued
with the new clause of the bill "providing
I
for the voluntary payment of fines".
know that such a practice is customary, but
I am wondering if it is usual to include that
provision in a statute, or if wording of that
kind has been included in other acts. I
should like to hear an opinion on that.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): If there
are no further questions, may I answer the
honourable gentleman directly? We were
advised, and it is the fact, that provision
is made in the provincial laws for the payment of fines for traffic violations prior to a
court hearing. Let me illustrate: If I get
a ticket for a parking violation on federal
property and the provision which is in the
provincial law is not in effect, I cannot go to
the police station directly and pay the fine,
but must wait until the case is called in the
court. For the convenience of the public it
was thought advisable that one who is guilty
of a traffic violation on federal property
should have the privilege of paying his fine
without waiting to appear before the magistrate on the calling of the case. As I say,
that convenience is available under provincial law, and it was thought advisable to
extend it to infractions under the federal
law. However, I should add that if a person
who is charged with a traffic offence feels
he is not guilty, he can always appear before
the magistrate and plead his case.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My other question bas to
do with traffic violations on the grounds
around Parliament Hill.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): This
would cover parking regulations on Parliament Hill.
Hon. David A. Croll: Do the regulations
apply to senators and members of Parliament who park on Parliament Hill?

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the third reading of Bill Y-7, an Act to amend the Government Property Traffic Act.
He said: Honourable senators, some members of the committee to whom this bill was
referred, have asked me, because of the fact
that I explained the bill on second reading,
to say a few words about the work that was
done in committee on the bill. We were
privileged to have present C. R. O. Munro,
the senior counsel of the Department of
Public Works, under whose jurisdiction the
work in connection with this bill falls, and
Inspector M. S. Cooper, of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, who has a similar responsibility.
Two or three things constitute the highlights
of the deliberations that the committee gave
to the bill. In the first place, it was established to the satisfaction of the committee, I
think, that it is Parliament which bas sole
jurisdiction to legislate on traffic on properties owned by the Crown in the right
of Canada. In the second place, I think it
was clearly established that the purpose of
this bill was to bring the penalties for traffic
offences, particularly the more serious ones,
which are committed upon Crown property,
into line with the penalties that are prescribed by the various provincial laws.
If, because of the inadequate explanation
given on second reading, there was any misunderstanding about what the maximum penalties meant, the witnesses before the committee dissipated that misunderstanding.
These maximum penalties-for instance, the
$500 fine and the six-months imprisonmentare now understood to be penalties which
would be applied, not for a first offence, but
probably only in the case of a third offence,
and even then only if the offence was very
serious, such as driving while intoxicated, or
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Cerleaving the scene of an accident after serious

injury had been occasioned, or other offences

of that kind.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I understand we do have
I think we were impressed with one other
point, namely-to take an example--that in rights and have had them for years. On
the case of a traffic offence committed, say, these premises we are not subject to being
just outside a Government property but on served with documents, or to arrest. I recall
a provincial highway, it would be unfair if very clearly an occasion when an attempt
the penalty was a very severe one, while was made to serve me with a subpoena to
for the same offence committed just within appear as a character witness at a rather
a Government property but off a public famous trial. I did not choose to be served,

that day.
Honourable senators, I feel that this brief
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Did you go out on the
explanation pretty well summarizes the highgrounds?
lights of the committee's deliberations.

MARCH 14, 1957
Hon. Mr. Croll: I was out on the grounds.
These are old and traditional rights which
I think should be preserved. They should
be applied with respect to the use of automobiles and to whatever else the law is now
applicable. I did not attend the committee
meeting, and did not follow too closely the
provisions of the bill, but it seems to me
that the rights of senators and members of
Parliament shou-ld be preserved. I suggest
that we take another look at this bill before
it is given third reading and passed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When one's car is improperly
parked in some municipalities, the authorities
see fit to tow it to the police station. What
will happen to my car if I cannot find parking space on Parliament Hill in the section
allotted to senators' cars and park it in
another section? I believe there should be
strict regulations governing speed and so on
around Parliament Hill, but parking is a
different matter.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I understand there have been instances when the
cars of members of Parliament have been
towed away from Parliament Hill. No special
privileges are extended to us under this act
with respect to traffic offences committed
on Parliament Hill.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It is the encroachment on
the rights of senators and members of Parliament that I object to.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You can adjourn the
debate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion for the third
reading of Bill Y-7, an Act to amend the
Government Property Act. Is it your pleasure,
honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Reid: On division.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
do not like to see this bill carried on division.
I now move adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, the debate
was adjourned.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented

be taken into consideration today.

It is intended that all the 40 petitions
listed for hearing shall have been heard by
the 25th of this month. So, if I may project the
reckoning until that date and assume that all
the cases now listed will then have been heard
and recommended, the total number of cases
dealt with will be 340. A comparison may
make these figures stand out in our minds. I
have not the exact number of petitions which
were heard at this time last year, because the
statistics cannot be measured so closely; but
the 1956 and 1957 sessions began at about
the same time of year, and on May 2, 1956
the committee had heard and disposed of 281
cases. That is to say, last year, a month and a
half later than March 25, the Divorce Committee had disposed of 281 cases, as against
340 which will have been disposed of by
Monday next. These figures, I think, speak
for themselves; and as spokesman for the
committee I feel entitled to throw bouquets at
ourselves for the industry and great attention
to duty which have been shown by all its
members. For some weeks we met every day
each week from Monday to Friday; more
recently, when other committees have been
sitting and the reporters have been required
there, we have met either twice or three
times-usually three times-weekly; and that,
I suggest, is a pretty good chore.
Honourable senators, we have accomplished
more than I could have reasonably hoped for
by this date, and I thank the house for agreeing to give these reports immediate consideration.

PACIFIC SALMON FISHERIES
CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second read-

ing of Bill 180, an Act to implement a Convention between Canada and the United
States of America for the protection, preservation and extension of the Sockeye Salmon
Fisheries in the Fraser River System signed
at Washington on the 26th day of May, 1930,
and a Protocol thereto signed at Ottawa on
the 28th day of December, 1956.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
speak on the second reading of Bill 180, may
I first of all personally extend to the Honourable Leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) and other honourable senators
my sincere thanks for helping to expedite

SENATE

this bill this evening. There is a great
urgency to have the bill passed as quickly
as possible, owing to the fact that those-of
whom I am one-who will have the responsibility of carrying out the provisions of the
act are awaiting the passing of this bill before
we can commence our duties. Since a
species of Pink salmon known as a two-year
fish will have a big run this year, and there
will be none next year, we feel that we should
get to work and carry out the duties provided
by the treaty as quickly as possible in order
to have time to lay out the proper regulations
to govern the same.
In speaking to this bill I have decided,
first of all, to lay certain groundwork. An
examination of the bill will show that its
purpose is to extend the Sockeye Salmon
Treaty to cover Pink salmon.
I believe honourable senators will be interested if I first of all take a few minutes te
explain the kinds and varieties of salmon
in the Fraser River. Even out in British
Columbia we have some difficulty in making
clear te our people that salmon is net just
one kind of fish and that the water in the
rivers is net all alike.
There are five species of commercial salmon
in the Fraser River, and each of the species
has a different life and characteristics from
the others. Most people look upon a river
or a lake and think that all water is the
same. However, it has been discovered over
long years of investigation that most large
bodies of water contain minute particles of
food called plankton, upon which fish live.
Some waters are devoid of plankton, while
other waters have a great deal of it. The water
temperature also is important.
The five known varieties of salmon are
Spring, Cohoe, Chum, Pink and Sockeye. The
life span of one species, such as the Pink,
from the time they are born until they return
te spawn again, is two years. The variety
known as Chum has a life span of three years,
the Sockeye four years, and the Spring five
years.
All these fish have entirely different characteristics. Many people who know about one
variety of salmon think the others are all the
same species. I would like to take a few
minutes to tell you the interesting story about
the characteristics of the Sockeye and the
Pink, the two varieties of salmon which are
dealt with in the bill now before the Senate.
Many questions remain unanswered, but
since the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission was set up, in 1937, there
has been an ample supply of funds forthcoming from both the Canadian Government
and the United States Government to provide
for a competent staff. I believe I can say

without successful contradiction that the commission of which I speak knows more about
the species and characteristics of the Sockeye
salmon than any other body or association on
the North American continent.
The Sockeye salmon is most valuable when
canned. In the early days when I came to
Ottawa I heard a good deal about the Gaspé
salmon, and of course the people from Gaspé
had heard about Sockeye. The Gaspé salmon
does net lend itself to canning as does the
Sockeye; but the Spring salmon is, I believe,
equal te any other specie caught in any
waters. The Sockeye is peculiarly red in
colour and full of fat; whereas the Pink and
other varieties are somewhat pale in colour,
but are just as nutritive. Indeed, the pale
species of Pink salmon is equally as wholesome as the Sockeye. For the information of
housewives who may hear of my words, I
may say the Pink salmon is much cheaper but
equal in food value to the Sockeye.
The Sockeye have a peculiarity net known
te other fish, namely, that they lay their eggs
in exactly the same gravel bed from whence
they were born or came. If they are blocked
on the way and are unable te go to that spot
they will die with their eggs inside of them.
Each female fish has in her body between
3,000 and 4,000 eggs. Nature is very kind,
for we now know that the mortality between
the gravel bed and the spawning place is
about 80 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My friend's information
about the life cycle of the various species of
salmon being two, three, four and five years
is most interesting. I was just wondering if
these species remain inviolate from each
other, or whether they become mixed up and
their characteristics change to the point where
some have a life span of two and a half years
or perhaps six years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, that is net se. For
perhaps a million years back these species of
fish have remained entirely separate and
have net mixed their characteristics with
other species. Honourable senators will appreciate what I have been trying to convey when
I outline the characteristics of the other
species. However, may I deal first with the
Sockeye?
The Sockeye will lay its eggs only in the
gravel bed from whence it came. In our
research we have discovered that it does not
vary more than five or six days in the time
of its leaving the ocean, perhaps some 400
miles out, to head back to the spawning beds.
We have also found out with respect to the

MARCH 19, 1957
little fingerlings that in a period of 20 years
or more the time of their leaving the lakes
has not varied more than two or three days,
so exact is their timing.
The Sockeye when it commences its return
to the spawning bed ceases to eat when it
touches the brackish waters of the Fraser
River. The most valuable of that species is
the variety that travels 850 miles from the
mouth of the river to the interior of British
Columbia. They fight their way through
many rivers and lakes, and through Hells
Gate canyon, a sight worth seeing, especially
since we have built the great fishways
which enable the fish to pass. While one
group goes up 850 miles, another goes 600
miles, and still another 400 miles, all are
headed for their separate places. As I pointed
out, the salmon in its journey to the interior
ceases to feed and must live on its fat. It
can be readily appreciated that those fish
which travel the greatest distance without
eating have the most fat and are perhaps the
most valuable in the can.
The Pink salmon is entirely different.
Shortly after it is born it heads for the sea.
It will lay its eggs in many streams or
rivers, while the Sockeye lays its eggs only
in rivers which flow into or out of a lake.
In that way, the Sockeye fingerlings upon
birth immediately move up or down into a
lake and stay there one year to 18 months
before heading out to sea. The Pink salmon,
on the other hand, upon leaving the gravel
bars almost immediately head for the ocean.
These two species are therefore strikingly
different in their characteristics.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What would be the
weight of these fish?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The weight of the Pink
salmon runs from 4 to 5 pounds, and the
sockeye from 6j to 9 pounds.
Another characteristic of the two species
is when they touch the fresh waters of the
Fraser they begin to change. Out in the
gulf where nets catch great quantities of
these fish, no one can tell by observation
which is male and which is female; but as
they head up the river towards the spawning beds they begin to change. The snout
of the male of the Pink salmon begins to
turn up, and by the time they are just above
the city of New Westminster the male fish
is easily discernible from the female by
its extended teeth and turned-up nose. Indeed, it gets a very ugly look. Besides,
both Sockeye and Pink salmon turn red in
colour as they near the spawning beds. But,
as I say, out in the open water you could
not tell the male from the female, unless
you caught a fish, opened it and found eggs
inside.

As I said earlier, honourable senators, we
have not yet found all the answers in our
scientific research, but since 1937 we have
reached the point where, for instance, by
examining the scales of a fish before it reaches
the Fraser River we can pretty well tellmuch as a forester would know from the
rings on a tree its age and history-the number of months that the fish has lived in
fresh water, the number of years or months
it lived in salt water, its age and even the
river or district to which it is going. It
is a wonderful study, and we are very proud
of the results.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask whether all
these varieties of salmon start up the river
at the same time?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, they all go up at different times. The Pink salmon comes in at a
later season than does the Sockeye.
May I turn now to the treaty. One could
spend a good deal more time discussing the
life of the salmon, but perhaps what I have
already told you will maintain your interest
until I am through with -a discussion of the
bill. It has been asked over and over again
why, if the salmon are born in the Fraser
River, is it necessary to have a treaty with
the United States? Well, the answer is very
simple. We are on the hatching end, but the
salmon returning to the Fraser River come
through American waters. In effect we are
on the rearing end and the Americans are on
the catching end, and so to develop the
salmon efficiently both countries have to cooperate in order to rehabilitate this great run
of salmon.
On the International Pacific Fisheries Commission there are six commissioners, three
Americans and ·three Canadians. I have the
honour, and I am proud of it, to be the only
member of the original commission appointed
in 1937.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Good.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am taking the opportunity
of saying this because so many people have
the idea that few, if any, will render public
service unless paid for it. The commissioners are not paid. We are doing a service,
and I am very proud indeec to have contributed my services to the development of
this great industry.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In the year 1913, when the
Canadian Northern Railway, now the Canadian National, was building its line through
Hells Gate Canyon, where the waters of the
Fraser flow into a gorge some 90 feet or so
in width and more than 100 feet in depth,

SENATE
fisheries, although it would be desirable to
have a large year every year, we cannot overcome what nature has been doing over a very
long period of time. Why? Well, we have
not got the answer yet.
It was not until the International Commission took over that we discovered why, after
the disaster of 1913, the Sockeye could not
get through, except in certain years. Now,
if the salmon are delayed longer than 11 days
or so they may never reach the spawning beds
above. Bear in mind, they still have hundreds
of miles to go after they pass Hells Gate
Canyon, and if delayed more than 11 days
or so they will never reach the spawning bed,
and even if they do they will be too weak to
reproduce their species. As I said, it was not
until the Commission took charge, under the
treaty passed in 1937, that we discovered the
reason for the block. After some years of
research we found that when the water in
Hells Gate Canyon reached a level of 140
feet the salmon had no difficulty going through
those raging waters-and I might say the
water travels through there at the rate of
about 25 miles an hour. But when the water
rose up, foot by foot, to 150 feet, it was just
the same as if you had placed an iron gate
right across the canyon. Nothing went
through. If you looked at the water going
through at the 145-foot level you could not
see much change from conditions as they

In building the roadbed, therefore, for the
railway they dynamited thousands of tons of
rock down into the river bed. That year the
salmon did not get through.
I will try to give some idea of the large
quantities of salmon in the Fraser, and I am
sure many of you from the east will be
amazed by the figures. I am going to invite
some of you to come out west this year and
see the run of salmon. In 1954 we put on a
gala day in the interior and were able to
show visitors a million and a half Sockeye
salmon in a mile or so of river. In fact, you
could almost walk across on their backs. It
was one of the greatest sights to be seen
anywhere.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What year was that?
Hon. Mr. Reid: 1954.
In that year one of the towns put on a
great gala day and thousands of visitors came
from far and near to see this great sight, to
see the tremendous number of salmon in a
mile and a quarter or so of the river. They
were counted scientifically by our staff-one
and a half million Sockeye salmon, all red,
all spawning. And may I point out that after
the salmon lay their eggs they die within a
day or two.

of 1913. In 1917 the Americans, chiefly for
war purposes, packed 15 million cases of
Pink salmon, as compared with 1,876,000
cases packed in Canada. I think the United
States required most of this salmon for their
troops during the war years.
I trust honourable senators will be patient
with me while I deal with my last point.
The picture looks very bright in so far as
the great salmon industry of the Fraser is
concerned. The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission has done a
wonderful job with the Sockeye, and this
legislation will place the Pink salmon under
the jurisdiction of this commission. If nothing goes wrong we feel that before long the
Sockeye salmon industry will be worth $50
million a year, while the Pink salmon industry will be worth $75 million to $100
million every two years. However, there are
many difficulties facing us and we are
deeply concerned about the efforts being
made by certain interests to construct hydroelectric dams on the Fraser River. No doubt
honourable members have read that a highlevel meeting is being held in Ottawa, the
purpose of which is to map out a program
for hydro-electric power development on the
Columbia River. I hope that a speedy settlement will be reached by the dominion
Government with regard to the Columbia
River problem, for research work carried on
by our scientists and engineers has disclosed that development of the Columbia
will alleviate any necessity for building
dams on the Fraser River for perhaps 20
to 25 years.
The United States once enjoyed a great
fishing industry on the Columbia, but the
building of dams resulted in a continual
dwindling of the industry despite the expenditure of millions of dollars by the American
Government to keep the industry alive.
These dams will ultimately result in the
salmon being wiped out. It is true the
Americans built fishways at the Bonneville
Dam, but there are no Sockeye salmon going
over these fishways. The Americans have
no Sockeye salmon now on the Columbia
River, their chief species being the Spring
salmon or the Tyee.
The danger to our Sockeye salmon industry
comes from selfish interests. One of these is
an American interest which bas hired two
propagandists who spread untruths throughout British Columbia regarding dams and
fish. They have been making misleading
statements to the effect that the building of
dams will not destroy the salmon of the

efforts to successfully put fish over dams.
During the past six or seven years the commission has spent considerable sums of
money in this same type of research but
no answer has yet been found for saving the
salmon on the Fraser River if dams are
built there. Neither is there any answer to
bringing the fingerlings down over the dams.
Research work done at a 280-foot dam in the
United States-the Baker Dam-disclosed
a loss of 56 per cent in the Sockeye fingerlings going over the dam on their way to
sea. Those that did not try to go over the
dam but attempted to go through the
turbines suffered a mortality rate of 34 per
cent. A fishery could never be maintained
with that kind of mortality rate.
Honourable senators, the Bonneville Dam
is practically the only place where we can
get any real information about the success
of fish going up over a dam or coming down
over it. The highest number that can go
through that fishway, however, is only
100,000 per day.
As I said before, these are not Sockeye
salmon but Spring salmon. That is the only
variety that attempt to go up the fishway,
which is really a fish ladder with steps going
up from the bottom to about the top of the
dam. In any event, the results at the Bonneville Dam cannot be applied to the
Fraser River. There is no comparison. In
1954 some one million Sockeye salmon passed
through Hells Gate fishways in one day. In
the light of this, just think of these American
interests who would like to build a 730-foot
dam with a lake stretching for 150 miles
beyond.
We are hopeful, as I said before, that the
Canadian Government will come to a speedy
agreement with the American authorities
with regard to the water power development
on the Columbia River. Over 22 million
horsepower can be developed on the Mica
Dam on the Columbia River, where there is
no salmon to be concerned about. We would
like them to go ahead and develop hydroelectric power at those sites on the Columbia
and leave the Fraser free to the salmon
fishing industry.
The preliminary report of the Gordon
Royal Commission on Canada's Economic
Prospects points out that by 1980, between
two-thirds and three-quarters of a greatly
increased total of power will be supplied by
petroleum and natural gas. That statement has

MARCH 19, 1957
a bearing on the salmon industry, as bas the
following one, taken from page 56 of the
report:
Under these circumstances one possibility is to
try, by low rates, to induce one of the relatively
few industries that use very large amounts of power
and for which power costs are therefore a very
important factor, to locate in the area.

The inhabitants of the interior of British
Columbia around the Columbia River are
somewhat enthusiastic about the stories that
the development of the Mica Dam on the
Columbia River will bring in new industries
and create new towns and cities. Well, in
British Columbia we have a large industry
called Alcan. It is a subsidiary of Aluminium
Limited, and the control of that company is
held in the United States, 80 per cent of the
shares being held by Aicoa. Aluminium
Limited, the parent of Alcan, was able to get
a large block of power in the Nechako River.
The point I wish to impress upon honourable senators is that in the whole of British
Columbia the power in existence at the
present time is around 1,130,000 horsepower,
and that is providing employment for approximately 800,000 persons, both men and
women. That power is lighting all the homes
and factories and motivating all the machinery
in British Columbia at the present time.
However, I doubt if when the 1,750,000 horsepower is finally developed by Alcan it will
provide employment for more than 10,000 persons. I trust honourable senators grasp the
point I am trying to make, namely, that it is
one thing to develop large blocks of power,
but it is another thing to see that the power is
developed where it will give the maximum
employment. We maintain that if large blocks
of power in the interior are handed out for
the manufacture of more aluminum, or metal
of that kind, it will not provide the great
employment and build the cities envisioned
by the promoters of the schemes.
It strikes me very forcibly, in reading this
report, that when the Gordon Commission was
in British Columbia quite a number of briefs
were presented by the fishermen and the fishing companies in regard to salmon in the
Fraser River and the dangers of power, yet
in the whole of the Commission's preliminary
report there is not one word regarding the
fisheries. And it is interesting to note that the
B. C. Electric, with the aid of funds from
the federal Government, are making test
holes at the proposed 750-foot Moran Dam
site, which if built will completely wipe out
the great salmon fisheries we have in the
Fraser River-the Pink, the Sockeye, and all
the other varieties-and will affect thousands
of sportsmen as well, because it is not generally known that once the Sockeye disappear
most of the sport fish will also be lost. In my

travels through the interior I discovered that
very few sports fishermen realize that but for
Sockeye salmon with their eggs, which are
frequently gobbled up by sports fish, and the
little fingerlings, sport fishing would not be
very good, if existing at all in the interior
waters.

In British Columbia our commission is
faced with this black cloud of selfish interests, sending around highly paid officials,
making speeches, holding meetings and generally making many untruthful statements
about salmon. I have suggested that these
men come to an open meeting so that the
public could hear both sides. Let these
officials tell their tales in front of the public
where we can tell our story and repudiate
all the misleading statements and false propaganda about the salmon on the Fraser River.
They aim to "put it over" the public so they

can be allowed to proceed with the building of these dams.
Honourable senators, while the dominion
Government has some say with regard to
the Columbia River, it bas nothing to say
with regard to the Fraser River. The Cc
lumbia is an international river, and therefore the dominion Government is brought
into the picture.
The Fraser is entirely
a provincial river. Although the Premier
of British Columbia has said that the fishing
interests must be satisfied, nevertheless, he
might grant a license for the proposed Moran
Dam. I am wondering what his thinking is
when he reads about these men saying the
fish problem has been solved. That is what
they are telling the public, and nothing is
farther from the truth. Are we to wait
until one dam is built, and then find the
salmon is wiped out, before we protest?
We are protesting now. We say that in
spite of $3 million spent across the line,
and half a million dollars here last year,
not by the commission alone but by the
Department of Fisheries and others, to find
ways and means to bring the fingerlings
down, either by electrical contact or by
some other method, and, on the other hand,
to find a method of taking the salmon
successfully over the dams, we have so far
not been able to solve the problem of how to
preserve the Sockeye salmon fishery if a dam
is proceeded with. Indeed, no one has
solved it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the senator
another question? First of all, does he say
that the Fraser River is entirely within
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That being so, why must
we share the product with the United States?

378

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, the Fraser River is
entirely in British Columbia; it rises in that
province and keeps within it. All matters
within the province are the right and prerogative of the provincial Government. The
Columbia River, however, rises in British
Columbia and flows into the United States.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I realize that. I am speaking
of the Fraser River, which is entirely in
Canada, and that is where the fish are caught.
That being so, why do they have to share
with the United States, which has no interest
in the Fraser?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am glad that the honourable gentleman asked that question, and I
shall be glad to answer it, for it will give me
a chance to reiterate what I have already
said. I pointed out the reason for the treaty
was that, although the salmon were born or
reared in Canada all the salmon coming back
from the sea to the Fraser River go out
through American Waters.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Where?
Hon. Mr. Reid: In the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. That is the reason why for many
years we could not get a treaty. Many people
have asked me why, if the salmon belong to
the Fraser River, we give 50 per cent to the
Americans. The answer is that we are obliged
to because they are on the catching end, and
they could catch all they wanted to if they
were not restricted by the rules and regulations laid down by our commission. I am
greatly perturbed, as are the commission and
a great many people in British Columbia,
but I am more alarmed by not knowing what
the provincial Government may do, and I
hope that a settlement will soon be arrived
at on the Columbia between the United
States and Canada. I am particularly worried
also about the B. C. Electric Comipany, because I think I could prove that they have
the ear of all the newspapers around Vancouver and are very powerful. They have
I believe one group of 16 men in British
Columbia who do nothing else but go around
and try to promote propaganda on behalf of
that company.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Are they not thinking of
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, they have mentioned
atomic power. The Gordon Corfimission does
not say very much about atomic power, and
it might be a great number of years before
it can be used. However, they do point out
that gas and petroleum could very well be
used.
I come now to the bill. I apologize for
the time I have taken in discussing the

background of this question, but I trust it
bas been of interest to honourable senators.
The purpose of the bill is set out in its
full title:
An Act to implement a Convention between
Canada and the United States of America for the
protection, preservation and extension of the Sockeye Salmon Fisheries in the Fraser River System,
signed at Washington on the 26th day of May, 1930.

May I say that although the treaty was
approved in 1930 by the Parliament of Canada and by the Congress of the United
States, it did not become law until seven
years later, the President having refused to
sign it. So, it was not until 1937 that the
commission to which I referred was set up.
The explanatory note to the bill contains
these words:
The convention, which initially covered only
Sockeye salmon in the Fraser River-Juan de Fuca
Strait area, was amended by a protocol signed at
Ottawa on the 28th day of December, 1956, to include also Pink salmon in the same area. This
necessitates the amendment of the Sockeye Salmon
Fisheries Convention Act, the revision of which
takes the form of more recent implementing legislation for international fishery conventions to
which Canada is a party.

This bill introduces very few changes into
the act of 1937, except to include Pink salmon
in the Sockeye Salmon treaty.
May I say again how much I appreciate
the attention I have received, and the opportunity of placing this bill before the house
this evening.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I wish to compliment the honour-

able senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) on the very excellent address he
has delivered. His remarks were most informative and interesting to all of us.
In particular I wish to refer to one
observation he made. If I understood him
correctly, he said something to the effect
that one of the members of the Royal Commission on Canada's Economic Prospects,
known as the Gordon Commission, had some
personal interest in one of the matters to be
reported on by the commission.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I suggested that one of the
members of the Gordon Commission has an
interest in the dams on the Fraser River.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would point out
to my honourable friend that it is not considered parliamentary to make such a statement. I would have stopped him when he
was discussing the matter, but I was not
sure that I understood what he had said. I
would also remind him that the Gordon
Commission is still sitting, and in the circumstances it would be as unparliamentary

MARCH 19. 1957
to reflect on the conduct of a member of a New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) for the
royal commission as it would be to reflect most interesting and informative address,
on the conduct of one of our judges. I rather and to say that it will be impossible for me
think my honourable friend might have gone in what I have to say to equal in any degree
a little too far, and I would ask him to re- the human interest of the subject with which
he so ably dealt.
consider his remarks.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If in what I said I contravened the rules of the house I will be
glad to consider it, because I do not want
to be guilty of an infraction of the rules.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
do not think the honourable senator from
New Westmintser should feel at all badly
about what he has said. The time might
come when we have in this country a great
number of commissions, covering almost
every subject of discussion, and we would
have to sit here like mummies without being
able to say anything about them.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But there is a proper
procedure in such circumstances, by way of
a motion. I think the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) realizes
that we in this house do not say anything that
reflects upon the judges in our courts.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I consider a member
of a royal commission entirely different from
a judge. In this instance I think the honourable leader is quite wrong.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As I said before,
this commission is still sitting, and I think
I am correct in the stand I have taken.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will look at the report of
my remarks.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Next sitting.

THIRD READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
March 14, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Honourable Mr. Connolly (Ottawa
West) for the third reading of Bill Y-7, an
Act to -amend the Government Property
Traffic Act.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, may I commence my remarks by
paying a compliment to the senator from

Honourable senators will remember that on

Thursday last, after the honourable senator
from Ottawa West (Hon. John J. Connolly)
had moved third reading of the measure, the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll) raised a point as to whether
or not the bill interfered with the rights,
privileges and immunities of senators and
other members of Parliament. There was no
answer possible to be given to the question
raised at that time; the question was something new. While the measure had been
most capably explained by the honourable
senator from Ottawa West, that particular
question had not arisen and was not dealt
with by him. I felt it would be unfortunate
to allow the bill to pass under a cloud of
doubt, which had been raised by the senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl), and
so I moved adjournment of the debate, on
the understanding, I think, of all senators
that I would deal with the question of the
rights of senators and other members of
Parliament under this bill.
In addressing oneself to a legal problem
of this kind it is always advisable to have
clearly in mind the subject about which we
are talking. I think that is a good principle
in life as well as in law. So, let me refer
honourable senators to this act to be
amended, which is Chapter 324 of the
Revised Statute of Canada, 1952, Volume V,
page 5775.
The vital section in the act
which we are seeking to amend reads as
follows:
2. (1) The Governor In Council may make regulations for tne control of traffic upon any lands
belonging to or occupied by Her Majesty in right
of Canada, and in particular, but without restricting
the generality of the foregoing, may make
regulations
(a) regulating the speed and parking of vehicles
and prescribing routes of travel;
(b) respecting one-way traffic obstruction of
traffic, and pedestrian traffie;
(c) for directing traffic and erecting signs;
(d) prohibiting traffic by such vehicles at such
times, in such places and in such circumstances as
may be prescribed in the regulations;
(e) prohibiting unnecessary noise in the vicinity
of buildings;
(f) authorizing officers to enforce the regulations; and-

I call particular attention to the following
paragraph:
(g) prescribing a fine not exceeding fifty dollars
or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two
months, or both fine and a term of imprisonment,
to be imposed upon sumnary conviction as a
penalty for violation of any regulation.

SENATE
The balance of the act regulates the
liability of the owner, does not relieve the
operator from liability, and so on.
As I remember the circumstances under
which the act was passed, a magistrate in a
police court had held that the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police had no power to regulate
traffic on the grounds around this building.
The magistrate, I understand, dismissed the
charge of a traffic infraction alleged to have
been committed on Parliament Hill because
of the lack of jurisdiction by the dominion
police or of our protective staff. Under the
circumstances there was no right to reserve
parking places for senators, members of the
cabinet and members of the House of Commons; and the speed of cars could not be
restricted in this area. And so this act was
passed. Under it there has been a certain
control over traffic in the vicinity of this
building since 1952. Now, this amending bill
is for the purpose, as the explanatory note
says, of bringing the penalties, which I have
just read and called to your special attention
into line with similar provisions of provincial
law regarding traffic. The amendment authorizes the Governor in Council to make
regulations:
prescribing a fine not exceeding five hundred
dollars or a term of imprisonment not exceeding
six months,

That is, an increase in the maximum fine
from $50 to $500.
or both such fine and teri

of imprisonment, to be

imposed upon summary conviction as a penalty
for violation of any regulation, providing for the
voluntary payment of fines and for prohibiting
persons who have violated any regulation from
driving a vehicle on such lands for any period not
exceeding one year.

In substance it merely changes the amount
of the fine and the length of the term of
imprisonment for violations of the regulations
with regard to the operation of motor vehicles
in the vicinity of this house. That is the main
substance of the bill.

Now, the question raised was: Does that
interfere with the rights, immunities and
privileges of members of Parliament? That
raises some very nice questions, and it seems
to me it might be of service if I give some
general information with regard to the rights
of Parliament, both its rights as a body and
also the rights of individual members of
You will find, honourable
Parliament.
senators, the basis upon which our rights exist
in the British North America Act, section
18, which reads as follows:
The privileges, immunities, and powers to be
held, enjoyed and exercised by the Senate and by
the House of Commons, and by the members
thereof respectively, shall be such as are from
time to time defined by Act of the Parliament of
Canada, but so that any Act of the Parliament of
Canada defining such privileges, immunities, and

powers shall not confer any privileges, immunities,
or powers, exceeding those at the passing of such
Act held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons
House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, and by the members
thereof.

That is the basis of our Parliamentary
rights and privileges. And acting under the
power contained in the British North America
Act we have passed an Act respecting the
Senate and the House of Commons to be
cited as the Senate and the House of Commons
Act. I draw your attention to section 4 of
that Act which you will find in the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1952, volume 4, chapter
249. It reads:
4. The Senate and the House of Commons respectively, and the members thereof respectively, shall
hold, enjoy and exercise,
(a) such and the like privileges, immunities and
powers as, at the time of the passing of the British
North America Act 1867, were held, enjoyed and
exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of
the United Kingdom, and by the members thereof,
so far as the same are consistent with and not
repugnant to the said Act; and
(b) such privileges, immunities and powers as are
from time to time defined by Act of the Parliament
of Canada, not exceeding those at the time of the
passing of such Act held, enjoyed and exercised by
the Commons House of Parliament of the United
Kingdom and by the members thereof respectively.
5. Such privileges, immunities and powers are
part of the general and public law of Canada and
it is not necessary to plead the same, but the same
sball, in all courts in Canada, and by and before
all judges, be taken notice of judicially.

So, you sec, we have read into our general
law of Canada the rights, immunities and so
forth enjoyed by the members of the Commons House of Parliament of Great Britain as
of the year 1867.
Now, what are they? I may say to you
that it is by no means easy to determine what
they are. I can tell you some of the things
they are not, but to make a comprehensive
study and digest of what they are is a much
more difficult process. But I will have some
conclusions to make after I read some of the
authorities on the question. Our great Parliamentary authority in Canada is Beauchesne, and I read from Beauchesne's
ParliamentaryRules and Forms, Third Edition
1943 section 183, at page 79. I read this
because it gives some knowledge upon which
one can understand the situation as it now
exists. Most of such rights are the product
of history, and unless one knows something
of the history of the subject-matter it is difficult indeed to clearly grasp the situation as it
now exists. So I read section 183:
The privileges of Parliament were first demanded
as a protection against outside interference. Members insisted on freedom from arrest for themselves and their servants during the session and
forty days before its commencement and after its
conclusion. The origin of that privilege has been
traced back to the Saxon rule; but freedom from
arrest at no time in the history of the English

MARCH 19, 1957
house, protected members from the consequence of
treason, felony or breach of peace. In 1404, it was
made a high contempt of Parliament to assault a
member of either bouse or his menial servant, and
Henry VI ordained that the penalty for assaulting
any Lord or Commoner attending Parliament should
be double damages to the party, with fine and
ransom to the King. In 1512, an Act was passed
providing that all suits, accusements, condemnations, executions, fines, amendments, corrections,
grievances, charges and impositions put or had, or
hereafter to be put or had on to members of
Parliament, shall be utterly void and of no effect.
Later in the sixteenth century the House of Commons took upon itself, without the sanction of any
legal ordinance or enactment, to be the sole judge
of its own causes.

Honourable senators may recall that there
was a long struggle in England between the
church courts and the common courts, because
the ecclesiastical courts claimed the right to
try members of the clergy and to hold them
immune from trial in the common courts.
Much the same line was followed by Parliament in assuming the right to try its members
before its own courts, and to exempt them
from trial in the ordinary courts.
Section 183 continues:
Until 1701, members arrogated to themselves the
right not to be sued before Courts of Justice during
the duration of Parliament, but in that year, a
Bill was enacted providing that suits might be
brought against peers and members during the
intervals of Parliament, after dissolution, and after
any adjournment for more than fourteen days.
In 1764, an Act was passed providing that if any
member committed an act of bankruptcy, his
creditor might proceed against him in like manner
as against other bankrupts, any privilege of the
Parliament to the contrary notwithstanding.

The extensive rights and privileges enjoyed
were then, year by year, being whittled down.
The immunity enjoyed by servants was discontinued by the Act of 1701. In 1772, the claim of
the House to constitute itself a tribunal for the
trial of private injuries done to its members was
abandoned. In 1764, the law disqualified bankrupts
from sitting in the Parliament. By the time of the
Reform Act of 1832 the only privilege remaining
to members beyond the walls of St. Stephen's were
freedom from arrest, assault, insult or menace in
their coming or going from the house, and inviolability, so far as the outside world was concerned, for their utterances within the Chamber;
and these are the only privileges enjoyed today
by the Canadian Parliament under section 18 of
the B.N.A. Act, which allows the Senate and louse
of Commons to define by statute their own
privileges, provided they shall never exceed those
at the passing of such statute possessed by the
commons House of Parliament of the United
Kingdom.

I refer in passing to another section in
Beauchesne's book:
205. Service of a criminal process on a member
within the precincts of Parliament, whilst the
House is sitting, may be a breach of privilege.

in my opinion it is not, but according to
Beauchesne it may be.
209. The committal of a member for any criminal
offence is brought before the House by a letter

addressed to the Speaker by the committing judge
or magistrate. The letter may then be referred

to the Committee on Privileges.

It will be seen that, by inference,
Beauchesne admits the power of the courts to
impose a penalty for a breach of the criminal
law.
The authority that I always turn to in
general matters of this kind in English law
is Halsbury's Laws of England. I read, in
volume 24, second edition, at page 344, under
the heading: "Privileges of Parliament":
695. The House of Lords and the House of Commons, which together constitute the ligh Court of
Parliament, claim for their members, both collectively and individually, certain rights and
privileges without which it would be impossible
for either House to maintain its independence of
action or the dignity of its position.

The author, in a footnote, states:
In the past, both Houses of Parliament have
insisted upon privileges which they have now
ceased to claim or of which they have been
deprived by Act of Parliament, and each House
has frequently asserted its privileges in a manner
which has led to disputes with the other House. . . .
Although the position and extent of parliamentary
privilege is difficult to define and its application
must depend upon each case as it arises, the result
of past cases may be summed up as establishing
the following general principles, namely:(1) that
neither House of Parliament, in order to assert its
privileges, bas the right to do anything or cause
anything to be done which is contravention of the
law of the land.

That is the situation here. If we pass this
act it will be -a law of the land, and once
Parliament has passed a law it has no power
by mere resolution, or in any other way
except the repeal of the law, to change the
law's application.
It is obviously impossible to give a complete or
accurate list of offences which would be considered
by either bouse of Parliament to constitute breaches
of its privileges, but such offences may be summed up under the following heads, namely:(1)
Any act of disrespect to the bouse itself on the
part of one of its members or by some person
who is not a member; (2) an act of disrespect to,
or an assault upon, an individual member of the
house, or a reflection upon his character; (3) any
interference with the procedure of the house or
one of its committees; (4) any interference with
an officer of the house, or other person employed
by the bouse, in the performance of his duties;
(5) a refusal to obey an order of the bouse or of
one of its committees; or (6) an attempt to induce
or procure another person to commit any such act.

That gives in a general way the rights
of Parliament itself and of its members. I
read again from Halsbury, in the same
volume, paragraph 699:
699. Whilst Parliament is sitting, and during the
time within which the privilege of Parliament extends, it is claimed by resolutions of both Houses
that no peer or member of the Flouse of Commons
may be imprisoned or restrained without the order
or sentence of the House of Lords or House of
Commons, as the case may be, unless it be for
treason or felony, or for refusing to give security
for the peace. Neither bouse of Parliament claims,
or has ever claimed, freedom from arrest of any
of its members who is charged with a criminal
offence.

SENATE

Honourable senators will observe that the
act in question is in its nature criminal law;
it is the exercise of that power which is
given to Parliament in the British North
I say it is, although the
America Act.
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) shakes his head. It is in
its nature criminal, because it prohibits certain acts and makes them subject to penalty.
So although the act is not included in the
Criminal Code-and the code is not allinclusive-in its nature, its substance, its
character, it is criminal law; and I can assure
honourable members that a violation of this
act of 1952 will be followed by the same
consequences as a violation of any of the
provisions of the Criminal Code or any laws
of the kind which prohibit acts which may
be deemed contrary to the public interest, and
provide penalties.
The only right that now remains to members of Parliament so far as immunity is
concerned, is that with regard to civil offences.
A member of Parliament is immune from arrest and imprisonment for a civil offence; but
while the right remains in English and Canadian law its practical application is gone,
for imprisonment for debt has been abolished
in Canada. I fancy some may take issue
with this statement, but the general principle
of imprisonment for debt has been abolished.
It is true that division courts make orders
with respect to the payment of money, usually
small amounts, and when payment is not
made the debtor may be committed to prison.
But the theoretical reason for the committal
is not the debt but rather the contempt of
court in not obeying the order of the court
to pay the money. So, to get around that
small matter, they make it in effect criminal
in the broader sense of that word. Contempt
of court is a criminal offence and as such
does not confer the immunity to which I
have referred.
Some may have in mind the liability of
being ordered to pay alimony. You will read
of numerous cases in the United States where
men are committed to jail for not paying
alimony.
That may also be possible in
Canada, but if that is so the penalty is
exacted because of contempt of court rather
than because of failure to pay the alimony.
My general conclusion, therefore, is that
there is very little left of these rights, immunities and privileges of Parliament except
the one to which I will refer, that is complete
privilege and immunity for words spoken in
Parliament.
I read from Oswald, Contempt of Court, at
page 186, which refers to Lord Brougham in
Wellesley's Case (1831) 2 Russ. & M. 639:
Against all civil process privilege protects ...

It still does against civil processes, but
there is no civil process left that I know
about that can affect the person of a member of Parliament. Reading again:
Against all civil process privilege

protects;

but

against contempt for not obeying process, if that
contempt is in its nature or by its incidence
criminal, privilege protects not.
Ever since that decision was given it has
been settled law that where there has been
contempt of court which, to use an expression
of Lord Brougham, savours of criminality,
privilege is no protection from arrest; and
the rule above stated was recognized and
adopted in subsequent cases.
Oswald's conclusion at page 187 is this:
. . . that privilege is no protection where the
attachment is ordered wholly or partially by way
of punishment, that is to say, where the contempt
is criminal or accompanied by circumstances of
misconduct.

Since the parking or traffic regulation itself has never been the subject of a particular privilege-these privileges go far back,
long before motor vehicles were known of
-if there is a privilege it must come within
either that class of privilege which is attached to the person of the member or that
class of privilege attaching to the body of
Parliament as a whole with respect to the
management of its internal affairs.
If a member chooses to ignore a summons
for a parking offence, a warrant for arrest
would be issued, which it seems could be
executed even in the house itself. The ignoring of a summons by a member could be
treated as contempt, and since the contempt
would be criminal rather thari civil in nature,
the authorities seem to say that the court
could attach the person of the member.
Just a few comments in conclusion, which
I have noted.
1. This bill does not appear to abridge
any privilege which members of Parliament
had before the bill was passed. If a parliamentary privilege in respect of any of the
matters covered by the Government Property Traffic Act had been abrogated, this
would have been accomplished when the
legislation was passed in 1952.
2. There is no parliamentary privilege in

privilege in "civil" matters. Sometimes the
line is hard to draw.
3. In cases of commitment for contempt
and in cases of statutory offences the house
or a committee thereof must decide in each
case if a privilege exists.

did not compel the member to go to court,
but not now. The question arises whether
a member can be served a subpoena when
the house is in session. It may be that the
person serving the subpoena should obtain
from the Speaker or perhaps the Committee
on Orders and Privileges a release of the
served member from his duty to attend the
sittings of Parliament. The authorities say
that such an application is always granted.
In modern times any immunity bas always
been waived. A member of Parliament served
with a subpoena to appear as a witness has
no immunity, in my judgment, in modern
times.
5. Even the service of a subpoena upon a
member during the session would not be regarded as a breach of privilege unless
effected within the precincts of the house
while in session.
There is doubt as to whether a subpoena
can be served right within the house itself.
So far as I can read the authorities, it can
be so served.
Honourable senators, that is the best I
have been able to make of it all. The law
of parliamentary privilege is very voluminous and difficult to read and understand,
but it does seem to me, after a study of the
authorities, that the one great privilege which
still remains to the member of Parliament is
that of serving his fellow countrymen and
taking part in the deliberations of Parliament and in the transaction of national
business. That is his great privilege. Other
privileges, such as immunity from arrest and
anything of that kind, are almost altogether
illusory.
To return to my proposition, my thought
is that if there was any breach of privilege
it was when the act was passed in 1952, but in
that regard it is no different from any other
criminal law, including the entire Criminal
Code, in connection with which there is no
privilege attaching whatsoever. If any member drives his car at an excessive rate of
speed or does any other act prohibited by
this traffic act around Parliament Hill, it
would be a shame if he could claim privilege.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And none of us, I take
it, desires such a privilege. A member of
Parliament had better answer a summons
if he receives one. A member's great
privilege, let me repeat, is to be a member
of Parliament, and to act as such, and while
serving the public interest to enjoy the
respect which is shown by almost every
citizen to a member of Parliament who is
doing his work.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I have not much to add to what bas
been said by our honourable colleague from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) in his
well-constructed, learned and logical presentation. My conviction is that the rights and
privileges of members of parliament apply not
only to the House of Commons but to the
enembers of the Senate as well. The numerous
authorities which have been quoted by our
honourable and genial friend deserve special
attention from all of us. I must include in that
tribute the honourable member from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl), who drew the attention of the Senate to the very same matter
which bas been masterfully dealt with by the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity.
Here we are together as a body. I have said
many times and on numerous occasions what
respect I have for my colleagues of the Senate,
and the people of Canada share my views
with regard to my colleagues individually.
But in these times the prestige of the Senate
is not the same as it was when I was elected
for the first time a member of parliament 33
years ago. Is that because of the indifference
that exists with regard to the Senate as a
body? I do not know. But our rights, privileges
and immunities are encroached upon on so
many occasions that I have not the time
tonight to recite them all. I can mention one
matter, which has existed for years and years,
that is, the limitation imposed by a certain
group of senators on the use of stationery,
which also imposes a limitation on our work
as members of the Senate of Canada.
It is very fortunate that today an amendment has been sponsored to Chapter 324 of
the Revised Statutes of Canada, an Act for
the control of traffic on Government property,
in order to discuss the principle of this very
important matter. We have so much legislation that it may happen that a piece of legislation is overlooked by us. We do not always
have the time to look at each bill with a
magnifying glass; and besides that, it happens
also that some members say: "What is the
use of discussing the matter? It has no importance." But what do we mean by rights,
privileges and immunities of the members of
either house of Parliament? It means that
Parliament shall be respected by the Canadian people at large, and shall be respected
especially by those who are appointed to have
the law respected in this land. I agree with
all that has been said by the honourable
senators from Toronto-Spadina and TorontoTrinity. Theirs was not only the voice of two
individuals; it was more than the voice of the
Senate; it was the voice of Parliament. Those
honourable gentlemen have defended the very
rights of Parliament in this house.
I cannot understand why some senators
may say it is a minor matter, a minor

384

encroachment, or of no importance whether
a constable who is appointed to defend
Parliament takes upon himself in virtue of
an act of Parliament the liberty to arrest or
to penalize any senator who comes here to
fulfil his duty according to the wish of the
people of the land. In the House of Commons
the members of Parliament, representing,
first, the people of their constituencies who,
have elected them, have a duty to those
people. At the same time, as Burke said at
Bristol, they represent the country at large.
We senators here represent not only our
divisions, in the first place, but we represent
the country at large, because the laws which
are erncted by Parliament apply to every
man, woman and child in the country. That
is the very reason why my honourable colleagues who have spoken on this matter,
along the same lines that I do now, have
rendered a most valuable service to the
Senate, to the House of Commons, to Parliament, and to the country, but preaching here
the respect of our own institutions. In these
days, when so much talk is heard about
freedom-fundamental freedom, rights of
the individual, rights of scoundrels-the
rights of Parliament should be defended to
the limit.
I hope that honourable senators are not
surprised to find my language so strong,
because my feelings should be theirs. We
are here to render a service. We are not
here to be sheep, we are not here to be
rubber stamps, we are not here to be office
boys, we are not here to do anything but
enact legislation that shall be useful to the
people of Canada. It is a notable duty that
we have, and it should not be underrated.
The Senate has a function to perform, to
My honourable
fulfil, in this country.
friends from Toronto-Spadina and TorontoTrinity have done very well.
This is my sincere opinion about the matter. Wherever a bill comes from, and no
matter who sponsors it, we have the right
to scrutinize it, and we are defending the
rights of the Canadian people by defending
ourselves.
Today I asked for and received a copy of
the Encyclopaedia Britannicain order to quote
to honourable senators the principles of immunities, privileges and rights of members of
Parliament.
If someone else wishes to make my speech,
I will sit down.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order!
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I got this book today,
but I have not had time to read any quotations or precedents from it. It seems to me
that our honourable colleague from TorontoTrinity has quoted enough in the learned

speech he has just delivered. What he has
said is solid, it is accurate, it is true, and you
know it. Why then should I come up with
more quotations from an encyclopaedia? You
know that from the remotest time, from the
time of the Stuarts and the early Kings of
England, Parliament has been supreme. When
the Speaker of the House of Commons comes
before the representative of Her Majesty at
the opening of a session of Parliament, he
comes as the head of the members of the
House of Commons to show that the Commons
deserve recognition. Then what happens? To
show that Parliament is supreme a bill is
presented in both houses before a motion is
made for consideration of the Speech from
the Throne. In this way Parliament affirms
its right in front of Her Majesty or Her
Majesty's representative in this land.
All this has to be remembered on such an
occasion as this. If we disagree at times, it
is a matter of minor importance, because we
are people of good will. We may disagree on
other matters, but when it comes to the
defence of our rights, traditions, immunities
and privileges, there should be a unison and
a oneness in this chamber, as there is in the
House of Commons. This is my understanding
of the whole matter, after having been a
member of the House of Commons for 31
years before coming to this chamber last
year.
The Senate is doing too well and its members are too faithful to their numerous duties
to be stopped on their way to the Parliament
buildings by a constable of any force. I say
senators are fulfilling their duty: they can be
compared to the ambulance drivers who pass
stop signs and red lights in order to save the
life of a man who has been stricken with an
illness. Their duty is just as important as
that of firemen who also may pass red lights
on their way to save buildings from destruction. We are here to do our duty as members
of Parliament. I do not know what constable
would arrest me from coming here when I
take the trouble to travel a long distance to
attend to my duties. I do not see anyone who
will stop me or penalize me in the doing of
my public duty.
Therefore, honourable senators, you will
understand my animation and feeling of protest on an occasion like this. I cannot stand
it. In speaking of a breach of privilege, I
wonder if it would not be better to amend
Chapter 324 of the Revised Statutes to make
it an offence for a traffic officer on the Crown
property that surrounds Parliament to stop
a senator or a member of the House of Commons from coming to Parliament. The offence
should be his, not that of any senator or
member of the House of Commons.
Freedom from civil and criminal arrest is
a right which has belonged to members of

MARCH 19, 1957
Parliament for centuries.
Therefore, honourable senators, I have an amendment to
move to this bill.
Before moving the amendment I would
remind my honourable colleagues that by
virtue of the rules of this house any member
of the cabinet may appear on the floor of the
Senate to explain a piece of legislation. That
is an exception which is made in favour of
ministers, and rightly so. Since I have been
a member of the Senate, during the past two
sessions, I have not seen any member of the
cabinet come here by virtue of that rule.
The witnesses who usually appear before our
committees are the heads of departments. I
have noticed the Deputy Minister of Trade
and Commerce there; and last week the
Superintendent of Insurance came before
one of our committees to give his opinion on
a piece of legislation. It was perfectly in
order for these heads of departments to come
before committees. But in this matter which
concerns the very life of Parliament I was
surprised that instead of the Deputy Minister
of Public Works, the Commissioner of the
Mounted Police, and the Chairman of the
Federal District Commission, there appeared
before the committee two minor officials.
Is it not ridiculous, honourable senators,
that no one can tell us whether the sidewalk
which surrounds the Senate is Senate property, or if it is under the management of
the Federal District Commission, or if it is
just left over by the Department of Public
Works? When I walk on that sidewalk I
want to know if I am on Senate property, or
on Federal District Commission property, or
if I am on stone that have been left over by
the Department of Public Works. The Minister of Justice could have given us that
information; he could have appeared as a
witness or sent his deputy to inform us. It
is most unfortunate that he did not do so,
honourable senators.
I demand the rights, immunities and privileges of the Senate; it is part of my duty as
a Senator to do so, and to see that the
Senate does not fall into disrepute. Therefore,
I have the honour to move, seconded by my
distinguished colleague from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croil):
That Bill Y-7, an Act to amend the Government
Property Traffie Act, be not now read a third time
but that it be referred back to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to complete the evidence relating to the Senate property
outside the Parliament Buildings (Central Block).

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the honourable Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) for
third reading of Bill Y-7, intituled "An Act
to amend the Government Property Traffic
Act" to which the Honourable Senator
Pouliot, seconded by the Honourable Senator
82719-25

Croll, has moved an amendment that the
bill be not now read a third time but that
it be referred ba.ck to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to
complete the evidence relating to the Senate
property outside the Parliament buildings
(Central Block).
Hon. David A. Croll: In rising to take part
in this debate I hope honourable senators
will bear with me for a moment if I draw
to their attention something that happened in
this house last Thursday. The house will
recall that for about fifteen minutes some of
the elder and more experienced and distinguished senators talked sense about the
lack of publicity given to Senate proceedings. You will also remember that in the
space of about a minute I rose quickly and
talked some nonsense about the same
proceedings. I was reported in the papers
and the rest of you were not. I do not know
whether that is a formula or not, but I
thought the observation was worth making.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) will correct me if
I am wrong: he said that he was of the view
that members of Parliament were subject to
criminal proceedings while Parliament was
in session and while they were on these
grounds. My memory may be playing tricks
on me, but the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity some years ago was Attorney
General of Ontario sitting with me at the
cabinet table, when a member of Parliament
-as a matter of fact, a Liberal member of
Parliament-charged with a criminal offence
was not taken into custody until he left the
buildings; he stayed here for a period of a
week or ten days. Does the honourable
gentleman recall that, or am I wrong?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I remember the case
very well, but not from looking it up recently.
I understand he was arrested in the precincts
of this house.
Hon. Mr. Croll: My recollection is that at
that time, in your capacity as Attorney General, you held the view that that would not
be the proper procedure.
You have a
perfect right to change your view in the
course of time and in the light of additional
wisdom.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If I may offer an observation: I was a member of the House of Commons at the time. I told the individual in
question not to go out. He went out and was
arrested, but he was not arrested on the
grounds of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I stand corrected.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Croll: I think the difficulties
here stem from the fact that there is a lack
of opportunity to discuss these bills in
Committee of the Whole. Because members of the Senate are not members of al
committees, the implications of the bill are
not clear. The bill on the face of it looks
harmless, it appears to be a matter of some
I presume
minor administrative nature.
the minister's office hope to have it passed
through here and sent over to the other
bouse. That house, of course, having absolute
confidence that we had carefully examined
the bill, would pass it promptly, as though it
were of no importance.
I was a member of the House of Commons
in 1952 when the original bill was passed,
although I do not recall it at the moment.
Because I made a mistake in 1952 I am
not going to repeat the mistake in this
house of wisdom. I think it is an ill-conceived
bill. It does not particularly relate to the
rights of members of the Senate or members
of the House of Commons, but it is a process
of whittling away the rights of Parliament
itself-far more important that the rights of
Parliament has constitutional
individuals.
rights. Some are written, some are unwritten,
some are inherited, but they all go to the
basic right of freedom, and that is what we
are here to preserve. If we are not careful
we shall one day find that Parliament has
been weakened by the process of measures
like this.
If I gave the impression on another occasion that I was trying to protect privileges,
it was not my intention to do so; it was rather
a loose use of language. No senator or member of the House of Commons asks for treatment other than that which is available to
Parliament asks
every other Canadian.
to be treated like Parliament and not as a
departmental adjunct or an administrative
convenience. This is an occasion when Parliament should assert itself and stand up for
its constitutional rights, or soon it may not
have any at all. It is vitally important that
we-and I refer now to the Senate-indicate
to the country at large that we are not
blotting paper for the House of Commons
or for ministerial departments. If a department has an administrative problem to deal
with, let it do it the hard way and not the
easy way. What is proposed in the bill
is the easy way. So the time has come for
us to speak up. I am prepared to support
the amendment put forward by the honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot), so that we shall have an opportunity to get in perspective, to understand, to

clarify and to reason as to what is in the
minds of those responsible for this bill.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
in rising to speak at this late hour I may be
imposing myself somewhat upon the house,
but I am a bit confused by what I have
heard this evening. I must also admit that
I cannot get as excited as some of my
colleagues seem to be about what, to my
mind, is a relatively unimportant piece of
legislation. So far the debate bas been
carried on largely by members of the legal
profession. I do not belong to that profession, and perhaps I am rushing in "where
angels fear to tread". But I cannot reconcile
the speech of the senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) with statements made by
the senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). If I rightly understood the senator
from Toronto-Trinity he said, in effect that
Parliament has practically no privileges left.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Members of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes: I think the phrase
he used was that Members of Parliament
have practically no privileges, no immunities.
But the senator from Toronto-Spadina complimented him on his fight to preserve the
privileges and immunities of Parliament.
Perhaps I am mistaken in my impression of
what the senator from Toronto-Trinity said;
if so, I would like him to correct me. He
made a profound speech, which evidenced
a great deal of research, upon which I compliment him, and for the most part his meaning was very clear. But if, as I understood,
he stated that there are now no immunities
and privileges of individual members of the
House of Commons and of the Senate to be
abrogated, I cannot understand why the
senator who succeeded him could compliment
him for fighting to preserve their privileges
and immunities. So much by the way.
I gather from the statement of the senator
from Toronto-Trinity that it is actually a
criminal offence for a member of the Senate
or of the House of Commons to violate any of
the regulations which govern travel on ground
owned by the Government of Canada. Does
this mean that, for instance, if I happen to
park my car in a place which is reserved
for somebody else I am liable to a fine of
$500? If that is so, I am dead against this
bill, because I believe in the old adage that
the punishment should fit the crime. In the
first place, I do not regard such an action as
a crime at all. In the municipality in which
I live-and the same is true, no doubt, of
any other-if I park my car in a street where
parking is prohibited, or if I go through a
red light, or violate any other traffe regula-

MARCH 19, 1957
tion, I am not accused of a crime, I do not
think I am guilty of a crime, and I would
not be tried as a criminal. If, by passing this
bill, we concede that by the violation of any
such regulations a crime is committed, I object to it very strongly indeed.
I have no objection to the amendment.
I do not know what the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has to say
about the matter, but, taking it by and large,
I think it amounts to a tempest in a teapot.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
a great deal of material has been spread on
the record this evening, and the discussion
which has taken place has created that confusion of which the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has spoken, so I
believe we should have a little more time to
think over these matters. For that reason I
would now move the adjournment of the
debate. Inasmuch as there is a meeting of
the Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts tomorrow morning,
obviously there will not be time before the
sitting tomorrow afternoon to consider all
that has been said during the discussion.
I therefore move adjournment of the
debate to Tuesday evening of next week.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not know what the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
intends to do, but personally I feel some
responsibility to do all I can to have Government legislation which is initiated here sent
on to the other place as soon as is reasonably
possible. Of course, if I do not agree with
any of it I shall vote against it, but I am
unwilling to delay action on any legislation
with which I am in agreement, because I feel
it should be considered as soon as possible
in the other bouse. There is no doubt
that we are getting very close to adjournment-much closer than some of us realize.
So, if it is intended that this bill should be
sent to the Commons at all, let us not defer
action on it beyond tomorrow.
Under the circumstances, the question of
adjournment of the debate is a difficult one.
It may be that my brain is not working well
this evening, but like the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) it is my
impression that the matters covered by this
bill are very limited, and not of a kind which
affect me as a senator. Since my immunities and rights have already disappeared, the
bill does not change our status at all. What
I object to is the provision for a $500 fine.
It is simply nonsense, and it makes me feel
hostile.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: Supposing you were to
kill a man in front of the Parliament
buildings.
82719-25J

Hon. Mr. Haig: If I kill someone I can be
charged with murder.
I served for many years on the committee
that looked after parking space for the Senate
and its staff, and we had a lot of trouble
before coming to any satisfactory arrangements. I wanted legislation to be passed
which would place the control of this matter
in the hands of Parliament. But this bill
does not do it. I know that a test case was
held in the local police court and it was
ruled that Parliament had no jurisdiction
over this matter. I thought we would get
some legislation giving us this control, but
that is not the case.
With all due respect to the honourable
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien),
who has moved the adjournment of the
debate, I think we should finish it tonight. 1
have no responsibiilty for the Government
at all, but I do have a responsibility as a
member of the Senate to try to get legislation through this house as soon as possible. I
do not want it said that we have delayed
legislation unduly. If the other house wants
to hold up legislation, that is its business,
but I don't think we should unduly delay
legislation of which we approve.
Honourable senators, this whole bill was
thoroughly discussed in committee, and the
meeting was open to all members. I think
we should finish the debate tonight and send
the bill to the House of Commons.
Hon W. Boss Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I appreciate what the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has said.
Naturally when Government
legislation is introduced in this house it is
in my interest that it should go through the
Senate without any undue delay. I might
say that it is not always easy to persuade
a minister to consent to have legislation
affecting his department introduced in the
Senate. The Minister of Public Works consented to having this bill introduced here.
Now, on the motion for third reading, it
has been proposed that the bill be sent back
to committee. I think the whole trouble
arises from the fact that not many members
attended the committee meeting at which the
bill was considered.
I was not present,
because I had to attend a cabinet meeting,
but ny information is that the question which
bas been raised tonight was not even discussed in committee.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am quite sure it was.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then I must accept
my honourable friend's word.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I
rise on a point of order. My honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) knows more

SENATE
than anybody else that a motion to adjourn
a debate is not itself debatable.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right, and
I admit that I am out of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: I must apologize
to the house, for I permitted the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
to proceed when he too was out of order.
Hon. Mr. Vien: This whole discussion is
out of order. If the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) were
given unanimous consent of the house to
speak on the motion, I would be quite willing to yield, but I would also want the
privilege of saying a word on this very
aspect of the matter.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have very few
words to say. As I said before, I appreciate
what the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has said with respect to the adjournment
of this debate. I want to point out, however,
that it would be impossible for the committee

to reassemble tomorrow morning to consider
this bill, as another important committee
is meeting. On Thursday of this week I
am desirous of giving consideration to legislation which has already been passed by the
House of Commons. Tomorrow, if we dispose of the motion that the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) has on the Order Paper, I would like
the Senate to give consideration to the
second reading of a bill to amend the Prisons
and Reformatories Act. It can be seen that
there would be little opportunity to resume
the debate on the present bill before next
week, and as there is more important
legislation to be dealt with in the meantime,
I would not object to the motion for adjournment made by the honourable senator from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien).
On motion of Hon. Mr. Vien, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

PROPOSED WIDER DISTRIBUTION AMONG

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot moved, pursuant
to notice:
That, in order to distribute evenly the sessional

work between the Honourable Members of the
Senate, and to afford them an opportunity to give
the full measure of their talents, the rules of the
Senate shall be revised and, in particular, the
membership of the standing committees of the
Senate shall be considerably reduced.

He said: Honourable senators, this is a
motion whieh is intended to afford all of
you an opportunity to give the Senate the
full measure of your talents. I do not say
this in the way of flattery. I say it so that
the Senate may remain true to its great tradition and that it may act in conformity with
the intentiopp of the Fathers of Confederation
who ,suggested its, establishment. -

I hope honourable senators will take what
I am going to say in the spirit in which I
say it. I will not argue that the rules of
the Senate are unsatisfactory. Far from it.
As a matter of fact, they are superior to the
rules of the House of Commons, for they
respect the freedom of speech of the members here. I was a member of the House of
Commons when the present Leader of the
Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was Speaker of that chamber. At
this time I wish to pay tribute to our present
Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson) by commenting that I find he is just as familiar with
British parliamentary tradition as is our Government Leader. It is in the shadow of our
Speaker's knowledge, wisdom and fairness
that I rise to speak on this occasion. That
being said, you may be sure, sir, that I will
not use unparliamentary language to express
my views as clearly and as concisely as
possible.
There is only one rule of the Senate that
I object to, and it is the one concerning
numerical membership of the standing committees of this house. I will leave aside joint
committees, that is, the committees on which
members of the Senate join members of the
House of Commons to study certain matters.
My intention now is to talk about only the
Senate's standing committees proper, and they
are numerous; in fact, I think that they may
be too numerous. I see that there are 16
standing committees, whose membership
varies from 9 to 50. The Debates and Reporting Committee has 9 members. That committee has no more usefulness; it dates back
to the time when employees of the Senate
were appointed by the Senate itself. In those
days the members of the Hansard division
were all appointed by the Speaker of the
Senate on the recommendation of this committee, but today the appointments are made,
after competitive examinations, by the Civil
Service Commission. Therefore, as I have
said, this committee of 9 members has no
longer any raison d'être.
The Committee on Standing Orders consista
of 15 members. That committee has not
met very often, and it has no special occasion
to meet, because the rules of the house are
satisfactory. Early this session some amendments to the divorce rules were sponsored
in this chamber by the honourable senator
'ftom Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuek),
and I wonder if before that he took up the
matter through the Standing Orders Coinmittee. My recollection is that he did not
do so.
Then there is the Public Buildings and
Grounds Committee, of which I am a member; it consists of 15 members It met last
year, and had a very interesting sitting. This

SENATE
is a small committee, and it has not had a
meeting this session. Last year it did very
good work in obtaining parking space near
the Library, in spite of objections by the
Federal District Commission. But as I said
yesterday, when speaking on another bill,
we do not know yet whether the sidewalk
that surrounds this chamber is part of the
Senate property or not.
Other standing committees are: Internal
Economy and Contingent Accounts, with 25
members; Tourist Traffic, 25 members;
Divorce, 25 members. In the book giving
the list of committee members there is a
note that the Divorce Committee membership
shall not be less than 9 and not more than
25 senators. There is also the Civil Service
Administration Committee, with 25 members.
That is, four standing committees have each
a membership of 25 senators.
The Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts Committee looks after appointments of persons who come under the Civil
Service Act, and deals with matters that
generally pertain to the Civil Service Commission. These appointments, in my view,
should be dealt with not by the Internal
Economy Committee, but by the committee
on Civil Service Administration, which comxnittee does not sit. As the Internal Economy
Committee has taken upon itself to make
recommendations with regard to appointments, promotions, and reclassifications in
the staff, it should not have overlooked the
staff of the Senate Post Office, the Senate
Reading Room, the char staff and the messenger staff. I hope that next year these
staffs will be considered by the Civil Service
Administration Committee of this house,
and that it will make due representations to
the Civil Service Commission.
My suggestion is that the work of the
committees should be as evenly distributed
as possible between the various standing
committees of this house.
I come now to the Tourist Traffic Committee. A few days ago we heard a very
interesting speech by the chairman of that
committee, the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor). After
his speech, we had the pleasure of hearing
from other honourable colleagues who in
splendid language told about the wealth of
picturesque scenery in the parts of Canada
from which they come. I congratulate the
honourable gentleman from Halifax-Dartmouth, and all others who participated in
that debate, upon having done so well to
promote tourist traffie in Canada. Those
speeches were all made in this chamber; the
committee did not sit. I am very glad that
our Hansard has recorded these excellent
speeches.

With regard to divorce, the answers that
were tabled yesterday by the honourable
Leader of the Government in this house were
most interesting, especially in connection
with the number of divorces that were
granted in the year of Confederation and for
a few years afterward. At that time the
population of this country was four and a
half times less than it is now. How did the
Fathers of Confederation visualize the application of tlhe provision of the British North
America Act concerning divorce? At that
time the number of divorce cases heard by
the Senate committee was practically nil;
according to the figures given yesterday by
the honourable leader, in 1867, the year of
Confederation, the committee heard none; in
1868, one; 1869, one; 1870, none; 1871, none;
1872, none. Probably that clause giving jurisdiction to the Senate in divorce cases was
inserted because there were practically no
divorces at that time. Last night the Chairman of the Divorce Committee, the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), told us the number of divorce
applications this session is quite high, nearly
450. Now, 25 members of the Senate are
paralysed in their Parliamentary activities
through having to attend Divorce Committee
sittings. I am very sorry that this is so. I
have nothing but praise for all the members
of that committee, and I cannot understand
how they can be so patient as listen to the
same story-I will not qualify it-from all
those who appear before them. In each case
the committee members have to make up
their minds whether or not the witnesses are
telling the truth. Most of the cases are sordid
and it takes men and women with an unusually high sense of duty to stand the work
throughout a session. I sympathize with
them. On the other hand, I think how much
more useful they could be, what greater
service they could render if they spent the
same time in studying highway, railway and
airplane accidents and in making recommendations that would reduce them.
Yesterday the answer was given to a question I asked about the number of persons
killed or injured in each of the last ten years
in automobile, railway and airplane accidents.
The number is appalling and shocking. For
instance, in 1955, 168 people were killed in
collisions between motor vehicles and trains;
and in 1954, the last year for which statistics
on the number injured are available, 390 were
injured in similar accidents. In 1955, 148
people were killed in other railway accidents;
and in the previous year, the last one for
which statistics on the number injured are
available, 2,359 were injured in similar
accidents.
Honourable senators, I know that cold
figures are not very interesting, but these are

MARCH 20, 1957
of the utmost importance to everyone desirous of doing something to reduce the tragic
toll of traffic accidents.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? He has deplored the fact that 25
senators devote their energies to divorce
matters when they might be engaged in other
work. What would be his remedy for the
present situation?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If my honourable friend
has no objection, I will finish what I have
to say about accidents, and then I will be
only too pleased to answer him.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Right.
interrupting.

I apologize for

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: But I thank my honourable friend for his question.
From motor vehicle accidents the number
of deaths in 1955 was 2,869. According to
the last figures available, the number of
injured in similar accidents in 1953 was
56,318. That, I point out, is the total for
only one year. I draw the attention of all
honourable senators to Hansard of yesterday,
page 371, where these figures are printed.
As regards airplane accidents: in 1955 these
caused 128 deaths and injuries to 50 persons.
My contention is that members of the Senate
Divorce Committee, although I appreciate
the painstaking work they do, would render
a much greater service to the country if
they were engaged in trying to reduce the
number of deaths and injuries in such accidents, rather than in dissolving the marriage
knot for people who, too often, make a sport
of marriage. This is not an answer to my
honourable and genial friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler): I have known him a long
time; he was the minister with whom I was
associated, and he is gifted with a dry wit
which is very keen, but that does not prevent
me from having a soft spot for him.
To answer his question, I repeat what I
said in the house when, unfortunately, he
was not here. My suggestion to reduce the
painstaking work of the Divorce Committee
is that we should, conformable to the spirit
of the Fathers of Confederation, relate the
number of divorces to be heard year by
year to the number granted at about the time
of Confederation, *multiplying the total in
accordance with the increase of population.
Of course, if we multiply nought by 4J we
shall not have much.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We shall still have
nought.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: My impression is that at
the time of Confederation the number of
divorces was about four or five annually. So,
if that number were multiplied on the basis

of the population increase, the committee
would deal each year with 20 or 25 petitions.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How would you make the
selection?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: To whom would you
give the first chance?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: To the first on the list.
It is very simple. It is my habit to ask simple
questions, and I try by a simple suggestion
to help the honourable members of the committee, even in spite of themselves. I am
sorry to invade the domain of my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who does so well as Chairman of the
Divorce Committee, but if my suggestion were
adopted the committee would have to deal
with only 20 or 25 divorce cases each year,
instead of about 450. The petitions which
had not been heard at the end of a session
would remain on a waiting list, to be dealt
with at subsequent sessions.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The next session.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Next session. or the one
after, or the one after the one after. Not many
people would suffer. I assure my honourable
colleagues who sit on the Divorce Committee
that I have sympathy for them and I try to
help them to the best of my ability by making
a simple and practical suggestion.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Simple, but not practical.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: There are other committees whose membership is increasing all
the time. There is the Miscellaneous Private
Bills Committee, which does not sit often;
there is the Committee on External Relations,
and the Committee on Public Health and Welfare, each of which has a membership of 35,
but neither-I speak subject to correctionhas held a sitting this session. I recall that my
honourable friend from Cochrane (Hon. Mr.
Bradette) did splendid service in the House
of Commons for many years as Chairman of
its External Affairs Committee. He is well
qualified to preside over the Senate External
Relations Committee, but no steps have been
taken to call it together. Yet, in the American
Congress, it is the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs which establishes the foreign
policy of our great neighbour to the south.
Moreover, no less a personage than the President of the United States never enunciates
his policy on external affairs without first
calling for advice from the Senate Committee
on Foreign Affairs. Why does our Government
not adopt a similar practice? There is a splendid opportunity for honourable senators who
are well informed on international matters
to meet and express views which will conform
to the sentiments-of the Canadian people.

SENATE
We also have a Canadian Trade Relations
Committee. Very important matters concerning trade come before the Senate, but they
are usually referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee. Why should we have a
Canadian Trade Relations Committee if we
are not going to refer any subject-matter to
it? If a committee is useless we should dispose of it.
As regards our Committee on Public Health
and Welfare, I cannot do other than remind
honourable senators that the Narcotics Control Bill was referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee on March 6.
Then we have the Committee on Natural
Resources, with a membership of 40, but to
my knowledge that committee has not met
this session.
Three of our committees-Banking and
Commerce, Transport and Communications,
and Finance-are each comprised of 50 members. I would suggest that the word "Commerce" be struck out of the name of the
present Banking and Commerce Committee
and that it be called the Committee on Banking, to which bills concerning banking should
be referred. Other money bills-concerning
insurance companies, and so on-could then
be referred to the Finance Committee. The
members at present serving on the Finance
Committee are just as capable as those serving on the Banking and Commerce Committee.
As a matter of fact, some belong to both.
The Committee on Transport and Communications is a most interesting and important committee, and I should like to have
been a member of it so that I could have
followed the policies of the Canadian National
Railways, whose officers, I presume, report
on the company's activities to the committee.
The reports of the Canadian National Railways are not printed in the Senate Hansard,
but I presume that Mr. Donald Gordon and
his aides do report on the railway's policies
and expenditures to the Committee on Transport and Communications. The work of this
committee is not publicized enough.
Honourable senators, I find that the membership of all these committees is too large
and is not evenly distributed among the
members of this house. Two senators belong
to 16 committees. I have no objection to this,
because they are the two leaders in the Senate.
The following table shows how membership
on committees is distributed:
2 Honourable senators are members of 16 committees; 2 honourable senators are members of il
conmittees; 1 honourable senator is a member of
10 committees; 3 honourable senators are members
of 9 committees; 9 honourable senators are members of 8 committees; 13 honourable senators are
members of 7 committees; 12 honourable senators
are members of 6 committees; 14 honourable
senators are members of 5 committees; 10 honourable senators are members of 4 committees; 17

honourable senators are members of 3 committees;
2 honourable senators are members of 2 committees.

Of the two members serving on the lastmentioned committee on this list, one is an
absentee. There are about 12 or 13 absentees
among the membership of all the committes.
I do not blame the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the
distribution of committee membership, but I
do say that the Committee of Selection has
not acted fairly in nominating senators to
serve on our committees.
My idea of the distribution of our committee work is that all bills that originate
in this chamber or that come from the House
of Commons should be canalized to a certain
number of committees, each having a membership not exceeding 15. The members of
these committees would be able to give careful study to every piece of legislation placed
before them. I would hope that no honourable senator would have any objection to this.
Naturally, fewer chairmen would be required
if we had 10 or 12 committees rather than 16.
There is no honour in being chairman of a
committee that does not do any work. If
members were given an opportunity to study
and scrutinize a certain number of bills they
would be in a better position to render greater
service to the Government and to the country
at large.
Honourable senators know better than I do
the splendid service which the Senate Special
Committee on the traffic in narcotic drugs
rendered to this country.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: The work of that committee was not publicized nearly enough. As
a matter of fact, there was some criticism of
it, and as late as this year a brilliant and
well-informed journalist asked me what this
committee had been doing in the United
States, and so on. The fact is that the Special
Committee on the traffie in narcotic drugs
studied a matter of deep concern to a large
section of our people, and its recommendations were most useful. The Canadian people
were 100 per cent behind the committee and
its work, but the Senate itself was not given
the credit it should have received for the
work done by that committee.
For many years the Standing Committee
on Finance, under the chairmanship of the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), did a tremendous amount of valuable
work in studying Government spending. The
honourable senator from Churchill always
acted in good faith, even though he was
criticized at times. Last year the honourable
(Hon. Mr.
senator from Milford-Hants
Hawkins) carried on this good work, and the
committee continued to supply members of

MARCH 20, 1957
full measure of their ability to their task. This
applies not only to the present membership
of the Senate but to future appointments,
and I want to qualify what I have just said.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I ask the
honourable senator if perhaps he might confine himself more specifically to the question,
rather than to a discussion of the personnel of
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you, sir; I will
abide by your ruling. But if I cannot speak
of the future I can speak of the past and
the present, If there is any senator who
objects to my suggesting qualifications required for appointment to the Senate in the
future I can tell him that the Government
never received such praise as when some independent-minded Liberals were appointed
to the Senate. I believe, sir, that I am within
your ruling in saying so. Now, I am reluctant
to say this, but I am bound to say it because of the point of order raised by my
honourable friend. Not later than July 1955
the Prime Minister and the Government of
Canada were showered with praise for the
appointment of my honourable friend fron
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croil), my honour,
able friend from Halifax North (Hon. Mr,
Connolly), and a number of others. I will
not speak about the generosity of the press
with respect to one who bas. learned in
politics a great lesson in humility, but I
will speak of the other appointees. I will
speak of the ladies who were appointed
with us; I will speak of the head of 'the
University of Alberta Arts School (Hon. Mr.
Cameron); of my good friend the former
Premier of Nova Scotia (Hon. Mr. Connolly,
Halifax North), who bas done more for his
province than any other premier of Nova
Scotia, who is respected throughout the land,
who has advertised his province, who has
built good roads, and who bas put Nova
Scotia on the- map. And there was similar
commendation of the Prime Minister for the
appointment of every one of the colleagues
that were sworn in with me, as well as the
last four appointees to the Senate. What the
country has desired in appointees to the Senate is not political colour, but character and
independence of mind and thought. I am
referring to the present and to the past, not
to the future.
My idea of the Senate is that it is a very
important body. It Is made up of legislators,
some of whom are Liberals, and some of
whom Conservatives. Each one of us, whether
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Speaking to the point a Liberal or a Conservative, is expected by
of order, sir, I will say that I have used no the' Canadian people to say publicly What he
offensive language to anyone. My motion or she, thinks is right and what he .orisbe
refers to the senators who serve on commit. thinks is wrong. The only difference between
tées, and proposes that they shall give the Liberals and the Conservatives in the Senate
82719- 26

Parliament and others with indispensable
information. The work of this committee also
was not publicized as it should have been.
As for me, I was proud that the committee
had done its work without any undue partisan
political consideration.
This year we have a Special Committee on
land use. It is another important committee,
but it has not been publicized as it should
have been, although I give credit to the
Canadian Press for having a representative
in attendance during the committee's sittings.
His reports have been fair and intelligent. I
do not complain about the reports of our sittings in the chamber, but I say that the press
at large has not treated with sufficient importance on the editorial page the work of
the three special committees that I have
mentioned.
Honourable senators, these are things that
I have wanted to say for a long time, after
having observed what is going on in the
Senate. Some people who are not familiar
with this house ask for reform of the Senate.
How would it be done? Should there be an
age limit for senators, as there is for judges
of the Supreme Court of Canada? I do not
believe that that would lead to efficiency here.
We have here in this chamber gentlemen of
wide experience whose age is more than
fourscore, who have good minds, and who
render great service to this country. I would
be opposed to depriving this country of the
excellent services rendered by my colleagues
who are older than I am, who are beyond the
age of 70. They are still active, still work hard
and give excellent service, and- they should be
held up as an example to the youth of this
country. A number of senators older than 75,
still full of enthusiasm, come in here to work
early in the morning and leave late at night,
after having done a good day's work. Reform
of the Senate could not be effected by fixing
an age limit of 70 or 75 for senators.
Now, would the Senate be improved if
sorne representatives of the Opposition were
appointed to this chamber? I doubt it. I
will tell you, honourable senators, what my
view is about it: it is that for appointment
to the Senate the Government should not look
after some gentleman whoHon. Mr. Aseltine: Mr. Speaker, I rise
to a point of order. I doubt very much if
the honourable senator is speaking to the
motion. In my opinion, the appointment of
senators to represent the Opposition has nothing to do with the question being debated
at ail.

SENATE
at the present time is that the Liberals shall
give the benefit of the doubt to the Government they support, and the Conservatives
shall give the benefit of the doubt to the
Opposition that they support in the House of
Commons. That is my view of the Senate.
Now, honourable senators, I have almost
concluded my speech. Next year I will take
up the matter again, and will sponsor an
amendment to the rules under which the
membership of standing committees is established. It is too late in this session to move
such an amendment, but I intended to do so
at the beginning of next session, with a view
to enabling the Senate to serve its full purpose. I am sure honourable senators will
understand that in this I have only one
ambition: it is that the Senate shall perform
its task as set forth by the Fathers of
Confederation.
Honourable senators, may I thank my honourable friend from Toronto-Spadina (Hon.
Mr. Croll) for the support that he gave me
yesterday. I remember the early days when
I was with him in Windsor, at the Kennedy
Stadium, with Mitch. Hepburn. My friend
was then the mayor of Windsor. He was
elected by a tremendous majority, for he
was then as popular as he is now,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I think the honourable senator from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) is out of order
when he makes that remark on a discussion
of the composition of the committees of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Well, Mr. Speaker, I
regret very much to be out of order in
expressing my admiration for one of my colleagues. I could make a much longer speech
by telling of the high regard I have for every
member of the Senate. But in view of Your
Honour's ruling, I will be unable to say the
good I would have said about my friends who
are members of the Opposition, and as well
about my friends on the Government side.
However, I can rejoice in my heart in what
I have said. May I read my motion? I
hope, Mr. Speaker, you will not object to my
thanking the honourable senator from Stadacona (Hon. Mr. Dessureault), who honoured
me by seconding my motion.
I had a nice bouquet for the honourable
Leader of the Government, (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), and also for the Leader of the
Opposition, (Hon. Mr. Haig), but unfortunately
those flowers will have to fade.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We will get them next
year, when you renew your motion.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If His Honour the Speaker
objects, what can I do? 1 will have to offer
my bouquets outside this chamber. My
motion reads as follows:

That, in order to distribute evenly the sessional
work between the honourable members of the
Senate, and to afford them an opportunity to give
the full measure of their talents, the rules of the
Senate shall be revised and, in particular, the
membership of the standing committees of the
Senate shall be considerably reduced.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Question.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, before the question is put I think
I should say a few words about this motion.
The sponsor (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) has intimated
that he does not wish to press for adoption
of his proposals at this session. He intends,
as I gathered from his remarks, to move a
similar motion next session. What he has
said today has been preliminary to the remarks which he will make at the next
session.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We will have an opportunity to study his remarks during the
recess, in order that we may give greater
consideration to this matter when it is raised
next session. Accordingly, I have very few
remarks to make today.
I do not take second place to anyone in
desiring to have the Senate function as expeditiously and as efficiently as possible. I
do not think any honourable senator can
place himself or herself in a superior position to another in that respect. Indeed,
we are all anxious to uphold the prestige
and dignity of this assembly, and to serve
Parliament to the best of our ability.
The honourable senator suggested that the
membership of some of the standing committees should be reduced. I would draw
to the attention of the house the fact that
we do not very often sit as a committee
of the whole. For that reason, I take it,
the membership of a number of the committees is unusually large in order to allow as
many senators as possible to attend committee
meetings. If the house were to sit as a
committee of the whole more frequently,
the membership of the standing committees
could perhaps be smaller, but I believe that as
long as we follow the present custom of referring bills to standing committees, it is advisable to have the main ones composed of
a substantial number of members.
The honourable gentleman referred to the
work of the Divorce Committee. He expressed his admiration of the work which
the chairman and members of that committee
are doing. I join with him in that expression
of admiration. I feel we are indebted to
that committee for the very necessary work
it is doing. My honourable friend suggested
that only a small percentage of the petitions
presented each year should be considered.

MARCH
That is a very interesting proposal, but I
doubt that it is practical. In fact, I would
not want to be one of those who had to
decide which 20 of the 400-odd applicants
should be heard. If his suggestion that
some 380 cases be stood over each year to
the following year were followed, at the
end of the tenth year there would be
3,800 unheard divorce petitions before us.
In my opinion the membership of the
Divorce Committee cannot be reduced. That
committee sits in several sections, and as
long as there are petitions before us requiring
considerations, I feel the committee must
remain at least as large as, if not larger
than, it is at present. If the committee were
to hear only 20 cases during each session,
the chairman could hear them himself, and
it could become a one-man committee.
The honourable gentleman referred to the
fact that the External Affairs Committee
did not sit this session. I would remind
the house that any honourable senator has
the right to ask that any committee be convened. A motion can be made at any time
that any matter or piece of legislation be
referred to a specific committee. In any
event, I am sure that the chairman of a
committee would convene a meeting of his
committee almost immediately, if asked to
do so.
Reference was made also to the Committee
on Canadian Trade Relations. That committee
bas been doing excellent work for several sessions. Its final report on that work has
not been presented, but I believe it is prepared
by a subcommittee. That is why the committee has not met this session.
My honourable friend mentioned that many
bills are sent to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce. He also made reference to the Standing Committee on Finance.
The Standing Committee on Finance was set
up to study especially the finances of the
Government, the spending of public funds.
The Banking and Commerce Committee bas
been considering, and I think rightly so,
bills which primarily have a financial implication. It is a large committee, and I think
quite properly a large committee, for one
reason that I have already mentioned, that
we do not consider bills in committee of
the whole bouse. The Banking and Commerce Committee is and bas been doing
excellent work. I do not see how it could
be reduced in numbers. Probably we should
be more careful in referring to that committee bills which should be referred to other
committees, but that is up to the bouse.
When a bill is referred to a committee this
house decides whether it shall be the Banking
82719-264

and Commerce Committee, the Finance Committee, the Transport and Communications
Committee, or some other committee.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
say anything about publicity. On that question we had an interesting debate, even if it
was out of order, one day last week.
I appreciate the fact that, my honourable
friend did not blame me for the fact that
some committees are too large and some are
too small. I will take the blame with other
members of the Senate, but I should remind
him that these committees are nominated in
the first instance by the Committee of Selection, which is appointed by this house. I do
not appoint the Committee of Selection. If I
am appointed chairman of it, well and good.
I do not remember whether or not I was
chairman of it this session, but I do not
think I was. In any event, when that committee meets, a chairman is appointed and
the members of the various committees are
selected by it. After the selection is made
the report of the committee is presented to
this house. I do not think it is ever considered on the day it is presented, but it is
put over for a day or two, and then this house
takes the responsibility of approving it or not.
In that way the house is responsible for the
composition of each of the committees.
The honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) has given us something to think about. He is anxious to have
the Senate function as well as possible in
the interest of Parliament and of Canada.
We are all anxious about this, and we are
open to suggestions at any time from any
honourable senator as to how improvements
may be brought about.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
there is just a word or two that I want to
say. I will not repeat anything that the
honourable Leader of the Government bas
said; I agree with what he said. I will try
to explain as best I can the reason why the
Committee of the Whole is not able to function efficiently in the Senate.
Those of us who served in a legislature or
in the House of Commons will know that
in such a chamber the Committee of the
Whole is used very extensively.
The
majority of senators will remember that
some years ago in this house we tried to
have the Committee of the Whole function
here, but did not succeed. The question
may be asked: Since it is so successful in
legislatures and in the House of Commons,
what is the difficulty here? The difficulty is
easily explained. In a legislature or in the
Commons the ministers responsible flor

SENATE
Government policies are right there on the
floor, prepared to answer any questions
that may be raised. They understand the
whole problem-they probably have had a
dozen cabinet meetings about it-and therefore are able to dispose of all questions on
the spot. But in this house, aside from the
Leader of the Government, there is no person who can speak on behalf of the Government. A few years ago we experimented on
several occasions by having a bill explained
by the responsible minister on the Senate
floor. The ministers who participated in
the experiment did not like it, and it did
not prove to be satisfactory.
When Senator Dandurand was Leader of
the Government and the Right Honourable
was Leader
of the
Meighen
Arthur
Opposition, they attended committee meetings, generally sitting one on either side
of the chairman. I asked Senator Meighen
and Senator Dandurand why the membership of the Banking and Commerce Committee was so large. Their reply was, "Mr.
flaig, we do not use the Committee of the
Whole, and if membership of the Banking
Committee is 50 senators, at least that many
may come here out of 96". The membership
of the Senate in those days was 96.
At the first meeting of the Banking and
Commerce Committee which I attended I
asked what bill was under consideration.
Although I was not a member of the committee, I was familiar with the subjectmatter because it had been discussed in the
Manitoba Legislature. I asked the chairman
if I could have a word to say on the bill or
ask one or two questions of a witness. The
chairman replied,"I don't know whether you
can or not, Mr. Haig," and one of the senators
spoke up and said, "No, you are not a member of the committee and you cannot have
any part in this discussion." When the late
Senator Dandurand heard this he remarked:
"When did that rule come in? I have been a
member of the Senate for a number of years,
and it has always been understood that any
senator can attend a committee, ask questions
of witnesses, and take part in discussions.
The only thing he cannot do is make a motion
or vote on a division." This occurred in 1936,
and since then no objection has ever been
raised in any committee to a non-member
coming in and taking part in discussions. I
admit non-members seldom attend, but that
is because they have confidence in the
Committees.
As regards the selection of committee
members, I can speak again with some authority. The member of our party who represented it in these matters when I came here
was pretty foxy. He said, "Here is Haig, a
young fellow who wants to get on in the

world; I will put him on the Selection Committee." So I became a member of that committee, and almost everyone was after me
to do this and that for him. The practice is
that the Liberal party whip produces a list
of the membership in the previous year, and
together we go over this list and arrange to
fill vacancies which have been caused by
deaths. For instance, between sessions five
Liberals and one Conservative may have
passed on. In this matter I have always been
treated with greatest consideration. Every
year I am asked whom I wish to represent
our party on the committees. Our relations
could not be more pleasant. If there were
reason to complain I would complain, but the
fact is that the majority representative insists
that I provide for Conservative representation,
and sometimes I find it rather difficult, because my followers are members of so many
committees, and I do not care to have them
too continuously occupied there. The party
whip suggests to each committee chairman
that five or six seats be left vacant. He does
so for two reasons. There may be seven or
eight newly-appointed senators whose preferences he has not been able to ascertain. Also,
if appointments to the Senate are made during
a session, places are available for them. This
is how the system has been worked, and in
15 years I have never been asked by any
honourable senator, whether a member of
my own party, the Government party, or an
independent, that he or she be appointed to
such and such a committee. That indicates, I
think, that honourable senators generally have
confidence in their committees and feel no
unsatisfied urge to join them.
I have made this statement in no spirit
of unpleasantness toward the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot), but to let him know the background
of the present system. It will not be found
in the records, but the facts are as I have
given them. So under the circumstances I
make bold to suggest to my honourable
friend that, now we have had this full discussion, he withdraw his resolution; and if
be wants to bring it forward again next session be can do so, and the matter can be
considered again at that time.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill:
Honourable
senators, for the information of the house,
and particularly of my honourable friend
from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot).
I would like to point out that any honourable
senator who may be looking for information
on which to discuss the motion, if it comes
before the house again, can find it in the
Senate Hansard for the second session of
1951. On October 16 that year a motion
similar in purpose to that of the motion
before us today was moved by the honourable

MARCH 20, 1957
Leader of the Government at that time
(Hon. Mr. Robertson). It proposed that the
membership of three important standing
committees be reduced to 17 senators.
The motion precipitated a vigorous debate,
which continued for several days and finally
was adopted by a vote of 35 to 11. The
report of the debate is very interesting.
Powerful arguments were urged pro and
con. Honourable senators who were in the
chamber at the time will remember the
debate; and, as I have suggested, all the
ammunition anyone may require for another
motion like the present one is available in
that report.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
am indebted to everybody; and I now beg
leave to withdraw the motion.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was withdrawn.

the Inspector of Jails of British Columbia,
or such other person as may be authorized
by the Lieutenant-Governor of that province,
to make such transfers.
Honourable senators, it is desirable that this
legislation be enacted at this session of
Parliament, for it is anticipated that the new
institution at Haney will be completed by
mid-summer, when Parliament will not be
in session.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) if he has any information as to
whether provision is being made for the
treatment of drug addicts at the new penal
institution at Haney?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not sure, but I
understand that the institution will be highly
advanced from the point of view of penal
reform, and will be a credit to British Columbia.

PACIFIC SALMON FISHERIES
CONVENTION BILL

Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
this legislation gives me an opportunity to say
something about prison reform, which is
a timely subject.
Many honourable senators participated in
our last Senate debate on this subject, which
took place in March of 1956. Since that tirne
we have been provided with the Fauteux Report on Remission Service, dated April 30,
1956. This is a blueprint which could affect
penal reform in our country.
The personnel of the Fauteux Committee
was as follows:
Mr. Justice Fauteux, of the Supreme Court
of Canada.
William B. Common, Director of Public
Procecutions, Ontario.
J. Alex Edmison, Assistant to the Principal,
Queen's University, Student of Penal Reform.
Joseph McCulley, Warden of Hart House,
University of Toronto. Former member of
Penitentiary Commission.
The report covers much ground and is a
sincere and thorough study. It is a heartening
report which lives up to high expectations,
though, as I will point out later, it has, in my
opinion, some shortcomings.
The Fauteux Committee was appointed in
1953 and visited all Canadian prisons and
larger provincial institutions. It also visited
institutions in Britain, France, Belgium, and
the United States.
On reading the report it is evident that it
shows up some glaring weaknesses in the
method of looking after and rehabilitating
offenders. Its main theme was leniency, parole, probation, suspended sentence and treatment. It emphasized the first principal of
modern correctional system: "Keep as many
offenders as possible out of prison."

THIRD READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the third reading of Bill 180, an Act to implement a Convention between Canada and the United
States of America for the protection,
preservation and extension of the Sockeye
Salmon Fisheries in the Fraser River System,
signed at Washington on the 26th day of
May, 1930, and a Protocol thereto signed at
Ottawa on the 28th day of December, 1956.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
PRISONS AND REFORMATORIES
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill U-9, an Act to amend the
Prisons and Reformatories Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is not
an involved piece of legislation but it is an
important one. A modern penal institution
costing about $3 million is now being built
at Haney, British Columbia. It is being
constructed in accordance with the modern
trend in the development of penal institutions,
which is to enable the segregation of different
types of criminal offenders.
Present legislation enables prison and jail
officials in British Columbia to transfer
prisoners from one institution to another.
However, this legislation is not wide enough
to enable such transfers to be made between
existing provincial penal institutions and
the new Haney institution. The purpose of
the bill now before the house is to authorize

SENATE
The report by itself, of course, accomplishes
nothing. It needs implementation, and the
manner, speed and degree of co-operation
between provincial and federal authorities
will tell the tale. Slowness in carrying out
recommendations will leave us further back
than when we started.
The task of reform-straightening out
crooked minds, calming disturbed personalities, strengthening weak characters-all this
cannot be accomplished simply by punishment, lectures, making reports, and putting
recommendations in pigeon-holes.
Let us look at the record for a moment.
These statistics are interesting. Of those committed in Ontario, 31.3 per cent are first
offenders and 41.5 per cent committed three
or more offences. Of the 10,341 committed to
reformatories, 9 per cent were committed for
the first time, 8 per cent for the second time,
8 per cent for the third time, and 30 per cent
for the fourth time or more.
The penitentiary population statistics are
not too bad. In 1955 the penitentiary population was 5,507. In 1956 it was 5,508, an
increase of one. That, of course, is very comnendable: it represents progress despite the
fact that there has been a continuous increase in the last ten years in our penitentiary
population. In 1946 the prison population
was 3,362, and in 1956 it was 5,508.
Here are some figures on general recidivism,
which is the habit of relapsing into crime.
In 1954 the figure was 77 per cent. Think
of it-three out of every four back in prison
again. In 1955 the percentage was 77.6; in
1956, it was 79.4. That is not a good record.
Penitentiary recidivism: In 1954, 38 per
cent; in 1955, 42.5 per cent; in 1956, 43.95
per cent. That is bad, as can readily be seen.
Young inmates, that is those under 21: In
1955 the number was 694, or 12.6 per cent;
in 1956, it was 669, or 12.14 per cent. That
shows some little improvement.
In 1956 there were 723 tickets of leave.
That was more than ever before, but we
are not yet liberal enough in granting tickets
of leave.
I will repeat to this house what I have said
and repeated on many occasions, and as
contained in the report, that the cost of maintaining an inmate in a penal institution is
from $1,500 to $2,500 a year. The cost of a
probation supervisor for the same period is
$50 for each probationer. That is not taking
into account the social benefits.
Honourable senators, no reform can do any
good, in fact, it is meaningless, if a criminal
having paid his debt is denied by society
the opportunity to re-establish himself, is
turned down for job after job, is coldshouldered by his neighbours, and so forced
back into crime again.

Despite the fact that men have been locking
one another up for generations, today they
earnestly question the ethics of imprisonment. They do so for many reasons and
motives, all of which are commendable. There
is greater knowledge and understanding today of what goes on behind prison bars and
its effect upon society as a whole, and the
prisoner in particular. There is a very deep
suspicion that we are wasting human material
which we cannot afford to waste-that we are
wasting money which we should not waste.
The figures on recidivism which I have
quoted today give thundering evidence in
support of these statements.
With the spread of literacy, people are
writing about their experiences. Some people
who can write have been to prison. The
daily editions of our newspapers, and particularly the weeklies, very often carry stories
by men who have been in our prisons. These
accounts are not only well written but have
a very wide circulation. Today the doors
of prisons are open to social workers, newspapermen, radio reporters, and students, who
can see for themselves what is going on.
They, too, write and speak of what they see
and hear.
We have had many reports from many commissions. I think the first one of which we
have a record dates back to 1832. More
recently we have had reports from the provinces of Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, British
Columbia, New Brunswick and Ontario.
These were excellent reports. They did not
quite cover the same reference as the Fauteux
Committee did, but to a greater or lesser
extent they gave consideration to the same
subject-matter.
The Fauteux Committee brought forward 44
recommendations-some vital, others important, and many administrative. It also
made some observations, two of which I
bring to the attention of the house:
1. We commit a child of 15 years to the
same penitentiary in which we keep adults
and hardened criminals. In 1955, 14 were
sent to the penitentiary.
2. We commit a man to prison on a charge,
hold back another and other charges, and rearrest the man, on the old charges, no matter
how old, the moment he is released.
Both of these observations should give us
great concern.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I ask the honourable senator if he was reading from the report
of the statement about re-arresting on the
old charges?
Hon. Mr. Croll: As a matter of fact, I summarized it. The committee says a great deal
more than I said.

MAIRCH 20, 1957
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The man would have
completed his sentence if hie was re-arrested
on an old charge.
Hon. Mr. Crali: That is wbat I said. I
said we "bhold back another and other charges,
and re-.arrest the man, on the old charges,
no matter how old, the moment hie is reIeased." I said that when hie has completed
his sentence on one charge, they re-arrest
him on another charge.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But hie is not paroled
and re-arrested.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No, I did flot say that. I
was quite clear in what I said. I have seen
this happen too often to be mistaken in what
they do. The committee recommended that
the man be given an opportunity to plead
guilty to ail the charges, at one Urne.
The more urgent recommendations of the
committee were as follows:
1. To establish a National Parole Board,
which would automatically review sentences,
with power to parole at will.
2. To grant pardons on a much more liberal
scale than at present.
3. Repeal law wbich authorizes imprisonment in default of payment of fines by persons unable to do so. Persons should not
become inmates for reasons of poverty.
4. No penal institution in Canada, provincial or federal, should contain more than 600
inmates. Five of our eight federal institutions
now exceed that limit.
5. A more intensifled system of treatmnent
should be instituted in the women's prison at
Kingston.
6. Encourage Canadian universities to open
schools of criminology and professional training in penal institutions.
7. AUl prison sentences of more than six
months should be the responsibility of the
federal Government, having one authority
instead of ten responsible for the welf are of
these men, so that a more effective job could
be accomplished in probation, parole and
rehabilitation.
8. The imposition of determinate plus indeterminate sentences should be repealed,
and the Parole Boards of Ontario and British
Columbia abolished.
9. Increased financial grants sbould be
made to after-care societies so that they could
work more effectively in the correctional
field.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question? I
arn rather intrigued by the suggestion that a
person who fails to pay his fine should not
be sent to j ail. In the case of a person who,
for instance, is sentenced to 14 days in jail
or a fine of $25, and who fails to pay that

fine, is it recommended that hie be let go
free, or given time to find the money to pay
Mis fine?
Hon. Mr. Croil: There are two ways of
approaching the problem.
The presiding
judge should beforehand ascertain the type
of man he is dealing with, and Mis ability to
pay. In any event, a convicted person should
be given ample time to pay bis fine on the
instalment plan.
Some judges, but not
enough of them, are doing that now.
The recommendations I have been referring
to are those that I take from the Fauteux
report; they arê flot mine. However, I wil
have some of my own to present later.
Finaily:
10. They were struck by the fact that the length
of sentences imposed In Canada when compared to
England for comparable offences Is generally much
greater. They asic, do long sentences serve the
intended purpose?

A case i point was reported in the Toronto
Star of March 6. A 19-year old errand boy
was sentenced in Toronto to 14 years in penitentiary after having been convicted of stabbing another boy following an argument.
Honourable senators have witbin their personal knowledge or have read of persons
cbarged with murder and convicted of manslaughter who escaped with much shorter
sentences. In this case the stabbing took place
as a resuit of an argument between two boys
of about the same age. The boy who was
stabbed was flot seriously injured, and the
incident was flot reported to the police department. Tbey learned of the incident, made
an arrest, and brought the boy to trial. Though
be was. as 1 say, 19 years old, with fia
previous record, he was sentenced to 14 years
in penitentiary.
In the circumstances, this is a ferocjous
application of the law; it cannot be termed
Canadian justice; it is bard and brutal. That
is the type of case which attracted the attention of the Fauteux Committee.
In some respects, the Fauteux Committee
was silent where it should have spoken. It
faiied to recommend more time off for good
behaviour. A person who is serving two years
today is released after 19 months and 8 days.
In England, a sinilar person, serving the same
time in the same circumstances, receives a
one-third cut in sentence, and serves 16
months.
The comxnittee failed to recommend a pardon in the case of a first offender, to wipe
the siate dlean and to eradicate bis conviction
from the record after five years of exemplary
citizenship; that is, to forget the past, bury
it, make the forgiveness absolute and give
the offender a new -'art. Today a rash act
involving an infraction of the law may wel

SENATE
spoil a man's chance of getting a job, obtaining a license to carry on business or emigrating to the United States if lie so desires.
These are very serious handicaps to inflict on
a person for one mistake.
The committee failed to recommend that
prisoners could earn home leave at regular
intervals in the interest of health, family life
and discipline.
They failed to recommend rehabilitation
leave for those whose release is not too far
off, in order to accustom the prisoner to
more normal surroundings and to prepare
him for his day of release. He has still to
face the unfamiliar and hostile world with a
release ticket, a few dollars, and wearing
prison-made clothes which almost appear to
have bars painted on them. Through enforced isolation lie has lost touch with society;
his rigidly controlled life has left him badly
handicapped in his efforts to rehabilitate
himself. My suggestion is, and I make it for
the second time, that his leaving prison
should be tapered off; lie should be allowed
to go home from time to time. He will
return from such leaves, there is no doubt
about it.
I do not expect that all the recommendations made by the Fauteux Committee will
be accepted, nor do I anticipate that those
which have been or will be accepted will
be fully implemented. But I do ask that
the minister-he is a member of this house
-take the country into his confidence and
bring us up to date in order that we can
judge progress in the light of the report
which took three years to compile and contains some 44 recommendations on matters
involving justice, freedom and citizenship.
Like other senators, I am looking for information, and so I put this question to
the minister: Have we made significant progress on the recommendations of the Fauteux
Committee? We ought to lose no time in
acting on the report as expeditiously as
possible.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
in view of the fact that we in New Brunswick
are moving along the same lines as is British
Columbia in the establishment of some
medium security prisons, I would like to
ask the honourable Leader of the Government
if the proposed amendment applies to other
provinces than British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It applies only to
British Columbia, but no doubt there is a
similar statute with respect to New Brunswick.
Honourable senators,-

The Hon. the Speaker: I would remind
honourable senators that if the honourable
leader speaks at this time lie will close the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: First, I should like
to thank the honourable senator frorn
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croil) for his
very interesting and enlightening address on
a subject with which he bas been familiar
for many years. I know of his interest in
these unfortunate people, from having heard
him speak once before in this house and on
numerous occasions in the House of Commons.
We all, I am sure, have an interest in the
man who has served a time in a penal
institution, but unfortunately we are not sufficiently interested in him after he is
released. As the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina has said, he comes out of
jail, reformatory or penitentiary, and we
take too long to forget that he has spent time
behind bars. When he applies for a job,
and it becomes known that he has served a
prison term, we hestitate to employ him. Not
only do we hestitate in that respect, but we
take no interest in him at all. Then we
wonder why lie becomes a repeater.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But no Government can do
anything about it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think my friend is
right to a certain extent. The only thing the
Government can do, as has already been
suggested, is to grant a pardon after a man
has served a term for not too serious an
offence. The Fauteux Committee made a
recommendation in that regard.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: But they did not recommend an immediate pardon.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, not an immediate
pardon. That question is receiving attention of the Department of Justice.
We ail have a great deal of sympathy for
men and women who have been in prison,
and we say we would like to see them
released, but if after they are free they commit a second-and perhaps a more serlouscrime, the public reacts quite differently to
them. Honourable senators will recall that
as recently as a month ago a man who was
released from one of our penitentiaries on a
ticket of leaveHon. Mr. Dupuis: He was frorn British
Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -shot and killed a
policeman in the city of Montreal. Immediately there was a deluge of complaints to me,
as minister, that this man had been let out
before his time. That is the type of situation
we face in these cases. Fortunately, not too

MARCH 20. 1957
mnany convicted persons fail to carry out the
terms of their ticket of leave.
I happen toi have before me the figures
for 1956 which indicate that the total number of prisoners released on ticket of leave
in that year was 1,620.
Hon. Mr. Croli: The figure I have is takeri
fromn the blue book, the annual report.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do flot suppose
the figure for 1956 would be in there?
Hon. Mr. Croil: This is for 1955.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The total releases
in 1956 were, 1,620. 0f these, 102 broke the
ternis of their conditions of release and were
recalled to complete their terni. That is not
a very high percentage; it is about 6 per
cent. Fifty-one of the 102 were convicted of
an off ence during the time they were on
ticket of leave. Such conviction while on
ticket of leave automatically brings their
freedom to an end, and the time that was
credited to themn for good behaviour is added
on and they have to complete their ternis.
The remaining 51 were called back because
they did flot live Up to the conditions of
their release. Hlonourable senators realize
that when a man is allowed out on a ticket
of leave there are certain conditions attached
to his release: hie has to report, he usually
has to abstain from. the use of intoxicating
liquor; he cannot associate with his former
companions if they have criminal records or
are believed to be leading an unsatisfactory
life.
The honourable senator from TorontoSpadina has asked what progress has been
made over the year since hie brought this
matter Up in the house. Considerable progress
has been made. During th.is year there have
been established by my departmnent four
additional regional offices. Until this year
there were two regional offices, that is, places
where men who are on ticket of leave report,
either directly or indirectly. There is a
central office at Ottawa, of course. Smnce 1948
there has been an office at Vancouver, and
there has been one in Montreal. This year
one is being established at Moncton. Here
I repeat what I said on a former occasion,
that New Brunswick is making great strides
in titis matter; it is taking a keen interest
in those who are in institutions and who are
being released. The office at Moncton will be
for the Atlantic provinces. A new office Is
being established at Toronto, another one at
Winnipeg, and a f ourth at Kingston. Also,
three additional employees are being taken
on the staff at Ottawa to make inquiries and
to enable reports to be handled more expeditlously. The men in charge of the various
offices have had considerable experience i
correctional. work and in social service.

The persons who are released in each
of these districts will be under the joint
supervision of an officiai for the district and
an officiai from an after-care socîety. So
1 think honourable members will agree that
we have mnade considerable progress in that
respect.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: How are these regional
offices termed?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They are known as
Regional Remission Branches of the Department of Justice.
Probably honourable senators will be
interested to know that in 1949 there were 907
people allowed out on ticket of leave, but
only 87 of those were under the supervision
of any agency.
In 1956, out of a total of 1,423 allowed out,
1,037 were under the supervision of social
agencies. A number of these persons had
practically finished their terni, so they did
not have to be supervised.
My honourable friend said there had been
an increase in the number sent to penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Croli: There was only an increase
of one titis year over last year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He mentioned also,
that recidivism was greater than in previous
years. I do flot know how we can account for
that. The oniy thing I can say is that practically every inmate of a penitentiary is there
because of a second offence. Only those who
receive sentences of two years or more are
sent to penitentiary, and most men on their
first conviction do not receive a sentence of
two years. It naturally follows that the large
percentage of those in the penitentiary are
second-offenders. My great concern has been
that a man who gets out of penitentiary shail
not become a third-offender. We have no
figures on how many inmates are third
offenders.
My honourable friend referred to a subi ect
which has given the department, judges, and
everyone interested in prisoners great concern: that is, the difference in the lengths
of sentences which are meted out. It is a
very difficuit; matter. I think anyone who has
had anything to do with criminals, any lawyer
who has appeared before the courts, knows
how hard it is to properly apportion the
sentence to the crime. The degree of criminality is not always the sanie. Men are brought
up in different surroundings and commit
crimes under varying circumnstances.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is there any factual evidence
to show that leniency by way of reduction
of sentences is effective in curing or helping
to reduce crime? I have been interested ini
the growing trend to reduction of sentences.

DEBATE PROCEDURE
SECONDING OF MOTION

Hon. Jean-Francois Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I have a correction to make to
yesterday's Minutes of Proceedings and
Debates of the Senate. The motion that I
sponsored concerning the distribution of the
Senate work among its members was seconded
by the honourable senator from Halifax North
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) as well as by the honourable senator from Stadacona (Hon. Mr. Dessureault), but in the records the honourable
senator from Stadacona is shown as the only
seconder.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would remind the
honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) that it is the custom in
this house to have only one seconder to a
motion.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: May it please your
Honour: when I mentioned yesterday that
the motion had two seconders, no one took
objection, so I was surprised when I did not
find my words in either the Minutes of
Proceedings or Hansard. For me, the more
seconders of a motion, the more important the
motion may be.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable
senator may be right in his logic, but I can
see indefinite possibilities if this procedure

were followed to any great extent. I will
make inquiry from the officers of the house,
but my impression is that it is customary to
proceed with one seconder only.

MUNICIPAL GRANTS BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 158, an Act to amend the
Municipal Grants Act.
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that municipal grants were first paid in lieu
of taxes on federal properties in February,
1950, under municipal grants regulations, and
that later those regulations were put into
statutory form. Under the original formula,
annual grants were limited to 75 per cent of
a tax rate applied to the value of the federal
property in a municipality in excess of 4 per
cent of the aggregate of taxable and federal
property in the municipality.
The original formula was applied in determination of grants in lieu of taxes for five
years, that is from 1949 until 1954. During
that time 48 municipalities were in receipt of
annual grants totalling approximately $3 million. Honourable senators will recall that in
1955 the Municipal Grants Act was broadened
substantially in scope. The percentage of
federal property in the municipality which
would enable a municipality to obtain grants
was reduced in that year from 4 per cent to
2 per cent. It will be recalled that when the
grants were paid originally only 75 per cent
of the tax applicable was taken into consideration for the grant-that is, 75 per cent over
4 per cent. But in 1955 that limit of 75 per
cent was taken off and grants were made on
100 per cent, provided the federal property in
the municipality was over 2 per cent of the
aggregate. To put it in other words, as the
honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly) has suggested, grants were
made on 100 per cent of 98 per cent of federal
property in a municipality.
Hon Mr. Haig: Provided it was over 2 per
cent.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If the municipality
had federal property within its boundaries of
the value of less than 2 per cent of the taxable
property, then no grant was made to that
municipality.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But if it were over
2 per cent, then 100 per cent of the tax was
paid.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This bill takes the
2 per cent limit out of the act. The bill provides that the Government will make grants
in respect to 100 per cent of the taxes on
federal property.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Would that include railway property?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I believe railway
property comes under another provision.
There are exceptions, and honourable senators will find them listed in the bill. I will
not go over all the exceptions, but, generally
speaking, the payment of grants does not
apply to park land, nor to museums and the
land used for such institutions.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does the Government also
pay taxes for local improvements?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, the bill provides
for the making of grants for local improvement taxes. There are provisions for special
cases also. For instance, there may be a concentration of Government property in one
municipality, which receives a grant in lieu
of taxes, whereas an adjoining municipality
receives no grant, notwithstanding the regular
use of the streets of that adjoining municipality by people going to and from the concentration of property. In such circumstances
a grant can be paid to the adjoining
municipality.
The bill also provides for a case where, for
instance, in a municipality eligible for a
grant, a park land has on it a residence which
is not used in connection with the park. A
grant would be made in lieu of taxes on that
residence.
There is also provision for grants with
respect to land which is used in connection
with airports. Also, where there is, as at
Gagetown, New Brunswick, a concentration
of federal buildings and activities, the Government can enter into a special arrangement
with the province in connection with the
property.
Another provision relates to the city of
Ottawa. In general, the act prevails in respect
of Government properties in Ottawa, but in
respect of the Houses of Parliament, comprising the Centre Block, the Library, the lands

MARCH 21, 1957
west of the East Block and east of the West
Block, from Wellington Street to the river,
a grant is flot made in lieu of taxes but a
lump sum is payable in respect of these
properties to the city.
I believe I have mentioned the main
features
of this
legislation.
Probably
honourable senators would like to have more
details, so when the bill has received second
reading today I shall propose that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, where departmental
officiais can appear to give honourable members any further information they desire.
Hon. Thornas Reid: Honourable senators, I
should like to say a word or two about this
bill, and the reason 1 amn speaking today is
that I have to leave on Saturday to attend to
duties connected with the International
Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission.
In the first place, I commend the Government for having introduced this bill. It
is progressive legislation and, I believe, will
be well received ini every province. I compliment the Government upon the provision
which relieves it from acceptance of assessments of local assessors. For the past four
years, in the province and the municipality
where I reside, assessments have been
increasing each year. Until about two years
ago I thought that the local assessor was to
blame for the continuing rnethod of raising
assessrnents every year, but on investigation
I learned that the assessors act on orders of
the provincial Government, which has taken
the assessment of property completely out of
the hands o! the local authorities, by issuing
direct instructions to every municipal assessor that provincial directions in respect of
assessments must be followed to the letter.
And so, for the past four years the assessments have been going up and up, and if
under the present regime in British Columbia
we are to receive $28 a year, as promised by
the Premier, ahl it amounts to is a return to
us o! some of the money which the Government has stolen or taken from us during
the past four years.
Before the provincial authorities intervened
to regulate assessments, property owners
aggrieved by valuations o! assessors were
able to go before a court of revision, composed of men responsible to the people and
required to come before the people, or ratepayers, for re-election. If you felt that you
had not obtained justice in that court, you
could appeal to the judge of the county
court. That process has entirely disappeared
in the province o! British Columbia. An
order cornes from Victoria to the assessors
to raise assessments to certain heights, and
if an owner is dissatisfied he rnay take bis

case to a so-called court, which consists of
three persons appointed by the Government.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask whether a
property can be assessed at more than its
value?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Weil, there are two different values.
Is -the honourable senator
speaking of the actual value of the property
or its sale value?
Hon. Mr. Euler: What
beyond the sale value?

value is there

Hon. Mr. Reid: What the assessment in
British Columbia is based on now is sale
value, and not always the actual value. Sometimes sale values go very high, because occasionally certain parties are willlng to pay
fabulous prices, for particular pieces of
property, and that situation affects assessments in the surrounding area. I happen
to know, from municipal experience, something about this matter; I do know what is
happening out in British Columbia; and that
is why I arn pleased that the dominion Government is not going to subniit to locailyimposed assessments, but will send in its own
assessors and ascertain whether the valuations
are proper.
I was pointing out that formerly a dissatisfied owner could appeal to a local court of
revision and from there to a judge of the
county court, but that now one must appear
before three provincial Government appointees-they could be henchmen, or otherwiseand if their decision is unsatisfactory the
only recourse left is to appeal to a body of
three men in Victoria who are also appointees
of the provincial Government. This means
that one has iost his case before he begins
it ; to appeal is simpiy a waste of time. We
have iost our rights. Sa, I reiterate that if
a British Columbian is now receiving the
$28 a year which has been promised him from
time to time he is merely getting back what
was taken from him.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Does that mean that
taxes are going down?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. My taxes on a 20-acre
block, which were $25 a year back in 1922,
are now $385, and. I arn getting little more,
if any, added service for my taxes than I
got thirty-five years ago. The same road is
there, but we are required to pay for the
great increase in schools, hospitals and other
requirements of people who are coming in,
and for construction o! new roads.
As regards the province of Alberta, I do
not know whether it is realized that a kind
o! new nationality has been created, because,
by Government order, to receive the special
allowance or dividend one must now be an

SENATE

Canadians first, and afterwards Albertans,
British Columbians, Nova Scotians, Newfoundlanders, or so on, according to the province in which we lived. Now, as far as a
person living in Alberta is concerned, he is
to be designated an Albertan first. That, to
my mind, might start a very unwise trend in
this great country of ours.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How long must one be in
Alberta before one can become an Albertan?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Five years. Of course, while
the people are happy to get anything they
can, they would like to be dealt with more
generously by the federal Government.
Alberta can easily afford per capita grants of
$22 because of the oil discovered there, but
after all has not every Canadian citizen some
interest in the oil of that province? Could
Alberta protect its resources if it were
a little country standing by itself? It enjoys
the benefits from discoveries of oil not because it is Alberta but because it is part
of Canada, but its money distributions are
made on the basis that no one is entitled
to them who has not lived in the province
for five years. I say this is wrong. It is
high time that Alberta be designated as one
of the rich provinces, since it has collected
enough money to pay off its provincial debt,
and if it has not done so it is merely because
its surpluses are more or less concealed. No
other province is in so favourable a situation.
Every Canadian has an interest in this matter,
and it is to emphasize the fact that I have
risen to speak this afternoon.
There is one other matter which I should
mention and which, I believe, comes within
the range of this debate. I would like the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) to put a request before the
cabinet on behalf of the municipalities and
have a note taken of what I am about to
suggest. Much is said about health insurance,
and the dominion Government is moving a
good way in that direction. But one of
the first requirements in the promotion of
national health is the provision of hospitals.
In my own district we cannot build a hospital
because it would be necessary to raise the
funds in the United States. Ten years or
more ago the dominion Government undertook to provide $1,000 per hospital bed. At
that time the cost of providing a bed was
between $3,500 and $4,000. Now, although the
grant has not been increased, a hospital bed
costs around $10,000. I think it is time that
this situation be reviewed.
I make no apologies for rising and advocating that some consideration be given the
municipalities which, under present high
costs of labour and materials, have to pay

larger sums of money for hospital requirements, yet receive only the same grant per
hospital bed as they received eleven years
ago.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) a question?
Has he any information which would indicate
the amount of money represented by the
expenditure under this new formula, and
also the number of municipalities that would
be affected by this legislation?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Before the debate is
closed I will endeavour to find the information sought by my honourable friend.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I am in a rather peculiar position with respect
to this legislation, for I find I want to commend the Government for introducing it.
It is one of the most forward steps this Government has taken in some time. I have
always bitterly opposed the present system
whereby some small communities having a
limited amount of federal property can qualify
for grants, whereas many larger centres with
far more federal property cannot qualify.
A municipality has been able to qualify for
grants in lieu of taxes provided the federal
property in that municipality exceeded in
value 2 per cent of the combined value of
taxable and federal property. Winnipeg has
a large number of federal buildings, but it
does not get any grants with respect to them,
despite the fact that the city furnishes the
usual urban services. The only municipal
service the federal Government does not enjoy
is that rendered by schools. This bill represents the first real attempt to allocate fairly
some of Winnipeg's municipal costs to the
dominion Government, in so far as federal
property is concerned. The same applies to
Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And other places.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
said about assessment applies, of course, to
every city.
The federal Government is not too good,
but unless we can have one formed by the
Conservative party I would rather have the
Liberal party in office than any other. The
Government is at least trying to do what is
right in this matter. Property values have
gone up everywhere and therefore assessments have gone up. I know they have increased materially in Winnipeg. When a
private property owner is not satisfied with
an assessment that has been made on his
property he can appeal to a judge who, after
hearing the evidence, will decide the issue.
I believe this practice applies throughout
Canada.

MARCH 21, 1957
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It reserved the minerai
rights.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Honourable senators, I think this bill should
go to commnittee. I for one wouild like a ful
explanation. If it means, as I think it does,
that there wiil be proper taxation of dominion
Government property in every city and
municipality in this country where such
property exists, then I arn ail for it.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
few of us could find fault with the underlying
principle of this legisiation, although perhaps
that needs to be said with some reservation.
We cail these municipal grants, but in
effect we are inaugurating a system by which
the federal Government will pay taxes on its
properties in various municipalities throughout Canada. That is the bare bories o! the
thing. The bill is a very complicated bill, and
I arn almost impeiled to register criticism
against the manner in which it is drafted.
I do not mind admidtting that one day I studied
it for several hours and f ound it difficult to
comprehend how the measure would operate,
although that may have been my f ault. For
legisiation of this kind it would be much
better if the amendments were drafted in a
bill along with the old sections of the act
that are to be retained. Then it would be
before us as a whole, and it would not be
necessary to go through two or three other
acts and relate thern to the arnendrnents proposed here. However, that is by the way.
In one particular this legislation is unique.

one likes to see assessments go up, but in
order to meet rising costs of municipal administration it bas been necessary to increase
them. They are the only source of municipal
revenue. I will not get into any political discussion as to whether there should be other
sources.
Honourable senators, as I have said, this
legisiation is the first real attempt to give the
municipalities a break with respect to taxation of federal property, and everyone
knows they need this break. I think my
honourable friend, the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was right in
suggesting that the bill be referred to committee. When we return to our own communities people will ask us about this legisiation.
As far as the Manitoba senators are concerned, they will be asked about it in Winnipeg, Portage la Prairie, Brandon, Dauphin
and other communities. While the minister
bas given us a full explanation of the bill,
I think we would have a better understanding
of it if we discussed it in committee with the
appropriate officiais.

discussion about oul right in Alberta, but there

services, for which it pays directly; it gets
fire protection; it gets police protection. I
think it is only fair that for these services
the federal Government should give some
compensation.
On the broader field, I feel bound to say
that I have some reservations. Take the city
of Ottawa as an illustration. This city has
benefited far more than any other municipality
in Canada by reason of the fact that it is
the national capital. For instance, no other
city has a more assured payroll for employees.
I do not know how many tens of millions or
scores of millions of dollars the federal Government pays to its employees here, but I do
know that the main burden of its payroll is
in this city. Of course, that is of real benefit
to the varied businesses that are carried on by
the citizens of Ottawa. The federal Government spends large sums of money in Ottawa
in other ways, as, for example, through the
Federal District Commission. I do not know
how many millions of dollars is in its budget
for the Commission this year. It maintains the
thoroughfare known as the DrivewayHon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
federal Government owns the Driveway.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, it owns the Driveway,
but it is maintained as a service for the people
of Ottawa. The commission is responsible for
cutting the grass on the Driveway boulevards
and, for some strange reason which I have
never been able to fathom, on Clemow
Avenue also, one of the leading streets in the
southern part of the city. The federal Government has assisted in building bridges in the
city that are a service to the residents of
the city. And after the passage of this bill,
as the honourable Leader of the Government
stated, the only federal Government property
in Ottawa that would not come under this
legislation is the building in which we hold
our deliberations. The East Block, the West
Block, the Justice Building, the Confederation
Building-all of these can be assessed, and
the municipality will receive a tax based on
the assessment.
Now that seems to me to be an extraordinary arrangement. I say that for the reason
that the City of Ottawa does not spend one
cent for police protection in this area; it does
not cut the grass or pave the streets; it
renders no service to the federal Government
in the area from the canal west to the old
brewery building.

from that, this whole area derives no direct
benefit from the city. I believe I am correct
in that statement. It seems to me that this
whole area should have been exempted from
the application of the act.
I hope that the bill will go to a committee, because there is a good deal of information which could usefully be received
in respect of how it will actually work out.
It is interesting to note that in the past
there have been great demands on whatever
Government was in power in Ottawa to build
public buildings here and there throughout
the country. Every person who has had
a part in any Government here knows the
truth of this statement. Very often the
people in the municipalities did not want
any small or unimportant buildings; they
wanted a substantial and an important one.
For instance, in the city of Winnipeg, the
federal Government is now completing a
post office building. I do not know what its
total cost will be, but the original estimate
was from $12 million to $15 million. In
all my experience, honourable senators, I
have never known a Government building to
be constructed for less than the estimate given.
Now what does this mean? It means that
the federal Government will pay taxes on a
much higher assessment in Winnipeg because
of the erection of the post office. And that,
let me repeat, will be because of a building
on which the Government does not make
directly one cent of profit; it is a building
which is for service to the community.
Perhaps my thinking is wrong, but I doubt
the wisdom of the principle of imposing taxes
on buildings for which the people in the
community do not pay directly, and which
buildings are supposed to give a service. I
can well foresee that a prudent Minister of
Finance and a prudent Government will hereafter look very carefully at requests that
come from members of constituencies, or
groups of constituencies, for federal buildings.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I doubt it.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: My friend doubts it. Perhaps he may be right in the current way
of thinking, because our present philosophy
is one of spending, spending, and never thinking of tomorrow.
Honourable senators, I ask you, what is
the sense of going out and spreading public
buildings all over Canada if we thereby put
an additional burden on the treasury? What

MARCH 21, 1957
million come from? It will have to come
from taxes collected by Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: This is one way of helping the municipalities.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The people of the municipalities pay directly, as by income tax, or
indirectly, as by sales tax, the amount that
goes back to them by way of municipal
grants. I have not yet discovered any people
in Canada who do not pay taxes to the
federal Government. Even the "panhandler"
who walks up and down Wellington Street
pays taxes in some form or other to the
federal Government.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: They are bound to get you.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I was pleased to hear
the honourable leader say he intends to
move that the bill be referred to committee.
When it reaches the committee I think we
should have some questions to ask with a
view to getting a little better understanding
of how the legislation is likely to operate.
This is an important measure; there is no
doubt about that. It is important because of
the adoption of the principle that henceforth
tederal Government property, wherever it
may be situated, will, with certain exemptions such as monuments and parks, pay
tax. And I am almost prepared to predict
that within a few years there will come a
demand that qhe federal Government should
pay taxes on historic sights and parks
throughout Canada.
Hon. Mr. Baird: May I ask a question of
the honourable senator? He made a statement to the effect that the post office did
not make any money, that it just rendered
a service to the people. Well, I think if he
looks at some figures of the past he will find
that the post office has made considerable
money, as have other government departments which function in various cities.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): What
about the Department of National Revenue?
Hon. Mr. Baird: These departments are all
doing business in their own way.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The Department of
National Revenue has no balance sheet. I
do not know whether the post office has one,
but if it has it will show back over the years
a balance on the deficit side more often than
on the profit side.
Hon. Mr. Baird: That may be, but it still
makes a profit.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: True, the post office sells
stamps, but that is a service to the community.
I overlooked mentioning one. point. The
Department of Public Works builds post

office buildings and gets no revenue from
them. We discovered that fact in one of
our committees not long ago. If it were on
a strictly business basis, the Department of
Public Works would charge the Post Office
Department rent, but it does not do so. The
Post Office Department gets the building free.
I trust I have not wearied honourable
senators, and that what I have suggested may
be of some interest to the house.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, I should like to make a few observations
on the bill itself, and to bring ta your attention some aspects of the problems which are
related directly and indirectly to this legislation. The honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) bas given a very
excellent account of the background of the
legislation since 1950, and I should not like
to enter upon this phase of the discussion.
The principle of Bill 158 is simple and
direct. It provides for the payment of the
equivalent of full municipal taxes on federal
property, as defined, with some exceptions.
We are dealing here with a more comprehensive approach than there bas been in the past,
extending still further the principle of the
original grants formula of 1950, and removing
more of the exemptions from local municipal
taxation which the Crown has enjoyed for a
very long time. We are, as it were, witnessing
the gradual liquidation of the former premise
that the federal Government need not share
the cost of local municipal services provided
by local governments.
Although arguments are being advanced
that the extension of this municipal grants
program is not motivated by present municipal fiscal need, which is a direct provincial
matter and not really the purpose of this bill,
the net result of this bill will be to increase
the transfer of federal local revenues to
municipalities in the form of grants, even
though we may defend them as a voluntary
act of grace. It is immaterial whether this
extension is ex gratia or ex justicio; the fact
remains that the character of the local services is changing drastically under the impact
of modern conditions, and the needs of the
municipalities will have to be more carefully
considered by the higher levels of government, be it directly or indirectly.
In a practical sense, from some 500 recipient municipalities and .grants amounting
to $9j million, this legislation will bring to
an estimated 1,300 municipalities payments
amounting from $16 million to $20 million
per year. Please note that this additional
assistance to municipalities is not very substantial when one considers that, for the year
ended December 31, 1954, municipalities in
effect had a deficit of expenditures. over
receipts of almost 40 per cent, and at that

SENATE
time the receipts were in the neighbourhood
of over $800 million. The need at the municipal level for more revenue appears urgent,
and I may have more to say about it later.
I should like to draw attention to an expected collateral result of this legislation,
which will probably be the acceptance of this
principle of paying the equivalent of full
municipal taxation, also on similar types of
property owned by Crown corporations. To
me it is inconceivable that Crown corporations will not follow the leadership of the
federal Government in this regard, although
the practical application of this principle will
require careful study and adjudication.
The present bill contains an excluding section concerning properties owned by Crown
corporations, tax grants on which are still
subject to negotiations. I understand that
present Crown corporation payments range
from a low of 15 or 20 per cent to a high
of 100 per cent of taxation, as in the case
of the Polymer Corporation. The impact of
the voluntarily accepted principle contained
in Bill 158 will necessitate interesting changes
in these negotiations between municipalities
and Crown corporations so that they may be
in line with the basic hypotheses in this bill.
Consequently we welcome the assurances that
this problem is going to receive active consideration by the Ministry of Finance and by
the Crown corporations themselves.
I believe the net result of this bill will
be more financial assistance to municipalities,
in an amount of roughly, $8 million to $10
million per year. Whether directly or indirectly, this bill is an acknowledgment of the
existence of financial need at the municipal
level.
This brings into focus the whole problem
of the division of revenue between the various
governmental jurisdictions in Canada. This
basic problem needs constant and continued
review. It needs understanding and an avoidance of misconceptions and partial truths.
For example, figures are often quoted that
the federal Government takes 75 per cent
of all the taxation revenue and leaves the
provinces and the municipalities to struggle
along as best they can with the remaining
25 per cent. This estimate is high, at the
very best, and it must be corrected. The
figures for 1953-54, which are complete, show
the percentages as 71 for the federal Government, 16 per cent for the provincial Governments, and 13 per cent for municipal
Governments. But that does not take into
account the intergovernmental transfers, and
these are very, very substantial indeed. In
the White Paper for 1956 these transfers
from the federal Government to the provincial
Governments are estimated at close to $400

million. So, if one makes these corrections
at the three levels, the percentages for the
year I have mentioned change to 64 per cent
for the federal Government, 19 per cent for
the provincial Governments and 17 per cent
for the municipal Governments.
And that does not tell the whole story,
because the character of the federal Government expenditures and the demands on the
federal treasury have changed beyond recognition since the pre-war years, or 1939, which
is often taken as the base point for comparison. We must know that the change in the
past decade or so has been tremendous, and
if we want to make an analysis-and one
has been made by competent financial people
-in an attempt to relate the present expenditure of the federal Government to the kind of
demands that existed back in 1939; and if we
delete the increase in defence expenditures
and veterans' pensions, the debt charges, and
all the new social welfare costs, and then if
we make similar adjustments on the provincial and municipal levels, we find the relative
position is roughly the same as in 1939,
when the federal Government was taking a
little over 40 per cent of the taxation revenue,
the provincial Government took 32 per cent
or thereabouts, and the municipal Governments got 28 per cent.
I am raising these points because there is
too much talk-I will not call it misguidedabout the tremendous amount of money that
is taken by the federal Government, and the
problem needs to be analyzed a little more
fully.
Honourable senators, I would again draw
your attention to the problem of municipal
taxation and fiscal need at the local level.
I would point out that the latest consolidation
of public finance statistics, for the year
ending December 31, 1954, after transfer payments, shows that the federal Government received $4,204,469,000 and expended
$4,056,161,000. You will notice there is a
surplus at the federal level. However, at
the provincial level the receipts totalled
$1,054,979,000 and the expenditures totalled
$1,349,385,000.
That represents a deficit of
almost 30 per cent. Much the same picture
exists at the municipal level where the
receipts were $885,082,000 and the expenditures $1,214,033,000, a deficit of almost 40 per
cent.
At page 17 of the White Paper, with relation to the latest year's expenditures, it is
stated:
Expenditures by provincial and municipal Governments rose by $364 million or 13 per cent while
revenues increased' by $254 million or 9 per cent
and the deficit more than tripled and reached a
level of $157 million.
In the federal accounts,
excluding the adjustment for the accrual of corporation taxes mentioned above, receipts increased by

MARCH 21, 1957
$764 million or 16 per cent and expenditures rose
by $264 million or 6 per cent. As a result, the 1955
deficit of $14 million gave way to a surplus of $486
million in 1956.

municipalities will benefit from this act, and
that the estimated total annual payments will
range between $16 million to $20 million.

SENATE

my city pays the cost of paving the street in
front of his property, although everybody is
at liberty to use the street. As to police protection, schools, et cetera, why should real
estate pay for these and all other services that
the municipalities render? I confess that I
do not know the remedy. In most towns and
cities many people do not own any real
estate at all; some are landlords and some
are tenants. It may be argued that the
tenant pays taxes through the rent on the
property he occupies, but I do not think that
is entirely true. There are men such as
some of my colleagues-I will not mention
names-who perhaps own no real estate, but
who own bonds, stocks and other securities,
from which they receive dividends, and yet
who do not pay a single cent for police
protection, the education of their children
and all the rest of the services rendered by
the cities in which they live.
I think the whole system of taxation as
between municipalities, the provinces and
the dominion Government ought to get an
overhauling. I admit it would be a difficult
job. Years ago municipalities did not assess
properties up to their value; that is very
well known. I can remember when in my
home city of Kitchener the assessment was
about 40 per cent of actual value. We had
a municipal income tax at that time. If a
property was assessed at 50 per cent of the
value, the tax rate might have been, say,
40 mills. Of course, it would be double that
now. If that property had been assessed at
its proper value of 100 per cent, the tax
rate should have been 20 mills. The income
tax was calculated on the full income; if it
had been on 50 per cent of ýincome the taxpayer would have paid only half of what he
was obliged to pay. That is merely an illustration of anomalies that exist in our taxation
system.
Honourable senators, I favour the intent
of the bill. As I have said, I do not know
all the implications of it, and for that reason
I favour referring the bill to a committee.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, there are two or three features of this
bill that I wish to mention.
In the first place, my motive in asking for
information from the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was simply te
save my generous minded friend the senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) from
being put in the position of approving, or asking the Senate to adopt and support, a blank
cheque for the expenditure of federal funds in
this country. This bill as it stands today, without the information that should be appended
to it, is really nothing more or less than a request to underwrite an unknown amount,

arrived at in a way that is not clear to me,
or, I think, clear to any member in this
chamber. The basis of the assessment that is
arrived at to determine the amount of the
grants that are to be made by the federal
Government should be defined more clearly.
I think it is worth recording that the part
of Section 91 of the British North America
Act referring to appropriation of public
funds provides pretty definitely that federal
properties located in provinces and municipalities should not be taxed at all. The federal
Government cannot collect any revenues
from these sources, and therefore grants have
been devised as a means of getting around
that provision of the Constitution. The policy
of giving grants to the municipalities by the
federal Government has been evolving over
quite a number of years. Two years ago, when
the last edition of the federal grants legislation
came to us, the Minister of Finance made it
quite clear that, from the point of view of
policy, he looked forward to the day when
the federal Government would include in its
grants payment based on 100 per cent of the
assessed value of federal properties located
in any municipality. This has been the expressed and avowed policy of the Government
enjoying the confidence of this country, as
it does-and I need only refer to statements
that have been made many times in this
house by very distinguished members, including the Right Honourable the Leader of the
Opposition of some years ago, that it was
not the place of the Senate to oppose in any
shape or form established policies on the part
of the Government of the day wherever it
reflected the will of the people. For that
reason I am not opposing this bill, but I very
definitely maintain that more information
than has been furnished should be available
to us in connection with the details. We should
have an opportunity in the appropriate committee to ask officials of the Department of
Finance just how they figure out the basis
of assessment in the various municipalities.
I could say a great deal about the place of
the city of Ottawa in this bill, but I hope that
possibly in the future we shall have a better
opportunity of dealing with the subject when
we are considering the Federal District Commission's requirements, which may or may
not come before us this session. A joint
committee of both houses of Parliament spent
six weeks last year inquiring into the relations
between the federal authorities and the city
of Ottawa; and in connection with this bill,
I suggest that a perusal of the evidence, as
well as of the final report of that committeewhich, although laid on the table in both
bouses of Parliament, was not discussed at all
be enlightening to our members
-would
at this time. As a commentary upon the

MARCH 21, 1957
findings of that committee today, one
sees only wholesale repudiation by the present
Mayor of Ottawa of the main priorities that
were recommended in that report. Public
expenditures of moneys connected with this
year's program of development in this city
and district have been recently outlined with
the participation and acquiescence of the Government of Ontario, the City of Ottawa, and
the Federal District Commission as well. I
think these expenditures would bear a good
deal of scrutiny by a committee of this house
when the proper time comes. This situation is
not unrelated to the bill before us, for if I
am any judge of it at all the exemptions in
connection with the assessed value of federal
property in Ottawa result in a pretty unsound basis of assessment.
I hope that the basis of assessment on Government property all over the country is
determined in a more accurate way than it is
in this community.
My honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) referred to the situation as it
exists here in connection with Parliament
Hill property. It would be interesting to
know what has been the measuring rod for
the assessment of Government property in
this community as a whole. If the total
federal grant is $15 million or $17 million,
then at least one-quarter of that, or $3j
million, as I have heard mentioned, should go
to the City of Ottawa. I think the least that
can be expected is that the Department of
Finance, which now has a branch to deal with
this problem, should have some idea of how
the money is to be distributed and spent.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is especially true
in view of what the Prime Minister said in
the other house last year, that the Federal
District Commission is the best customer the
city of Ottawa has. Considering the unique
circumstances of the relationship between the
federal authority and the municipality in
this city, the operation of this legislation is
different from that in other municipalities
throughout the country. I hope that when
the bill goes to committee more light can be
shed on the whole question. What officials
will be called to explain the application of
the bill, will be for the honourable Leader of
the Government to decide, but if we could
have the Minister of Finance or his deputy,
as well as representatives from the municipal
branch of that department, which now has
quite a large staff, I think it would be desirable and helpful.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And let us hear from the
Mayor of Ottawa as well.

Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, while much study may be required
as to the working out of the mechanics of
this bill, as referred to by the honourable
senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), I for one want to go on record as being
strongly in favour of the principle of the bill.
At the same time I should like to echo the
words of the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), who expressed my
sentiments fully.
I do not know whether the municipalities
in the west and in other sections of Canada
are suffering in the way that the municipalities in my province are,Hon. Mr. Reid: We are.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: -but there is evidence
everywhere of the strain being placed on
municipal officials to present a budget which
can be met by the income of the taxpayers
in the various municipalities. It is a most
pressing and urgent problem.
The burden of taxation rests, as has been
said this afternoon, upon real estate; and
the important item of cost which causes the
taxes to soar every year is for schools.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask my honourable friend if he thinks the matter of land
taxation is a problem of the federal
Government?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes, I do.
This legislation provides one way by which
the federal government can channel back
to the people some of the money taken
through income tax, for which they normally
get no advantage at all. If the federal
Government can use this method to channel
some money back to them, all to the good.
As has been pointed out this afternoon,
there are in our municipalities some residents who do not own a dollar's worth of real
estate and make no contribution to the municipal budget for schools, but who pay a large
sum to the federal Government by way of
income tax. The situation is altogther out
of joint. If there is any way of making an
overall study of taxation in Canada at the
different levels, I am all in favour of it. It
is a difficult task, I know, but it is something which sooner or later has to be undertaken. I again echo what my friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) said this afternoon.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
if the honourable Leader of the Government
speaks now, he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -we have had a ful
and interesting debate on this important bill.
As honourable senators will have observed,

SENATE
when I explained the bill I did not go over
it clause by clause. When I commenced the
preparation of my speech this afternoon, I
endeavoured to inform myself so as to be
able to deal with the bill clause by clause;
but I soon realized that such procedure was
not advisable with a measure of this kind, but
that it would be better to explain the bill in
principle and then to refer it to a committee
where honourable senators could ask questions directly of the officials. In doing so I
was following the prescribed custom of explaining a bill only as to principle on second
reading and taking it up clause by clause
later.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) raised the question
of how the assessment was arrived at, and
suggested it should be made by officials of
the federal Government. That suggestion was
questioned by the senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler). I may say it is not the
intention of the department to have its own
assessors go about the country. I would refer
honourable senators to clause 3 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It provides for a checking of
the assessment.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It gives the basis of
the calculation of the grant.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But that calculation is not
necessarily acceptable.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It may not necessarily
be acceptable. May I read subsection 3 of the
new section 5:

lands on which grants were made in lieu of
taxes were examined by a representative
from the department. But honourable senators
will recall that at that time a very limited
number of municipalities were affected by
the act. Under the present legislation the
assessments will be reviewed, particularly in
the light of section 3 of the bill which carries
the marginal note "Calculation of grant".
I thank honourable senators for the interest
they have taken in this bill and for their
free expression of opinion. When the bill
receives second reading, I shall move that it
be referred to the Banking and Commerce
Committee, and I shall immediately get in
touch with the Department of Finance and
suggest that the appropriate officials of that
department appear before the committee. It
is my hope that the committee would be able
to meet on Tuesday morning next.

(3) The minister may, in determining the amount
of any grant to a municipality under this section,
deduct from the amount that might otherwise be
payable
(a) an amount that, in the opinion of the minister, represents
() the value of a service that is customarily
furnished by the municipality to real property in
the municipality and that Her Majesty does not
accept in respect of federal property in the
municipality . . .

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Property owned by
Crown companies is not covered by this bill.

As I understand it, that clause would have
application to the city of Ottawa, where a
grant is made by the Federal District Commission and certain lands get the benefit of
that grant; and when the value of that land
is fixed for payment of grants in lieu of taxes
the amount of the payment by the Federal
District Commission to the city would be
taken into consideration. I trust I do not make
it seem too complicated.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government whether it is not
so that in 1950 a board composed of three men
was set up to deal with the various municipalities in Canada which apply for grants?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I believe there was
some such arrangement. I do not know that a
board was in fact set up, but I understand the

Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable
Leader of the Government reply to a question
raised by one of the previous speakers with
respect to Crown properties? I am under the
impression that some provision was made
with respect to the fact that certain Crown
properties should bear a share of the tax.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not understand
to what my friend refers. All property owned
by the Government is Crown property.
Hon. Mr. .Isnor: I have reference to
property occupied by Crown companies.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Not covered at all?
Hon. M. Macdonald: No. The Crown companies now pay their taxes and make their
arangements direct with the municipalities.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
PRIVATE BILL
PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE COMPANY OF
CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill F-11, an Act respecting
Progressive Insurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I shall not
detain the house for more than a few minutes.
I would not have brought the bill before the
house today, but that it is a private bill and
seven days must elapse before it can go to

MAROR 21. 1957
committee; so that, with the end of the session, seemingly, in sight, it is desirable to
make progress as soon as possible.
The Progressive Insurance Company of
Canada was incorporated in 1947, and the act
of incorporation appears as Chapter 85 of the
statutes of that year.
It is proposed by this bill that the name of
the company be changed to "London and
Midland General Insurance Company" and
that the capital be increased from $1 million
to $2,500,000.
The company has effected practically ail
kinds of insurance except life insurance. It
has been underwriting such limes as fire, automobile, accident, inland marine, guarantee,
thef t, personal property and real property
insurance. It is a tariff company.
The effective ownership of the company has
been in Industrial Acceptance Corporation,
but recently a contract was made whereby
that control passed to a number of individuals
who live in and intend to conduct the company's business in the southwestern part of
Ontario.
It is proposed that the head office of the
company be removed from the city of
Montreal to the city o! London, Ontario. It
is also proposed that, immed.iately after the
authorization sought by this bill has been
given by Parliament, if it is given, a very
substantial amount o! capital shall be subscribed ini addition to the capital already
subscribed.
The company has been carrying on business in ail parts of Canada. That project

82719-27

will stili continue, although I arn informed
it is intended to do more business in the
London area and in that part of Ontario
where the head office will be located.
If the bill is given second reading, I shail
propose that it be referred to the Committee
on Miscellaneous Private Bils, before whom
representatives of the company can corne
and answer whatever questions may be
asked.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REPERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Honourable senators,
I was mistaken. As this is an insurance company bill, and as it is customary to refer
such bills to the Comnmittee on Banking and
Commerce, I move that it go to that
committee.
The motion was agreed to.

On February 27 the respondent acknowledged the
letter of February 18, stating she wished to contest
the matter, and requesting funds for her defence.
On February 27 an order was issued by the
Chairman, requiring the petitioner to pay to the
respondent one hundred dollars. The Ottawa agent
for the petitioner, the solicitor for the petitioner,
and the respondent were so advised, and proof of

payment of the money to the respondent personally
on March 9 was subsequently filed with the Committees Branch.
On March 14 the respondent was advised by telegram that the case would proceed if she did not

As of this date, no acknowledgment of the telegram or further indication of intention to oppose

Accordingly, I am now asking that the

will in due course ask for the consideration

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2
SECOND READIN~G
Hon, W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bll 280, an Act for granting
ta Her Mai esty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending the
3lst March, 1957.
He said: Honourable senators, the estimates
which are bef are us toniglit are the final
supplementary estimates for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1957. Honourable senatars
will recail ihat this is the third suppiementary
estimate which we have received; in fact, it
is the fourth, because at the time the main
estimates for this fiscal year were passed a
supplementary estimate was approved also.
Appropriation Bill No. 6, which we passed
on August 14, 1956, cantained those main
estimates, with certain supplementaries. During the short session in November hast a
supplementary estimate of approximately $1
million-in fact, one million and one dollarsfor Hungarian relief, was passed. A further
appropriation bill was passed on February 6
this year, during the present session, lu the
amount of $23,270,000.
The supplementary estimates covered by
the present bil amount ta, $89,825,249. The
total of the main estimates already passed
was $5,040,843,969, with supplementaries at
that time in the amount of $146,025,513. The
total for the present fiscal year, including the
amount in the bill before us this evening, is
$5,300,964,732. It includes an accumulation of
ail the statutory items, amounting ta
$1,869,978,290. Subtracting the statutory items
from the total I have just mentioned, the
sums appropriated aggregate $3,430,986,442.

SENATE
As I have said, these are the last supplementary estimates for this fiscal year. It is
customary to give consideration to this bill
when the main estimates for the ensuing
fiscal year are being tabled. However, the
main estimates have already been tabled, and
therefore I would ask honourable senators
for their favourable consideration of this
bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I can say quite honestly that I never consider it really worth while to say much on
Nevertheless, I have
the budget debate.
never agreed that putting in supplementary
estimates from time to time is a very good
idea. It is really a bad idea, because it does
not give us a true picture of Canada's financial situation. In former years our Standing
Committee on Finance has studied Government expenditures, but it was agreed by the
members of the committee that it should not
try to do so at this short session. I have no
criticism to make of that decision. The fact
is, however, that as a deliberating body the
Senate is really not making any check on the
estimates at all this year. By giving proper
consideration to the Supply Bill, this house
could make a real contribution to the business
of this country. I am not suggesting we
should indulge in any criticism of Government policies, but we should at least find
out for ourselves what the estimates cover.
For instance, I may be wrong but I do not
believe there are many in this chamber who
know what portion of the estimates is earmarked for defence purposes.
The honourable senator from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill) pointed
out the other day that Canada is going to
have to face up to a reconsideration of the
basis upon which taxes are collected at all
levels throughout the country. At the present time tax revenue is collected at the municipal, provincial and federal levels. I am
not going to discuss what is collected by each,
for that would not get us very far on a bil
of this kind.
As the honourable senator said so well, our
educational costs, both from the standpoint
of buildings and instructional staffs, have increased so much in the last ten years that
the burden of meeting these costs is now too
great for our municipalities. Some solution
of the problem must be found. I do not think
anybody in this country-and I say this
without conceit-is better qualified to solve
this problem than the Senate of Canada.
Most of us have been members of school
boards, municipal councils, provincial legislatures or the House of Commons. I feel
sorry for those who have not served in any
of. these capacities for I think their education

has been neglected to that extent. At any
rate, I am sure we all realize that governments at the municipal, provincial and federal
levels are facing a real problem with regard
to taxation.
There has been a lot of talk about inflation
and the threat of inflation. I admit that inflation constitutes a real problem, but I am
not going to discuss this matter here tonight.
I have my own ideas about inflation.
My honourable friend from Northumberland-Miramichi, in one of the ablest speeches
he ever delivered in this house, said that
through public schools, high schools and universities we must give the youth of this
country the best possible education. This is
the only way they can become properly qualified to take their part in world affairs, which
are becoming more and more difficult all the
time. Education is growing in importance all
over the world. Just look at the Russian picture. The number of boys and girls in Russia
who can read and write must be a million
times greater than it was 30 years ago. That
is no exaggeration. Not many years ago
thousands upon thousands of grown men and
women in Russia could neither read nor write.
We have to keep up with the new standard.
More than that, we must assure our children
of the pleasure that education can bring them
during their lifetime. I am sure I express
the feelings of every parent in this chamber
when I say that one of the proudest moments
a parent has is when he or she can say, "Well,
I have given my children the best education
I could afford to give them." It is not just a
matter of equipping them to become financially successful in life, but of enabling them
to enjoy pleasures that can only be derived
through education.
Quite a number of senators are educationalists, among whom are the junior senator
fron Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall), the senator
from Banff, (Hon. Mr. Cameron), the senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)-who is
a member of the Board of Regents and one of
the Governors of McGill University-and
many other senators also have a keen interest
in education. I am one of these, for I have
children and grandchildren, and also am
active in university work in my province of
Manitoba.
Honourable senators, Government spending
this year will total some $5 billion. That is
a tremendous amount of money to be spent
by a population of 16 million. It may be
justifiable, and I will not go into it. However,
when Parliament meets next fall, perhaps in
October, we should appoint a committee of
15 to 20 members to undertake a non-political
study in an attempt to arrive at an equitable
basis of levying taxes at municipal, provincial and federal levels. If we tried to do this

MARCH 25, 1957
during a pre-election session we would be
accused, no matter how fairly we endeavoured
to deal with the matter, of making political
powder for one party or another. After the
election, however, we should undertake such
a study. I take this opportunity to suggest
that at the beginning of the next session a
finance committee should be set up, and extended widely.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
discuss the estimates. I merely wanted to
raise that one question, and I hope that
when we return here, probably next October,
other members will join with me in setting
up a committee to study all phases of taxation. Honourable members are well aware
of the good work that has been done in
the past by special committees appointed to
inquire into specific matters. One of the
most important of these was the special committee on income tax.
The Prime Minister recommended that the
Senate set up at this session a committee
on land use, and that has been done. I make
a similar recommendation in regard to education. We could undertake a study of the
problem without the introduction of politics.
I believe we could make a real contribution
to the educational life of our country by
setting up such a committee.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
think we can probably all agree with the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) when he says that the Senate
should have a greater opportunity of discussing estimates and supply bills in this
house. On the other hand, do we not already
have that opportunity in our Standing Committee on Finance? Is there anything to
prevent us from referring the estimates to
that committee when they are tabled in this
house?
As regards this particular supply bill, I
find it was laid on the table by the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) on March 12. Therefore, since
that date, the Leader of the Opposition, or
any honourable member of the Senate, could
have moved that the estimates so tabled be
referred to our Standing Committee on
Finance.
I suggest that at the beginning of next
session when the estimates, the Auditor
General's report, or the public accounts are
filed, they should be referred to the Standing
Committee on Finance so that an opportunity
will be provided to study them with the
greatest care. The machinery is there for
that purpose; let us make use of it.
Honourable senators are aware that in
financial matters members of the Senate have
the same powers as the members of the
House of Commons. Many people seem to

think that the Senate has no interest or
power to deal with estimates, the budget or
supply bills. Section 18 of the British North
America Act gives the Senate exactly the
same powers that it gives to the House of
Commons in that regard, with this provision,
however, that a money bill must first be
introduced in the House of Commons by a
minister of the Crown, on the recommendation of the Governor General. Once a money
or supply bill has been introduced, and later
reaches the Senate, we have the same powers
to deal with it as have the members of
the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable
member a question? So far as the British
North America Act is concerned, could this
bouse add to or take away a single penny
from a money bill like the one which is
now before this house? For instance, take
a bill for the sum of $1,000,001. Is it not
true that this house has no power to reduce
that amount by one dollar or to increase
that amount by one dollar?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I have stated that the
powers of the members of the Senate are
exactly the same as the powers of the members of the House of Commons.
With regard to the question now put to
me, I would add that it is not permissible
to increase estimates. Down through the
years Speakers have always held that the
budget and supply bills must be submitted
by a minister of the Crown, and the items
therein cannot be increased except with a
further recommendation of the Governor
General. Such increase must be submitted
to the House of Commons by a minister of the
Crown. This is in accordance with section 53
of the B.N.A. Act. It has been held that if the
Governor General recommends the sum of $1
million, it is not open to any member of the
House of Commons to suggest an increase
of even one dollar. But parliamentary practice and usages are also to the effect that
members of the House of Commons and
members of the Senate can reduce the items
in the supply bills recommended by the
Crown.
Honourable senators, I submit that to accomplish the objective of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition, at the opening of
the next session of Parliament, our Standing
Committee on Finance should be set up and
the Auditor General's report, the public
accounts, and all estimates be referred to
it as soon as tabled.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I am sure we are all grateful to the distinguished member from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien) for his remarks. However, since
I have been a member of this house I have

SENATE
always understood from opinions expressed
on jurisprudence in this house, and frorn my
study of the British North America Act,
that the Senate cannot change a money bill
which comes from the House of Commons
by adding one penny to it or taking one
penny from it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You are wrong.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: That is my understanding
of our position with respect to a money bill
once it has passed the other house. I should
like therefore to ask the honourable senator
for De Lorimier to give us some instances
in which this house has reduced the amount
of a money bill after it has been approved
by the other house.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) raised two points. First, lie
thought it was an opportune time for this
house to have one of its committees study
money bills that come to us for approval.
I may be mistaken, but I believe the only
course open to this house would be to have
a committee study money bills and make
suggestions or recommendations to the House
of Commons based on our findings.
The second question raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition had to do with
education. I would support him wholeheartedly in what lie had to say, if we were
a country like England or France, not divided
by provinces, for then the problem of education would be very much simplified. Under
those circumstances we would be not only
free to, but we would be bound to, offer
money to our local school boards to assist in
meeting the cost at all levels of education.
But we are a confederation, and questions of
property and civil rights have been left to
the jurisdiction of the provinces. As the
honourable Leader of the Opposition was
speaking I asked myself what he had in
mind as to the means by which this house
could study the matter of financing school
boards throughout the country. If lie has
some suggestions to make which would be
acceptable to all the provinces, I would be
glad to hear them. But lie must know, as
we all do, that the province of Quebec in
some respects is not like other provinces.
What I have said does not apply to federal
grants to universities, because I am inclined
to believe that universities do not belong to
any one province, but rather to the whole
country. For instance, the French-speaking
university of Montreal is attended by students
from all the other provinces, irrespective of
their language and religion. The standard
of education in both the University of Montreal and in Laval University is very highly
regarded by students of all provinces, and
they take advantage of their facilities. The

more we learn of the beautiful history of
this country the more we are convinced that
these two great French language universities
are rendering a wonderful service to Canada
at large. Because of this aspect of the question of universities, I am firmly convinced
that the whole country should have the opportunity to take advantage of the high
standards of universities, regardless of where
they are situated. Consequently, I cannot
convince myself that federal grants to universities, wherever they may be located,
should be refused.
I know, Mr. Speaker, I may be out of
order in discussing this question on the money
bill now before us. But we have listened to
some very interesting suggestions by the
honourable Leader of the Opposition, and I
thought this was a good opportunity to ask
him whether at the next session lie could
lay before us ways and means by which it
would be possible for this chamber to do
something for education without infringing on
the provisions of the British North America
Act. If lie could do so, I would pledge my full
support to such a plan.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I cannot make any promise for the
future. However, I have listened with great
interest to the speeches which have just been
made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), one of the deans of
this house, and by my learned colleagues from
the city of Montreal (Hon. Mr. Vien and
Hon. Mr. Dupuis).
This bill would vote a large sum of money
-an amount that is equal to 44,912 times that
spent for stationery for the use of members
of this house. I do not say that any item mentioned in the schedule to this bill is uncalled
for. Each item may be well justified. I have
read the bill and I have read the supplementary estimates.
Now we are facing a most complex situation. I am glad that the honourable Leader
of the Opposition is so much in favour of
higher education because we ourselves need
lots of it to know where we are and where
we stand in the Senate. I was particularly
interested in the views expressed by the
honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien), because he has the prestige of
having occupied the Chair as Speaker of the
Senate not so long ago; and also in what
was said by my honourable friend from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis), who is known as
one of the best lawyers of the metropolis of
Canada. I am not one to say anything that
would be unpleasant to any of my colleagues
of the Senate, but we must know where the
Senate stands in matters as important as
money bills.

MARCH 25, 1957
Now, how is it that all money bills have ta
be initiated in the House of Commons? It
is because, as you all know, payments made
in virtue of a bill like this come from taxation, and the only ones in Parliament who
can initiate a taxation bill are those who are
elected by the people and are responsible
to them. This is the orthodox doctrine
which has been expounded by Blackstone and
by all those who came after him---"no taxation without representation". As we are not
elected by the people of Canada, but have
been appointed by the Crown, we have the
right ta sit here, but we have not the right
ta initiate money bills in the Senate. Approval
of the Governor General in the name of
Her Majesty was, in the first place, a solace,
a kind of solace given ta the Sovereign for
the right that the commoners had taken for
themselves ta oppose taxation. You know
that in the first place the kings imposed
taxation. There was then no representation.
When the commoners told King John that
they had their word ta say, the King, as a
compensation, said, "I give you the power
ta raise taxation, provided that I reserve
for myself the right ta approve the amounts
that you are ta levy by taxation." That is
the history of England, as everyone knows
from elementary school days.
I will not insist upon it, but my conclusion
is that if we cannot levy taxation in this
house we can decrease the amount asked for
by the House of Commons. I do not suggest
that it should be done, but my view is that
we are the guardians of the public exchequer just as much as members of the
House of Commons are, and we have the
right ta say, "This is too much", "This is
unwarranted",
"This
is uncalled for".
Unquestionably, we in the Senate have the
right ta say that, if we are ta be true ta the
trust that has been given us by the Government of Canada.
We are not here ta put obstacles in the way
of the Government; we are here ta protect
the rights of the people of Canada. And I
do not know ta what extent the Senate of
Canada is the last ta refuse freedom of
speech. I will be able ta say that the last
day of this session, but nat before. But
that is as it should be: there is no reason
why the Senate of Canada should nat be an
example of liberty and freedom of speech ta
the whole world; and it is because I have confidence in Your Honour and in my colleagues
that I dare say that in this house tonight.
Now I will draw ta your attention,
honourable senators, a fact that you know
as well as I do, and that is that the schedule is
part of the bill, and that on second reading
there is nothing ta prevent me from speaking

about the schedule as well as the figures that
are contained in the bill itself. I did not make
a speech of an hour and a half about it, but
I just remind you of that.
As there is an item concerning External
Affairs in the bill I must say that as a Canadian citizen, I am very glad that Mr. St.
Laurent, the Prime Minister of Canada, is in
Bermuda today ta discuss international
matters and matters pertaining to the Commonwealth with his colleague of the Commonwealth, the Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom. I had the good fortune ta meet the
Prime Minister on Saturday last and I told
him that I hoped that his trip would be just
as fruitful as was his trip around the world
when he postponed ta much later on the
danger of a third world war. Credit should
be given ta Mr. St. Laurent for facing the
issue and acting as a great diplomat in his
dealings, not only with the Prime Minister of
the United Kingdom, but with the heads of
the states that he met on his trip around the
world. Also, I must pay a special tribute ta
Mr. Pearson for the good work that he has
done, and ta Mr. Paul Martin for the
good work he likewise has done. They are
great Canadians, and they deserve special
acknowledgement.
There is an item in this bill in the name of
the Department of Public Works. I must
express my gratitude to the members of the
Government and in particular ta the Honourable the Minister of Public Works for what
he has done ta improve the condition of the
Senate. It is remarkable. The new senators
do not have any idea of how bad it was when
we came in here last year. The walls were
dirty, the lights were poor. Now the walls are
clean and the lights are better. I thank the
honourable Leader of the Government in this
house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for what he bas
done, and I thank also the Minister of Public
Works: they deserve our appreciation. The
Senate chamber looks much better than it did.
Some honourable senators have complained
that the purchase of a new rug is an extravagance. The present rug has been here
since the construction of this building at the
time of the First World war. There are holes
in it; it is worn out. Is is nat right that when
Her Majesty comes here next fall she shall
be honoured with a new rug, and that none of
ber suite shall be exposed ta the danger of
falling by tripping over a hole in this rug?
I congratulate the honourable Leader of the
Government and all honourable senators who
favoured this purchase. They showed vision;
they knew that the time had come ta make
some improvements in this room, not ta leave
it in its former state of drabness. The Woolsack is no longer used; it bas been consigned
ta the attic. Sa much the better. There is

SENATE
now a good postmark, with bilingual wording;
and wherever our correspondence goes, to all
corners of the world, there may be seen an
attractive picture of the Parliament buildings.
That is progress.
Some may say that all this is not enough.
For my part I do not expect progress in the
Senate at a rate faster than sound. But little
by little we advance. The only direction in
which progress is not evident is with regard
to the rules. In 1951 a resolution to reduce
the membership of committees was approved
by a vote of 35 to 11. I appreciate the fact
that it was moved by the honourable senator
who is now our Speaker. This action marked
one forward step, but at the following session
the committee memberships were restored to
their former figures. That was a step backward; and if you have one year a step forward and the following year a step backward, where are you? You do not move. We
should at least make two steps forward and
only one backward; then we would advance
one step. I say this seriously. I would compare the Senate not to the hare, which runs
too fast and may lose its way, but to the
turtle, which advances slowly but which,
honourable senators, is distinguished by
having a strong back.
My conclusion, which I express in the
friendliest possible manner, is that no one
outside the Senate can reform it. Attempted
reforms by the Government could kill it. The
press may ridicule it. But if the Senate is
to perform the task which was assigned to it
by the Fathers of Confederation, it must take
the responsibility for reforming itself; and I
hope that action in this direction will be
taken by common consent at the beginning
of next session.
In conclusion, may I say that I do not take
any credit for the physical improvements
which have been made to this chamber. I
give full credit to the honourable Leader of
the Government in this house and to all my
colleagues.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: "All my colleagues"
is the way to put it.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: And I am very proud
that our honourable Leader is one of them.
I compliment all his colleagues, that is, all
the members of the Government. I hope this
process will go on, and that the dirty windows will disappear as soon as this house
I trust that these windows,

painted a dirty brown, will be replaced with
clean and clear windows through which the
rays of the sun will penetrate to brighten
our proceedings. As for the pictures, if I
could use the gun depicted in the painting
opposite me to destroy them, it would be no
loss to the Senate nor to the country. I trust

also that the suggestion of the honourable
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) to
instal additional galleries will be adopted,
for, besides improving the acoustics much
more effectively than any other device could
do, they would enhance the appearance of
the chamber, and render it more attractive to
the distinguished visitors of all ages who
come here to listen to us. For, to listen to us,
they must be able to hear us. The provision
of galleries on both sides, or at least a gallery
on one side to begin with, would attract more
people to the chamber; and the more who
are interested in our debates, the better.
So much for the physical amenities. With
regard to spiritual reform, there is a question
mark. One needs to know how much "moral
rearmament" will be required.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, may I have a moment to comment
on the question of the right of the Senate
with regard to money bills? It seems to me,
the question is an important one, and it
would be unfortunate if an erroneous impression were implanted in the minds of our
own members, or got abroad.
I concur wholly in everything that has
been said by my distinguished colleague the
honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien), who stated, out of his long experience, that the Senate cannot increase an
item in accounts such as we have before us,
but it can decrease the amounts. The honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon.
Mr. Pouliot) spoke in much the same vein,
although more generally, and I agree with
what he said in this regard. However, the
honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis) has expressed some doubts, and it
is for that reason that I have risen, not that
I can add very much to what has already
been said, but I should like to give some
information to the honourable senator from
Rigaud and others who are interested in the
matter.
The honourable senator from Rigaud bas
asked whether certain instances could be
stated where the Senate has acted within
its rights to reduce a money bill. The best
answer I can give is to refer the honourable
gentleman to a report of a Special Committee
of the Senate which sat in 1918 to consider
the question of determining what rights the
Senate had in matters of financial legislation.
This committee was under the chairmanship
of the Honourable W. B. Ross, K.C., who, as
many honourable senators will recall, was
a very distinguished lawyer. That committee
made an exhaustive inquiry and presented
a brief report to this house. Added to the
report was an extensive and detailed memorandum concerning the whole question, and

MARCH 25, 1957
attached to the memorandum were the
opinions of lawyers. I am sure the honourable
senator

will

and

Geoffrion, who signed one of the opinions.
The other opinion was signed by a renowned
constitutional

lawyer, Mr. John

S.

Ewart.

Now, the report, the memorandum and the
two opinions all agree substantially with what
the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) has told this house. I should
like to read three short excerpts from this
report, which is dated May 9, 1918. The
first reads:

cases the bills were allowed to pass, the Commons
protesting or claiming that the Senate could not

I would point out that in some cases

Commons, although there were some in

Senate cannot initiate money bills, but if it
is so important to have money appropriated
and available for the payment of these
accounts, why would that paragraph not be
directed to this chamber as well as to the
House of Commons?
Hon. Thomas Vien: In answer to the honourable gentleman I would say that that
phraseology is inaccurate but based on a long
parliamentary usage. It is quite obvious that
money bills are not the sole gift of the House
of Commons. If it were so, we would not be
called upon to vote the budget and supply
bills. Why are we called upon to give our
advice and consent if the subject-matter be
not within our jurisdiction? Could it otherwise
become law? Therefore, I say that that phraseology is improper. It may have been inspired
by the fact that in Canada, since Confederation, money bills must originate in the House
of Commons, because sections 53 and 54 of
the British North America Act so provide;
but once money bills have been introduced,
as was aptly said by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
members of the Senate have the same powers
in dealing with them as are possessed by the
members of the House of Commons.
Section 18 of the B.N.A. Act reads as
f ollows:

no right to interpret as it does by its Standing
Order 63, what are our constitutional powers,
as if the Commons were the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council interpreting the
British North America Act. The Commons
has no right to say that "All aids and supplies
granted to His Majesty by the Parliament
of Canada"-meaning the Senate and the
House of Commons-"are the sole gift of the
House of Commons", as if it were enacting
legislation on the Constitution. This is sheer
impertinence and that rule should be deleted
from the standing orders of the House of
Commons. "All bills for granting such aids
and supplies ought to begin with the House",
not because of Rule 63 hereinabove quoted,
but because it is so stated in section 53 of the
B.N.A. Act. Order 63 ýcontinues:
. . . as it is the undoubted right of the Flouse to
direct, limit and appoint in all such bills, the ends,
purposes, considerations, conditions, limitations and
qualifications of such grants, which are net alterable by the Senate.

That it does not lie within the power of
the House of Commons to say that money
bills are the sole gift of the House of Commons clearly appears from the fact that such
bills cannot become law without the advice
and consent of the Senate. And that it is

The powers of the members of the House
of Commons, once a money bill is introduced,
are exactly the same as those of the members
of the Senate. A money bill is not a grant
or the exclusive gift of the House of Commons. It is a grant made jointly by the
Senate and the House of Commons to the
Crown.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I have no desire to make a second speech,
but may I have the indulgence of the house
to add another instance of the exercise by
this house of its right to amend money bills?
The member for Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) has called my attention to the instance when the Borden Government sent to
this house a supply bill which included an
expenditure of $35 million for the purchase of
two battleships which were to be presented
to the British Government. The portion of
that bill which voted the $35 million was
rejected by this house. I am sure that many
honourable senators who know something of
the history of Canada will remember that
incident.
Hon. Mr. Golding: It is nothing new to
suggest that we can reduce the amount of
money bills.
Hon. Donald Carneron: Honourable senators, I do not rise at this time to continue
this most interesting constitutional discussion, which I have found very enlightening.
May I say at the outset that one of the
documents which I received just after my
appointment to the Senate-I do not recail
whether it was from the honourable Leader
of the Government or from His Honour the
Speaker-was that admirable speech by
Senator Murphy, made I think in 1927, in
which he referred to the rights and privileges
of the Senate. The point which I underlined
in that speech was one to the effect that the
Senate has the right to modify or reject
certain money bills. But I do not propose to
go into that subject at this time. My purpose
in rising is to ask a question which I think
should be directed to the honourable Leader
of the Government. First may I note that
the federal Government has this year been
very generous with respect to matters of
education. For instance, the per capita grants
to universities have been doubled, and the
Canada Council has been established. Now
by vote No. 563, which appears at the bottom
of page 3 of the schedule under Miscellaneous
Grants, this further grant is proposed:
Grant to assist the Stratford Shakespearean
Festival Foundation of Canada in the construction
of a permanent theatre at Stratford, Ontario.

Now, I would be the first to compliment
the Government on this additional generosity,
because I think all Canadians can be proud
82719-281

427

of the accomplishment of this organization
within a very short time. The question that
comes to my mind is whether this is to be an
isolated gift to a very worthy cause or the
beginning of a new policy on the part of the
Government under which other equally deserving and promising national educational
institutions may be entitled to some assistance. I have reference to the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, and perhaps the National Ballet,
and I even have the temerity to mention the
Banff School of Fine Arts.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: My question is one
which I should like to have answered at
some future time, because I think it important to know whether the federal Government
is establishing a new policy under which it
will make capital grants to national organizations of this kind.
Hon. W.
senators,-

Ross

Macdonald:

Honourable

The Hon. the
Speaker:
Honourable
senators, if the honourable Leader of the
Government speaks at this time, he will close
the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -we have listened
to a very interesting and enlightening discussion on the subject of whether or not
the Senate can initiate money bills, or increase or reduce them when they come before
this house. There seems to be general agreement on the proposition that money bills
cannot be introduced in the Senate. There
is, however, some difference of opinion as to
whether the amounts which these bills would
vote can be reduced.
Hon. Mr. Golding: They can be reduced by
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At least one honourable senator has suggested they cannot be
reduced. As I have said, I think most
honourable senators agree that they cannot
be increased in this house.
With respect to the reducing of the amounts
of money bills by the Senate, I believe it was
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) who referred to a report
made by a group of eminent counsel including Mr. Geoffrion, Mr. Lafleur and others.
He also mentioned the opinion given to this
house by another eminent counsel, John
Ewart. I do not have a record before me
of either of these opinions, but I should
think that before the matter comes up again
we should all take advantage of the interval
to read the opinion expressed by Mr. Ewart.
This is a very interesting subject, and I am
pleased that it was raised here tonight.

SENATE
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity referred to a bill which was passed
some years ago by the House of Commons
under which a certain sum of money was
voted for the purchase of two battleships.
That bill was rejected by the Senate, but
I do not know what happened to it when it
went back to the other house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It was killed.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: They got their battleships
anyway.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators
whose memories are longer than mine will
recall the instance, and the rest of us can
look at the record to see what happened to
the bill. But there must be an opinion to
the contrary that bills can be reduced in
amount in this house, because I note by
Beauchesne's ParhamentaryRules and Forms,
Third Edition, at page 328 there appears form
No. 59 with the heading "For Agreeing to
Senate Amendments to Money Bills", and
reads as follows:
(The amendments having been concurred in):
That the Clerk do carry back the Bill to the
Senate and acquaint Their Honours that this House
hath agreed to their amendments, the Minister of
Finance accepting the said amendments with a
protest against the right of the Senate to make
amendments to money bills.

Apparently this proposition that the Senate
can reduce money bills is not entirely
accepted by the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: May I ask the honourable leader whether it is not a fact that
when an estimate of expenditures is before
the House of Commons the proposed estimate cannot be increased on a motion of
a private member of that house?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is in accordance
with some statements made here tonight, that
a bill appropriating any public funds must
be initiated in the House of Commons after
first obtaining the approval of the Governor
General to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: And such a bill must
be initiated by a member of the Government,
not by a private member.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. It is questionable whether a private member could get
the consent of the Governor General with
respect to a money bill and come to the
house with that consent. It would be most
interesting to see what would happen in those
circumstances, but such an instance has never
occurred. The amount appropriated by a
money bill cannot be increased, because the
resolution which precedes a so-called money
bill sets forth the amount that is required.

Therefore, before the amount could be increased the Governor General would have to
signify approval. For that reason the amount
of a money bill cannot be increased in the
House of Commons any more than in the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Will my honourable friend
permit me? If my memory serves me rightly,
the Senate defeated a bill for a gift of $35 million from Canada to the United Kingdom to
buy cruisers or battleships, and the thing
went no further.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I believe that is the bill to which the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) referred to a few minutes ago,
and I think he said the honourable senator
from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) brought
the bill to his attention. I should say that
my deskmate brought to my attention the
form from Beauchesne's Third Edition to
which I have referred.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable
Leader this question: When you refer to the
Governor General you mean the cabinet, do
you not?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, I am referring
directly to the Governor General. When a
money bill is introduced in the House of
Commons a member of the Government
stands in his place and says the Governor
General has signified his approval of the
introduction of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is that not just merely
a matter of form?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, that is the
procedure in any event. I do not suppose
the Governor General would refuse the
request of the Government for his approval
of an expenditure.
Hon. Mr. Aselitne: Can the honourable
Leader give us any instance where approval
has been refused by the Governor General?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would not know,
because if the approval is refused the
minister cannot come to the house and say
be has the approval of the Governor General.
Hon. Mr. Davies: But does the Governor
General not represent Her Majesty, and is
not Her Majesty advised by ber ministers?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right. That
is why I say I think the Governor General
would accept the advice of the cabinet that
certain money was required.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable
leader allow me to ask him a question? Is he
not of the opinion that it is not a matter of

MARCH 25, 1957
form but a matter of a distinct stipulation of
the British North America Act?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is no doubt
of that. It is a distinct stipulation of the
British North America Act, and prior to 1926
I do not know what attitude a Governor
General might have taken. Honourable gentlemen recall that in 1926 the Governor General
of that day, in connection with another matter, did not accept the advice of the then
Government.
Honourable senators are aware that I have
never endeavoured to introduce into this
house a bill which would appropriate a portion of the public funds. For that reason I
have been limited in the number of bills
which I could introduce here. Sometimes
the Government is criticized for not having
more bills introduced in the Senate. Well,
there is a distinct limitation in the British
North America Act, and we cannot get around
that: money bills must be introduced in the
Commons and then come here. But I suggest to honourable senators that if they look
over the records for this session-which I
have not done yet-they will find that the
number of bills introduced in the Senate
compares very favourably with the number
introduced in the Commons.
A suggestion was made for the setting up
of a committee to study the whole problem
of education on the public school, high school,
and university level. However, one honourable
senator suggested that might be a subject
which certain provinces would feel is not
within our domain. I think it is something for
us to think about before introducing a motion
to appoint such a committee. We are all
interested in education, but it seems to me
we must remember that under the British
North America Act education is a subject
within the jurisdiction of the provinces. I do
not think we should enter into a consideration
of that subject generally without first giving
the matter our very serious consideration.
Honourable senators, another suggestion was
that the estimates and the Auditor General's
report should be referred to the Finance
Committee. That committee, for some years
under the chairmanship of the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and during the last two years under the
chairmanship of the honourable senator from
Miltford-Hants (Hon. Mr. Hawkins) has done
exceptionally fine work. It decided that there
would not be time this session for a thorough
examination of the estimates, and so it held
no sittings. I am sure, however, that it will
be glad to consider the estimates when tabled
in future sessions.
With regard to the tabling of documents, an
honourable senator said to me that the supplementary estimates had not been tabled

this session. I am glad the honourable senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) mentioned
that they were tabled on March 12. If honourable senators at any time think that documents which should be tabled have not been
tabled, I hope they will not fail to bring the
matter to my attention.
The honourable senator from Banff (Hon.
Mr. Cameron) referred to the grant to the
Shakespearean Festival at Stratford, and asked
whether the Government in future would
make contributions to similarly worthy organizations.
Hon. Mr. Cameron:
I was only raising
the principle of making special grants to
special institutions.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I may say that in
this instance the payment was made before
the Canada Council was established.
The
Government of the Province of Ontario gave
$100,000, and the city of Stratford gave $30,000. The federal Government felt that it
should make a contribution to this great
national festival. I suppose the Government
could have waited until the Canada Council
was established, but there was considerable
urgency, because the work has to be proceeded with if the new theatre is to be used
this summer. For that reason a contribution
was made from the public funds. We have
greAt hopes thatmany organizations and individuals will make contributions to the work
of the Council, and that from the money
which the Council receives, not only from the
Government, but from wealthy individuals,
corporations, and so forth, the necessary
grants can be made.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:

Next sitting.

MERCHANT SEAMEN COMPENSATION
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Kinley moved the second reading of Bill 178, an Act to amend the Merchant
Seamen Compensation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the act which
this bill would amend was originally Chapter
58 of the Statutes of 1946, and upon the
revision of the Statutes in 1952 it became
Chapter 178.
This bill comes to us from the House of
Commons, where it was introduced by the
Minister of Labour. After second reading
it was referred to the Standing Committee
on Industrial Relations and reported back to
the house with one slight amendment, and
the amended bill was then given third reading and passed.
This bill is designed to bring the benefits
payable to disabled seamen or the dependants of the seamen up to and in line with
the more liberal benefits provided under the
various provincial laws in the matter. I am
informed that the federal act has not been
amended in this respect for some years,
whereas the provincial acts have been
amended from time to time. Thus it is that
the benefits provided under the federal act

have not kept pace with the compensation
provided in the provincial acts. I would say
that since 1953 most of the provincial compensation acts have been amended and the
rates of compensation and benefits increased.
The idea behind this legislation is that
men who work upon the sea are entitled to
the same protection as those who work
ashore. The bill would revise the rates of
compensation paid to men who work upon
the sea, and who, in virtue of their occupation, are not covered by any other statute.
Their work is arduous, and requires them to
be away from their families a great deal of
the time. While their working day is eight
hours, the statutory working day in Canada,
they must be on hand and available during
all hours of the day and night in case of
call at sea.
Honourable senators, in computing average
wages for the purpose of arriving at compensation, this bill proposes to raise the ceiling on wages from $3,600 to $4,506 per year.
In two of the provinces the ceiling is set at
$5,000 a year, but it is lower in other provinces. The cealing of $4,500 on earnings may
be high for ordinary seamen, but it should
be made a little higher to cover those on oil
tankers. I might point out that seamen on
dry cargo ships do not receive wages as high
as are paid on tankers. The conditions on a
dry cargo ship are such that you would not
expect the wages would be equal to those
paid on a tanker. I should mention also that
the ceiling of $4,500 is designed to cover
officers as well as seamen.
The rates for benefits in the bill before us
are set out in sections 1, 2, 3 and 4. The bill
proposes:
(1) to raise the percentage of average earnings
used in computing compensation from
66§ to 75 per cent;
(2) to raise the maximum annual earnings
which may be taken into account from
$3,600 to $4,500;
(3) to raise the monthly payments to the
widow of a deceased seaman from $50 to
$75;
(4) to raise the payment to a dependent child
living with a widow from $15 to $25
a month;
(5) to continue the payments to an invalid
child until the child ceases to be an
invalid. At present the board continues
payment so long as it decides that the
deceased seaman, had he lived, would
have continued to contribute to the child's
support.
(6) to raise the payments per month to an
orphan child from $25 to $35;
(7) to increase from $100 to $200 the immediate lump sum payment to a widow.

SENATE
The provisions of the bill will apply to
between 3,500 and 4,000 seamen. It will, so
to speak, take up the slack in respect of
what is not now covered by legislation. At
present the provincial compensation boards
deal to a large extent with those activities
associated with seafaring, and they administer
the provisions of the Government Employees
aids
The medical
Act.
Compensation
provided under section 5 of the Canada
Shipping Act do not conflict with the provisions of this bill, since, where those provisions
apply this bill will not be applicable. Home
trade and foreign voyages are covered by
scheme; inland and
this compensation
minor water voyages are covered by the
provincial workmen's compensation acts.
As defined in the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act,
(i) "seaman" means every person, except pilots,
apprenticed pilots and fishermen, employed or
engaged on
(i) a ship registered in Canada; or
(ii) a ship chartered by demise to a person
resident in Canada or having his principal place
of business in Canada, when such ship is engaged
in trading on a foreign voyage or on a home trade
voyage as these voyages are defined in the Canada
Shipping Act, 1934; and, if so ordered by the
Governor in Council, includes a seaman engaged in
Canada and employed on a ship that is registered
outside of Canada and operated by a person resident in Canada or having his principal place of
business in Canada when such ship is so engaged.

The direct responsibility under the bill is
upon the employer. He must see to it that
he insures his employees who are seamen,
under the provisions and to the full requirements of the law, by insurance or otherwise.
The Merchant Seamen Compensation Act
is administered by a board of three civil
servants. Mr. A. H. Brown, Deputy Minister
of Labour, is the chairman, and the other

commissioners are Mr. B. J. Roberts, Chairman of the National Harbours Board, and
Captain G. L. C. Johnson, of the Department of Transport. Mr. George G. Greene,
the secretary, carries on the routine administration, the cost of which seems to me quite
low. Last year it amounted to only $2,870,
including $110 for stationery and other office
supplies. In the years 1945, 1946 and 1947
the administration cost in connection with
each case amounted to $52.24. By 1955 and
1956 this cost had been reduced to $29.44. I
think it is worth while to note this reduction,
for it is not the usual trend in administering
any business today. There are 63 shipping
companies paying a monthly service charge
of $25.
The board's power of decision is final, but
on application it can review a decision,
and I am told it is always willing to do so.
Like similar acts, the Merchant Seamen
Compensation Act takes away the common

law rights of an employee so that he cannot
sue his employer under the act. If a dispute
arises between an employee and his employer
the matter must be settled by the Board.
However, an employee is entitled to sue a
third party for damages.
Honourable senators will recall the disaster that occurred at sea not long ago when
an Italian ship and a Swedish ship collided
off the American coast. On that occasion the
Swedish and Italian shipping companies
showed good sense in settling the matter out
of court.
The original Merchant Seamen Compensation Act was assented to on August 31, 1946.
Prior to that date claims arising from accidents happening to merchant seamen were
dealt with under the provisions of the Merchant Seamen Compensation Regulations,
1945, made under the War Measures Act.
That is when compensation for seamen was
introduced into our economy. During the
war merchant seamen had a most hazardous
occupation. There were many casualties
among them, and there was a great need for
compensation benefits for their families.
Shipwrecked merchant seamen whose ships
had been sunk by submarines would be
brought into Halifax or some other port.
These seamen had perhaps the most dangerous job of the war. Now we are amending this act to bring it into line with provincial and other legislation so as to give
merchant seamen the same treatment that
employees in other industries are entitled to
receive by way of compensation.
When workmen's compensation benefits
were extended to merchant seamen by statute
the lights of the Canadian merchant marine
shone on almost every ocean in the world and
its ships were to be found wherever there was
trade. While today these lights are but a
flicker compared with what they once were,
the merchant seamen look to better days and
are grateful that these benefits, which mark
progress, are being preserved for them.
Honourable senators, I am sure that this
sound legislation will prove beneficial both
to the merchant seamen and to the Canadian
public.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I would like to ask the
honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Kinley) why it is necessary to
have this act administered by a special board
rather than by the Workmen's Compensation Board.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Usually provincial boards
do not extend their activities to include compensation on the high seas, and therefore
this is considered a subject of federal
Government control. The courts have decided that provincial legislation to insure
seamen who are residents of the province

MARCH 26, 1957
is valid. British Columbia exercises that
authority, but other provinces do not. The
purpose of this bill is to enable the merchant
seaman to recover compensation for accidents
occurring at any time anywhere upon the
ocean, and it is because he is beyond the
territory of the country that the federal
Government has the best means of control.
This legislation applies to seamen employed
in home trade and on foreign voyages.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Next sitting.

did not oppose the petition, and in the report
now before the house the committee recommends that the bill be reinstated on the Orders

PRIVATE BILL
BAPTIST CONVENTION OF ONTARIO
QUEBEC-SECOND READING

AND

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second reading of Bill Q-12, an Act respecting
the Baptist Convention of Ontario and
Quebec.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple bill, and a very delightful one
to sponsor. I fancy I need say very little
by way of explanation.
The Baptist Convention of Ontario and
Quebec was incorporated in 1889 and has
been carrying on the great work of that
church in both provinces ever since. It is
unnecessary for me to state how great that
work has been. I will simply quote from a
letter I received from Mr. M. Cleeve Hooper,
Q.C., the solicitor for the church, in which
he says:
The convention came into being by the statute
of 1889, which we now propose to amend, and has
operated continuously during the subsequent years.
There are nearly five hundred Churches and Missions associated with the Baptist Convention of
Ontario and Quebec throughout the two provinces,
and they represent an adult membership of more
than 52,000 people.

Mr. Hooper names some prominent people
who belong to the church, whom of course
I will not name. Indeed, I see in our midst
some prominent persons whom I know to
be members of that church.
The bill proposes to amend the constitution
of the convention in two small and inconsequential details. First, it would change the
name "The Church Edifice Board of the
Baptist Convention" to "The Church Extension Board of the Baptist Convention".
The new name is thought to better describe
the work being carried on by the board.
Secondly, the bill would give this board
certain additional powers. In more recent
times the board has been actively engaged

SENATE

in the obtaining of sites and the building
of church edifices. Therefore, the bill authorizes the Convention to appoint:
A board for assisting Regular Baptist churches, by
loan or gift, in the acquisition, erection and maintenance of church edifices, and the acquiring of
lands as sites therefor, to be called "The Church
Extension Board of the Baptist Convention". The
board, when it deems it expedient, may itself
acquire and hold the land, and erect and maintain
the buildings.
The objects of the board shall
include the promotion and establishment of new
Regular Baptist churches within the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec. The board may do all such
lawful acts and things as are incidental or may be
conducive to the attainment of its objects, and in
particular may, when it deems it expedient, in
relation either to new or existing churches, manage
and control all matters relating to the real property
required therefor, the construction, equipment and
maintenance of buildings for the use of such
churches, and the financing, in whole or in part,
of any such projects.

I am sure all honourable senators will be
pleased to facilitate this board in its good
work.
I may say that the situation is complicated,
because the act of incorporation has been
amended once or twice. If the house sees
fit to give the bill the second reading, I will
move that it be referred to the Committee
on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
with reference to the consideration of this
bill in committee may I refer to Senate
Rule 119, which reads:
No committee on any private bill originating in
the Senate (of which notice is required to be
given), is to consider the same until after one
week's notice of the sitting of such committee bas
been posted up in the lobby . . .

One can imagine what might happen if
we waited a week before this bill were considered in committee-it might well not be
considered this session. Therefore, I intend
to move, with leave of the Senate, that
Rule 119 be suspended in so far as it relates
to this Bill.
I have an explanatory note: The purpose
of this motion is to dispense with the one
week's delay imposed by Rule 119 between
the second reading of the bill and the consideration thereof by the committee to which
it is referred.

Perhaps to keep the procedure more
orderly, I should first move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills. I so move.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, on
a point of order, may I suggest that as this
bill has to do with financial matters-the
making of loans and the buying of propertyit might be advantageous to refer it to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, which meets almost daily.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It is meeting tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would be in favour of
having this bill dealt with tomorrow by the
Banking and Commerce Committee. If it
is postponed for one week it may have to
wait over until after the election.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In the circumstances,
if the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) concurs in that
suggestion, I shall move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I point out that it has not been customary for the Leader of the Government in the
Senate to make any suggestion with respect
to private bills. Personally, I have no objection to reference of this bill to the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
I should like to add that I am not of the
opinion that if this bill were not considered
in Committee until next week it would go
over until after the election. I am not that
optimistic.

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, for once I approve of the remarks
made by my honourable colleague (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot). In this atomic age, speed is the
order of the day.
I am happy to see that our distinguished
colleague seems to have changed his mind,
since he now approves the steps we have
taken.
Several weeks ago, our friend took issue
with the Government in the matter of granting money to the Canada Council for distribution to universities in order that they
may help talented students who cannot afford
to go to the university. As we have already
been told, Canadian universities receive gifts
from private sources and from foundations.
Will some bureaucrat object to the acceptance of the full amount of these grants?
I do not know but I hope everything will
work out all right.
Over the week-end I learned that the National Research Council distributes several
thousand dollars to universities to promote
certain scientific studies and research.
I am told that, even at Laval University,
it would be impossible, without these grants,
to do such research work.
I agree with my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Pouliot). The C.B.C. might very well,
instead of the ineptitudes which have been
served us, broadcast educational programs
that would be both interesting and instructive. But such a step would have to be
supported by all the social and educational
associations interested in the cultural development of our country. What is good in principle should be accepted, whatever its source.
If this proposal can promote scientific
methods and ensure better understanding
among Canadians, I believe it should be
given unqualified approval.
For some years, the C.B.C. has been broadcasting an educational program called "RadioCollège" which I find excellent. Unfortunately I am not always free to follow it.
University professors take part in this program and are paid by the C.B.C., which
has to come to Parliament for the necessary
funds. I repeat that our honourable friend
had mended his ways, for deeds speak louder
than words.
I am happy to see that our colleague
accepts the principle of good will and wants
to see to it that Canada as a whole benefits
from the educational features which this
motion would promote.
(Text):
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I am not rising to oppose the spirit

of the motion, but I wonder if the resolution
should be passed in its present form. It reads:
That, in the opinion of this house, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation should each week grant
a thirty minute free time for TV broadcasting to
the Canadian universities.

I think all honourable members are in
accord with the desire that the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation should, throughout the year, give as much free time as possible to discussion of the work of the Canadian universities. Would it not be better,
however, if instead of our passing the resolution I brought it to the attention of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and
stated that the Senate is in accord with the
suggestion that as much free time as possible be given to the Canadian universities?
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, I am not sure that I am in accord with
the suggestion. I think we should realize
that this is a very difficult matter. It is all
very well to say that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation shall give free time to
the universities, but in order to do so the
corporation would have to secure the free
time from all the commercial stations across
the country; and that is not as easy as it
seems, for when the C.B.C. broadcasts a
nationwide program a great deal of it is
channelled over private stations. At the
present time all the television and radio
stations are giving a good deal of free time
to this, that and the other subject. I do
not know that the Senate should try to put
pressure on the C.B.C. in this matter, for
that would be tantamount to asking all the
commercial stations to give the free time.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, I
suggest that it might be advisable to keep
this resolution in suspense until we and the
country as a whole have an opportunity to
study the recommendations of a certain
report being tabled in Parliament today,
and which I think might have a bearing on
the whole question.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I am
in favour of the resolution, but I am somewhat at a disadvantage, which is entirely my
own fault, in not having quite understood
everything that was discussed this afternoon. I should like to have an opportunity of
looking at and adding to the record, and
therefore I now move the adjournment of
the debate until, say, Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Did the honourable
gentleman say that he wanted the debate to
be adjourned to doomsday?

MARCH 27, 1957
The Hon. the Speaker: I heard no such
expression.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Croll, the debate
was adjourned.
MERCHANT

SEAMEN COMPENSATION
BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. John J. Kinley moved the third reading of Bill 178, an Act to amend the Merchant
Seamen Compensation Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
FERTILIZERS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John A. McDonald moved the second
reading of Bill R-12, an Act for the regulation
and control of agricultural fertilizers.
He said: Honourable senators, when a
copy of this bill was first handed to me
yesterday morning I was surprised to note
that it contained only a short paragraph by
This short
way of explanatory notes.
explanation, which appears on the page
opposite sections 1 and 2 of the bill, reads:
The principal purpose of this bill is to meet
recent developments and trends in the plant food
industry.
No major changes in substance are
contemplated. The form of the bill corresponds
to the agricultural statutes enacted in recent years.

I am sure it would be of considerable
advantage to honourable senators if bills
such as this contained an explanatory note
on each section. With the use of such notes
one could explain the bill more easily and
honourable senators would be able to follow
the explanation better. In order to get an
understanding of this bill it was necessary
for me to go to the senior officers of the
fertilizer section of the Department of
Agriculture. For the information which I
shall pass on to the house today I am very
much indebted to the able and willing
officers of that section.
I know that many honourable senators
appreciate well the great value of fertilizers
to our farmers today in the improvement of
the agricultural economy; but the rapid
progress in utilization of this commodity is
known to a lesser degree. The increase in
the domestic consumption of fertilizers as
shown at 10-year intervals from 1926 to 1956
is remarkable, as the following table
indicates:
Years
1926-27
1936-37

............. .800,680

Increase

112 per cent over 1936
26 per cent over 1946

While fertilizers are beneficial in increasing yields of most crops, they appear to be
used in largest volume for specialty crops.
For example, in 1956 Kings County, Nova
Scotia, used 31 per cent of the fertilizers used
in that province. These were for the most
part used for fruit, potatoes and improvement of pasture and production of grass.
Carleton and Victoria counties in New Brunswick-the potato counties-used 65 per cent
of the total for the province. The tobacco,
sugar beet and specialty crop area of Ontario, namely, Essex, Kent, Norfolk and
Oxford counties, used 37 per cent of the
Ontario total.
These figures will perhaps give honourable
senators an idea of the way fertilizer is used
throughout the provinces, and the importance
it is assuming. As more and more of our
farmers realize the great need for and benefit
from the use of fertilizers in order to grow
maximum crops, consumption will increase.
Canada is not self-sufficient in fertilizer
materials. The main components of fertilizer
are nitrogen, phosphorous and potash, and
Canada has a surplus of nitrogen only. Importations of fertilizers in 1955-56 totalled
907,000 tons, including 708,000 tons of
phosphate materials and 152,000 tons of
potash materials. Exports of fertilizers in
the same period totalled 870,000 tons, consisting mainly of ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate and
cyanamide. Eighty per cent of the nitrogen
produced in Canada is exported.
Honourable senators who are members of
the Land Use Committee have heard by
the evidence given before that committee
how important it is that farmers use fertilizers, especially on farms that are not as
productive as they could be made. For instance, we learned that even marginal lands
may be brought into much greater production by the wise use of fertilizers.
Farmers today generally have their soils
analysed and know in what respect they are
deficient. In the eastern part of Canada
most of the soils are acid and require the
application of lime. After lime is applied, the
wise use of fertilizer can greatly increase the
crops which the farmer wishes to produce.
I am not at all sure that the soils in western
Canada will benefit from the use of fertilizer
as the soils in the east do, but I believe
that in years to come much more fertilizer
will be used in the western provinces than
is used there today.
Development is taking place in Saskatchewan for production of potash, and it is expected that actual production will commence
late next year. With this development Canada should be self-sufficient in all but

SENATE

phosphorous. A potash plant is being established near Saskatoon, where, I understand,
there are large deposits of potash, if they
can be got at. The phosphoric acid that
farmers use is imported by western Canada
mainly from the states of Montana and
Wyoming, and by eastern Canada from the
state of Florida.
The fertilizer industry is big business
today. It is a $100 million industry, with
40 per cent of the production dollarwise being exported.
The Fertilizers Act, which was passed in
1922, was amended in certain details in 1928
and 1947. The fundamental purpose of the bill
is to require that all fertilizers sold in Canada be marked to show the guaranteed plant
food content, and to provide for inspection
and analysis to ensure that they meet
their guarantees.
An important secondary provision of the
bill requires official registration of fertilizers,
for the purpose of prohibiting the sale of
those which do not meet the requirements
of the act. I think it is only fair to state
that the officials of the Fertilizer section of
the Department of Agriculture have donc a
great work over the years. Their inspectors
have been very active, and they have so
handled the situation that the farmer has
been assured of getting the quality of fertilizer
that was spelled out on the labels of the
fertilizer containers. I do not think there
has been any prosecution of fertilizer dealers
or manufacturers under the act for some
years.
The act contains several items of detail
which have been found to be inadequate and
outdated in the light of recent technical
developments and merchandising practices.
The bill in no way changes the basic purpose
or substance of the act, but provides for
the establishment by regulations of matters
of operating detail which need periodic revision. With the Law Clerk of the Senate I
went over other agricultural statutes which
have been revised in recent years, and found
that two such acts were revised in the session
of 1955, namely, the Canada Agricultural
Products Standards Act and the Meat Inspection Act. The bill before us is similar in
form to these two acts. Also, it provides
for the same penalties as they do. I may say
that these penalties are much more severe
than the ones specified in the present Fertilizers Act.
Honourable senators, I intend, if this bill
receives your approval and is given second
reading, to ask that it be sent to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce for
further consideration. This is a bill which,
if we had had it earlier in the session, could

have been studied with profit by the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources. I would
not mind referring it to the latter committee,
except that I think the Banking and Commerce Committee is meeting more or less
regularly and perhaps would wish to consider this public bill. There is, I believe,
some urgency about getting the bill through
this house; I understand the Minister of
Agriculture and the department are very
anxious that the bill be passed at this session.
Of course, if it is the wish of honourable
senators that the bill be referred te the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I
shall be more than pleased, because the members of that committee would at least be
expected to know more about this legislation
than the members of the Banking and Commerce Committee do.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
may I ask the honourable gentleman a question? This measure replaces the Fertilizers
Act, which is to be repealed. It is therefore
new legislation, and I agree with his comment that the explanatory notes to the bill
might at any rate have been fuller than
they are. Can the honourable senator tell
us how many persons are employed in the
administration of the present Fertilizers Act?
I presume the same number will be required
under the new act.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I am sorry I have not
that detail, but we can secure it in committee. I may say that the chief officers of
the Fertilizer section of the Department of
Agriculture will be present when the bill
is considered in committee.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I ask that question, honourable senators, because from reading the
bill I gather that there will be a substantial
number of employees. It does seem to me
that a bill of this kind could be framed in
simpler terms. After all, the purpose of
the legislation is to protect users of fertilizers
against abuse. If the bill did these three
things: (1) defined fertilizers; (2) required
the person selling them to show clearly on
the bag or other container the constituent
elements of the contents; and (3) specified
the penalties for violation of the standards, I
think that the requirements would be pretty
well met. I am bound to say that section 4,
which authorizes the making of regulations,
looks to me rather formidable, and since
Canada is a very large country, extending
from Newfoundland to British Columbia, I
should think that the staff necessary to administer the act, in addition to those who
may be based here in Ottawa, will be very
substantial. I think it might be useful if
the committee, whose meeting I might not

MARCH 27, 1957
be able to attend, were to get complete information on that particular point. I am bound
to say that it appals me sornewhat when I
see the expansion of our Civil Service in all
directions, and I cannot avoid thinking of
the fact that every time a new civil servant
is hired to do a job that could probably have
been handled in some other way, an additional burden is placed upon the taxpayers
of the country.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
may I ask the sponsor of the bill a question
with regard to offences and penalties?
I
notice that in section 10 the penalties have
been increased considerably. Can the honourable gentleman tell us if there bas been
any trouble in the administration of the
present act, and what prosecutions, if any,
were undertaken? Also can he give us some
concrete information as to why these penal7
ties are being increased to such an extent.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators,
the penalties are set out in section 10, and,
as I indicated before, are similar to those
contained in other leading agricultural
statutes. It is true that the amounts have
been increased, but I think the tendency to
increase penalties of this order is general.
I asked the chief administrative officer if
there have been any prosecutions, and he
assured me that in recent years there has
not been one. This, as he remarked, indicates
that the inspectors have done their work
very thoroughly, that farmers have been
assured of the amount and the quality of
fertilizer which they paid for so that prosecutions have been unnecessary. For the benefit of honourable members who may not be
familiar with these things, I may mention
that the labels will contain a statement as
to the maker, the contents and the quality of
the fertilizer. For instance, the numerals
6-12-6 indicate that the product contains, by
weight, six parts of nitrogen, twelve parts
of phosphoric acid, and six parts of potash.
The inspectors, in the course of their duties,
take samples from bags which may be stored
ready for shipment, or held by retailers, or
may even be on farms; and it is just too bad
for the people who put up these fertilizers
if they do not measure up to the contents as
stated on the labels.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If the administration bas
been so efficient that no prosecutions have
been necessary, why should the penalties be
increased?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine:
conformity.

On the principle of

Hon. Mr. McDonald: That, honourable
senators, is a nice question, but I am not in
a position to add to the answer I have given,

that the intent is to bring the penalty clauses
into line with those contained in other important agricultural statutes. I have heard it
suggested that if a prosecution should become
necessary the existing penalties would be
too low.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: I am glad that the
sponsor intends to propose that, if the bill
receives second reading, it go to committee,
and I trust that legal officers of the Department of Agriculture will be in attendance
there, because the bill strikes me in one way
as being very peculiar. Section 1 states:
1. This Act may be cited as the Fertilizers Act.

But, according to section 13The Fertilizers Act is repealed.

If the bill is passed in this form, will it not
be like the snake which swallows its own
tail?
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: I, too, hope that
the officers of the legal branch of the department will be present when this bill is considered in committee, because, while certainly I am not in a position to discuss the
subject with the knowledge of the honourable
senator who is sponsoring the bill, I very
much doubt its adequacy to accomplish the
intended purpose, namely, to protect purchasers from the fraudulent and perhaps
careless sale of fertilizers.
There are in this bill two prohibiting
sections. Section 9 states:
9. No person shall sell any fertilizer or supplement that contains destructive ingredients or
properties harmful to plant growth when used
according to the directions accompanying the
fertilizer or supplement or appearing on the label
of the package in which the fertilizer or supplement is contained.

You will observe that before the prohibition
is to apply the product must be sold. In other
words, an inspector must find the product
already sold before prohibition can take effect
or any of the penalties can be applied. In
actual fact, I assume, he will visit a wholesaler or a retail house and inspect the fertilizer which is there on sale, and not wait
until the sale bas taken place before he makes
his examination. So I suggest there should be
added to this clause the words: "No person
shall sell or have in possession for sale". Is
that not most important?
Hon.
sale".

Mr.

Quinn: "Or

for

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, that might well
be added, too. But if he has it in his possession for sale that would be sufficient: all the
inspector would have to do would be to drop
in to any place where the fertilizer is on sale,
and take his samples: the prohibition would
then become effective.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:

May I interrupt my

honourable friend? I think the point is
covered by the definition clause, paragraph
2 (h):
(h) "sell" includes sell, offer for sale, expose for
sale, have in possession for sale and distribute.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, that answers my
point. I had not observed the definition.
There is, nevertheless, something else I should
like to say. The bill prohibits any fertilizer
or supplement containing destructive ingredients. That, of course, is an excellent
provision: no one should sell a fertilizer containing destructive ingredients. But it seems
to me that the prohibition should go further,
and that no one should sell a fertilizer which
is not a fertilizer, although it may not be
destructive of or harmful to plant growth.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: To do so would be fraud,
would it not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I suppose that if the
product were sold as a fertilizer and proved
destructive to plant growth the transaction
could be fraudulent, but the vendor might
plead that he had no knowledge of the fact.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: But if, though it had no
fertilizing property, it was sold as a fertilizer,
that would be fraud, would it not?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: The product must conform to the requirements of section 3.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It might be possible to
prosecute the offender under the Criminal
Code, but the code is not well designed to
support a measure of this kind. The prohibition in the bill should be sufficiently
definite and complete to give the inspectors
the powers which are required to carry out
the purposes of the bill. I think there should
be a definite provision that fertilizers which
are destructive or harmful to plant growth
are prohibited. What we ought to provide is
that a description of the properties of the
fertilizer shall be marked on the bag or other
container and that the fertilizer itself shall be
in keeping with the description. That at least
would give some protection. We might go a
little further and say that a fertilizer must
fertilize, that it must be of some value. Under
this legislation you could sell something that
has no value at all.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: What is a fertilizer
supposed to do?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Is that not covered by
section 3?
The Hon. the Speaker: Order. One speaker
at a time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A fertilizer is supposed
to fertilize, and there is nothing here that
says it must do that. It says it must not be
destructive.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Is that not covered by
section 3?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it is not. Section 3

reads.
No person shall sell,.

Under the Interpretation Act, that includes
having possession for sale.
. . . or import into Canada, any fertilizer or supplement unless the fertilizer or supplement has

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And labelled.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I presume you cannot

register it until it is imported. A person
should have some time to register it after
its importation. The section continues:

packaged and labelled as prescribed.

and is

That might cover the packaging to some
extent, but a person ought to be required to
label the package, and the label should conform to the materials enclosed in the package.
I am under the impression that some further
consideration should be given to this phraseology by the members of the department,
particularly by its legal staff.
Hon. SalIter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I was very pleased to hear the
sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
indicate that it will be referred to committee.
However, I cannot say I was so pleased at
his suggestion that the Banking and Commerce Committee would be the proper one
to consider a bill dealing with the regulation
and control of the agricultural fertilizers.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am sure that some
of the agricultural experts in the Senate
must be getting a great deal of satisfaction
or amusement from the fact that, in the main,
those discussing this bill happen to be lawyers.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As I said to a colleague
a little earlier, I find it very surprising that
in such a charmed year as 1957, and having
regard to an important event which may
take place in the month of June, we should
be considering anything that has to do with
the regulation or control of fertilizers.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: There are one or two
things in this bill to which I should like
to draw the attention of honourable senators.
When I read the definition of fertilizers I
find it might cover natural fertilizers as well
as manufactured fertilizers. Is that intended to
be so? I find that an inspector and an analyst
are defined as persons appointed or designated as such under section 5 of the bill.

MARCH 27, 1957
But all I find in section 5 is that the minister may designate any person as an inspector or an analyst for the purposes of this
act. I find nothing in the regulations apart
from the omnibus clause at the end, prescribing any conditions or qualifications under
which a person may be appointed or designated as an inspector or an analyst. Maybe
he does not need to be qualified.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: That is why
lawyers are speaking to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That could be. I also
find other peculiarities, and I am only referring to them in a general way to indicate
it is a happy thought that the bill is going
to be sent to committee. Its drafters even
found it necessary to define the word
"prescribed":
"Prescribed" means prescribed by regulation.

Turning to the regulations, section 4(i)
says that the Governor in Council may make
regulations
prescribing anything else that by this act is required to be prescribed.

A person who can fit those together and
get some sense out of them is a mastermind. I should have thought that clause (i)
was all-embracing for I cannot determine
its extent or scope, but apparently it is
not enough, because clause (j) provides that
the Governor
in Council may make
regulations.
generally, for carrying
provisions of this act.

out

the

purposes

and

Very often that provision is appended to a
whole enumeration of powers by regulation,
but to find it together with the previous one
would suggest that this legislation was put
together by picking bits and pieces from a
number of statutes. It has resulted in a confusing overrun of words and language.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps it was drafted
by a fertilizer expert.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Then there is the point
brought up by my honourable friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to the effect
that if we pass the bill there may be no
Fertilizers Act at ail.
Honourable senators, this bill should be
given careful consideration. I do not know
why it is so urgent that it be put into effect.
The present Fertilizers Act bas functioned
very smoothly. There have been no prosecutions under it, so it bas not provided any
business for lawyers, and that is a very sad
thing. But, seriously speaking, if the Fertilizers Act has been so successful why should
we try to put this bill through so late in the
session, particularly when some more important legislation bas been put over until the

next session of Parliament? We should take
a good look at this measure and not be in
too big a hurry to pass it.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, speaking as an amateur agriculturist
and a limited user of fertilizers, I would
point out that there is one aspect of this bill
which has not been mentioned in the discussion so far. It rather implies the necessity of
protecting the manufacturer or the originator
of fertilizers as well as their users. As I
understand it, fertilizers can be applied to
perfectly good soil without giving the desired
results. When this happens the manufacturer
or originator of the fertilizer is exposed to a
charge that his product is not good, when,
in fact, the trouble very often results from
climatic conditions. Climatic conditions have
more to do with producing good results than
all the fertilizers that can be applied to
soi. Therefore, I think some attention should
be paid in committee to the other side of
the picture. If fertilizers are to be considered
as the main consideration of my potato-growing friends in the Maritime provinces, particularly in New Brunswick, I would accept
that as one basis of criterion. I would say
another basis might be the fact that the
perfectly good alluvial soil of the bench
lands of the Ottawa Valley does not always
respond as might be expected to certain
chemical fertilizers, particularly when climatie
conditions are not favourable. I say that
without implying any criticism of the manufacturers of fertilizers.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Following upon the
remark of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), I wonder if the
sponsor of the bill would enlighten us as
to what demand, if any, there bas been for
this legislation? Is any provincial body,
agricultural community, society, or association in any way responsible for the proposed
repeal of the present act?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I asked that question, and was informed that the present act
was outdated. The department had been
working on its revision for some time, and
I was told that the reason why the bill was
not introduced earlier was that it had been
under consideration by both the Justice
Department and the legal officers of the
Department of Agriculture and they had completed the work only quite recently. If the
bill goes to committee, I believe the legal
officers of the Department of Agriculture,
and possibly representatives of the Justice
Department as well, will be able to answer
most of the inquiries which have been raised.
I have no doubt that very careful consideration has been given to the drafting of the
legislation; it is a very important measure,

LAND USE
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE ADOPTED

Hon. John A. McDonald, for Hon. Mr.
Power, Chairman of the Special Committee
on Land Use in Canada, presented the committee's second report.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
committee's second and probably last report
of this session.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Special Committee on Land Use in Canada
make their second report as follows:
1. In accordance with the order of reference of
January 30, 1957, your committee held nine meetings, at which 27 witnesses were heard.
2. Your committee feels that while the progress
made is gratifying, it also serves to illustrate the
magnitude of the problem to be studied and to
rule out any ppssibility of fully reporting on the
subject at the present session of Parliament.
3. Your committee therefore recommends that the
committee be reconstituted at the next session of
Parliament to continue the inquiry.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: With leave, I move
that the report be adopted now.
Honourable senators, on behalf of the
honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr.

Power), Chairman of the Special Committee
on Land Use in Canada, may I take this
opportunity of thanking the members of the
committee for their conscientious devotion
to duty. They have shown a great interest
in this study and it has been a pleasure to
work with them. It is our hope that the
committee will be reconstituted at the next
session to continue this valuable work.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With consent of the
Senate, I move that these bills be read the
second time now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
these are divorce bills, and if I recollect
rightly it was my friend's deputy (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) who suggested at a previous sitting
that as the session appears to be nearing its
end we should put divorce bills through this
house on the day they are presented, in order
that they may be considered in the House of
Commons before prorogation.

MARCH 28, 1957
Hon. Mr. Haig: But you did not ask to have
these bills put through yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yesterday I presented
the reports on which these bills are based,
but the bills themselves were not ready then.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With leave of the Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the third time, and passed, on

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 3
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House

of Commons with Bill 360, an Act for granting
to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year
ending 31st March, 1958.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I would move that this bill be read a
second time now.
This bill is in the form similar to that of
interim supply bills passed in previous years.
The amounts set forth are intended to provide the necessary requirements for the public
service until the end of the present month
only. The bill asks for one-twelfth of the
total amount set forth in the main estimates
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1958,
which have already been tabled in this house.
This bill is unlike other interim supply
bills of recent years, in that the one-twelfth
applies to all the items. Honourable senators
82719-29

will recall that in previous years the first
interim bill asked for two-twelfths, or even
three-twelfths of the total of certain items,
on account of the relatively large proportion
of the annual expenditure required in some
instances at this time of year. In this bill
there is no provision for any more than onetwelfth of any item.
Honourable senators, that is al I have to
say on this bill, except to give the usual
assurance that the passing of the bill will
not prejudice the rights and privileges of
honourable senators to criticize any item in
the estimates when they come to us at a
later date. Such rights and privileges will be
respected, and will not be ýcurtailed or restricted in any way as a result of the passing
of this bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
have read the bill and understand it. I noted
the point mentioned by the honourable leader
that in past years different percentages of
various items have sometimes been asked
for-one-sixth in one case, one-third in another, one-twelfth in another, and so on. This
bill, however, asks for one-twelfth only, the
amount required for the month of April. Undoubtedly, if I can read the signs of the times
we may expect another supply bill a little
later on, perhaps requesting an amount for the
next five months.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, this is one of the last opportunities
that will be given to us to make a review of
what bas been done by Parliament during the
last four years. If the information is accurate,
Parliament will be dissolved in the near
future.
Sometimes one has to complain about civil
servants; at other times one has the pleasure
of complimenting some of them for their competence, efficiency and good work. My contention, honourable senators, is that the duties
of the members of both bouses are twofold:
we have to study legislation that applies to
all men, women and children in Canada;
and also we have the unquestionable right to
control expenditures. This is how members
of Parliament and senators as well can express their views about the manner in which
some people who are paid with the taxpayers'
money do their duties, or do not do them as
well as might be expected of them. That is
precisely the reason why in my first speech
in the Senate I complained about the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, a Crown company, which has wide powers. The purpose
of my complaint was to improve conditions
that were then existing; and the reason I
complained was that I had heard over the
radio a blasphemous poem, or so-called poem,
I asked the C.B.C. for a copy of it, and 4

SENATE
took five weeks to get it. The only excuse
that was given to me for broadcasting such
a stupidity was that the author was a
clochard-in English, a bum-and I wondered
why it was that the so-called poem of a
bum should be broadcast over the whole
French network of C.B.C.
At the time there was little criticism of it.
Some of my friends asked me why I had
denounced the C.B.C. from my seat in the
house of the Senate. I told them that at first
I had written and asked for the text of that
broadcast; and whether my letter was written
on Senate paper or on my private stationery
made no difference, because in my private
capacity as a Canadian citizen or in my
official capacity as a senator I had the unquestionable right to express my approval or
disapproval of any program of the C.B.C.
I do not remember, naturally, if my stenographer used paper without a letter-head,
paper with my letter-head as a barrister, or
paper with my letter-head as a member of
this distinguished house, but I wrote that
letter because I felt it was my duty to do so;
and some friends told me that they were
very glad that I had complained about it
because if I had not done so they would have.
Honourable senators, because we are members of the Senate, are we to be precluded
from exercising the rights that we have as
private citizens?

This is an important ques-

tion mark. Then if we are, there is no more
control of the vast civil service. That is my
first point. I did not write the C.B.C. and I
did not complain of it in the Senate for
the fun of it; I did it because I thought it
was my duty to do it. It is surprising at times
how some people who are protagonists of
free speech deny the right to others to express their own feelings about certain matters.
Free speech should only be for themselves,
and it should be for themselves to criticize
always the Government. If there is one who
will defend the right of anyone to differ from
the Government it is in order; but one
must oppose the Government continuously to
enjoy the freedom of speech that is advocated
by some people. This is beyond me. I cannot
understand it. But I have discovered an
item which appeared in one of my favourite
newspapers, the Halifax Chronicle Herald,
of March 29. I read that the Progressive
Conservatives are to plan strategy. Although
they have had four years to prepare their
program, nothing is done yet. I understand
that there was a change in the leadership of
the party; nevertheless one year is sufficient
time for preparation. Yet, I repeat, nothing
has been done; the program is to be laid out
at the next weekend, when they will meet

in Ottawa. I wonder whether honourable senators have seen this very interesting news
item, contained in a Canadian Press dispatch.
It reads as follows:
Ottawa (CP)-The Progressive Conservatives will
plan their election campaign strategy at a meeting
here early next month, Opposition Leader Diefenbaker announced Thursday.
The party's national campaign committee, comprising representatives from every province, will
meet here on April 7-8.
It is expected that the meetings will cover all
phases of the general campaign plan, including
policy . . .

They have no policy but there is a tremendous issue-the right of anyone who is
in politics to offer constructive criticism of

any organization. But they want the Liberals
to say nothing; they demand freedom of
speech only for Conservatives and only to
criticize the Government all the time.

I will not refer to what happened in the
other house last week but I have mentioned
my own experience with regard to the

C.B.C. I do not believe that any civil servant should consider himself superior to
Parliament. Civil servants should respect
our parliamentary institutions. Some years
ago at a meeting of the Professional Institute
of the Civil Service four of its members used
abusive language about the House of Commons Civil Service Committee of which the
honourable senator from Huron-Perth (Hon.
Mr. Golding) was one of the most distinguished members. I succeeded in obtaining
three apologies; that is to say the ministerial
heads of three of the departments concerned

told the civil servants who were guilty of
-n impropriety to make apologies. But the
minister with whose department the fourth
offender was connected informed me that this
man could not be required to apologize and
therefore-since he was reluctant to tell a
civil servant to respect a committee of Parliament-I was unable to make use of the
three other letters of apology.
It is unfortunate that some federal employees who are connected with Crown companies believe that they are not civil servants,
that they are superior to members of both
parties, and are not subject to parliamentary
control. This is wrong. I shall have more
to say on this matter at the beginning of
next session.
I would not conclude without saying a few
words about civil servants, ranking as 'deputy
ministers, who do their work so well, and
help us to do ours. As charity begins at home,
I want to say that the Clerk of the Senate is
one of the leading gentlemen in the public
service; and I appreciate his help, his courtesy, his competence and his patience.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Unanimously agreed.

APRIL 1, 1957
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you, sir. While I
do not name his assistant, I may recall that
last year, during his illness, a special tribute
was paid to him, and good wishes were
expressed. I am very glad that he made a
prompt recovery. He also is doing very well.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Another gentleman whom
I know well, and whose services are highly
valued by members of the other house, is Mr.
Leon J. Raymond, O.B.E.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: He was very helpful to
me when I was in the other house.
To continue my non-political speech:
another civil servant, also a very modest man,
but one who, because his representations to
the cabinet relate to taxation, plays a bigger
role in the affairs of the country than even
the Governor of the Bank of Canada, is the
deputy head of the Department of Finance.
He performs his duties very well.
An old friend of mine, Mr. David Sim, the
dean of the deputy ministers, is connected
with the Department of National Revenue.
In that capacity he does the most painstaking
and ungrateful work in the whole business of
government, for his is the department which
is charged with the collection of direct and
indirect taxation. Mr. Sim performs his task
with great skill and competence. I am very
glad that the minister has recommended the
appointment as Assistant Deputy Minister of
Mr. R. C. Laberge. He was for some time the
minister's private secretary; he knows the
department well; and I am sure that he will
follow the good example of Mr. Sim. Then
there is the able staff of the Income Tax
Branch under Mr. McEntyre. I hope that
this branch will succeed in getting returns,
but not in a painful manner, from the
taxpayers.
Then, Mr. Speaker, I come to our mutual
friend, the Queen's Printer, Mr. Edmond
Cloutier. Incidentally, when I speak of the
deputy head of a department or branch I
would like to include the whole staff. How
many of us realize the importance of the
Printing Bureau and appreciate the quantity
and quality of the publications it puts out?
The printing shops of the largest newspapers
in Canada and the United States are not as
big or as important as the Printing Bureau
of Canada. We do not think of this every
morning when we receive our copies of
Hansard, which we get in both English and
French languages at almost the same time.
The work is well done and is most satisfactory, so it is not necessary to correct the
proofs. Credit for this should be given to
Mr. Cloutier, a man of great experience, and
to his able staff.

I come now to a controversial figure who
has been my friend for many years. He is
a man of progress and I have great respect
for him. f refer to Mr. Walter J. Turnbull,
Deputy Postmaster General. I have not always
agreed with him, as I do not always agree
with others, but he is a very able man. When
I reported to him as Chairman of the House
of Commons Special Committee on the Civil
Service he was private secretary to Mr. King.
At that time he rendered me great service
and since then he has always been a friend.
I congratulate the Postmaster General upon
the appointment of Mr. G. A. Boyle, whom I
have known as a very efficient civil servant,
as Assistant Deputy Postmaster General.
Among other things he has helped me considerably in the organization of rural post
This is a promotion within the
offices.
service.
I would also like to mention Dr. Taggart of
the Department of Agriculture, and his
competent assistant, Mr. S. J. Chagnon.
Then there is Brigadier Carriere, who was
with the Department of Public Works. I do
not know* how many of you have met this
gentleman. He is an engineer of great
reputation, but unfortunately he left the
service to take an important position in a
Montreal firm. He has been replaced by Mr.
Gerald Millar, the son of a former District
Magistrate of Hull. Mr. Millar is highly
competent and will continue to help members
of the Parliament and others in doing
important work. I regret also that Mr.
Lessard, who did so well in the Department
of Transport, left the public service to do
some private work in Montreal. However.
he is now the right-hand of Mr. Chevrier in
the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority.
There are many others whom I could
mention, but I do not want to take too much
of the time of this honourable chamber.
However, I could not conclude without saying a word of thanks and praise to a great
scholar and friend of all of us, Mr. F. A.
Hardy, of the Parliamentary Library. Whenever we go to Mr. Hardy for any kind of
information we get it without delay. He is
most helpful, as is Mr. Sylvestre, who has
succeeded Mr. Desrochers. Mr. Desrochers
also was a man of great culture. I could
continue indefinitely to praise other civil servants who have been honest and helpful to
members of Parliament. Sometimes I may
have to criticize someone, even one of those
gentlemen, for something I find wrong, but
I do it in good faith, as it is my duty to do.
I deny to anyone-even to those who do not
feel as I do about them-I deny their right
to prevent me from saying what I have to
say about them.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendment made by the Standing Committee on Natural Resources to Bill R-12,
an Act for the regulation and control of
agricultural fertilizers.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt, Chairman of the
committee, moved that the amendment be
concurred in.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,
I understand that consideration of this item
was postponed from Thursday last until today

at the request of the honourable gentleman
from Toronto-Trinity

(Hon.

Mr.

Roebuck).

At the close of Thursday's sitting he asked
me if I would speak to it on his behalf, because he anticipated that he would not be

able to be in Ottawa today. He was concerned
about the provisions of section Il of the bill,
which reads as follows:
A certificate of an analyst stating that he has
analyzed or examined a substance or a sample
submitted to him by an inspector and stating the
result of his examination is admissible in evidence
in a prosecution for an offence under this act, and
is prima facie proof of the statement of analysis
contained in the certificate.

When the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity asked me to speak to this
matter I think he felt that the wording of
this section was unsatisfactory from the legal
point of view. However, he had not actually
studied the problem; and, to be quite frank,
neither had I. Since then, however, I have
been able to make some study of it, and I
hope the explanation I am about to give will
be satisfactory

to both this house and the

honourable gentleman.

The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity was concerned principally about the
use of the words "prima facie proof" in section 11. He originally felt those words should
be "prima facie evidence."
The words "prima facie evidence" are used
extensively in other federal statutes. They
are found in numerous sections of the Criminal Code, in the Bank Act and in the Bills of
Exchange Act, as well as in statutes of various
provinces. The words "prima facie proof"
have appeared of late years in various federal

APRIL i, 1957
bills. They were used, for example, in the
Precious Metals Marking Bill of 1946, but in
the Senate the wording was changed to "prima
facie evidence", and this wording is in the
act, Chapter 26 of the statutes of that year.
Likewise, I am informed that in 1948 the
words "prima facie proof" were used in the
original draft of the bill to amend the Income
Tax Act, and they were changed in the
Senate to "prima facie evidence". There may
have been other instances. This would indicate that up to that time the Senate preferred
the language "prima facie evidence" to the
language "prima facie proof".
However, in 1955 Parliament passed the
Agricultural Products Standards Act, Chapter
27 of the statutes of that year, and the Meat
Inspection Act, Chapter 36 of that year. In
both those bills, which were comparable to
the bill now before us, the words "prima facie
proof" were used, and the wording so remains.
This, however, is not conclusive evidence that
Parliament has accepted the new wording.
There are two problems involved here. One
is a theoretical problem as to whether or not
"evidence" or "proof" is the proper word.
There is a practical problem as well, and it is
the one with which we are mainly concerned.
It can be stated this way: Will a certificate
alone as prescribed or contemplated by this
section of the bill, presented by an analyst
to a court of law, be sufficient to convict an
accused, and be final and conclusive proof
to that effect?
I would think the answer to that question
is in the negative, but because there has been
some discussion about the point I thought it
might be better to have the record complete
so that honourable senators and other interested persons may be satisfied as to the
draftsmanship of this kind of legislation. I
have done a little work in some of the legal
authorities which I think bear upon the point,
and it might be important and helpful to
have some of these placed on the record.
Volume 15 Halsbury, Third Edition, at page
260 contains the following statement:
.

which it must not be confounded. Proof is that

tribunal, establishes a fact in the absence of
Unless a
acceptable evidence to the contrary.
particular enactment otherwise provides, sufficient
evidence usually means prima facie evidence,
which, if there is no contradictory evidence, may
establish a fact.

Then I have a reference to the Bandbury
Peerage case, 57 E.R., at page 62, which
reads as follows:
In every case in which there is prima facie
evidence of any right existing in any person, the
anus probandi is always upon the persan or party
calling such right in question.

I should like also to refer briefly to a
discussion of the point contained in the
Canadian Encyclopaedic Digest, second edition, page 441. It is as follows:
The expression "prima facie evidence" or "prima
facie case" may be used in two different senses.
It is sometimes used ta represent the stage where
the proponent bas submitted enough evidence ta
entitle him ta have the question left ta the jury.
But it is also used, and more frequently, as
equivalent ta prima facie proof, i.e. as representing
the stage where the proponent bas not merely submitted enough evidence ta get past the judge ta
the jury, but has gone further. and, either by
means of a presumption or by a general mass of
strong evidence, bas entitled himself ta a ruling
that the opponent should fail if he does nothing
more in the way of producing evidence.

So, on that authority, prima facie evidence
is assimilated mumeaning to the words prima
facie proof.
In addition to looking up the authorities,
I inquired of the officials of the Department
of Justice, who are responsible for the
draftsmanship of this legislation, as to their
view of the use of the word "proof" in
this section. If I may, I would quote briefly
from a letter which I received from Mr.
Driedger, the Assistant Deputy Minister,
which makes their position quite clear. He
says:
A document is either evidence or it is not
evidence; that is ta say, either it is received in
evidence or it is rejected. Having been admitted
in evidence, its value or probative force is another
matter.
Clause 11 of the bill deals with both evidence and
probative
value. It says that the certificate is
admissible in evidence, and then goes on ta state
that it is prima facie proof. This means that the
document must be received by the court, and in the
absence of any evidence adduced by the accused,
the facts set out in the certificate are taken as
proven. The accused could, of course, adduce his
own evidence ta rebut any of the facts or conclusions in the certificate.

That, I believe, was the line of thinking
Now, the real practical problem which
on which the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity based the point he proposed arises from this set of circumstances is this:
Heretofore the courts have been accustomed
to raise on this section.
A little later, in the same edition at page to interpreting the words "prima facie evi278, the author makes a statement with ref- dence"; and to introduce the new and more
erence to "prima facie", "sufficient" and modern phrase, "prima facie proof", as it
has been introduced in the past six, seven
"conclusive" evidence. He says:

SENATE
appear to be changing the idea behind the
legislation and thus make it more difficult
for an accused to present a defence.
Honourable senators, this may sound like
legal casuistry, but it is important because
I think we here are determined at all times
to protect the right of an accused to make
an adequate defence. If there is an improvement in the language of the statute,
and I submit in this case there is an improvement, we as a legislative body should
not resist that improvement.
I would further suggest that the use of
the words "prima facie" before the word
"proof" indicates the right of an accused
to come into the court in the face of a
certificate and make evidence which would
rebut the certificate or the content of it,
if in his defence it is desirable to do so.
I think the right remains with him, whether
the words used are "prima facie proof" or
"prima facie evidence".
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, I would like to say a few words in
connection with this bill. My reason for not
speaking on the second reading was that
I did not have an opportunity of seeing the
bill and comparing it with the provisions
of the Fertilizers Act, which was passed in
1922.
This bill was referred to the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources. I attended
the meeting of the committee, and I do not
mind saying that some of the provisions with
respect to the administration of the proposed
new act alarmed me. Those honourable
honourable senators who have had the opportunity and responsibility of administering
acts of this kind will recognize the fundamental features that should be spelled out
in such legislation. In connection with any
act there are other features that change
from year to year and should normally and
rightfully be dealt with by order in council
or by regulation. I have studied this bill,
and compared it with the present act, and
I think it is an excellent piece of legislation.
If passed, it will bring the law up to date.
Although I could make some references in
connection with the interpretation clause, I
do not think it is necessary.
We are all aware of the fact that during
recent years newly developed constituent
elements have been used in fertilizers,
although they cannot be rightfully used under
the present act. The bill will give the administrative officials of the department authority to make regulations to deal with
this matter. Otherwise they would have to
wait a year in order to have the act amended.
The bill proposes certain changes which
would improve the penalty clauses that are

in the present act. For instance, upon summary conviction for even a minor technical
violation the present act requires that the
penalty shall be not more than $100 for the
first offence, and not less than $100 for a
second offence. This bill provides that the
penalty shall not exceed $500, and under
that provision I think the administrative
heads of the department could recommenddepending on the nature of the offence-that
the penalty be as low as $5, $10 or $20. In
my opinion that is an improvement.
Not being a lawyer, I am not in a position
to discuss the references made by the honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr.
Connolly).
I would have no fear of the operation of
the law if this bill is passed. Having known
for a good many years the departmental
officials responsible for the carrying out of
the provisions of the present act, and having
had something to do with the administration
of other acts coming under their department,
I have no hesitation in saying that this new
act will be administered equitably. And as
far as the regulations are concerned, I think
that they will prove beneficial to everybody.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (O±awa West): Honourable senators, may I be allowed to add a few
words? I think it is the desire of this chamber that a person accused of violating any
provision of this act or any regulation made
thereunder should have the opportunity of
making an adequate defence, and I believe
that under section 11 of this bill as drafted
he would be entitled to make such a defence.
The motion for concurrence in the amendment was agreed to.

when it was studying the Municipal Grants

typesetter's transposition. In plain language,
what this means is that what was said by

in the city of Ottawa. The honourable gentleman from Churchill spoke of the dust and
he enriched my vocabulary by using the word
"grittiest", which is a strong word to use
when speaking of the capital city of Canada.
What I complained about was the condition
of the sidewalks of Ottawa in the wintertime,
which is an entirely different condition, for
at that time there is no dust at all. I hope
the newspaper will make due correction.

SENATE
to -come to the Senate tomorrow to discuss
the resolution that stands in the honourable
senator's name. As I read Rule 18A of the
Senate, I must pass that invitation on. The
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has referred to what has taken
place in the past. I have looked up the
record and I can report that on every occasion when a minister has come to the Senate
it was for the purpose of explaining a bill
on motion for second reading. The record
shows that there have been five such occasions. The dates of those occasions, and the
ministers who came over here, were as
follows: March 16, 1948, and March 28, 1949,
the Honourable
Lionel Chevrier, then
Minister of Transport; November 8, 1949,
the Honourable Brooke Claxton, then Minister
of National Defence; May 13, 1952, the
Honourable Stuart Garson, Minister of
Justice; and June 17, 1952, our colleague
the Honourable Gordon Bradley, who at that
time was Secretary of State.
Rule 18A reads:
When a bill or other matter relating to any
subject administered by a department of the Government of Canada bas originated in and is being
considered by the Senate or in Committee of the
Whole, a minister representing the department,
not being a member of the Senate, may enter the
Senate chamber, and, subject to the Rules, Orders,
Forms of Proceedings, and usages of the Senate,
take part in the debate.

The subject-matter to be discussed tomorrow is a motion in the following words:
That this house approve Canada's foreign policy,
with particular reference to its policies with respect
to the Middle East, Hungary and aid to underdeveloped countries.

Those

matters

are

administered

by

the

Department of External Affairs, of which
the Honourable Mr. Pearson is the minister.
I therefore feel that it is quite in order to
ask him to come to this chamber in accordance with the provisions of Rule 18A.
The honourable leader opposite has referred to the high standard of debate which
has been maintained in this chamber in the
past. Surely the Secretary of State for External Affairs, should he come here tomorrow,
would not lower that standard. I am sure
that anything he would say or any speech
lie would deliver would be up to the high
standard of speeches delivered in this chamber by honourable members and by ministers
who have come here on invitation in the past.
There is no obligation on any minister to
come. It is for the Secretary of State for
External Affairs to determine whether lie will
accept the invitation, but under this rule
I feel I should pass it along, as I have been
requested to do by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to ask the honourable

Leader of the Government two questions?
The motion of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina first appeared on our Order
Paper on March 19. I am wondering whether
the Secretary of State for External Affairs
has been acquainted for more than two days
with the view expressed in this motion. It is
rather difficult for me to understand why
the matter has been left to be decided by the
house until this date.
My second question is whether, on previous
occasions when ministers have come into this
chamber to explain legislation, the desirability
of having them come here was debated in this
house beforehand, or was the Leader of the
Government in the Senate responsible for
their presence here?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators, whether the contents of this motion
have been brought to the attention of the
Secretary of State for External Affairs, I
cannot say. I presume that at least the officials of his department read the Minutes of
the Proceedings of the Senate and would be
aware that the notice of motion is on the
Order Paper.
As to whether on previous occasions the
suggestion to invite a Government minister
to the house was made at the initiation of the
Leader of the Government in the Senate, I
cannot say, for I have not the copies of
Hansardbefore me. However, from my reading of the rule I cannot find that that is
necessary.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would the honourable
Leader of the Government not have to make
a motion that the Secretary of State for
External Affairs be invited here? There is
no rule that I am aware of that empowers
the Leader of the Government here to
invite anybody to address this chamber. I
should think the honourable leader would
bave to move that the house invite the minister. The matter would then be debatable
and honourable senators could vote against it
if they wished to.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am sure that on
previous occasions no motion to that effect
was made.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I can tell you what
happened.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I know there has not
been any such motion. Whether there was
any objection at any time,Hon. Mr. Haig: No, there was no objection.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -I cannot say. I have
not read Hansard to that extent, but I did go
into the matter sufficiently to ascertain the
instances on which departmental ministers
have been invited here.

APRIL 2. 1957
Hon. Cairine R. Wilson: Honourable senators, if my memory is correct, a number of
years ago complaints were made that the
Senate had not enough work to do, and it was
proposed at the final stage of one session that
arrangements be made at the next session to
have ministers of Government departments
explain legislation in this house. I understand that Mr. Chevrier was the first minister
to do so, and I am pretty sure this matter was
discussed in the chamber before be came here.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson) is
correct. It was discussed in the Senate before
an invitation was made, but there was no
motion.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, may I speak to this matter for a few
moments? Before doing so, I wish to express
my great respect for the desire of the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina, who
gave notice of the motion. I think it should
be remembered that in 1948, as a result of the
suggestion of the late Prime Minister
Mackenzie King, a committee of this house
was set up for the purpose of conferring with
him about certain measures that might
improve the usefulness of the Senate. I
believe the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), who is not
present today, was chairman of the committee.
After the conference with Mr. King the committee reported back to the Senate very
definitely that the only suggestion it considered to be feasible at that time was that
the rules be changed to provide that a minister
from the other house should come here when
invited to do so and present or explain bills
in which be was interested. I think that
is a fair statement of the background.
I am quite certain also, certainly to the
best of my recollection, that the initiative in
the instances that have already been cited was
taken by the honourable leader at that time
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), who is now the Speaker
of this house. I remember very well when
the Honourable Brooke Claxton came nere,
and the Honourable Lionel Chevrier, and
others. There certainly was very little discussion about it. I think the responsibility
for having them come here to explain certain
bills was taken by the leader.
With particular respect to this resolution,
I know it is a compliment to the Senate to
have a minister come here, but I do not think
it is complimentary to the Secretary of State
for External Affairs that he be brought here
at this late date in the session when a large
number of our members who would be interested and glad to engage in a debate on
foreign affairs in this house have gone home.
And with all due respect to the rest of us
82719-304

who are here, I feel that it is not fair to the
minister to ask him to come here and speak
to the Senate on Canada's foreign policy,
when we have not had a debate on the
subject in this house or any discussion in
The
our External Relations Committee.
Committee on External Relations is one of
the standing committees of this house. On
numerous occasions many of its members
have been actively engaged in the field of
external affairs and would have benefited
from a discussion with the minister or with
some members of his department who had
been at NATO or United Nations meetings.
I recall very well that at the time of the
adoption of the United Nations charter we
had several meetings of our External Relations Committee, at which the minister and
the deputy minister explained at some length
the results of the meeting in San Francisco
which launched the United Nations. Those
discussions resulted in debates in this bouse
afterwards. I think the Senate was able to
contribute fairly effectively to representations that were made afterwards at the
United Nations in New York, and elsewhere.
Honourable senators, I feel that this subject could have been much more usefully
presented if we had had some opportunity to
crystallize in our minds opinions bearing
upon important phases of our foreign policy.
We would have had such an opportunity if
the Committee on External Relations had
discussed the subject with the minister.
I feel that I must say-and I say it without
prejudice of any kind-that I have agreed
personally in every particular with the position which the Secretary of State for External
Affairs has taken in relation to the crisis in
the Near East. I think his position on behalf
of Canada, as expressed at New York, and
elsewhere, was the only one that could possibly have been taken; but that is another
matter.
Honourable senators, I should very much
like us to have had an opportunity to explore
this subject earlier in the session, when there
was lots of time to do so. This notice of
motion has been on the order paper since
March 19, and there has been no intimation
whatever that it would be discussed. Days
have gone by, and I have heard of no suggestion that the Secretary of State for External Affairs would be asked to come here or
wanted to come. In the circumstances, I
personally would like to have this matter
deferred until there is a better opportunity
for discussion.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, a
thought has just occurred to me, and I shall
express it with all respects and courtesy to

460

SENATE

the Leader of the Governrnent (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald). Apparentiy the rule which he
quoted says that the ministermray cornehere.
Exactly what does that mean? Upon whose
initiative would the minister corne? Could
he corne even without an invitation? And
if an invitation is necessary, is it within
the power of the leader or of any other
member to extend the invitation? With al
respect to the leader, it seerns to me that
the Senate itself should have sornething to
say as to whether a minister cornes here or
not. I should like to know if there is any
rule on that point.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The rule is not clear
to the effeet that an invitation has to be
tendered to a minister. In fact, the way I
read the rule, a minister can corne here
without an invitation. This is what the rule
says:

The report by the Roy ai Commission on
Broadeasting, known as tho Fowler report,
which bas just been issued, becomes very
timely. First, it re-endorses the publiclyowned C.B.C., and indicates that it is here
to stay. It has given the corporation a clear
bill off health. It was highly commended; it
came off well.
In the course of the Fowler report it indicates that the only means of retaining the

Canadien national identity in the face of a
tidal wave off American programns is through

tbe C.B.C.

Only C.B.C., as it is now operated,

can preserve a purely Canadian culture. It
will be costly, but to date it has been Worth

The Hon. the Speaker: The motion stands.

The findings of the Fowler Commission
becorne very important in the light of constant and unfair attacks on the C.B.C. by
private stations. The private stations, in turn,
got the back of the hand from the commission;
they got a real roasting and carne off very
badly. The Canadian Association of Radio
and Television Broadcasters was publicly rebuked for the overaîl poor job it had done
to date, and in particular for bucking the

UNI VERSITIES
PROPOSED FREE TIME ON CEG.. FOR WEEKLY
TELECAST-MOTION WITHDRAWN

The Senate resumed frorn Wednesday,
March 27, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Pouliot, seconded by Hon. Mrs.
Jodoin:
That, in the opinion of this House, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation should each week grant
a thirty minute f ree time for TV broadcasting to
the Canadian Universities.

Hon. David A. Croli: Honourable senators
before I commence my speech 1 should like
to mnake a confession. On various occasions
I have written to the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. usually to complain about something or other.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You xviii be on the list.
Hon. Mr. Croll: My only regret is that
I did not write often enough to compliment it

leading information on the true nature and
functions of the present system.

The Fowlor Commission had something
eise to say that should be kept in mind. They
said that a licence, a dise jockey and a cash
register aire not a radio station. lb is about
time such a statement was made. I hope it
xvili be kept in mmnd when television stations
are being allocated. The commission, in fact,
told the private operators to pull up their
socks or they soon won't have any socks. No
portion of the report gives the private operators any comfort or illusions. In one portion

of the report they were said to be giving

APRIL 2, 1957
programs of "stupefying mediocrity". Those
are the words that the commission attached
to the private broadcasters, not the C.B.C.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my honourable friend
also quote from the report when he says that
the private station operators must pull up
their socks?
Hon. Mr. Croll: No, that was my own
expression. I thought it was apt, and I am
glad my honourable friend's attention was
attracted by it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I was just wondering
whether the commission in its report had
used that expression.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The commission had much
less kind words to say about the private
broadcasters.
The report recommends that there be more
French language stations. Such a recommendation is long overdue. This is a bilingual
country. By that I do not mean that Quebec
is bilingual, but that all parts of the country
are bilingual. I must confess my own inadequacy in being unable to fully understand
or speak the French language. I was not able
to participate in the debate in this house last
Wednesday because I did not completely
understand what had been said by the two
preceding speakers who spoke in French. That
is my shortcoming. There is perhaps too little
that can be done for my generation, but I
think we should do everything in our power
to better equip the next generation for true
bilingualism, which is essential to true Canadianism. Those who have facility in the use
of both languages are better equipped to go
into the world of tomorrow and to reach
better understandings with people. French is
a universal language, and anyone having the
facility to speak and understand English and
French is well equipped for tomorrow. Our
people can best acquire that ability at an
early age. All our children should learn both
languages from infancy. Television and radio
will bring both languages into our homes.
The Fowler Commission points out that the
C.B.C. was too busy to regulate private
stations, and when it did regulate them it
leaned over backwards and showed great
reluctance to regulate. The report recommends
the appointment of a regulatory body. With
the implementation of that recommendation
we will have professional regulators whose job
it will be to regulate. Indeed, they will
regulate morning, noon and night. I can
already hear the screams of the private stations, even before regulators begin their work
of regulating.
At the present time churches of all denominations obtain both radio and television time,
and they make very good use of it. Public
service bodies also obtain time on the air,

and they too make good use of it. The time
has now come when universities should be
introduced to all of Canada through the
medium of some free time, both on television
and radio.
I support the motion of the honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot),
because it offers a worth-while opportunity
to the universities. They will make good use
of whatever time they are permitted to use.
It was indicated that the motion in its present
terms would not be most acceptable. I support the purpose of the motion, in whatever
terms it is phrased.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
if the honourable member from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) speaks now, he
will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: -I thank the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl)
for his support of this motion. The purpose
of the motion is obvious.
I would not speak today if my honourable
friend the Deputy Leader of the Government
in this house (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) had not
spoken as follows:
I am happy to see that our distinguished colleague
seems to have changed his mind, since he now
approves the steps we have taken.

He probably referred to what I had said
about the Canada Council. I have not changed
my mind at all as to what I said on February
27 about the Canada Council, but now conditions are different. That bill has been passed
by both bouses of Parliament, it bas received
the royal sanction, and we have to see what
we can do with it now that it is an accomplished fact. Considering legislation in progress before either house is very different
from considering the effect of the legislation
after it has been passed and sanctioned. That
is why I will say what was in my mind when
I sponsored this motion.
In the first place, the universities do not
always show a great deal of imagination, and
suggestions often have to be made to some
of them-I do not speak of all universities,
I speak of the average-about some things
to be done. In this case my suggestion would
be that for about a year the universities
do TV broadcasting. TV is a medium which
is used today by millions of people. If we
multiply the number of sets by five people,
it means that in this country there are at
least, I would say, eight or ten million people
who look at television programs. It is undoubtedly the best medium for informing
the Canadian people about what is being
done or accomplished by Canadian universities. In the first place, I should suggest

SENATE
that the first TV broadcast time should be
given to the universities themselves-I mean
to the council of each university-to inform
the Canadian people about the financial condition of each university. From the time when
Dr. Cyril James of McGill University made
his first lament about the need for money,
we have not been informed at all about the
financial status of the universities. That
information would be most interesting. Universities appeal to the Canadian people for
funds, for support of their drives in favour
of the Alma Mater, etc. Those drives may
serve a very useful purpose, but the Canadian people will be more generous if they
know what use is made of money contributed
by the Government of Canada, by the provincial Governments, by corporations and by
private individuals.
Naturally, the wisest men of long ago did
not live in mansions or castles. Socrates
lived in a cave. He was a wise man and a
great philosopher. Diogenes lived a very
practical life; he lived in a barrel, and he
carried a light in his hand to help him in
his search for another man equal to himself.
But today conditions are different, and I
wonder if the expenditures on immense and
expensive buildings for the universities are
wise or not. I am not passing judgment; I
just put the question.
And then, I am not satisfied to live in a
cloud of mystery. That mystery should disappear. The universities should be frank
with the Canadian people. They should tell
us the size of their endowments and the
amount of their revenues, and what use they
make of subsidies and donations, public and
private. It is only fair that that information
be made known, in the interests of the universities themselves, of the Governments concerned, of the Canadian people and of the
students. So I suggest that the first broadcast
over the C.B.C. should be granted by the
corporation to the universities free of charge,
by way of a distribution of television time
over a period of approximately six months.
But in view of what has been stated indirectly by the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) concerning the Arts Council, I would say that,
although my motion was justified before the
Canada Council Bill received royal sanction,
the council, which has been richly endowed,
should pay for broadcasts by the universities
to explain their position to the public and
to the taxpayers, who are much interested
in knowing what use has been made of Government subsidies to the universities, as well
as of private subscriptions.
This, honourable senators, covers the first
part of my argument. I withdraw that part
of the motion which concerns the programs
to be followed by the universities themselves

in the first six months. There are 21 Canadian universities. However, the Canada Council is rich; it can afford to pay; and there
is no reason why more time should not be
provided for university spokesmen if they
ask for it. I am glad that our distinguished
colleague from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
has come in. A moment ago I spoke of Dr.
Cyril James's lament concerning lack of funds.
He was the first to raise his voice in this
matter.
The second part of my argument concerns
television broadcasts by the students themselves, to enable the Canadian people to
realize what kind of education is being provided by the universities. It should be open
to boy and girl students to discuss matters
which are in the public mind. The first broadcast should be by way of a forum on the
topic of the importance of spiritual values in
public and private life. Then the Canadian
people will see not only what kind of factual
education is provided, but what characterforming material is given to youths in the
Canadian universities. This is the first point,
and a very important one. I know the youth
of our country. I like them; I have respect
for them. I find that they are as good as if
not better than Canada's youth of any previous generation, because nowadays students
have more opportunities to make fools of
themselves, and when these are resisted it
shows that they are not only receiving a
good education but that they have a good
"formation". Although today, perhaps, education is less solid than it was in former years,
its scope is wider, and young men and girls
today are able to discuss astonishingly well
and intelligently problems of importance and
interest concerning the future of this country.
So, I repeat, the first television broadcast by
Canadian university students should deal with
spiritual values; and it should be open to
students of various religious denominations,
because spiritual values exist in them all.
By this means Canadian people would be able
to judge of the progress made by our youth.
The second broadcast should be about
citizenship. In any country an individual is
born a citizen before being christened and
becoming a member of any religion. So, next
to spiritual values there are natural values
that count; and it will be most interesting to
have a television forum of students discussing
Canadian citizenship. In this country we have
a double citizenship. We are British subjects
as well as being Canadian citizens, since the
adoption of the law of citizenship. Would it
not be interesting to have a forum of young
men and women discussing whether we should
have only one citizenship or two? I do not
express any personal opinion. I put the question and I would like to have it answered both
ways by intelligent young people of this

APRIL 2, 1957
country. There are many other subjects that
should be considered with personal conviction
and tolerance. These may seem to disagree
but they really do not, for although one has
personal convictions he should show tolerance
for the views of others. This again is a vast
subject of tremendous interest to this country,
where two official languages are spoken and
where we meet so many new Canadians who
have made Canada their own country.
Who is a good Canadian citizen? I said
on numerous occasions in the House of
Commons that it is not necessary for a person to be born in Canada to be a true Canadian. A true Canadian is a man or woman
who, having been born anywhere, has made
Canada his or her own country, a country he
or she likes better than any other in the
world. It is not exclusive, of course. We
may love other countries, but our first love
should be given to Canada. This is another
matter that should be considered, and it
would be most interesting to have young
men and women who receive their formation
in Canadian universities to give their
opinion about this very problem which concerns the present and future unity of this
country.
There are many other subjects that could
be dealt with. We are not eternal. I am
glad to belong to this fine association of
distinguished men and women who are called
the Senate of Canada, but we cannot expect
to live for ever. Others will take our places,
and it is precisely those who will come after
us who must inform us about their own
personal views. All those broadcasts should
be free from intervention. Young people
should not have their speeches prepared
by others.
They can make their own
speeches and hold their own places in a
forum. It would be more interesting to
know from them what they think about so
many national issues. They could discuss
trade matters or Canada's relations with other
countries. The standing of Canada among
the world's nations has never been so high
as it is now. The honourable senator from
Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron) told us that when
he went to the Antipodes he met people from
all over the world who told him how highly
Canada is regarded so far away from home.
We owe that standing to somebody. We
owe it to the present Government, to the
fairness of the members of the Government
and that of their supporters, and also to the
fairness of the Opposition, as I judge by
the stand taken by our colleagues who form
the Opposition in this chamber.
All these matters deserve to be discussed,
not in camera but openly and publicly, so that
we may know the opinion of our youth.

There is nothing more interesting than to
talk seriously with young university students.
It is illuminating, and very often we hear
more from them than from their professors.
That is something.
What progress has the idea of sovereignty
made in the minds of young Canadians? This
is a great question mark. We will realize
this one day when we have a national
emblem to represent Canada throughout the
whole world, a national emblem that will be
enthusiastically accepted by all without
hesitation. It will be placed in our churches
as well as in public squares and on public
buildings and private homes.
It will
represent Canada itself amongst all the
nations of the world.
I remember with emotion the splendid
speech made by our honourable colleague
from De Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr. Fournier)
last session about the very same matter. The
idea goes on. I am not against the Union
Jack at all. I have taken an oath of allegiance to our sovereign and I stand by it.
Honourable senators, as I have said in many
parts of this country, in the province of
Ontario as well as in the province of Quebec,
if we are to have the Union Jack then let
us have it full-sized, not a minimized Union
Jack in the upper left corner of the red
ensign. Let us have it full-sized, with the
crosses of the three patron saints of the
United Kingdom: the Cross of St. Patrick
for Ireland, the Cross of St. Andrew for
Scotland, and the Cross of St. George for
England. It is a beautiful flag. But let
us not forget that in this honourable chamber
the late King George VI spoke of his realm
of Canada. He was King of the United Kingdom, on the one hand, and of Canada, on
the other hand, as Henry the Fourth was
King of France, on the one hand, and of
Navarre, on the other hand. I am ready,
I am satisfied, to have to keep the Union
Jack, full-sized, as a sign of colonialism. But
I do not want to see the red ensign, for
another reason, and a very good one. In
the red ensign the Union Jack is minimized.
Also, honourable senators, how can you see
the emblems that are on the red ensign that
flies from the tower of this building? No
person can see them. There are lions six
inches long. How can you see them 350 feet
in the air? How can you see lions that look
like squirrels? And how can you see the
harp? It is most ridiculous.
At the next session I will ask for a complete description of all the emblems that
are engraved on the letter-head of the Senate
stationery. The lions, the harp, the maple
leaves, are so small that they are like tiny

flags, one flying toward the east, and the

me of a drawing that I made when I was
a little boy, of a ship with two flags. One
flag was on one side, the other was on the
other side. My uncle said to me, "When the
wind blows it always blows on the same
side." But if one looks at the emblems on
the stationery that we have in our desks he
will see that I do not exaggerate-they are
very small, and one flag points west, while
the other points east. "East is east, and
west is west, and never the twain shall meet."
Honourable senators, I am only quoting Kipling. I have expressed no personal opinion
about it; I am making suggestions.

BUFFALO AND FORT ERIE PUBLIC

relates to the Peace Bridge between Fort Erie
in Ontario, and Buffalo in the United States.
Many of us have crossed it from time to
time when going to or coming from the
United States. The building of the bridge
was conceived in about the year 1914, by
prominent citizens in both Canada and the
United States, and the suggestion was that a
bridge should be built across the Niagara
River at these two points to commemorate a

taking the directors subscribed to $50,000 of

up to $50,000 of capital stock with the limitation that it should be retired at par, and

APRIL 2, 1957
that while it was outstanding it should receive a rate of interest no higher than 7 per
cent. There was no promoter's stock in
connection with this company or the building
of the bridge.
The public subscribed for approximately
$5 million worth of bonds, of which $3,500,000
were 7 per cent first mortgage bonds,
and $1,500,000 were 8 per cent debenture
bonds. While these rates seem high today,
they were the prevailing rates at that time,
The first plans submitted were for a lowlevel bridge, but after negotiations with the
United States it was decided to build a
high-level bridge. Construction of the bridge
was begun in 1925 and completed on June
2, 1927. The bridge was dedicated on August
8, 1927 by distinguished persons from Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) was one of the distinguished
persons from Canada, who attended the dedication ceremonies.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: From the opening
of the bridge, in 1927, until 1929 the traffic
over it was much greater than had been anticipated, but after 1929 there was a sharp
drop in traffic and it was impossible to
retire the bonds in accordance with the
original intention of the directors. This was
due to some extent to the high rate of interest, and as I have said, to the decreased
traffic. To meet this situation the company
in 1934 applied to the New York Legislature
and the Parliament of Canada, for a private
bill to establish with the State of New York
a bridge authority for the purpose of acquiring, holding and managing, on behalf
of His Majesty in the right of Canada, the
property and assets within Canada of the
Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Company, and to empower the company to convey
to the new bridge authority all its property
and assets within Canada. In the petition
which was presented to Parliament at that
time the company requested appropriate action on the part of Parliament for the
purpose of refinancing, which would permit
considerable reduction of fixed charges and
subsequently further reduction of tolls. It was
pointed out that if this was not done "the
beneficial and reversionary interest of Canada would be imperilled".
The bill was passed by Parliament and
became Chapter 63, 24-25, Geo. V. Honourable senators, that is the act which this
bill proposes to amend.

The act contains a beneficial or reversionary clause, being clause 10, which reads
as follows:
When all of the bonds issued by the Bridge
Authority shall have been paid in full, or shall have
otherwise been discharged, the powers, jurisdictions and duties of the Bridge Authority shall cease
and the property acquired and held by it within
the dominion of Canada shall become the property
of His Majesty the King and shall be under such
jurisdiction, authority or agency as the Governor
in Council shall designate.

The New York act of 1934 contains a similar
clause.
Honourable senators will be pleased to
know that in recent years the Bridge
Authority appears to have achieved a very
healthy financial position, with gross revenues
averaging about $1,250,000 per annum, and net
revenues averaging
slightly more than
$500,000 per annum. This resulted in the
accumulation of a surplus at the end of 1954
of approximately $5,500,000. That surplus has
now been spent. Honourable senators will
understand that with the increased traffic it
was necessary to provide better facilities at
each end of the bridge. Large custom houses,
bus terminals and such facilities have been
provided, and the surplus was used to make
these impr.ovements.
I believe honourable senators would be
interested in a table which I have before me,
which gives a comparative picture of income
and expenses of the Bridge Authority for the
years 1947 to 1955. With the consent of the
house, I will have this table placed on
Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will pass the table to
Hansard.

However, in view of the attitude of the

may not think it necessary that the bill
should be dealt with by a committee.
In conclusion, I think I should say a word
in acknowledgment of the spirit of co-operation which has prevailed at all meetings of
the joint committee. The problem could have
been a very difficult one, and probably it
would have been if our neighbours were some
other countries. I cannot speak too highly of
the attitude which was taken by the United
States' representatives when they visited us
or when our representatives visited them.
They showed a wonderful spirit of co-operation and friendship, and proved anew that
they are, as they have always been, good
neighbours.
I have no hesitation in asking the house
to pass this bill.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, as
one who resides in Ontario at no great
distance from the location of this bridge, I,
perhaps, have a greater personal interest in
it than have some other members here. I
well remember when the bridge was built. As
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) said in reply to an undertoned
remark of my own, I had the pleasure of
being present when the bridge was opened.
Perhaps it is worth mentioning that it was
the then Prince of Wales who advanced to
the middle of the bridge and cut the ribbon
when, with the usual ceremonies, the bridge
was declared open. I had the impression at
that time that after the outstanding obligations had been paid off the bridge was to be
toll-free. I may have been wrong, and I am
not objecting now to the toll provisions,
because I recognize it is important that the
Authority shall have at least enough revenue
to provide for maintenance and, perhaps, some
extensions.
I am glad that Canada's representation on
the board of management is to be equal to
that of the United States. To this day I have
not understood why the Canadian Government, which accepted half the responsibility
and was entitled to half the profits, was
restricted to a membership of three in a commission of nine. We seem to have got rid of
a national inferiority complex in that we are
now insisting upon, and apparently receiving,
equal representation on this new body.
In conclusion, to give credit where credit
is due, I think I should say that the agitation
for the building of this bridge was initiated

and maintained for some years by the then
member of the House of Commons for Welland, the late Mr. German.
He worked
literally night and day to promote the project,
and finally achieved his purpose. The bridge
has been immensely useful, mainly no doubt
to the people of western Ontario. I cross it
many times a year. I do not think that the
tolls have been excessive. The management
has been efficient. It is a pleasure to know
that not only has a great service been given
to the people of Canada, particularly Ontario,
and residents of the United States, but that
the enterprise has shown what a sprit of
co-operation between nations-a spirit which
might well be emulated by other countriescan do.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, as a
similar bill has been passed in the United
States, I do not think this bill should be sent
to committee. If it were altered, the New
York State Legislature would have to change
its statute. This would create an impossible
situation. I suggest that, after the able explanation we have just heard, the house
should pass the bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Just before the bill
is given second reading may I say that I
am sure we all appreciate the attitude taken
by the Canadian officials from both the Department of Finance and the Department of
External Affairs. They had a difficult task,
and I am sure honourable senators will agree
that they performed it in an admirable
manner.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Some Hon. Senators: New.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If honourable senators consent to having the bill read a third
time now I would take this opportunity to
reply to the question as to the names of the
Canadian members on the board. I do not
have their initials, but their names are Mr.
Kaumeyer, Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Teal. I
understand these men are from the Niagara
district. When this bill is passed two other
Canadian members will be appointed.
Honourable senators, I move the third
reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

I do not always agree with the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity, but I have great
admiration for him. The amount of work that
his committee was able to get through in
this short session is very remarkable. I sincerely hope that he will soon be back with
us, fully restored to health.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills

Hon. Mr. Kinley: With the consent of the
Senate, I move the third readings now.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
consent to these bills being read the third
time now. May I take this opportunity to
express my regret, and I am sure that of
all members of this house, at the absence of
the Chairman of the Divorce Committee, the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), owing to illness. He
always enjoyed particularly the last part of a
session, for he then had occasion to present
the committee's final report for the session
and to tell about its work. I join wholeheartedly in what the honourable Leader of
the Governrment (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said
yesterday about the work done by the committee this session under the able chairmanship of the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity.

CANADA'S FOREIGN POLICY
RESOLUTION OF APPROVALDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. David A. Croll moved, pursuant to
notice:
That this house approve Canada's foreign policy,
with particular reference to its policies with respect
to the Middle East, Hungary' and aid to underdeveloped countries.

He said: Honourable senators, I regret to

advise the house that the Honourable the
Minister of External Affairs cannot be here
today to participate in this debate. On the
other hand I wish to express my own appreciation to the Leader of the House (Hon. Mr.

Macdonald) for the firm stand that he took
yesterday when the purpose and the intent
of rule 18A was questioned. To one who is
new in the Senate it was very heartening to
receive that support from the leader. My
own impression was that the application of
that rule was intended to stimulate the usefulness of this bouse. The effect of yesterday's debate, I think, will not be lost on the
country and may yet have a useful effect on
the functioning of this bouse.
My original intention was to speak on
the economic aspects of foreign affairs and
leave the political part to the Secretary of
State for External Affairs. I shall now speak
to both aspects, and it is going to take me a
little while longer than I had anticipated.
Thus I ask for your indulgence. I promise
one thing, that I will finish in time so that
members of this house may be able to join
with the delegation that is coming to town
from Montreal in a special "rock'n'roll" train
to see and hear a character called Elvis
Presley who will be holding forth at the
Auditorium.
I was a delegate to the eleventh session of
the United Nations General Assembly at New
York which has just concluded its deliberations. The session lasted for three and a half
months. It was interesting, it was exciting,
educating and expensive. Many matters of
import were discussed and remained unsolved.
Uppermost of course were the Middle East
question, the Arab-Israeli differences, Hun-

SENATE
gary's fight for freedom and the flight from
communism. There were also the matters of
Cyprus, Algeria and Kashmir, as well as assistance to underdeveloped countries. Canada
played its part. It was extremely well represented by its delegation, which included the
permanent member, Dr. R. A. MacKay, and
had some very able, knowledgeable and intelligent assistants who acted as advisers to the
delegation. Canada's position at the United
Nations is very high, and the delegation and
the advisers maintained that high level. Foremost, of course, was the Secretary of State
for External Affairs, who by any measure is
by far the ablest secretary of state in the
world today.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Croll: He was consulted by all
heads of delegations. His counsel was sought,
his advice was taken, and he exuded leadership. He established and maintained Canada's high reputation in world affairs to the
point where this country, once considered
the top of the middle powers, is now one of
the smaller of the greater powers. His contribution has been constructive and dynamic;
and if a historian today were to assess the
post-war record of the world he would have
to place Canada in first position.
I did not become an expert on world
affairs in three and a half months, nor do I
set myself up as one. Long before I came
here or to the House of Commons I had a
vital and consuming interest in foreign
affairs, and during all my years in the other
house I was a member of the Committee on
External Affairs and active in its deliberations. That, I repeat, does not constitute me
an expert. However, I think I can make a
contribution.
Canada's foreign policy, operated within
the framework of the United Nations, the
Commonwealth and NATO, has found approval in the western world, and should be
endorsed by Canadians. That is why I bring
the subject before this deliberative house at
this time. The policy has been constant in
its purposes, wise in its application, and
directed to the interest of peace. In many
ways it has given leadership.
I quote this editorial comment from the
New York Times of March 2 of this year:
This compromise marks a triumph of statesmanship and diplomacy for which credit and thanks
is due to all who made it possible.

And further:
. . . but by no means least, Canada's Mr. Pearson,
who did much to correct the balance of right and
wrong as between Egypt and Israel.

From the New York Times of March 26 I
quote the following with reference to the
recent
conference
at
Tucker's
Town,
Bermuda:
For their part members of the British delegation
went out of their way to say that there was great
appreciation in Britain for all that Lester B.
Pearson, Secretary of State for External Affairs,
had done for the Mother Country in the United
Nations . . .

The Ottawa Journal of March 18,

1957,

quoted the Daily Telegraph of London, as
follows:
No country has grown in international stature
so swiftly and markedly as Canada has donc during
the Middle East crisis. Her role in the United
Nations has been of dual importance. At the outset
she assumed there a Commonwealth leadership
that Britain, as a "party in the dock", was

subsequent shaping of United Nations policy Canada tried to temper with realism the legalism
into which the Assembly was forced by AfroAsian rigidity and United States timidity. Hers
has often been a lonely voice of reason, crying out
in a wilderness of fantasy, "expectations" and
"assumptions".

And still quoting from the London Times,
I read from the Montreal Gazette of March 27:
Canada speaks with a new authority on Middle
East problems as a result of her active role in the
work of the United Nations Emergency Force.

These writers whom I have quoted are not
Canadian. Their comments show how other
people see us.
The alternative to our present policy is
isolationism or power politics. We have discarded both as unacceptable and unsuitable.
In bringing judgment to bear on our policy,
we must ask ourselves, "Is Canada doing
everything that she can?" Are we doing all
that is possible to correct the situation, keeping in mind that we didn't create or contribute to the present unsettled world situation?
It is true to say that we are nobody's
chore-boy, nor are we satellites.
It is
equally true that we have come forward with
the only solution. The Honourable Lester
B. Pearson, Secretary of State for External
Affairs, is the architect of the United Nations
Emergency Force, which was a bold and
imaginative experiment and appears to have
worked.
It is equally true that Canada
moved the resolution under the heading of
"Uniting for Peace", whereby the General
Assembly and not the Security Council could
deal with urgent matters. This was done in
order to avoid the veto which belongs to
members of the Security Council. In so far
as the United Nations Force is concerned,
it is taking shape, sentiment for it grows,
and it will be on a permanent basis, doing
fire brigade duty, putting out fires of anger
which might lead to a holocaust.

APRIL 3, 1957
I do not overstate when I say that the
world has not received a thorough briefing on
all the aspects of the Israeli case and it is
increasingly understood. The great error was
that we treated Nasser as an innocent victim
of aggression. The world today realizes that
Israel was not the aggressor-the provocative
aggressor was Egypt; and now from humiliation of defeat by Israel, Nasser is attempting
to win a personal victory.
Britain and France departed because of
the United Nations. Israel, whose very existence was threatened, departed on certain "assumptions", "assurances", "understandings"
and "expectations". What were these? They
are very important in attempting to understand what is going on there now. They were
put to the assembly in a statement by the Foreign Secretary of Israel on March 1.
One was that the Gulf of Aqaba and the
Straits of Tiran would be considered as
international waters, and that there would
be free and innocent passage for all shipping
through them, and that the United States
Government would support this proposition.
Second, that the United Nations Emergency
Force would move into the Sharm alShaikh area, and not move out of that area
until the matter had been considered by the
Assembly Advisory Committee of seven.
Then with respect to Gaza which was the
dangerous point at the moment, Mrs. Meir, the
Foreign Secretary of Israel, in a speech before the Plenary Assembly laid down these
assumptions:
(a) That on its withdrawal the United
Nations forces will be deployed in Gaza .and
that the take-over of Gaza from the military
and civil control of Israel will be exclusively
by the United Nations Emergency Force.
(b) It is further Israel's expectation that the
United Nations will be the agency to be
utilized for carrying out the functions enumerated by the Secretary-General, namely:
safeguarding life and property in the area by
providing efficient and effective police protection; as will guarantee good civilian administration;
as will assure maximum
assistance to the United Nations refugee
program; and as will protect and foster the
economic development of the territory and
its people.
(c) It is further Israel's expectation that
the aforementioned responsibility of the
United Nations in the administration of Gaza
will be maintained for a transitory period
from the take-over until there is a peace
settlement, to be sought as rapidly as possible,
or a definite agreement on the future of the
Gaza strip.

She concluded by saying:
It is the position of Israel that If conditions are
created in the Gaza strip which indicate a return
to the conditions of deterioration which existed
previously Israel would reserve its freedom to act
and defend its rights.

These were the assumptions and expectations laid down by the Government of
Israel on the basis of which they withdrew.
The Canadian position with regard to this
statement of Mrs. Meir was that, as we
understood them, her assumptions and expectations were reasonable.
The United States position, as stated by
Henry Cabot Lodge, the chief American delegate, was as follows:
For the most part the declarations constitute, as
we understand it, the restatements of what bas
already been said by this Assembly or by the
Secretary-General in his reports, of hopes and
expectations which seem to us not unreasonable in
the light of the prior actions of this Assembly.

This statement of Mr. Lodge was followed
by an extremely important communication of
March 2 from President Eisenhower to the
Prime Minister of Israel which may have
been decisive in bringing about the withdrawal. I quote from that letter of President Eisenhower, as follows:
It has always
ment . . .

been the view

of this Govern-

meaning the American Government.
that after the withdrawal there should be a
united effort by ail of the nations to bring about
conditions in the area

that is, the Gaza area.
more stable, more tranquil and more conducive
to the general welfare than those which existed
heretofore.

Then he went on to say:
I believe that it is reasonable to entertain such
hopes and expectations and I want you to know
that the United States, as a friend of ail of the
countries of the area and as a loyal member of
the United Nations, wiU seek that such hopes
prove not to be in vain.

That was followed by a televised speech
by the President of the United States, which
most of you heard. Well, what else could
Israel do? She had the word of the President of the United States. Furthermore,
when she agreed to withdraw her forces it
was on the unequivocal understanding that
the world community, headed by the United
States, would protect her legitimate rights.
She now holds an international commitment
which the world cannot lightly disregard.
Israel yielded Gaza and Sharm al-Shaikh with
deep misgivings under pressure from the
United States and the United Nations on
the following conditions:
(1) That Israeli ships would have free and
innocent passage through the Straits of Tiran
and the Gulf of Aqaba, which would be
considered international waters.

provocation classed together. The United
Nations, on the other hand, liquidated intervention before causes for provocation were
dealt with.
Israel's withdrawal bas put her morally and
politically in the right. We must ask ourselves, can we afford to put her back into the
lacerating conditions which preceded the
intervention?
So long as the Arab leaders say that Israel
must be driven into the sea, there will be no
order in the Middle East. Yet if Israel were
wiped out, not a single Arab would benefit.
Arab leaders are using the Israelis as
whipping boys. They feel they have to give
the people something to be good and mad
at or else they will be good and mad at the
Arab leaders. They might well better attack
poverty and ignorance, of which they
possess even more than oil.
Israel withdrew, as I have already indicated, on certain understandings, but she
might better have said that she would
evacuate Gaza and Sharm al-Shaikh when
Nasser restores the Suez to its legal status;
when Russia starts withdrawing troops from
Hungary; the moment India starts restoring
the legal status of Kashmir.
It comes badly from India to lead a bitter
attack on Israel, a tiny country desperately
trying to survive, mainly because India
wished to curry favour with her Arab friends
by declaring that Aqaba was not international water. We were led to expect
better from her.
There was some talk at the United Nations
about sanctions. The Canadian Government
was always opposed to sanctions. The
Canadian Government agreed that Israel

pledges and assurances of future Egyptian
principles of justice.

on at least two occasions, to have the United
Nations spell things out. He argued that United Nations troops on her territory is

(2) That the United Nations should take
military and civil control of Gaza so that
the Gaza strip would not be used as a base
for Egyptian fedayeen guerrilla raids.
That is what we in Canada understood;
that is what the world understood. Despite
these assurances, Israel bas been doublecrossed. Two days after the withdrawal the
world saw that what Israel had said was true.
Nasser bas ditched the assumptions of Israel
and the hopes of the United States and the
United Nations, and now we find the United
Nations' troops in the Gaza strip not administering the area but shielding Egypt, acting
as a buffer between Israel and Egypt.
Without consulting the United Nations, in
disregard of previous understandings and
pleas to go slow, the United Nations force
has been ousted from the administration of
Gaza. Israel expelled Egypt from Gaza, and
the United Nations bas now restored them to
their former position. What irony! What
tragedy!
As a result of all this, Israel feels badly
let down. She surrendered her natural
defences to depend on people who have failed
her in the past, and it appears even now
that the United Nations condones sin only
if the sinner is too strong to be chastised,
too tough, or is a sacred cow.
Israel does not ask to enjoy the fruits of
victory, but it follows that she should not
be asked to return to the status quo ante.
The only reward she asks is the establishment of conditions which would prevent
border warfare and the violation of international maritime law; and for that she is
relying, to quote the words of the President
of the United States, on:

APRIL 3, 1957
function to perform within Israel. Israel
maintains that the United Nations' force
would be far less efficient than their own
soldiers in stopping guerrilla raids. All it
would do would be to advance the guerrilla
borderline a mile or so beyond where it is
at the present time. Israel says that she
has about 20 villages whose farms are a
potential no man's land, who would be
dependent on the United Nations' force for
defence. That is to say, Israel can do that
job better than anybody else can at the
present time.
Thus we find ourselves in the position that
the world has learned little from past experiences. We did not stand up to the big
bully, Hitler. We are not standing up to
the little bully, Nasser. The time has come
when Nasser, who is not a conqueror but
is acting like one, must be checked.
It is time we began to talk of sanctions
against Egypt, boycotting the canal and providing alternative routes to the Suez. Appeasing Nasser will not pay off. We shall receive
only the appeaser's reward, the bitter taste
of humiliation. We can never again rely on
the Suez Canal for fuel which lights our
cities, heats our homes and powers our
industries. We must for our own safety
by-pass the Suez.
To date, this much has been resolved in
the Middle East: there is greater understanding of Israel's position and Nasser's intransigence. If it becomes necessary for Israel
to blast her way in and out of the Straits of
Tiran and the Bay of Aqaba, the world will
cheer. If it becomes essential to re-occupy
Gaza, the world will applaud.
It is our fervent hope that neither of these
will become necessary or take place. The
world has given Israel the green light for
innocent passage through the Gulf of Aqaba,
security of frontiers, and freedom from
fedayeen raids in Gaza.
We are a small nation and have a deep
and abiding feeling for other small nations.
Down deep we have a feeling of admiration
for Israel, who stood up to friends and foes
alike. The western world is running out of
patience. The time for a show-down with
Nasser is overdue. We must ask ourselves,
are we underestimating Nasser? How did we
ever get ourselves into this mess? I think
we have to come to the conclusion that this
violent truce which we have at the present
time cannot endure. What the solution is,
I cannot say. I was somewhat struck when
I picked up the Montreal Gazette this morning and learned that Secretary of State Dulles
gave notice that:
Western confidence in Egypt's word might hinge
on whether President Nasser accepts United States
revisions in the Egyptian plan for operating the
Suez Canal.

To have the Secretary of State of the
United States raise the question of confidence
in Nasser's words at this stage shakes me,
if it does not shake anybody else in this house.
I thought we had come to the conclusion
a long time ago that we could not take his
word for anything, and could not accept his
undertaking. It is statements like that which
make it difficult to understand what is really
going on in the world today, and who is
handling world affairs and how effectively.
Honourable senators, the second portion of

from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) was the
representative when he was at the United
Nations, and the honourable senator from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) was on the committee when he was a delegate. This committee deals with the social and economic
problems at the United Nations.
What I have to say on help to underdeveloped countries is neither dramatic nor
sensational but a worthy record of steady and
clarified progress in providing human goodwill. Our economic aid prograrn has been
successful because we gave generously without strings attached. It was a giving from
the warmth of the heart and not by way of
charity. We had no military pacts attached
to our aid.
We paid in membership fees to the United
Nations administration budget $1,600,000,
which is equivalent to 3.6 per cent of the
total. In economic aid we usually give 6 per
cent of the American contribution. Specialized
agencies last year cost us $1,400,000. These
agencies are devoted to better social conditions and higher living standards in underdeveloped countries. We gave $650,000 to
UNICEF, and since 1947 we have given
$10,675,000 to the same fund. Private campaigns collect another $1,500,000, and I am
told by the people who collect for UNICEF
that this money comes in in dimes, quarters
and half-dollars quite voluntarily and from
many parts of the country. To the Palestine
refugees we give a half-million dollars yearly.
Hungarian relief costs us $1 million. Technical aid since 1950 costs us $7.2 million,
which is the third largest contribution and
the largest on a per capita basis. Our total
giving in 1956 to United Nations agencies
was $6 million.
Whereas in other countries foreign aid has
been referred to as "Operation Rat-hole", and
there has been much sound and fury in
opposition, our country bas taken the opposite
view-we don't think we have been doing
enough.

SENATE
Today the slumbering nations in the East
and Far East have awakened to self-government. They demand not only freedom, but
more food and better health services, and the
right to learn how to read and write. The
need is there. If we do not meet it the
Soviets will do so and, by sucking these
nations into the role of satellites, make for
us a shrinking world.
We do not attempt to buy friendship and
allegiance with dollars. Bought friends are
not too trustworthy. Under our plan each
nation must accept responsibility for planning
and administering its own development program, even though in some instances help
may be necessary in planning and administration. Donor countries merely supervise, to
protect their own contributions, to see that
the project is carried on as agreed.
We give some assistance bilaterally, through
the Colombo Plan. We give some multilaterally, through the United Nations. Circumstances decide each case. Under the
Colombo Plan we pay particular attention
to India, Pakistan and Ceylon. We have
always considered the Colombo Plan an
investment in peace and we are spending
$34 million annually, not as a handout, but
in capital goods like machinery, power plants
and that sort of thing. For example, in
India we are building an atomic reactor and
a hydro plant; in Pakistan we are building
a hydro plant and doing an aerial survey; to
Ceylon we are supplying diesel engines. These
are being manufactured in the city of Kingston, the home town of an honourable senator
(Hon. Mr. Davies). And we are putting up
a fish cold storage plant. The Colombo Plan
has been a significant contribution to the
economic welfare of South and South-East
Asia.
There are at least three valid reasons why
we should co-operate with these Asian countries in such mutual aid. One, of course, is
the sincere humanitarian desire on the part
of those who are materially well favoured
to help those who are not. The second is
the recognition that it is in our own interest
to live in a world where prosperity is more
universal; that the more quickly other peoples'
standard of living can rise, the better off
all of us will be. The third is the hope
that economic aid can serve the cause of
peace; because the stronger any free nation
is, the less chance there is of aggression and
war.
I repeat, it is important to guard against
the idea that we can purchase or should try
to purchase allies in that part of the world.
Communist propaganda is insinuating this
interpretation throughout Asia, and it is important to give it the lie. The East will

not become a mercenary in our ranks. It
would be deplorable if Asians believed that
Westerners had insulted their dignity, or
misread their independence, by entertaining
such notions. If we of the West provide
material aid only or primarily for cold-war
motives, we are likely to fail in achieving
any good and permanent result. If, however,
we give help out of a recognition of brotherhood with our free Asian neighbours, we
shall succeed in improving the political atmosphere as well as in promoting human
welfare. Good will is contagious.
We in the West have no wish to compete
with communist dictatorial régimes in their
offers, some of them cynically hypocritical, of
material assistance, dictated by political considerations arising out of communist policy
which in the long run can mean only trouble
for those peoples who come under its influence. We can, however, successfully compete with them-if we wish to, as we should
-in sympathetic understanding and goodneighbourliness as the basis for mutual aid.
These qualities are more important even than
the material value of such aid. We in the
Western countries would be well advised to
remember this as we face the problems of
competitive co-existence and the contest for
the hearts and souls and the friendship of the
uncommitted millions of Asia.
There are three main permanent organs of
the United Nations-the Security Council, the
Trusteeship Council, and the Economic and
Social Council. Canada is a member of the
Economic and Social Council, which is regarded as a specialized body of the United
Nations responsible for economic and social
matters. Canada bas always taken an active
and constructive interest in the economic subjects discussed in the United Nations. In the
early sessions of the United Nations, Canada,
to a large extent, was responsible for laying
the groundwork for its activity in the economic field, because it early recognized the
importance which the United Nations could
play in the economic field and bas been
among the leaders in contributing in a practical financial manner to the U. N. economic
program.
Let us take some specific examples. Canada
has so far contributed $72 million to the
United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency
and about $9 million to the United Nations
extended program of technical assistance.
Canada is regarded as a very influential
middle power whose views are treated with
respect and confidence, and there are occasions when the Canadian delegation is especially qualified for initiating or supporting
some measures in the General Assembly.

APRIL 3, 1957
The nature of the Canadian economy and
the political position of Canada make it necessary sometimes to assume an active and
responsible role which is always closely related to the position of our friends and allies,
particularly the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the United States of America;
but we also work very closely with some of
the European delegations and have particularly close and friendly contacts with delegations from the less-developed countries,
especially those countries in which we are
undertaking important programs of economic
assistance.
The discussions on economics are usually
freer from political difficulties than are discussions in most other committees, but political realities do underlie the decisions of the
Economic Committee. None the less, most of
the decisions reached were unanimous except
where major differences of opinions could not
be reconciled-and these were very few.
Let me just indicate some of the matters
that were dealt with at the last session of the
United Nations. One was United Nations
Korean reconstruction. This echoed the
actions of the U.N. after the Korean war. The
agency was established to assist in the rehabilitation of a war-devastated economy.
This work is now completed. It was well
done.
In the field of technical assistance much is
accomplished. In a great measure this is due
to a distinguished Canadian, Dr. Hugh
Keenleyside, who served as Director General
of the U.N. Technical Assistance Administration. One of the serious matters was the
utilization of currency in order to assure that
no country would attach conditions to the
contribution that would serve that country's
national political interest; that is, to serve the
interest of the contributor rather than the
overall interest. This program is one of the
more successful ones and is genuinely
multilateral.
In the field of public administration it was
indicated that the economic difficulties of
many of the less-developed countries arise to
a very great extent from the lack of sufficient
trained and experienced administrators. The
United Nations extended its efforts to promote the training of specialists who could
subsequently play major roles in their country's administration. Canada has made training facilities available and is to some extent
responsible for United Nations actions in this
respect.
Underdeveloped countries urgently need
help in drawing up sound practical development programs. The term "underdeveloped
countries" is usually applied in relation to
Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin
America. We from the developed countries of

Europe and America were very careful to
make certain that under no circumstances
would we find ourselves in a position with
the underdeveloped on one side and the developed on the other side on any question.
We felt that to split on "have" and "havenot" lines was not in the United Nations
spirit.
One of the matters dealt with was the
establishment of a world food reserve. In
this subject Canadian delegates had a very
great interest. As one of the major food
producing countries, Canada was deeply concerned to ensure that the discussions were
practical and realistic. It was decided that
it was not practical at the present time to
consider establishing a world food reserve.
The matter of industrialization was considered and the Canadian delegation felt that
the studies should be made as useful as
possible to assist the underdeveloped countries to promote industrial development. This
seemed to be the objective of all underdeveloped countries who took one look at
Canada and decided that what they saw they
liked and immediately set out to become
industrialized overnight. We advised them
the road was paved with pitfalls, that it
would be a long period and that it would
need much adjustment in the economy. The
matter was left for further study.
One matter of particular interest was the
Special United Nations Fund for Economic
Development, referred to as SUNFED. The
Canadian position on the matter was laid
down in these terms:
The Canadian Government bas in the past supported the special fund in principle but bas
opposed its immediate establishment. The Canadian Government's final decision regarding a fund
of the type now under consideration would depend
in large measure on whether it was satisfied with
the organizational and administrative arrangement
where such bas to lead to efficient operation and
that the fund would command sufficient support to
enable it to operate effectively.

The underdeveloped countries have been
pressing since 1949 for the establishment of
a fund to aid projects for which other sources
of finance were not available. They expected
that SUNFED would finance such projects
as schools, roads and hospitals, which do not
show a profit but which are nevertheless of
general importance to the economic development. The original expectation was that the
countries which were able to provide economic aid would, through SUNFED, provide
this assistance through the United Nations
rather than through bilateral channels. The
major potential contributors to SUNFED
were not prepared to make large sums available until conditions of world-wide disarmament had been achieved. The Canadian
position was not on that precise ground, but

SENATE
rather would depend on administration and
authority establishment to the extent to
which this fund would be supported by other
major donors. Support of the major donors
was not at present available and so the fund
could not be established at this time. Nevertheless, progress was made by establishing
an ad hoc committee of the General Assembly
to study the SUNFED concept. In this respect it is particularly interesting to note
that while underdeveloped countries had a
majority on the committee for early and immediate action, they could have passed any
resolution they wished toward early establishment of SUNFED. They were nevertheless willing to postpone such action, and in
the final analysis a resolution on the subject
was presented to the Assembly and passed
unanimously.
Another matter of interest to the Canadian
delegation was a discussion on international
trade. The U.S.S.R. and its satellites were
insisting on holding an international economic
conference. The view of the committee was
that at the present time an international
economic conference would produce undesirable political consequences. It was decided
to continue supporting the existing programs
of studies by the U.N., to promote freer world
trade within the context of existing institutions such as the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which we know as GATT.
The Soviet group are not members of
GATT and were attempting a diversionary
attack on it through the United Nations.
There was one rather important matter
which Canada presented. It dealt with the
collection by the United Nations of information concerning all programs of international
economic assistance. It was to have an
inventory of current aid to complete "aid
currently available". The Canadian delegation believes that the United Nations should
take into account the bilateral programs of
economic aid which are undertaken directly
by members of the United Nations as well
as those undertaken collectively through the
U.N.
The Canadian delegation considered
that the collection of this information would
lead to a useful co-ordination of all economic
aid programs and would result in a better
understanding of the nature of the problems
with which the U.N. is so deeply concernedthat is, the economic development of the
underdeveloped countries.
In the course of the three and a half
months at the United Nations there were ten
or twelve subjects of interest and concern
which were studied by the second committee.
I spoke at least once on each subject, and
on some it was necessary to speak two or
three times. I was, of course, briefed by

departmental experts.
We were able to
make helpful contributions to these deliberations. We stood by our guns and made friends
for Canada. We hoped that we were able
to get our message across to the uncommitted
people, particularly those who needed our
assistance.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: You always make a good
speech.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Croll: In general the matters
before the committee were discussed in an
informal and constructive fashion. Some of
the debates were difficult but, in the main,
solutions acceptable to the Canadian delegation were evolved and the Canadian delegation was required to play an active role in
ensuring
that
decisions
reached
were
reasonable and practical. It is quite evident
that there is an increased interest from all
countries, including those countries which
have recently joined the United Nations.
We found that whereas the Senate had one
representative among the five delegates, all
parties in the House of Commons sent
observers. They came for a period of two or
three weeks. They were briefed and enjoyed
participating in the matters that took place at
the United Nations, depending on their special
interests. There were no senators, however,
who came in as observers. I think the Senate
should take advantage of the opportunityand I am sure it is available-to send some
of our members as observers. If I know
senators as well as I know members of the
other house, I feel senators can afford this
trip. It is not too expensive and is very
educational. I am sure honourable senators
will find it as stimulating and interesting as
I did.
Honourable senators, I apologize for taking
so long, but there is another matter that I
did want to raise.
One of the matters we dealt with at the
United Nations was the nation of Ghana,
which after nine centuries was reborn. Ghana
is faced with frightening problems of poverty
born of centuries. To come of age is, in part,
deliverance; but more than that, it is a
challenge. When you come of age there is
no longer anyone to lean on if things go
wrong. Ghana has decided to stay in the
Commonwealth to work out common problems. She also claims that she will act as
an instrument and example to end colonialism
and not to perpetuate it. She bas had no time
to develop her resources as a basis for creditworthiness and she needs so many things.
We, of course, are the eldest member of the
Commonwealth family, and at times we have
helped out the head of the family by gifts

APRIL 3, 1957
and otherwise. As the eldest and richest and
strongest and most able we should in turn help
the youngest and weakest member of the
Commonwealth family. We can act as a bridge
on the continent of Africa; we can brîng light
to that dark continent by giving the people of
Ghana assistance, guidance, and extending to
them the welcome hand of friendship.
We as a country have done a tremendous
job in giving worth-while assistance to the
people in underdeveloped countries. There is
a real bond between us. You have to be
there among those needy nations to really feel

it-and you can feel it: it is electric. 1 think
that one of our great missions is the spreading
of some of our wealth to these people who
need things so badly, and who take it from.
us because they feel we give it out of friendship and a desire to improve their standard of
living.

STATUTE OF INTERNATIONAL
ENERGY AGENCY

ATOMIC

RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL
Hon. Donald Cameron moved, pursuant to
notice:
Resolved:

That it is expedient that the Houses

of Parliament approve the Statute of the International Atomie Energy Agency signed by Canada
at New York on October 26, 1956, and that this
house do approve the same.

He said: Honourable senators, I might take
a moment or two to give some historical background in connection with this motion. It
will be recalled that it is an outgrowth of
President Eisenhower's dramatic proposals to
the United Nations General Assembly on
December 8, 1953. In that address he outlined a plan for an International Atomic
Energy Agency under the aegis of the United
Nations, with responsibility for finding
methods of applying atomic materials to the
production of power, for use in agriculture
and in medicine and for other peaceful
purposes of mankind. This became known
very shortly as the "Atoms for Peace
Proposal."
In the following months these proposals
were discussed, generally with approval, by
various members of the United Nations, and
in a short time an eight-nation group-consisting of the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Portugal, South Africa
and the United Kingdom--prepared a first
draft of the statute. That was in 1954. This
draft was debated at the United Nations
General Assembly in the fall of 1954, and on
December 4, 1954 the proposal for creating
an International Atomic Energy Agency was
endorsed by unanimous vote.
In August 1955 the draft statute was circulated to get the views of all members of the
United Nations and specialized agencies; in
other words, it was circulated among 84

different countries. The subject was again
debated at the Tenth General Assembly of
the United Nations in 1955, and was unanimously endorsed at that time.
On the basis of approval of the Tenth General Assembly of the United Nations, the
eight-nation working group referred to earlier
-namely,
the United States, Australia,
Belgium, Canada, France, Portugal, South
Africa and the United Kingdom-was expanded to include Brazil, Czechoslovakia,
India and the U.S.S.R. Upon the invitation
of the United States Government this group
met at Washington for the purpose of incorporating the suggestions that had been
made by the member states and drafting a
revised statute. This revised draft was completed on April 18, 1956, and met with almost
unanimous approval. It was further discussed by a twelve-nation working group,
consisting mostly of ambassadors, and was
submitted to a conference on the Statute of the
International Atomic Energy Agency which
opened in New York on September 20 last,
under the chairmanship of Carlos Muniz, of
Brazil, with Ambassador Winkler of Czechoslovakia as Vice-Chairman and Dag Hammarskjold as Secretary-General.
The conference was called on the invitation of the United States Government on
behalf of the twelve-nation sponsoring group.
It brought together 81 nations, the largest
world gathering of nations in the history of
mankind; and after 36 days of discussion
and negotiation it arrived at an agreement on
the setting up of an International Atomic
Energy Agency and a statute governing its
This statute was opened for
operations.
signature on October 26, 1956, and was
signed that day by 70 nations. Ten other
countries have since signed. The delay in
signing by these other countries was
not due to any objection to the statute but
arose simply because of constitutional, geographic and other limitations. Thus up to
date 80 nations have signed this statute.
We have now reached a position where
the statute, before it can become effective,
must be approved by the Governments of
the signing countries. Provision is made that
the statute will come into effect when 18
countries have approved it and deposited the
ratified instrument with the Government of
the United States, which has been designated
as a depository government for the purpose
of convenience.
Of the 18 signing countries necessary to
bring this statute into effect, three must be
from among the following: Canada, France,
the United Kingdom, the U.S.S.R. and the
United States.
In order to continue the preparatory work
of the Agency, provision was made in

APRIL
Annex 1 of the draft statute for establishment of a preparatory commission composed
of the 12 nations which drafted the original
statute, together with six elected members.
The commission, which was to come into
being on the day the statute was opened
for signature, was to be responsible for
arranging the first General Conference of the
Agency and was to make designations to the
first Board of Governors.
The elected members of the preparatory
commission were, in addition to the 12 original members: the Argentine, Egypt, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, and Peru. At the
closing plenary session of the conference last
September it was recommended that the
headquarters of the Agency should be in
Vienna.
The Statute of the International Atomic
Energy Agency consists of 23 articles, the
most important to Canada being (1) Article
VI, composition of the Board of Governors,
(2) Article XII, Agency safeguards, and
(3) Article XIV, financial arrangements.
Article XX, dealing with definitions, involved some argument in the conference
which adopted the statute, not from the
standpoint of the definitions themselves but
rather from the standpoint of the control of
and disposal of fissionable materials which
were the by-product of operation in an
Agency project.
Taking the most important articles in order,
I might briefly comment on them.
Article I simply deals with the establishment of the Agency.
Article II deals with the objectives. Briefly,
these are that the Agency shall seek to
accelerate and enlarge the contribution of
atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity
throughout the world. It shall ensure, so
far as it is able, that assistance provided by
it or at its request or under its supervision
or control is not used in such a way as to
further any military purpose.
Article III deals with the functions. Under
section A the Agency is authorized:
(1) To encourage research on, and development
and practical application of, atomic energy for
peaceful purposes throughout the world; and, if
requested to do so, to act as an intermediary for
the purposes of securing the performance of services or the supplying of materials, equipment, or
facilities by one member of the Agency for
another; and to perform any operation or service
useful in research on, or development or practical
application of, atomic energy for peaceful purposes;
2. To make provisions, in accordance with this
statute, for materials, services, equipment and
facilities to meet the needs of research on, and
development and practical application of, atomic
energy for peaceful purposes, including the production of electric power, with due consideration for
the needs of the underdeveloped areas of the
world;
3. To foster the exchange of scientific and
technical information on peaceful uses of atomic
energy;

4. To encourage the exchange and training of
scientists and experts in the field of peaceful uses
of atomic energy;
5. To establish and administer safeguards designed
to ensure that special fissionable and other
materials, services, equipment, facilities, and information made available by the Agency or at its
request or under its supervision or control are not
used for any military purpose; and to apply safeguards, at the request of the parties, to any
bilateral or multilateral arrangement, or, at the
request of a State, to any of that State's activities
in the field of atomic energy;
6. To establish or adopt . . . standards of safety
for protection of health and minimization of danger
to life and property . . . and to provide for the
application of these standards to its own operations
as well as to the operations making use of materials,
services, equipment, facilities, and information
made available by the Agency or at its request or
under its control or supervision; and to provide
for the application of these standards, at the request of the parties, to operations under any bilateral or multilateral arrangement, or, at the
request of a State, to any of that State's activities
in the field of atomic energy;
7. To acquire or establish any facilities, plant
and equipment useful in carrying out its authorized
functions, whenever the facilities, plant and equipment otherwise available to it in the area concerned are inadequate or available only on terms
it deems unsatisfactory.

Section B provides that in carrying out its
functions, the Agency shall:
1. Conduct its activities in accordance with the
purposes and principles of the United Nations to
promote peace and international co-operation, and
in conformity with policies of the United Nations
furthering the establishment of safeguarded worldwide disarmament . . .

I might mention that this was one of the
policies which precipitated a great deal of
discussion.
2. Establish control over the use of special fissionable materials received by the Agency, in order to
ensure that these materials are used for peaceful
purposes;
3. Allocate its resources in such a manner as to
secure efficient utilization and the greatest possible
general benefit in aIl areas of the world, bearing
in mind the special needs of the underdeveloped
areas of the world.

Subsections 4 and 5 require the submission
of reports on the Agency's activities to the
General Assembly of the United Nations,
the Security Council, when appropriate, and
the Economic and Social Council.
Article IV, dealing with membership,
provides:
A. The initial members of the Agency shall be
those States members of the United Nations or any
of the specialized agencies which shail have signed
this statute within 90 days after it is opened for
signature and shall have deposited an instrument
of ratification.

It is rather interesting to note that the
first country to ratify was Russia, and the
second was Egypt.
B. Other members of the Agency shall be those
States, whether or not members of the United
Nations or any of the specialized agencies which
deposit an instrument of acceptance of this statute

shall have the following rights and responsibilities
to the extent relevant to the project or arrangement:
1. To examine the design of specialized equipment and facilities, including nuclear reactors,
and to approve it only from the viewpoint of assuring that it will not further any military purpose,
that it complies with applicable health and safety
standards, and that it will permit effective application of the safeguards provided for in this article;
3. To require the maintenance and production of
operating records to assist in ensuring accountabiýlity for source and special fissionable materials
used or produced in the project or arrangement;
5. To approve the means to be used for the
chemical processing of irradiated materials solely
to ensure that this chemical processing will not
lend itself to diversion of materials for military
purposes and will comply with applicable health
and safety standards; . . .
6. To send into the territory of the recipient
State or States inspectors, designated by the
Agency after consultation with the State or States
concerned, who shall have access at all times to all
places and data and to any person who by reason
of his occupation deals with materials, equipment,
or facilities which are required by this Statute to
be safeguarded, . . .

This is the section which understandably
presented some difficulty.

by the recipient State or States to take requested

APRIL 4. 1957
corrective steps within a reasonable time, to suspend or terminate assistance and withdraw any
materials and equipment made available by the
Agency or a member ln furtherance of the project.

Article XIII-"Reimbursement of members"
-simply provides for members being reimbursed by the Agency for materials supplied.
Article XIV deals with finance. This was
one of the controversial articles in the statute.
It is interesting to note that the Canadian
representatives in the conference of last
September played a leading role, since the
financial provisions adopted were essentially
those put forward by the Canadian delegation.
The difference of opinion which made this
article controversial was between those who
wished to use the financial lever as a means
of controlling the Agency to the point of
ineffectiveness and those who wished to see
it thrive under proper financial controls.
Provision was made as follows:
A. The Board of Governors shall submit to the
General Conference the annual budget estimates
for the expenses of the Agency. To facilitate the
work of the Board in this regard, the Director
General shall initially prepare the budget estimates.
If the General Conference does not approve the
estimates, it shall return them together with its
recommendations to the Board. The Board shall
then submit further estimates to the General
Conference for its approval.
B. Expenditures of the Agency shall be classified
under the following categories:
1. Administrative expenses: These shall include:
(a) Costs of the staff of the Agency other than
the staff employed in connection with materials,
services, equipment, and facilities referred to in
subparagraph B-2 below; costs of meetings; and
for the preparation of
expenditures required
Agency projects and for the distribution of
information; . . .
2. Expenses, other than those included in subparagraph 1 of this paragraph in connexion with
any materials, facilities, plant, and equipment acquired or established by the Agency in carrying
out its authorized functions, and the costs of
materials,
services,
equipment,
and
facilities
provided by it under agreements with one or more
members.
C. In fixing the expenditures under subparagraph
B-1 (b) above, the Board of Governors shall deduct
such amounts as are recoverable under agreements
regarding the application of safeguards between
the Agency and parties to bilateral or multilateral
arrangements.

In brief, the financial proposals envisage
an assessment on the member countries
in approximately the same amount as is
the case in the United Nations, and the
special projects which may be set up are
expected to be financed by special financial
provisions and recovered from the countries
participating in the project, as far. as that
may be possible.
Article XV "Privileges and immunities"makes provision for the Agency' fo enjoy in
the territory of each member such legal
capacity privileges and immunities as are
necessary for the exercise of its functions.
Article XVI, which deals with relationship
with other organizations, authorizes the
82719-81
;
MI

Board of Governors with the approval of the
General Conference to enter into agreements
between the U.N. and other organizations
whose work is related to the Agency.
Article XVII deals with the settlement of
disputes and makes provision whereby disputes which cannot be settled by negotiation
may be referred to the International Court of
Justice.
Article XVIII-"Amendments and withdrawals"-sets forth the machinery by which
amendments to the statute may be made and
how they shall come into force. It also covers
the procedures by which a member may withdraw from the Agency.
Article XIX-"Suspension of privileges"provides that a member of the Agency which
is in arrears with its dues for a period of
two years may be prevented from voting in
the sessions of the Agency. The article also
sets forth the terms under which a member
State which consistently violates the provisions of the statute may be suspended from the
exercise of the privileges of membership by
the General Conference acting by a two-thirds
majority of the members present and voting
upon recommendation by the Board of
Governors.
Article XX-"Definitions"-spells out in
detail the definition of terms such as "special
fissionable material", etc.
Article XXI-"Signature, acceptance and
entry into force"-provides for the statute
coming into effect when 18 members have
signed the instruments of acceptance and
deposited the instruments with the Government of the United States. It further makes
provision for the depository Government to
inform all States signatory to the statute of
the dates on which additional States become
parties to it.
Article XXII-"Registration with the United
Nations"-makes provision whereby the
statute is to be recorded by the depository
government, that is the United States Government under article 102 of the United
Nations Charter.
Article XXIII-"Authentic text and certified
copies"-states that the statute shall be provided in the Chinese, English, French, Russian,
Spanish languages.
Honourable senators, in conclusion it can
be said that this statute represents one of the
constructive and hopeful phases of the work

why this statute should be formally approved

that the motion before the Senate will receive

APRIL 4, 1957
Honourable senators, when we look at the
part played by Canada in international affairs
we can use the expression of our Prime
Minister and with a just pride we can say:
It is great to be a Canadian. Thanks to
the eminent statesman who is at the head
of our Government, and his very able Secretary of State for External Affairs, Canada
is now known the world over as a peaceloving nation, a nation which always contributes effectively and positively to the
sacred cause of peace. To that cause we
do not pay merely lip service. Our Prime
Minister has been a genial ambassador of
good will at all the Commonwealth conferences in London and at all his meetings in
Washington, in Bermuda and Paris, as well
as in India and other countries of Asia.
Thanks to IVr. St. Laurent, our policy,
whether in domestic or in external affairs,
is truly Canadian-a policy of the good
neighbour, a policy of human brotherhood.
Our Prime Minister has devoted his very
remarkable intelligence, his outstanding experience and ability, and all his heart and
soul to making the twentieth century Canada's century. He has left his own personal
mark-I would say, his fingerprints-on our
Canadian policy as a whole.
But in international matters Canada has
given to the United Nations and to mankind
at large a most extraordinary envoy and
admirably gifted diplomat in the person of
Mr. Pearson. He fully deserves all the
compliments which were paid to him yesterday by our honourable colleague from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll). Really,
I cannot say anything more. Mr. Pearson
has contributed more than anybody else at
the United Nations to finding a positive and
practical means to restore peace with honour
in the Middle East, and to preventing the
conflict there from degenerating into a third
and last world war. Mr. Pearson believes
ardently and deeply in the rule of law in
international matters but, with his clear
sense of justice, he wants to secure the respect and fulfilment of their obligations by
all the United Nations, not only by some of
them. His goal is to achieve a real settlement of the dispute. Quite rightly he was
opposed to sanctions which would have been
applied with discrimination and which would
not have proved at all to be a remedy. In
fact, in my opinion, they would have been
monstrously unjust. Peace had to be restored
and, once restored, it had to be preserved.
Peace cannot be maintained within our own
borders without the presence of an adequate
police force. So it is that in international
affairs the continuance of peace can be
secured only by an international police force.
As stated yesterday, Mr. Pearson is really
82719-314

the grand architect of the United Nations
Emergency Force which is now patrolling the
frontier between Egypt and Israel.
Honourable senators, may I very briefly
refer now to the fundamental principles of
the United Nations Charter on the subject
which I am now discussing?
Under section 33 of the U.N. Charter, all
members have undertaken to settle their disputes by peaceful means. They have also
pledged themselves to supply the necessary
contingents whenever the Security Council,
under section 43, decides to use force in order
to restore peace. The use of force by any
individual state is now expressly limited to
repelling aggression, under section 51. With
the use or, I should say, the abuse of the
so-called right of the veto in the Security
Council, some intolerable situations have
arisen. In particular, no action can now be
obtained through the Security Council to
secure for Israel the respect of her right
to use the Suez Canal and to have access to
the Gulf of Aqaba. Egypt has ignored the
resolution adopted on September 1, 1951, by
the Security Council, asking Egypt to cancel
the restrictions illegally imposed by her upon
Israeli shipping. Eleven nations raised their
voices in protest against the flagrant violation
of Egypt's obligations; but nothing was done,
and even today the canal and the Straits of
Tiran are still closed to Israel. Border raids
from the Gaza strip have been repeated
thousands of times since the armistice of
1949. Egypt still revendicates her rights of
belligerency, and such is her position in
blocking the Straits of Tiran.
Egypt pretends to close the Suez Canal to
Israel "to secure her own defence and to
maintain public order", and she invokes
article X of the Convention of 1888. No more
futile pretence has ever been raised to justify
a flagrant illegality. Last year Israel considered that her very survival was at stake
and she used armed force to secure the
respect of her rights which she could not
obtain otherwise. That military intervention
resulted in a brilliant victory, the rapid conquest of the Gaza strip and of the Sinai
Desert, and the occupation of the Straits of
Tiran.
At the same time Great Britain and France
intervened in Egypt for the avowed purpose
of forcing that country to comply with her
obligations concerning the Suez Canal under
the Convention of Constantinople of 1888.
This Convention, as honourable senators
know, is based upon three fundamental principles. First, the canal is to remain open to
merchant shipping of all nations at all times,
in wartime as well as in peacetime. Secondly,
free navigation is to be allowed also for warships, provided they do not stop in the canal

SENATE
and do not unload troops or material. Thirdly,
the neutralization of the canal is proclaimed,
and in wartime it can be neither blocked nor
attacked.
Until 1968 La ,Compagnie Universelle du
Canal de Suez was to enjoy a concession for
the exploitation of the canal, That concession
was granted by Turkey about 1869, when
Egypt was still a Turkish vassal. But that
does not in any way justify Egypt in treating
the concession and the Convention of 1888,
signed on lier behalf by Turkey, as no more
than scraps of paper, and in nationalizing the
canal in 1956. The respect of treaties-Pacta
sunt servanda-is the very basis of international law and of the United Nations Charter.
No doubt Egypt is now a sovereign state, but
ber sovereignty does not exempt lier in any
way from complying with the treaties which
are binding upon ber.
It would indeed be a great fallacy to describe Egypt as an innocent victim of aggression. Since 1949, 11,873 incidents of Arab
sabotage and marauding have caused 1,335
Israeli casualties. I quote those statistics from
a pamphlet just issued by the United Zionist
Council of Canada, concerning violations of
the armistice agreements by the various
neighbours of Israel. Israel, indeed, has as
much right to her existence as any other
state in the world. Egypt has as much obligation to respect the rules of international law
as any other state. The ships of Israel have
the clearest right to pass through the Suez
Canal and the Straits of Tiran. Israel is entitled to prevent guerrilla warfare along lier
boundaries. The Suez Canal is also a life-line
for Great Britain, France and Western
Europe.
Justice had to be done. But the military
action of Israel, Great Britain and France
undertaken last year was not in accordance
with the United Nations Charter. A withdrawal of their forces was imposed by the
United Nations upon those three powers. We
all assumed that steps would be taken to
restore effectively peace in the Middle East.
To achieve that noble purpose, we all trusted
the powerful and generous nation, our very
friendly neighbour to the south, the United
States. But time passes, and all concessions
have to be made by Great Britain, France and
Israel. International law is enforced upon our
friendly allies, not upon either the Arab
world or the U.S.S.R. How long can such a
situation last? How long will the United
Nations Emergency Force be tolerated in
Egypt? The present force is almost only a
token force. An effective international force
was contemplated by article 45 and following
articles of the United Nations Charter. But
the abuse of the veto power has again rendered impossible the establishment of a
permanent force. Therefore, Mr. Pearson is

absolutely right in advocating the setting up
of such a permanent force. It should be endowed with sufficient power to inspire the
respect of any transgressor of international
law.
Yesterday, our senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl) expressed the wish
that such an international force would come
into existence before it is too late. I hope
with all my heart that all nations will realize
that peace is the greatest of all blessings,
and that Almighty God will help us to find
some way to prevent another war. Peace
and war begin in the minds of men. The
senator from Toronto-Spadina described our
policy of mutual aid to underdeveloped countries as an investment in peace. Here I must
mention the visit to South-East Asia by our
Minister of National Health and Welfare, the
Honourable Paul Martin. He was welcomed
everywhere as the worthy representative of
Canada. I want to congratulate Mr. Martin
upon his unsparing and very successful efforts
in the international field of economic and
social co-operation, and particularly upon
his fine work on the Economic and Social
Council of the United Nations. We were all
glad to note that two members of this house,
the honourable senator from Wellington (Hon.
Mr. Howard) and the honourable senator
from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), took an
active part in the work of the Economic and
Social Council at previous sessions.
Yesterday the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina spoke also of the desire of
underdeveloped countries to build schools and
to secure for all their young people the
facilities of primary education. I believe also
in such intellectual co-operation. Ignorance
engenders prejudices. Instruction properly
given is, in my opinion, the best means to
combat war. It is just like light which dissipates darkness. We already supply technical
assistance under the Colombo Plan. Students
from various parts of the Commonwealth
come here to study especially engineering,
agriculture and various applied sciences. But
UNESCO also is accomplishing a wonderful
job in the field of world-wide intellectual
co-operation. With the foundation of the Canada Council our country will now be able to
participate fully in the good work of
UNESCO. Ouir council will facilitate exchanges of students between Canada and
other countries. Thus we shall have broader
human relations; we shall know people from
other lands better, and they in turn will know
this great Canadian land of ours and our
excellent population better. The Canada
Council can be a wonderful instrument for
peace, and an excellent agency for promoting

the humanities, the arts and the social
sciences, flot only for Canadian scholars but
also for others. Thus we shall be better able
to appreciate the spiritual treasures of mankind at large, to realize ail that we have in

May brotherly love, flot hatred, inspire ai

PRAIRIE GRAIN PRODUCERS INTERIM
FINANCING BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 263, an Act to amend
the Prairie Grain Producers Interim Financing
Act, 1956.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, I move that this bill be read the
second time now.
The bill contains three short amendments
to an act entitled "The Prairie Grain
Producers Interim Financing Act", passed
in 1956. The purpose of the bill is to extend
the legislation for another crop year, namely,
from September 1, 1957, to June 1, 1958.
The first amendment relates to the maximum loan to an individual grain producer.
This loan has been limited to $1,500, but the
bill provides that up to $3,000 may be loaned
through any branch of a chartered bank to
grain producers during the year designated
here as extending from September 1, 1957,
to June 1, 1958.
The second amendment provides that the
rate of interest, which is now 5 per cent,
shall be left to the determination of the
Governor in Council. This means that the
rate would probably be higher than 5 per
cent but not higher than the current rate of
interest being charged by banks for similar
loans.
The third amendment extends by one month
the period for making loans, setting the opening date at September 1 instead of October 1,
as it has been under the legislation in the
two previous crop years.
The additional $1,500 provided for in this
bill is really intended to benefit those farmers and producers who have not been able to
deliver much grain to their elevator points on
account of the congestion prevailing in the
areas in which they live, and to that extent
have not profited or benefited under the

regulations to the same extent as some other
producers have done where delivery quotas
have been larger. The provision for an extra
$1,500 up to a $3,000 maximum loan undoubtedly will apply to those producers
whose delivery quotas have been kept down
to the low figures of 2 and 3 bushels per
acre of their harvested crop area.
Of the 2,000 odd western country elevator
points where farmers deliver the vast bulk
of their grains, 165 were as at the middle of
March this year on a 5-bushel-per-acre delivery quota. In addition to that number,
425 were on a four-bushel basis; but around
1,500 points have been and are now on a
2- to 3-bushel delivery quota.
The experience during the past two years
in connection with this legislation is that
loans that have been extended have been repaid out of the crop that these loans have
been intended to finance. It is interesting
also to note that the number of loans in relation to the total number of producers has not
been large, and have not been renewed to
any great extent at all. In the 1955-56 year
there were 10,326 loans paid through the
chartered bank branches of Canada, amounting to somewhat less than $8 million. So far
in the current year, 1956-57, which leads to
the end of July, 5,034 loans have been negotiated, amounting to a total of $3,498,000. In
those past two years, therefore, while this
legislation has been in effect the total amount
of the loans that have been negotiated
through the branch banks of the country is
about $11 million or $12 million.
The bill provides that if an earlier loan
is not repaid by September 1, no further
loan can be negotiated. In other words, the
new loans that will be negotiated during the
coming year, 1957-58, will be made only to
those who either have had no loans at all in
the past, or to those who have borrowed in
the past year and will have paid off their
loan before October. So if an earlier loan
has not been repaid by September 1 of this
year, the borrower on a note could still deliver some new crop wheat, pay off his loan
by October 1, and proceed to get a new loan.
In that way he can accommodate himself to
the proposed change in the legislation.
I may say, honourable senators, that this
legislation is being advanced as a result of
general representations by the leading grainproducing organizations in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Copies of the
correspondence exchanged in connection with
the negotiations were tabled by the minister
in the other house during the discussion on
this bill in committee, and it was made quite
clear that the desire on the part of the producer organizations was to have this legislation approved by Parliament in plenty of

APRIL 8, 1957
time to be taken advantage of by some 1,500odd producers, to whom I have referred, who
are still delivering grain on the basis of 2
or 3 bushels per acre and will undoubtedly
require some financial assistance at the beginning of the harvesting season.
The situation which this legislation was
designed to meet in 1955-56 and in 1956-57,
and which still exists, bas arisen, as honourable senators know, as a result of the extraordinary bounteousness of nature in conferring upon this country an unprecedented
series of very large harvests, even beyond
the capacity of our interior country elevators
and our large terminals in all positions to
accommodate.
As a commentary upon this condition it is
interesting to note that over a 35-year period,
from 1921 to 1956 inclusive, the western
Canadian wheat crop has averaged only 16.6
bushels per acre. Twelve of those 35 years
were below the average figure, and nine
years were above it. Of those nine abnormal
years with crops far above the average yields,
six have followed each other in a row since
1950. The other three years came during the
first seasons of the forties.
This legislation is of a temporary nature,
being passed as it is year by year in the hope
that the grain producers' financial problem
will at least be relieved, and it is rather risky
to make prognostications where western grain
crops are concerned. In spite of that risk,
it is interesting to note that present soil and
climatic conditions which apply throughout
the whole central and northwestern regions
of this continent are such that with the rule
of averages as shown in the statistical record
of the past 35 years, one might not be too far
wrong in suggesting that by this time in
1958 our total carry-over of grain will not
greatly exceed the economic requirements of
this exporting country. If this be so, the
financial problems represented in this bill
will have changed very substantially.
This bill was discussed at some length in
the other house and discussion was largely
on whether or not the measure went far
enough or whether more generous credit
should be provided. There were no very concrete suggestions-certainly no practical suggestions-for providing a plan contrary to
the one contained in this bill.
Honourable senators, these are all the explanations that I have on second reading.
If there are any questions on the bill and if
itý is desired to have them answered in committee by the gentleman who answered questions on the Wheat Board Bill earlier in the
session, I shall be glad to move that the bill
be referred to committee. But if the bill is

acceptable as I have tried to explain it, I
would like to see it given third reading
tonight.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
I have no authority to speak on behalf of
the Opposition with regard to this legislation
or any other legislation which may come
before us in the closing hours of the session.
My honourable friend to the right of me,
the senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte),
has more right to speak than I-he is my
senior as a senator and he is also my senior
in years-but he has not indicated any intention to do so. I can only say that those who
are qualified to pass on this legislation have
given their opinion regarding the need for
it and should know what they want. I am
not qualified in any way to discuss matters
pertaining to agriculture and therefore I
offer no objection to the bill. However, I
think it should go to committee, if the sponsor
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) so desires.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I move the third reading now.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I understood the honourable gentleman to say he would move that
the bill be referred to a standing committee.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I offered to do so if
there was any desire on the part of honourable senators to ask for further information.
I have no objection whatever to that
procedure.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: In those circumstances I
have no objection to third reading being
given now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time and passed.
INCOME TAX BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill No. 407, an Act to
amend the Income Tax Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John J. Connolly: I move the second
reading now.

SENATE
Honourable senators, the Income Tax Act
comes before us every year for amendment.
This bill contains some 22 sections. Very
few of these sections relate one to the other.
There is as a consequence no general
principle running through the bill, except
perhaps the principle of amending the
Income Tax Act. I do not mean by that
that it is an unprincipled bill! I do mean,
however, that there are separate and special
considerations which must be given to almost
every one of the individual sections in the
bill. If honourable senators would not mind,
it seems to me that it would be more helpful
and perhaps a little more logical if I were to
start discussing the bill first by considering
the most important section in it. As I conceive it, that is section 17. It deals with
registered retirement savings plans.
As honourable senators are aware, for
many years the Income Tax Act bas
recognized the principle of pension plans.
By this principle, employees are enabled to
postpone the tax payable on certain portions
of their income which are paid in to a trustee
by them under a pension plan. This money
is invested, and when the employee reaches
a certain age, or at his retirement-depending on the provisions of the plan-the
proceeds of this investment plus his payments into the plan are paid to him in instalments, usually for the balance of his life.
That is the general principle of a pension
plan.
Such plans are available in industry, and
also under the Civil Service Superannuation
Act and other legislation. But there is a
broad area wherein this privilege has not
existed, and which is best described by calling it an area occupied by people who are
self-employed. For a number of years organizations such as the Institute of Chartered
Accountants, the Canadian Bar Association,
the Association of Professional Engineers, the
Canadian Medical Association and other professional organizations, as well as small merchants and people more or less in that
business category, have been urging that some
steps be taken to enable them to embark
upon a savings program permitting tax-free
payments into a fund from which annuities
in later life will be paid. The provisions of
section 17 of this measure are designed to do
just that.
The discussion in the other place indicated
that perfection is not expected from the provisions at present before Parliament. Similar
action bas been taken recently in England,
and attempts to legislate along the same line
have been made in the Congress of the
United States. As the proposals embodied in
this bill are new, they must be tested by
experience, but it seems to me that tbey are

a step toward filling a long-felt need. As
they are explained and understood it will be
apparent, I believe, that the plan is not a
form of class legislation, available solely to
professional or business groups. It is open
to all Canadian citizens, including those who
are even now members of a pension plan.
However, a ceiling has been placed on the
amount which can be set aside tax-free each
year to provide for an annuity. As far as
possible the legislation has been so drafted
as to eliminate ministerial discretion. In
other words, all the law, it is hoped, is contained in the bill itself.
The intention is that its operation shall
be worked out with agencies like life insurance companies, the federal Government
annuities branch, and appropriate branches
of provincial Governments which have annuity schemes-f or instance, Alberta, I
understand, bas such a scheme-and with
organizations which provide investment contracts-although the mechanics for this type
of organization are somewhat different from
those contemplated for insurance companies;
and, perhaps, with trust companies and other
agencies which can qualify to accept the
payments and arrange for the issue of annuities. In every case the organization which
receives the periodic payments from the taxpayer will invest the money so received. No
doubt these investments will be made pursuant to the provisions of the Trustee Act of
the province in which the money is invested.
At the end of a stipulated period of time the
funds will be used to provide regular annuity
payments to the contributors. The payment
as and when received by the ultimate annuitant will be taxed in his hands. When payments are made into the fund by the taxpayer
within the limits provided by the bill
they will not be taxable.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Is it correct that the
provision relating to persons who may operate
this retirement savings plan bas been somewhat extended since the budget speech was
delivered? Was it not originally intended to
be done solely by insurance companies?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes: the
provision was extended in the other house to
include, as I said, not only insurance companies but companies which issue investment
contracts, and also trust companies. There
was some mention in the other place of the
possibility of banks having the same right,
but I believe that enabling legislation will
be necessary before they could undertake an
operation of that kind. As honourable senators know, the issuance of annuity contracts
is not the kind of thing which banks normally can or want to do.

in order to be tax free, must be paid into a
"registered" plan; that is to say, a plan that
has been approved by the Department of
National Revenue. Otherwise the taxpayer
will pay income tax on any amount which he
may put into a plan.
If a plan or contract is voided by a taxpayer and does not qualify as a registered
plan, and if the trustee is called upon to refund, in a lump sum or otherwise, the
amounts paid in by the taxpayer under the
bill, the trustee is required to withhold 25
per cent of the refund on account of tax.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable
senator explain what is meant by "if a plan
does not qualify"?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oitawa West): Let me
say for the sake of argument that the taxpayer, a Canadian citizen, began to make
payments under an annuity contract which he
believed to be an approved contract, that is,
a plan registered with the Department of
National Revenue. If for some reason the
plan had not actually been approved by the
Department, then the payments that he might
claim exemption for in the year in which he
made them-up to $2,500 or 10 per cent of
his earned income-would not be payments
upon which he could claim a tax deduction.
In other words, it is important for every
person who buys such an annuity to make
sure that the plan is one which has been
approved by the Department of National
Revenue. Does that answer my honourable
friend?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It does, except that I would
make this point: I was under the impression
that all insurance companies, before entering
into a contract in regard to pensions, applied
to the Department of National Revenue for
approval of that particular plan.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Would my honourable
friend tell us what happens to the accumulated premiums paid by a man who
starts contributing to one of these plans and
for some reason is unable to continue?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Well,
if he intends to void the plan, to void or
break the contract, or to make the contract
unacceptable to the department, then I think
the result in that case would be the same as
would obtain in a similar situation with a
Government annuity. In other words, they
would probably change the contract and give
him an annuity which he could otherwise buy
for the money he had up to that time contributed.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But, on the other hand,
if he claimed the premiums back, then I
think my honourable friend said 25 per cent
of the refund would have to be retained by
the operator of the plan and paid as income
tax. Is that right?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.
There is a little confusion in my mind on
that point. Certainly, if the plan -were voided
and became annulled and he asked to have
his payments back, and he was entitled to
have them back, then they would come back
to him, less a deduction of 25 per cent on
account of tax.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I was not thinking
of a plan becoming a nullity, but I was thinking of an ordinary man unable to continue his
payments and asking for his premiums back.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In that
case, 25 per cent withholding deduction would
be made, certainly. But as I say, there is a
little confusion in my mind on one point,
because the rights under these contracts are
not assignable, and you cannot borrow upon
them, which means that they are locked in
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otlawa West): Certainly and you cannot deal with them. I think
the kind of insurance companies we have in perhaps because of the confusion that might

May I say that this bill was only passed in
contracts, and therefore I think it is wise for
us to realize now, and perhaps for the public the House of Commons at half past three
at large to realize, that before embarking this afternoon, so I have been a little short

have been paid out of "tax-paid" income.
That portion of the annuity payment due
after the maturity of such contracts which
represents the part of the annuity purchased
before this legislation became valid, will at
that time be free from income tax, except
for one thing, and that is the interest earned
on the money paid in heretofore. That little
portion will be taxed.
Honourable senators, that concludes the
explanation of section 17.
Section 18 is designed to encourage further
exploration for natural resources in Canada.
Heretofore, only mining companies and exploration companies were entitled to charge
off against their earnings the expenses incurred in sub-surface exploration. This section applies to companies which process
mineral ores for the purpose of recovering
metals and which engage in the exploration
and development work involved in finding
the ores upon which they work. Even if exploration and development is not their principal business, they will be allowed to charge
the expense incurred to the cost of doing
business. For example, there are smelting
companies, and companies which make steel
products from ore, which desire to supplement their source of raw material by acquiring their own sources of raw material. Under
the provisions of this legislation they will
be able to treat the expenditures on such
work as legitimate expenses of their company.
Another provision of section 18 allows a
Canadian company which acquires the whole
Canadian undertaking of a United States
corporation engaged in the production of
petroleum and natural gas to use the exploration expenses accumulated by such American
company in years prior to the purchase.
Heretofore, these exploration expenses incurred by a prior corporation could not be used
by a successor corporation which bought out
the undertaking of the prior corporation.
This seems to be a sensible type of provision.
Section 19 provides that when rentals are
paid in advance for a number of years to a
taxpayer for lands or chattels, it will be permitted to the owner of the land or chattels
so rented to spread the rental income over
the years for which the payments are
received. Without this provision the rental
income received from land or chattels
would be taxable entirely in the year in
which the advance rental was received. Now
the owner can set up a reserve and spread the
incidence of tax over the years for which
the rental was intended to be applied.
Section 20 is a section which was contentious last year.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Before he proceeds
further, may I ask the honourable gentleman
82719-32j

a question? As I understand it, that means
that if a lease was entered into for a period
of 20 or 30 years the landlord could spread
over the revenue received on a yearly basis
in so far as the amount is concerned; is that
right?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, I
think that is right.
He receives a lump sum, in advance. For
the sake of argument, and since 20 years is
a long period of time to use as an example,
let us say that a landlord issued a lease for
a building to a tenant for a period of five
years, and got all his rent the first year. First
of all, let me say that this applies to chattels
as well as to land. Incidentally, the provision has been in the act now for a number of
years in connection with land, and also
ships, but not in connection with other
chattels.
Perhaps I could answer my honourable
friend from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr.
Isnor) in this way: without this provision of
law a landlord who received in 1950 the
rental payments covering the period 1950 to
1955 would have to show the total rental
receipts in his tax return for the year 1950.
That would mean that his revenue would be
inordinately increased for that year, and his
tax would be proportionately burdensome.
It seems therefore equitable that he should
be allowed to set up a reserve and spread
the income over the years for which the
rental was intended to apply.
As I said earlier, section 20 proved to be
rather contentious. We provided by; the
legislation passed last year that the son of a
farmer could get the same advantages from
the rules governing depreciation whether he
bought a farm from his father or from a
stranger. This advantage is now being extended to the son of a fisherman who buys a
vessel from his father, provided the father
owns all 64 shares in the vessel.
Now honourable senators, may I come back
to the earlier sections of the bill. I think I
need spend very little time on section 1,
which simply provides that alimony payments may be deemed to have been made out
of "investment income" and not out of
"earned income". This offers an advantage
to the alimony payer, because it will reduce
his "investment income" which as you know,
carries a 4 per cent surtax. To that extent
he gets relief.
Section 2 also deals with alimony. Under
the present law a person who pays alimony
under an award made in an action for
divorce, for judicial separation or under a
written agreement, is relieved from the tax
that he would otherwise pay on the amount
of the alimony. This amendment would allow

SENATE
the alimony payer to escape tax on the
amount he pays under an agreement made
after a divorce or after a judicial separation,
or by virtue of a court decision which is
given after a divorce or judicial separation.
It appears that in British Columbia an
action for alimony may be taken, in addition
to an action for divorce. It sometimes happens that the alimony decision is reached
after the divorce decision has been made.
Because the alimony provision was not part
of the divorce proceeding, under the present
law the alimony payment was not deductible
for income tax purposes from the income of
the alimony payer. This amendment would
make it deductible.
I understand that there have been cases in
Ontario of a divorce having been granted
without provision being made for alimony,
and subsequently an alimony award was
made to the needy former spouse.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable senator if when a man obtains a divorce
from his wife he is in law bound to pay
alimony to her?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): That
question gave me some concern. But apparently in British Columbia the two proceedings run concurrently and are dependent one
upon the other. The fact that the divorce
decision happens to come down first would
not prejudice the results of the alimony action
in so far as the Income Tax law is concerned.
I am not a member of the bar of British
Columbia and am unable to give my honourable friend a full explanation. I am sure
a better explanation can be given by the
officials of the department when the bill
is considered in committee.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Does that situation occur
in other provinces-in Ontario, for instance?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (O±awa West): I do not
think any other province follows the pra.ctice
of having two separate actions, one for alimony and the other for divorce, of the same
character as that followed in British
Columbia.
Section 3 is intended to assist persons who
have pensioners dependent upon them. As
honourable senators know, taxpayers are
allowed a certain exemption for qualified
dependents who are not in receipt of income
above a certain level. This section provides
that a dependent who is in receipt of a
pension under the War Veterans Allowance
Act will not be required to include that
amount in determining his level of income.
Section 4 is consequential upon section 17,
which I explained at some length at the
beginning of my remarks. It provides that
only income from an annuity is now taxable.

If an annuity is brought within the retirement
savings plan the premiums paid on the
annuity are deductible in the year in which
they are made, and when payments are received by the annuitant the total annual
receipts are taxable in the year in which
they are received. The same rule applies
to pension plans.
Section 5 contains a provision which is of
interest only to professional people such as
lawyers, doctors, engineers, accountants and
others. They will now be allowed to deduct
the fees they pay into their particular guild
or association. Such an exemption is permitted whether or not it is obligatory for them
to maintain that membership as a result of
their contract of employment. For example,
if I, a lawyer, were appointed deputy minister
of some department it might not be necessary
for me to maintain my status as a member of
the bar. Heretofore, if my contractual arrangement with my employer had been such,
I would not have been allowed to deduct the
fees I would pay to maintain my position
at the bar. Under this proposed amendment,
such fees become a deductible item for taxation purposes. Perhaps it will serve to keep
some professional persons more honest within
their profession than would otherwise be the
case!
Subsection 6 of section 4 is of interest in
that it provides that farmers, businessmen
and corporations who erect wires, poles,
pipes, telephones or sewer connections for
public utilities of various kinds, may now
charge the cost of installing such facilities
against the cost of doing business. Heretofore they have never been able to get anything in the way of a capital cost allowance,
because they did not own the facility which
they installed and for which they paid-it
was owned by the public utility company.
Under this provision, even though it is owned
by the public utility company the person
who makes the payment in will be able to
charge the cost of the installation as an
expense.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would that apply to installation of a sprinkler system, or attaching a
fire alarm system to your building? Could
that be written off as expense?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oi±awa West): Well I
would think a sprinkler system might be
incorporated into the realty, and in that
event perhaps it would be considered as an
addition to the realty and the depreciation
you would get would be only as part of
the depreciation of the real estate. As to
a fire alarm system, that might be in the
category of an improvement to the realty, in
which event you would get the depreciation
in the same way as you would get real estate

APRIL 8, 1957
depreciation. Perhaps it would be in the
category of equipment and the rate of
depreciation would of course depend on the
class of equipment into which it fell. I think
if the honourable gentleman would ask that
question of the representatives from the
department they would be able to furnish
him with the depreciation rates from the
official table and tell him exactly what category it fits into. I am afraid I cannot help
him much more.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I will be pleased to do
so. The honourable senator is so well posted
and bas given us such a splendid explanation
of this bill that I thought that perhaps he
could answer questions from all and on
every angle. In connection with a sprinkler
system, I would point out that water is of
course absolutely necessary in order for it
to function. The water must be brought
into the building from the lines of the public
utility concerned, and I thought there might
be some provision covering water lines laid
to the building.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): You
mean the water lines coming from the main
pipes to the building?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): They
might fall within this section. I was thinking
of a sprinkler system within the building
itself.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
is not this the distinction, that the sprinkler
system would belong to the owner of the
building and would be part of this building,
subject to depreciation in the ordinary way,
whereas the payments provided for under this
section are payments which the owner makes
for the installation of something which never
belongs to him at all? They are for the installation of pipes and so on, which belong to the
public utility company, and obviously the
owner of the building cannot depreciate them
as part of his own property.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That is
undoubtedly true, and I thank the honourable
gentleman for his observation. I was going
just a little bit further with the honourable
gentleman from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon.
Mr. Isnor), and I think I was confusing myself as well as him. However, the question
might be answered in detail by the officials
from the department.
Section 5 presents some technicalities and
perhaps honourable senators won't mind if I
stick rather closely to my notes on this. As
honourable senators know, dividends received
by one Canadian corporation from another

are exempt income in the hands of the corporation which receives them. Hitherto expenses incurred by a holding company to deal
with exempt income, that is to say, to earn
dividends, were not deductible. By this
amendment, when a holding company has
more than 50 per cent of its assets in sharesin other words, receives more than 50 per cent
of its income in dividends-the expense
attributable to this exempt income may be
deducted from its taxable income. That might
read all right, but it does not sound very
good! However, I think there is no heresy in
what I have said. It is a little difficult sometimes to follow these things, and I prefer to
have the accurate statement on the record.
Hon. Mr. Woodrow: The holding company
that you speak of must be a Canadian holding
company?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Would it be better if
it was set to music?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): If the
honourable gentleman would sing it, it might
be more helpful still!
Section 6 also provides that payments to
or for immigrant children in their first year
of residence in Canada are assimilated to the
position of the family allowances provision
in so far as the tax approach to those allowances is made by the parent for the purpose
of the Income Tax Act.
Section 7 may be of general interest to
honourable senators. Under the provisions of
subsection (1) (a) of section 27 of the present
act individuals may make charitable donations in each year up to 10 per cent of their
gross incomes, and corporations up to 5 per
cent of their gross incomes. In sorme years
this limit can be exceeded; and the amendment allows a carry-over of the excess for one
year, but it does not increase the allowable
percentage in the following year. It will be
helpful to an individual who has been overly
generous in a given year, and finds subsequently that his total income has fallen off
slightly and that he has given more than he
was legally entitled to give. Under this provision he can carry over the excess.
The bill contains a provision in the same
section with reference to non-profit housing
corporations whose buildings are used for the
benefit of the aged. I am told that such
organizations, particularly in western Canada,
have ereçted buildings with funds most of
which carne from Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Strictly speaking, such bodies
are not charitable institutions, because they
must make a profit from their operations if
they are to pay off their mortgages. However,
in a very real sense they are doing works of

SENATE
charity, and hereafter donations made to
such organizations will be classed as "charitable" within the meaning of the Income
Tax Act.
Another subsection of section 7 deals with
medical expenses. Heretofore the remuneration of a full-time attendant for the taxpayer
or one of his dependents has been deemed a
medical expense. It is now proposed that costs
incurred by a taxpayer for service in a
nursing home shall be considered a medical
expense. Also the cost of maintaining a mentally-retarded person in a nursing home may
be included in medical expenses.
A general provision in subsection 3 of section 7 may be of interest. Charitable donations,
medical expenses, union dues, professional
membership dues and the like are allowed as
deductions, but hitherto, to qualify for such
deduction, a voucher had to be supplied. Now,
if the sum total of such items is less than
$100, vouchers will not be necessary. If no
vouchers are supplied the allowance will be
$100. If the sum total of such expenses exceeds $100, vouchers must be produced to
justify the claim.
Honourable senators, this explanationand I apologize for having been so long and
tedious about it-is my understanding, and I
think a reasonably fair understanding, of the
provisions of the present amendments of the
Income Tax Act. If the bill should receive
second reading I shall propose that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, probably for attention
tomorrow morning.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I have only a few words to say on this bill.
I think I am expressing the feelings of every
honourable senator present this evening when
I offer our thanks and gratitude to the honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr.
Connolly) for his most able explanation,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: -particularly when we
bear in mind the short time that he has had
at his disposal to familiarize himself with its
rather complicated provisions.
I want to voice my own view as welcoming
the introduction of this form of registered
retirement savings plan, to which the honourable senator from Ottawa West devoted a
good deal of the earlier part of his remarks.
As he said, over the last few years there
has been, on the part of corporations, a great
and increasing tendency to introduce pension
plans-mostly contributory-for the benefit of
their employers. Under the provisions of
the Income Tax Act, as amended from time
to time, contributions of employer and employee to these plans; within certain limits,

have been exempt from income tax or have
been allowed as a deductible expense for the
year in which they were made. The result
has been that to an increasing extent employees of corporations have received an advantage which has not been open to people
whom one may generally refer to as being
self-employed, such as doctors, lawyers, accountants. There has been no method whereby
anybody who is his own master, who does
not happen to work for a corporation, has
been able to set aside a certain part of
his income every year, tax free, for the
purpose of providing a pension for himself
in his old age. For some years past representations have been made to the Minister
of Finance with a view to the introduction of
some sort of system which would rectify that
injustice. For a long while it was supposed
that such a plan would be very difficult to
work out. I believe that the plan now before
us results largely from the fact that last year
a similar scheme was introduced in Great
Britain; and if I am not mistaken, the scheme
set out in section 17 of this bill is based
very largely on the British act. Is that
not so?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I
think so.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The honourable senator from Ottawa West has told us that this
bill is to a certain extent in the nature of
an experiment, and it may well be that in
the working out of this section it may be
found necessary to change it in order to
improve it, and that there will be some loopholes which it may be desirable to plug up.
But I think that, generally speaking, we
should welcome this proposal. I think it
is a fair and just proposal and will be for
the benefit of a large class of people in this
country who up to the present time have not
been able to provide for pensions for their
old age in the way that such pensions ought
to be provided.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
I should like to add a few words in praise
of the explanation of this bill by the honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr.
Connolly). I agree with the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) that
this legislation is a step in the right direction.
Pensions have become the order of the day
for large organizations, and now the individual is being given a similar opportunity.
I was not quite clear about the meaning of
the term "earned income". I take it that
that would mean income from salaries only.
I was wondering what position an individual
would find himself in if he contracted to
make certain payments and, after making
them for a number of years, suddenly found

APRIL 8. 1957
he had to use a portion of his savings or
reserve in order to keep Up the payrnents.
Would that portion of his saving then be in
the same category as an earned arnount?
The honourable senator from Ottawa West
rnentioned doctors and lawyers. Down our
way we are also interested in fishermen and
the farrners. I suppose the benefits of this
legisiation will be available to them.

arnount to considerably over $100. I understand the deduction for charitable donations
cannot exceed a certain percentage of total
income.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I arn
glad that the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) has
raised this point. This kind of legisiation was
resisted for a number of years on the ground
that it was class legisiation for professional
people and for certain categories of business
people who are generally described as "selfemployed". When the scheme was embarked
upon and when thîs provision was drafted,
apparently it was accepted on the ground
that it would not be available to oertain
specific classes only. Anybody -in the country
is entitled to embark upon it. Any taxpayer
can corne under it. Fishermen, farmers and
even people already rnembers of pension
plans may take advantage of it. Any person is
entitled to participate in týhis scheme of providing for his own needs in his later years.
I would not want to under-ernphasize that
fact for a single moment. Any taxpayer can
take advantage of the provisions of this
scheme.
With respect to my honourable friend's
question as to what is meant by "earned
income", I would say that in the flrst place
"earned income" is ahl income other than
"investment incorne". To be more specific,
earned income is defined in detail in section
32 of the act, and that definition has been
amended in section 9 of the bll. I do not
propose to read the appropriate section because it is too long, but the honourable
gentleman will see there that it includes
superannuation or pension benefits, retirement allowances and things of that character
as well as salaries or wages.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Perhaps
I did not make rnyself clear on this point.
You as an individual are allowed to make
charitable donations to the extent of 10 per
cent of your gross income and to get credit
for them if you have receipts frorn organizations which are recognized as charitable

case of an individual taxpayer, if his charitable contributions were less than $100 and
he did not bother getting receipts, he would
be entitled to a $100 deduction. The purpose
of the amendment, as was explained in the
other bouse, is to avoid a great deal of paper
work for the departrnent with respect to
those taxpayers whci contribute less than
$100 to charitable donations.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you.

Hon. Mr. Connolly: Ten per cent.
Hon. Mr. Taylor <Westmorland): I wonder
how this new provision applies. Is it in lieu
of the present provision?

Hon. Mr. Lambert: That would make it
possible for anyone who did not contribute
anything to be credited for $100?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In other words, it has
a general application to ail taxpayers?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Quite.
Hon. Mr. Taylor <Westmorland): And they
do not have to submit any receipts?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: They are allowed the
credit whether they made any contributions
or not?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.

SENATE
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. John J. Connolly: I move the second
reading now.
Honourable senators, this is a very short
bill and I would not detain the chamber tonight with respect to it were it not for the
fact that this act is administered by the taxation section of the Department of National
Revenue. In the event that it should go to
committee it would be more convenient for
honourable senators, I think, if both bills
were dealt with in the same committee at
the same time.
This bill can be explained very simply. The
main change is in clause 3. Under the Dominion Succession Duty Act every dutiable
estate is subject to duty under two headings,
namely, the "initial rate" and the "additional
rate". The "initial rate" of duty is based
upon the aggregate net value of the estate.
The aggregate net value of the estate is the
value of the estate after the debts, etc., have
been deducted.
I think this can be more readily followed
by giving an illustration. Let us say the
aggregate net value of an estate is $100,000.
In that case, under the rates of duty applied
by this act the "initial rate" would be 4.9
per cent. As well as the initial rate, there
is an "additional rate" which is levied upon
successions, based upon two factors: one, the
amount that passes to any one person; two,
the degree of relationship, or lack of relationship, between the deceased and the person
who is benefited.
Let me take again the example of an estate
with an aggregate net value of $100,000.
Let us say that out of that estate the widow
gets a bequest of $50,000. The rate of duty
applicable to her interest would be 6.9 per
cent. Let us say the deceased's father gets
$7,000. The rate applicable to his bequest
would be 4.2 per cent. Let us say that his
brother gets $10,000. The rate applicable to
his bequest would be 5.8 per cent. Let us
say the testator leaves $19,000 to a friend.
The rate applicable there-because it is in
"the stranger" class-would be 7.4 per cent.
And let us say, for the sake of argument,
that he leaves $4,000 to charity. That gift
would attract no additional tax. Heretofore
the aggregate net value would include the
$4,000 for the purpose of the initial rate of
tax. Under this amendment the amount of
the charitable gift is removed from the aggregate net value. Therefore in the case of
this estate, the aggregate net value, instead
of being $100,000, would be $96,000, and the

initial rate of duty, instead of being 4.9 per
cent, would fall to 4.8 per cent. That is the
explanation of section 3.
Clause 4 of the bill deals with an estate
which opens in a province which levies succession duties. Only two provinces in Canada
levy their own succession duty, namely, Ontario and Quebec. Heretofore the federal
deduction allowed for succession duty purposes under the Dominion Succession Duty
Act was the lesser of half of the federal duty
or the full amount of the provincial levy.
Under the amendment proposed by this
measure, hereafter the federal authority will
levy only 50 per cent of the federal tax on
property taxed by the province. This provision is designed to carry out a provision of
the Federal-Provincial Tax Sharing Agreements Act, which is Chapter 29 of the statutes
of last year.
There is but one exception to this general
rule, and that exception favours the province.
It deals with estates which have assets which
include superannuation or pension rights.
The Province of Quebec does not tax these
rights. The Province of Ontario allows certain exemptions for these rights. Under the
law as it now stands with regard to estates
which hold such assets, the federal authoritics grant a credit only where the province
taxes superannuation or pension rights. Under
the proposed legislation the federal authorities
will assume that superannuation and pension
assets have been taxed by the province in
which the succession opens. Accordingly, the
federal authorities will reduce its tax bill
against the estate by 50 per cent, whether the
province in fact taxes these assets or not. In
this way the province which imposes such
duties will now be free to impose duty on
superannuation or pension rights, if any one
of them sees fit to do so. If it does, then the
federal authorities will collect no more than
50 per cent of the duty payable under the
federal act on such rights.
Honourable senators, that is the explanation
of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Woodrow: Would the honourable
senator from Ottawa West say what is taxed
for succession duty purposes in an estate
which contains as an asset, or which includes
as an asset, either a superannuation or a
pension right? Is it the value of the periodic
payments, or is it the capital value of the
pension or superannuation?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: No; it would be the
capital value. When the value of the pension
right is determined it would be capitalized for
the purpose of succession duty purposes.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

THE LATE SENATOR McINTYRE
TRIBUTES

TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, before we proceed with the business
of the bouse may I refer to the sudden passing of one of our colleagues, Senator James
P. Mclntyre. I arn sure we were ahl shocked
last evenin-g wben we heard that he had
passed away, in Boston. It seems only a few
days ago tbat he was with us. It is true that
he did not then appear to be in the best of
health; nevertheless we d-id not think for
one moment that we would not see hima
again.
Senator ýMeîntyre was a close ýfriend of
many of us. He was always ready to talk of
our problerns; and 'he took a great interest
in the Senate. The first time I ever heard
him speak was in this chamber. I believe
on that occasion he was speaking on the
motion for an Address in reply to tbe Speech
from the Tbrone. He did not have a note in
his band or on bis ýdesk. I recaîl that be made
particuhar reference to Canada's national debt
and 'ber per capita debt. He also gave the
total debt and the per capita debt of each
province and be did all this without reference
to notes. He did not start at Newfoundland
or Nova Scotia and go across the continent,
but skipped frorn one province in the east
to British Columbia and back to Ontario,
and then out to Alberta, and so on. I believe
he also gave Canada's total population and
,that of each province. I thought it was an
amazing performance. I had neyer heard
anyone do such a thing before.
Senator Mclntyre was born on July 19,
1883, at St. Andrews, Prince Edward Island,
tbe son of William D. McIntyre and Elizabeth
McKinnon. His parents were- of that hardy
Scottish stock wbich immigrated to this continent to escape religious persecution in
their native Scotland. I amn sure it is unnecessary to summarize the achievements of
many of those hardy pioneers. Suffice to say
tbat that was the calibre of our late colleague.
The late senator was born and raised on
the farm, and 'became a f armer, but 'he also
branched out into other endeavours and
became one of the leading lobster packers in

eastern Canada. He was president of the
Savage Harbour Packing Company and a
director of several other business developments in his native province. At an early age
his ability in publie affairs was recognized,
and in 1917 he was a candidate for a seat
in the Prince Edward Island Legisiature, to
which he was first elected in '1919. He was
defeated in 1923, and re-elected in 1927, in
which year he was appointed Minister of
Public Works and Highways in the Government then headed by Premier Saunders. He
was re-elected in 1931 and 1935. In 1935 he
became Minister of Public Works and Highways in the Campbell Government and he
continued to hold a seat in the local Legislature until 1943. He was summoned to
the Senate on February 21, 1943.
Senator Melntyre was knorwn to a host of
friends on the Island as Jim Bill Mclntyre.
His kind and hospitable nature endeared him
to everyone, and I arn sure it will be difficuit
for many of his f ellow Islanders to accept
the fact that he is no longer with thema.
They will be comforted, however, by the fact
that his was a lif e dedicated to high purpose and public interest, for he has left a
legacy of good works long to be remembered.
I arn sure honourable senators will join me
in extending to his wif e and children sincere
sympathy in their very great loss.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
at a time like this it is difficuit to find words
to express what is in one's heart in referring
to the passing of one of our most respected
and lovable colleagues. I give that its full
meaning, for since Big Jim Mclntyre entered
this chamber I have regarded him as one of
my closest friends, and I feel bis passing very
keenly. I littie thought when he said good
bye to me, only a f ew days ago, that I would
neyer lay eyes on him again in this life.
Jim Mclntyre was a real Canadian citizen;
he was a patriot, a man who loved bis Canada,
but above ail bis native province, Prince
Edward Island.
He proved that by his
deotion to public if e. The honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) has referred to bis record as a
public man. I can only repeat that for 40
years our late colleague gave of bis best to
the government of bis province, and then he
was rewarded by a seat in the senior chamber
of the Canadian Parliament. He was most
attentive to bis duties, and very seldom,
missed a sitting of this body. He devoted a
good deal of time and interest to the work of
this chamber; and when he spoke he did so
with meaning, as is indicated by the illustration which the honourable leader gave us in
referring to one of the late senator's speeches.
Senator Mclntyre had a wonderfui memory,
and a wide knowledge of the important

SENATE
aff airs of his country. He was an honest,
upright and God-loving Christian man. I
do not think he did harm to anybody in his
life. He was gifted with the help of a most
wonderful wife; she was a charming and
lovable woman and made for him a splendid
home. About a year ago Senator McIntyre
was much concerned when his wife had to
go to hospital. Fortunately, she recovered and
came back. We little thought at that time
that in less than a year Senator McIntyre himself would have to go for treatment to the
same hospital, from which he would never
return.
I am deeply grieved by the passing of
Senator MeIntyre, and I wish to join with
the honourable Leader of the Government in
extending to Mrs. Mclntyre and the other
members of the family our most profound
and heartfelt sympathy.
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators,
it is with a great feeling of sadness that we
are called upon to mourn the passing of a
valuable and highly respected colleague and
member of this chamber.
Senator McIntyre's death is a distinct loss
to the Senate, and especially to Prince Edward Island, whose interests and welfare
were so near to his heart. He was one of
the Island's most outstanding citizens-well
known throughout the length and breadth of
the province. and indeed well known all over
Canada. He visited every province in connection with his duties as Minister of Public
Works in Prince Edward Island, and his
opinions and judgments were sought and
accepted as being sound and reliable.
Born at St. Andrews, Prince Edward
Island, the late Senator McIntyre left his
home as a young man to seek his fortune in
the United States. After a short while he
returned to his native province, where he
found the way of life more to his liking. He
acquired a farm on the beautiful shores of
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a few miles from
Mount Stewart, where he engaged in farming
and lobster packing and made a success of
both undertakings.
The Mclntyre homestead has always been
the epitome of hospitality, and both the senator and his wife extended a smile and the
hand of friendship to all who came to visit
them there.
Senator McIntyre gave 24 years of his life
to the public service of his province, first as
a private member of the Prince Edward
Island Legislature and later as Minister of
Public Works, before being summoned to
the Senate, in 1943.
I knew Senator McIntyre for many years
and found him always a true and sincere
friend. He could not be otherwise, for he

was fair, generous minded and big hearted,
a champion of what is best in life. He loved
people and was loved by people; he was a
popular and highly esteemed personality of
whom his province can be justly proud.
I wish to join with honourable senators in
extending to Mrs. McIntyre and their family
deepest sympathy in their great bereavement.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, on behalf of those of us whose
designations are associated with parts of
Upper Canada but who have had the privilege also of enjoying some of the charms of
Prince Edward Island, I feel that I would
be remiss if I did not say a word in tribute
to our late colleague. I had the pleasure
not so long ago of enjoying his warm hospitality at his homestead not far from
Charlottetown. I will not forget the interesting experience of trying to find his place,
of stopping on the road to inquire of a young
lad where Senator MenItyre's house was,
and being greeted with the question, "Do
you mean Big Jim Bill?". It was not difficult from then on to find the roadway into
his homestead, from where I think there is
one of the finest and most beautiful views
that I saw during my visit to the Island
that summer.
There was a warm simple Celtic hospitality
about Senator McIntyre and his wife and
family and their own home, which I think
might be regarded as characteristic of the
kind of hospitality that one receives on the
Island. I look back on that visit to his place,
which occupied most of one afternoon and
evening, with the greatest warmth of regard
for all that he stood for. I had met him
previously through my acquaintance with
another late colleague from Prince Edward
Island, Senator Jones, with whom he served
as a minister in the provincial Government,
and I learned to have a good deal of respect
for his ability. He was not a man who in
his early life had the opportunity of an
extensive academic background or of more
than an ordinary schooling, but he was
blessed with great natural talents, some of
which were reflected in this chamber on one
or two occasions when he sought to expand
a bit, in a vein of eloquence which I think
anyone might envy, on the beauties of Prince
Edward Island.
He will leave a real void in this chamber;
and on behalf of all of us from Upper Canada
-if I may put it that way-who learned to
have a real attachment for him, I express
deepest sympathy to Mrs. McIntyre and
family.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, the late Senator McIntyre well
deserved the eloquent and moving tributes

APRIL 9, 1957
which have been paid to his memory; and it is
comforting to those who survive our deceased
colleague to realize that friendships made in
the Senate are not broken even by death. I
have a vivid recollection of the strong handshake that Senator MeIntyre gave me after
my appointment to this chamber. He said to
me "I am glad that you are with us". It was
a touching welcome, and I shall never forget
it. I remember the senator as a man who
had a high sense of duty, and who remained
at his post in the Senate until a grave illness
forced him to go to the hospital. As I was
walking up to this building in his company,
only about a month ago, he told me that
some medical men had warned him that his
days were numbered. But he faced the
inevitable with courage, a courage inspired
by a profound and sincere belief in God. He
said, "I cannot do otherwise than try as much
as I can to stay longer with my family, if
it is God's will."
His was a quiet nature, but he was a man of
deep convictions. He was naturally gifted as
a speaker. I remember his powerful voice
and his accent of sincerity when be was
speaking in this chamber. As he was kind,
he had countless friends; and it is my privilege
to join all those who have so well spoken of
him, and who will still remember him, in
offering most profound sympathy to his
widow and their eight children.

The North Pacifie Fur Seal Conference
came to a successful close 'on February 9 this
year, in Washington, with the signing of the
Interim Convention for the Conservation of
North Pacific Fur Seals. The convention was
the result of extensive negotiations by delegations representing Canada, Japan, the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United
States of America, which began discussions
on November 28, 1955.
There are about two million fur seals in
the North Pacific ocean. Indiscriminate killing of seals would soon reduce their numbers
sharply and perhaps jeopardize their existence. This was demonstrated at the end of
the nineteenth century and later, when the
herds, whose numbers in the 1860's had
reached almost two million, fell to about
200,000 head in 1911 after commercial hunters
had relentlessly pursued them both on land
and at sea. Under the four-power Fur Seal
Convention of 1911, Canada, Japan, Russia
and the United States prohibited their
nationals from hunting the seals at sea. As a
result the population rose to 1,600,000 by 1941,
when the 1911 convention was terminated, and
the herd is now estimated to number over two
million. Meanwhile, during this 30-year period
of the original convention, over a million
skins were harvested on the breeding islands
by the governments having control of them.

bulls are taken by the hunters. The hunters
on the Asian Islands are employed by the
Government of the U.S.S.R., and the killing
on the Pribilof Islands, where 60,000 to
70,000 are taken anually, is done by the
United States. I might say that in 1956
over 120,000 were taken, but there were
some unusual circumstances with regard to
that kill. I am informed that the annual
kill will usually average between 60,000 and
70,000.
The convention provides among other
things for:
1. The establishment of a North Pacific
Fur Seal Commission of four members, one
from each of the signatories. The 1911 convention did not grant Canada and Japan
the right to participate in research and
management of seal herds on the breeding
areas, which are under the jurisdiction of the
United States and the U.S.S.R. Canada only
shared the skins. Now all four countries concerned will participate equally in the new
commission.
2. A six-year co-operative research program on: food habits in relation to effect
on commercial fisheries; potential damage to
fishing gear; what measures would result in
the optimum sustained yield of fur seals
in relation to other marine resources; and
fur seals taken at sea for research purposes.
The U.S.S.R. has undertaken to take up to
1,250 annually; Japan bas undertaken to take
up to 3,250 annually, and Canada up to 750
annually. There will be a very extensive
tagging program, and the United States will
endeavour to tag 50,000 on the Pribilof
Islands. The U.S.S.R. will tag 25 per cent
of the black pups on Commander and Robben
Islands.
3. The prohibition of pelagie sealing, which
is seal hunting at sea, except to a specified
extent for research purposes.
4. The boarding and search of vessels at
sea in suspicious circumstances, and the
arrest of vessels and crews upon reasonable
belief of seal hunting, with trial in the
country of the fiag of the vessel.
5. The enactment and enforcement by the
parties of such legislation and the application
of such measures as may be necessary to
guarantee the observance of the convention.
6. A sharing of the land kill such that
Canada and Japan will receive each year
from the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. 15 per cent
of the sealskins taken on the islands by the
latter two Governments.
The Canadian share is in compensation for
not killing the seals as they move along the

coast of British Columbia on their annual
migration from California to the Pribilof
Islands. The net return from our percentage
of the fur seals, which are processed and
sold on the auction fur market, is placed in
Last year this
the consolidated revenue.
amount was almost $1 million.
Canada's interest, apart from this direct
monetary one resulting from the kill, is very
great. In the research program it is hoped
to learn whether, for instance, the continuation of a large seal population would be
detrimental to the valuable salmon and halibut resources of the Pacifie. The fur seal,
although omnivorous, is known to have a
daily menu of fish, and a 600- or 800-pound
bull must have an enormous capacity.
Canada's assignment in the research program is to examine the stomachs of the seals
taken at sea, in order to gather data regarding what kind and quantities of food are
taken by the seals. It is evident that this
information will be of great value in assessing the effect of the seal herds on the Pacifie
fisheries.
The convention will enter into effect upon
the deposit of ratifications in Washington by
the four signatories. It will continue in effect
for six years, although in certain circumstances the term may vary from six years.
The parties agree to hold a meeting toward
the close of the research program to determine what more permanent arrangements
may be necessary for the conservation of the
herds.
The convention is now in the process of
being ratified by the Japanese Diet and the
United States Congress. Ratification by the
U.S.S.R., which has already signed the interim convention, should not be a very long
or doubtful process.
Bill 412 is the legislation necessary for
Canada to implement the interim Convention
on Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals.
The clauses of the bill parallel the articles of
the convention, which is attached as a
schedule to the bill. This approach is the
one followed in the past in ratifying other
international conventions.
I should like to conclude my remarks with
a reference to the continued good work being
done by the Minister of Fisheries and his
able staff, in the field of conservation of the
resources of the sea.
May I remind honourable senators that in
1950 ratification was given to the setting up
of the International Commission for the
North West Atlantic Fisheries. This commission is actively engaged in research and
international acceptance of regulation of the
haddock fishing through the use of a size of
net mesh which will allow the smaller haddock to escape. In 1953 came the ratification

of these bills is going to compare to the
Income Tax Act in intricacy of provisions.
I might also say that for a measure of this
kind it is almost impossible to compete with
bills that have to do with the mating habits
of seals on the west coast or with the balmy
breezes that blow into the province of Alberta,
both in summer and winter. I know that,
from the point of view of popularity, a
measure of this kind simply cannot appeal
to the membership of the Senate in the way
these other two measures did.
May I first of all make a few very general
observations on the Excise Tax Act, which
is chapter 100 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada. It seems to me that for a financial
measure of this kind it is a little easier to
understand the amendments if you know
generally the bill which you are amending.
In general, the act is divided into a number
of segments: one deals with the excise tax
on insurance premiums, another with the
tax on magazines, another with the taxes on
automobiles, televisions and commodities of
that character which are subject to an ad
valorem excise tax. All these taxes are
collected at the manufacturer's level. Another

Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, may
I be permitted to say one word more? I
imagine my friend the Leader of the Government thinks I have manufacturers in
mind. I am not thinking of manufacturers,
but rather of people in many other lines of
business in this country which find it difficult
to get along but receive no assistance at all
from the Government.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I hope my friend was

Hon. Mr. Euler: They do not need assistance.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

SENATE
under the heading "Foodstuffs" there are a
number of additions which will now be
exempt from sales tax, such as baking powder,
baking soda, cocoa, cocoanut, meat.tenderizers,
pie fillings, prune juice, tea, coffee and substitutes therefor.
I understand the loss to the revenue, or the
saving to Canadian taxpayers on tea, coffee
and substitutes therefor, is some $10 million.
The total saving to Canadian taxpayers,-or,
looking at it the other way, the total loss
of revenue-from exemptions listed under
this measure, is some $19 million.
Under the heading "Farm and Forest" there
is an exemption provided for "potted, flowering or bedding plants; dormant flower bulbs,
corms, roots and tubers; eut foliage".
Under the heading "Printing and Educational", on page 8 of the bill, "desks and
chairs specially designed for use in school
rooms when sold to educational institutions"
are new exemptions; and on page 9 under
the same heading, "printing for school boards,
schools and universities, for use by such institutions and not for resale".
Then certain building materials are added
to the long list of building materials already
exempt from the sales tax.
Honourable senators will be interested to
know that "gasoline powered" as well as
"diesel powered" self-propelled trucks for
off-highway use in quaries and in mines are
no longer to be subject to sales tax. Likewise,
too, under the "Miscellaneous" heading,
equipment sold to or imported by municipalities for road cleaning or road making, or
for fire fighting purposes, at a price in excess
of $500 per unit, are now to be exempt from
sales tax. Heretofore, the price minimum was

under this heading.
I should mention too that 75 per cent of the
sale price, if they are manufactured in Canada,
or of the duty paid value, if they are imported,
of trailers for use as homes, will not be
subject to sales tax. That is a concession, I
understand, welcomed warmly in the construction industry, particularly where extensive
construction work is going on at points distant
from the centres of population.
So much for the exemptions under the
sales tax schedule, which is schedule III of the
bill.
The ad valorem excise tax, which is usually
referred to under this measure as "excise tax",
is also removed from certain goods which are
now taxable under schedule I of the bill, such
as soft drinks, candy, motor cycles, fountain
pens and items of that character. These are
now to be exempt from the excise tax.

Under schedule II, Canadian raw leaf
tobacco, which was formerly subject to this
tax in the amount of eight cents a pound,
will be free of it.
These are the main financial provisions of
this measure; but a few other things are
sought to be done under the bill. In the first
place, a very long title, which was appropriate in 1915, when the act became law,
is now deleted, and for it will be substituted
the name "An Act respecting Excise Taxes".
An interesting and, I believe, a useful
provision is contained in section 3, with
reference to the automobile industry. As
honourable senators know, automobiles are
now subject to an excise tax and a sales
tax. Generally speaking, I understand those
engaged in the automobile industry have never
been particularly concerned about the existence of the sales tax, because it is not likely
that, with such a tax in existence, automobiles would be exempted. But from time to
time changes have been made in the excise
tax on cars. Usually these changes are made
at the time of the budget, which as a rule
comes down in the spring, when new models
of cars have begun or are beginning to come
out. In that period of the year dealers are
very reluctant to stock up with new cars
before the budget if there is any prospect of
relief in respect of excise taxes. For that
reason it has always been a problem between
manufacturer and dealer as to who shall
store new cars, and under what conditions.
Also, manufacturers have been complaining
that the reluctance of dealers to order or take
delivery of cars has slowed down the tempo
of the industry at that period of the year.
The change proposed is that, contrary to
what has obtained heretofore, the excise tax,
though not the sales tax, will not attach at
the time of the transfer of possession from
the manufacturer to the dealer, but the
excise tax will apply only when title passes
from the manufacturer to the dealer, if the
car is made in Canada, or when the importer
takes title to it, if the car is imported. In
other words, dealers will be able to order
cars, take delivery of them upon consignment,
and hold them in stock without being then
subject to excise tax. The tax will become
payable only when the dealer buys the car
from the manufacturer.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: As I understand it,
under the bill, the dealer is not obligated
to pay that tax until he sells the car to the
ultimate purchaser.
Hon.

Mr.

Connolly

(Ottawa West):

The

position has always been that, once possession passes from the manufacturer to the
dealer, the tax applies.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is so.

APRIL 9, 1957
,Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): But
under the amendment, that will no longer
be the situation: in future the tax will apply
only when the dealer takes title to the car.
This arrangement is much fairer to the dealer,
and I think it is better for the manufacturer
as well.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: It will not be
necessary for the dealer to take title to the
car until he sells it? Although it will be
in his possession, he will not take title to it?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): He can
take title when he sees fit. He can hold the
car on consignment. But I imagine the dealer
would not take title until he had made a sale,
and then he would pass the tax on immediately. Heretofore the complaint has been
that the dealer had to pay the tax when he
took possession and then, perhaps before he
sold the car, the amount of the tax was
reduced by Parliament, so he could not
charge the full tax to his customer. The
dealer is now to be relieved of any uncer-tainty in that regard.
Hon. Mr. Baird: In other words, the cars
will be on consignment.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Precisely.
I thank the honourable senator: that is the
neatest way of putting it.
Hon. Mr. Power: Could not that always be
done by arrangement between the dealer and
the manufacturer? In other words, the dealer
could be treated as a warehouseman.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That
could have been done by contract, excepting
that there is a provision of the law which
states that, once possession passes, the tax
applies. I know that a number of years ago
cars, perhaps by the thousands, were stored
by General Motors in a field near Oshawa.
As I remember it, some of the officials of that
company were very much concerned at the
possibility of destruction or damage through
falling aircraft or other hazards. These cars
were stored there by the manufacturers
simply because the dealers were not taking
them, perhaps for lack of room, but knowing
also that if they took them before the budget
came down, and the tax were reduced, they
stood to lose a great deal of money. I understand in one year the dealers did lose
considerable money.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is not the matter rather
one of actual ownership than of mere possession of cars?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): As the
law is-that is, before this amendment is
adopted-the tax applies at the time of transfer of possession regardless of who may then
legally be the owner.

Hon. Mr. Davies: As I understand from
what the honourable senator has told us, the
amount which the Government will eventually
receive will be the same, but it will get it at
a different time.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That, I
think, is so, unless in the meantime the tax
is reduced, in which event the tax payable
will be at the rate applicable at the time the
dealer takes title to the car.
Hon. Mr. Davies: That would be when the
budget is brought down? There would be no
change in the intervening period?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Usually
the amount of the tax is not changed between
budgets: that is, from one spring to the
next.
Perhaps I should mention one other provision of section 5. It is designed to enable
the minister to extend the date within which
the taxpayer must make his return to the
department under the Excise Tax Act.
Heretofore, due to circumstances completely
beyond the control of the taxpayer, he might
be late in making a return within the month
or two months allowed by the act, and
sometimes his late filing might be due to ill
health, or inclement weather delaying postal
delivery, and things like that. I understand
the minister has been using discretion in
allowing such late .filings to be made without assessing a penalty.
However, the
Auditor General, who is the watchdog of
the Treasury, found a number of these cases
and challenged the minister's right to allow
this kind of late filing without penalty. He
was supported in that by the law officers of
the Crown in the .Department of Justice.
The result has been that in order to regularize
a practice which has been followed in the
department for a number of years, there is
an amendment to section 5.
Section 6 of the bill simply rewrites the
schedules. I think that is of great convenience both to taxpayers and to legislators.
Section 7 of the bill provides that the
new exemptions will go into effect on March
15, 1957, with the exception of the change
in the date of the imposition of the excise
tax on automobiles. That became effective
on February 1, 1957, a date which antedated
the budget, for it was desired to give that
much help to the automobile industry in
advance of the budget.
Honourable senators; that is the explanation of the principal features of this bill.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
suppose one should commend the Government for anything that it does in the way of

SENATE
reducing taxation, although some of us might
think that reductions could have been made
in other directions as well.
At this time I should like to refer to
Schedule III of the bill, which lists exemptions on foodstuffs. I have often wondered
upon what principles these exemptions are

exempt from the 10 per cent sales tax because they are necessities? I do not know.
As I have said before in this house, the list
seems to be fearfully and wonderfully made.
They make fish of one commodity and flesh
of another.
Hon. Mr. Baird: What about margarine?
Hon. Mr. Euler: My friend is anticipating
me. I regard that as quite unfair, for margarine is my own particular hobby. I once
tried to have margarine inserted among the
list of exempted articles, but I did not get
by with it. This house voted me down. Let
us look at Schedule III. There are now being
added to foodstuffs already exempt such
items as baking powder, baking soda, and
cream of tartar. I do not object to that at
all. I am all in favour of it. Lard and
yogurt were in the list before. Cooking oil
and salad oils are still exempted. I wonder
if margarine could get in under that item.
Mayonnaise and salad dressings are being
added to the exempted articles. They are
very important articles of food. Another
addition to the list is edible gelatine. Whatever that is. I do not know.
Among the further additions are flavouring
extracts, gravies and meat extracts. Ice
cream is on the list; it has always been
exempt. I am in favour of that, but why
should it be exempt and not the commodity
to which my honourable friend from St.
John's (Hon. Mr. Baird) referred? Peanut
butter is on the list. This bas always been
exempt, and, horror of horrors, one of its ingredients is imported from the United States.
Those who are opposed to margarine altogether-though they are in favour of the
sales tax on it-base their strongest argument on the fact that it is made from vegetable oils which are imported from the United
States. I cannot see any reason why margarine, which is largely made from imported oils,
should be in a different category from peanut
butter, the peanuts for which are imported
from the United States.
Also included in this list of exempted foodstuffs are such new items as pickles, relishes,
catsups, sauces, olives, horseradish, mustard,
pie fillings, and sandwich spreads. I wonder
whether margarine could come in under the
heading of sandwich spreads. I wish the
officials who drafted the list had been more
specific and put margarine down there in
black and white.

Honourable senators, I mention these items
for the simple purpose of pointing out that
there is the rankest sort of discrimination so
far as margarine is concerned. After all,
margarine is a food. I have said that in this
Margarine is, of
chamber many times.
course, a substitute for butter. It sells at
about half the price of butter and is a great
boon to many people in this country. There
is no question about that at all.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Surely people should have
the right to purchase whatever foodstuff they
want, as long as it is healthful.
I should like to refer to another matter,
although in doing so I may be out of order,
for it is beyond the competence of the Senate
to deal with it. I refer to the continued
prohibition against the colouring of margarine.
This practice is not permitted in any province
except the intelligent provinces of British
Columbia and Newfoundland. The right to
continue this practice was one of the conditions under which Newfoundland entered
Confederation with Canada. If the Government wants to be consistent and exempt
articles of foodstuffs from the tax, certainlyit should include margarine. It would mean
a reduction of about 2 cents a pound in the
cost of the margarine to the consumer. Margarine is quite inexpensive, and the removal
of the prohibition against colouring it would
mean that even more people would use the
product. This, of course, is a matter for the
provinces. Factories would be well pleased to
put artificial colouring in the margarine, as
they did when margarine first became legal,
but the provinces have forbidden this. Perhaps
the worst province in this respect is Quebec.
In a grocery store in Trois Rivières-Three
Rivers-I found something that looked exactly
like butter. It was parcelled a little differently and it was very well sealed. It was
openly on sale in that store, although the sale,
purchase or possession of margarine in Quebec
is illegal.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Why does the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) insist upon giving manufacturers the
right to colour margarine? Is it in order to
have that commodity compete with butter?
Hon. Mr. Euler: No.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: What is the reason
then?
Hon. Mr. Euler: To make the product look
a little more appetizing.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Because butter is
more appetizing?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my honourable friend
admit that butter is also coloured artificially?

APRIL 9, 1957
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Sometimes, but flot
ail the time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I maintain that every individual should have the right to purchase and
use margarine of any colour that he prefers,
just as he has the right to purchase and wear
clothes of any colour.
I wish to point out again the inconsistencies
that are inherent in this list of exempted
foodstuffs.
One need only look at it to
observe that there is no more logical reason
for exempting certain foods in the list than
there would be for exempting many that are
not in the list.
Han.
Austin
C. Taylor:
Honourable
senators, I had no thought of saying anything
concerning
this bull
until my
honourable friend referred to margarine, and
in particular to the colouring of it. I should
like to know why the manufacturers of
margarine were so insistent in colouring their
product exactly the same colour as butter.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why is leatherette made in
the same colours as leather?
Hon. Mr. Taylor <Westmorland): I arn
talking about margarine. So far as butter
is concerned, I have made and printed a lot
of dairy and creamery butter in my time.
1 will admit that there may be two months
i the year when, if dairy cows do not get
much succulent feed, such as turnips and
silage, butter will need some artificial colouring; but if the cows are getting succulent
feed there is no need for artificial colouring.
I make butter on my own farm, and 1 get
natural yellow butter ail through the winter
months. That is why, when the ban on
margarine was lifted, I was one of those
who advocated that no colouring should be
permitted.
I was in the Department o!
Agriculture of New Brunswick at the time,
and I recaîl very distinctly being called
by certain manufacturers in Canada and
told that unless something was done to permit
colouring I would be ruined politically in
New Brunswick. My answer was that if that
wou:ld defeat me in New Brunswick 1 would
take defeat.
Honourable senators, 400,000 Canadian
families depend on the dairy industry. I
admit that probably the industry cannot
compete with the same industry in some other
parts of the world, sucli as New Zeaiand and
Australia, and parts of Europe. However,
the large group o! Canadian people dependent
on this industry should, I think, be recognized
and asslsted on a national scale when necessary. 1 do not complain, and I neyer will
complain, about any assistance given to the
prairie farmers, and 1 know that many o!
them will fot obJect to an assistance given

to eastern farmers, because we have reached
a time when we understand ea*ch other. I
think ýit is -a fact that a great many eastern
f armers are receiving benefits and assistance
from the federal authorities. I intend to
say something about that at a later date,
probably before the end o! this session. In
ail fairness, I must say that over the y cars
the western farmers have developed the
ability to organize themselves well enough
to present their problems fore!ully before
their provincial Governments, as well as
before the federal Government.
We in
eastern Canada have not yet reached that
fortunate position, but are fast getting there,
and we are glad to join hands with the
western farmers to help agriculture as a
whole.
In closing, may I say that I hope that in
Canada manufacturers will not be permitted
to colour margarine like butter at any tîmenow or in the future.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why not ban margarine
altogether?
Hon. Mr. Baird: I would like to tell the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.

we hope to have it for ail time.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill 408, an Act to amend the
Customs Tariff.

SENATE

He said: Honourable senators, this is a
fairly simple bill, much simpler than the
bill we have just been discussing. May I
express the hope that it will give rise to
as interesting a debate as did the last bill?
Generally speaking, the provisions of this
bill reduce duty, but there is one exception
-there is an increase of duty on potatoes
imported from the United States.
The first section of the bill reduces duty on
some 65 different items in the tariff. This is
accomplished sometimes by changing the position of the items in the tariff as it exists now,
sometimes by adjusting wording, and at other
times by bringing order-in-council items into
the tariff itself, and thereby making those
provisions statutory law rather than law by
order in council.
I must say that schedule A in this measure
is perhaps not as illuminating a document to
read as are the tables to be found in the
Commons Hansard, for March 14, beginning
at page 2233. That was the date of the
Budget speech. Comparative tables are given
there, showing the present position of each
tariff item and the position which would
result from these amendments. I put that
reference on the record in case honourable
senators are interested in seeing what the
provisions of the tariff were prior to the
amendments we are now enacting.
Section 3 makes changes in five different
items, which are all set out on page 12 of
the bill. They clarify cases in which drawbacks may be claimed. For example, it was
formerly provided that certain items of
machinery "for use in" plants manufacturing
automobiles could be the subject of a claim
for a drawback. The words "for use in"
are now changed to read "used in"; in other
words, the drawback may now be claimd
only after the machinery is installed and used
for the purpose for which it was originally
intended under the item.
Section 4 of the bill strikes out two items
of the tariff. Heretofore item 1206 prohibited
the importation of adulterated tea, and item
1207 prohibited the importation of animals
suffering from contagious diseases. It has
been found that the importation of adulterated
tea is now prohibited by regulations made
under the provisions of the Food and Drug
Act. So it is redundant to have it in the tariff.
It is also found that the importation of
animals suffering from contagious diseases is
prohibited by regulations made under the
Animal Contagious Diseases Act. Therefore
it is unnecessary to have that item in the
tariff.
By section 4 Schedule D is enacted. It provides by item 1220 of the tariff that "offensive
weapons" as defined by the Criminal Code

may not be imported into Canada. Heretofore this prohibition has been made effective
by Order in Council passed under the provisions of section 279 of the Customs and
Excise Act, on the recommendation of the
Minister of National Revenue. It is now proposed that this be done by legislation which,
I think, is the better way of doing these
things.
There are certain exceptions in Schedule D
to which the words "offensive weapons" do
not apply: for example, standard shotguns,
weapons intended for army stores and antique
items are not considered to be "offensive
weapons" within the meaning of the Criminal
Code or this section of the tariff.
Section 2 corrects a word used in the
French translation of tariff item 422a. The
phrase sought to be translated, I am told, is
"transporting scraper unit". The word used
originally in the French translation was
transporteurs. The proper word, I am informed, is racleurs. That change is made.
Perhaps the most interesting of all these
changes is that made in connection with
potatoes. Heretofore, between August 1 and
June 14 in every year potatoes were imported
to Canada from the United States free of
duty. For a six-week period, however, between June 15 and July 31 each year, potatoes
attracted a duty of 37ý cents per hundredweight. In other words, except for six weeks
each year Canada was wide open for the free
importation of mature or old potatoes from
the United States. I may say it will still be
possible, under the change I am about to
describe, to import new potatoes free of duty
from the United States in the period from
January 1 to June 15.
Recently negotiations were conducted between American authorities and officials of
the Department of Finance and of the Department of External Affairs, pursuant to the
provisions of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, called GATT. As a result
of these negotiations the American authorities
agreed that Canada could impose a duty of
371 cents per hundredweight on potatoes
coming into Canada from the United States
at any time of the year. Canada sought that
amendment in the GATT. But this amendment, like others, was not given without a
certain amount of quid pro quo. The condition under which the American authorities
relented and relaxed their adherence to the
GATT provisions in respect of potatoes was
this: Canada could export to the United
States 2j million bushels of seed potatoes and
1 million bushels of table potatoes at the low
rate of duty imposed by the American
authorities on this type of product. Under the
new arrangement these quotas have been
reduced as follows: seed potatoes, from 2j

APRIL 9, 1957
million to 1 million bushels; table potatoes,
from 1 million bushels to 600,000 bushels. In
other words, Canadian seed potatoes now
going to the United States in quantities in
excess of 1 million bushels will not qualify
for the low rate of American duty, which is
374 cents per hundredweight. They will
attract the higher rate of 75 cents per
hundredweight.
That, honourable senators, is the general
explanation of the bill.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: May I ask the
honourable senator from Ottawa West a question? Would he state again the quota of
seed potatoes allowed to enter the United
States market at present?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I understand that before this revision of the provisions of GATT was made Canada could
export to the United States 24 million bushels
of seed potatoes each year, and 1 million
bushels of table potatoes, at the low rate
of duty imposed by the United States on these
two commodities.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is that arrangement confined to any particular time of the year?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No, I do
not think there is any time limit.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): What is
the quota now?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
reduced quota for seed potatoes will be
from 24 million to 1 million bushels, and
for table potatoes from 1 million to 600,000
bushels.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): From
recent press report I was under the impression that the combined total of 34 million
bushels of table stock and seed had been
reduced by only one million bushels, namely,
600,000 bushels on certified seed and 400,000
bushels on table stock. According to information the honourable gentleman has just given
us, the quota is apparently reduced by 14
million on certified seed.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That is
the information I have. If the honourable
gentleman would care to refer to the House
of Commons Hansard-unfortunately I do not
have it at hand-he will see the figures
given there. They can be checked against
the ones I gave. Perhaps we could allow this
bill to stand until tomorrow, and in the
meantime we can check those figures. I
would be very happy to agree to that.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): I am quite
concerned about this item because, as I say,
I was under the impression that the reduction was only 600,000 bushels on certified seed

and 400,000 on table stock, on the total of
3è million bushels. According to the figures
we have just been given the reduction is
14 million bushels.
May I at this time express my appreciation
to the negotiating team for the Canadian Government and the officials from the United
States government for their efforts to bring
about some uniformity in these duties, or
what I have called for many years countervailing duties, which could not be free
both ways. I have had some experience in
this field, having attended four conferences,
two in Canada and two in the United States,
when the matter of tariffs on fruits and
vegetables was being discussed between the
two countries. I know that the Canadian
team faced a difficult task. However, I do
know this new arrangement is going to mean
a great deal to the potato growers of New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and British
Columbia. Therefore, I pay my tribute to the
Government in its efforts to negotiate the
question with reasonable satisfaction. I hope
that a review of the figures will show my
understanding of the reduction by 1 million
bushels to be correct. At the same time, I say
that while we are probably not entirely
satisfied, because we felt that the quota
should not have been touched at all, the fact
remains that we are grateful for the consideration that has been given to the potato
growers in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend from
Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) a question?
The reductions in the quota seem to be
very substantial, and while I think you mentioned it I do not recall now what the quid
pro quo was. What concession do we receive?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Heretofore, between the lst of August and the 14th
of June each year, potatoes imported into
Canada from the United States were free
of duty. In other words, for a six-week
period only, namely from the 15th of June
to the 31st of July each year, they attracted
a duty, when coming from the United States,
of 374 cents per hundredweight.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And that is increased?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West: What
has happened is this: we could charge duty
for a period of six weeks only on the importation of American potatoes, and now under
the new arrangement Canada can impose
a duty of 37.5 cents ,per hundredweight on
American old stock potatoes, no matter when
they are brought in. But for new potatoes
the same provision remains. That is, we can
get new potatoes from the United States free
of duty between the lst of January and the
15th of June each year.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): Honourable senators, I have before me a copy of
the House of Commons Hansard of April 5
which contains the statement by the Minister
of Finance in relation to an agreement between Canada and the United States. At page
3131, on the right-hand side a little over
half way down the page, I read:

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): From
2.5 million to 1.9 million bushels, and from
1 million to 600,000 bushels. I am sorry I
misled the honourable gentleman.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

The trade agreements to which I have referred
provided for certain concessions to Canada on
potatoes by way of reductions from the United
States statutory tariff rate of 75 cents per hundredweight. Under GATT the United States has been
obliged to admit at least 3.5 million bushels at a
reduced rate of 37.5 cents per hundredweight; this
has been made up of 1 million bushels of table
stock and 2.5 million bushels of seed.
Under the new agreement, and as a condition of
getting freedom of action to make the tarifT changes
which I am proposing, the United States is reducing
the present tariff quotas by 1 million bushels;
400,000 bushels will be taken off the table stock
quota and 600,000 bushels will come off the seed

Hon. Mr. Quinn: The C.N.R. also included

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. Of course the
C.P.R. also has some airplane operations,

they are not nearly as extensive as those of
the Trans-Canada Air Lines.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Does the Canadian National
Railways not issue a separate report with
respect to its steamship operations? I thought
those operations came under the heading of
the Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships, Limited.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think my honourable
friend is right.
I should like to refer for a few minutes to
the details of this figure of $304,707,000 which
appears at the top of page 2 under the heading of Gross Capital Expenditures. There are
five different items under this heading. The
first is expenditures of $118,605,000 for road

property.
deducted the $36 million for expenditures for
uncompleted work that I referred to a few
minutes ago, leaving expenditures for the
current year for road property at $82,605,000.
That is for general improvements on the
railway system, of which I have fairly complete details here. They will be available
to honourable senators if and when this
bill receives second reading and goes to
committee.
This heading of road property is broken
down into a number of items for the different
regions of the system. The subheadings are
roadway improvements, large terminals, communications, buildings, yard tracks and sidings, roadway and shop machinery, signals,
highway crossing protection, line diversions
and general. They total $82,605,000.
The second item under gross capital expenditures is branch line construction. The
particulars of this item also will be available in committee. There is only one really
important branch line in respect of which
caiptal expenditures are expected to be made
in the current year, and that is the line in
the province of Quebec between Beattyville,
Chibougamau and St. Felicien. It is expected
that $9,470,000 will be spent on this line.
There is also a line in the province of New
Brunswick from Bartibog to the Heath Steele
Mines, which is expected to cost $2,100,000,

making a total, with a few minor items, of
$11,820,000. From this total, however, there
is to be deducted a subsidy of $2,375,000
voted by Parliament for the BeattyvilleChibougamau-St. Felicien line, bringing the
net total to the figure shown in the bill,
$9,445,000.
The next item under gross capital expenditures is $12,631,000 for hotels. Of that amount
by far the largest proportion, $12,300,000, is
expected to be spent on the Queen Elizabeth
Hotel in Montreal.
The next item is a very large one,
$147,569,000, for equipment. Honourable senators will realize that there are three principal
items of equipment expenditure which the
railway company is forced to make under
present conditions. The first is for dieselization of its motive power. The second is
for modernization of its passenger equipment,
and the third is for acquisition of large
numbers of additional freight cars to meet
the growing requirements for freight cars
as a result of the great prosperity now
prevailing in the country. Of this item of
$147,569,000, nearly $87 million is represented
by payments for equipment which has already
been authorized by Parliament but which
will not be delivered and paid for until this
current year. Authority is also being requested for the ordering of additional equipment estimated to cost some $132 million, of
which approximately $54 million is expected
to be paid in the current year. This expenditure involves new orders for 373 locomotives, 92 passenger train cars, 3,800 freight
cars, and so on. The locomotives, of course,
are all diesel locomotives and form part of
the long-term dieselization program of the
motive power division of the railway
company.
The fifth item under the heading of gross
capital expenditures is $16,457,000 for investment in affiliated companies. That represents very largely the advances made by
Canadian Nation-al Railways to the TransCanada Air Lines for which, as I said, and
as honourable senators know, the Canadian
National Railways is responsible. Of that
$16 million odd the company expects to
advance $13 million to Trans Canada Air
Lines during the current year.
There are two further items of additional
working capital, totalling $14 million, which,
with the items I have mentioned, make this
total of capital expenditures asked for 1957
of $282,707,000.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Has the honourable senator the figures for operating revenues and
expenditures of Canadian National Railways?

APRIL 9. 1957
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have them both for
last year, which are in the annual report for
1956, and the anticipated revenues and expenses for the current year, which are in
this table of estimates, which will be available
in the committee tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I was just wondering
what the deficit was.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, there is not a
deficit. In fact, there was a surplus last year
of $26 million, which was available to pay
dividends on the preferred shares.
Hon. Mr. Davies: That is a change from
two years ago.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Quite a change, yes.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Have you the C.P.R. surplus for last year?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If I can find it, I can
take it out of the annual report. It is a little
difficult to tell exactly what the surplus was.
The C.P.R. had railway revenues of $505
million, and railway expenses of $463 million,
so that it had net earnings from the railway
of $41 million. I am using round figures.
Then it had other income of $30 million,
which represents income from hotels and
steamships, dividends from its shares of Consolidated Mining and Smelting Corporation,
and other things, making a total net income
of $71 million. It had fixed charges of $15
million, bringing the income down to $55
million. Dividends amounted to $27j million,
and the final balance was a surplus of $28
million.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: For a smaller company?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if we shall have a copy of the
estimates of Canadian National Railways for
the current year?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The estimates of income and expenditure?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I did not get my copy,
as I did when I was a member of the House
of Commons, and I wondered if we could
have copies of the estimates tomorrow at the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes, that is just
what will be available. I have a copy in my
hand at the moment of what the company
calls its operating budget for 1957, giving
estimated operating revenues, expenses, fixed
charges, and surplus. Copies of this paper,
and details of the other items under discussion, will be available to the members of
the committee tomorrow morning, as well as
copies of the Canadian National Railways
estimates for the current year.
82719-33J

It may be of interest to honourable senators to know how it is expected to finance
this $282 million of capital expenditures:
which are requested for the current year.
This is the way they are expected to be
financed: $84j million out of revenue, that is,
revenue applied to depreciation and to debt
discount amortization; $24 million by the sale
of 4 per cent preferred stock to the government under the statutory provision for the
sale of preferred stock to which I referred
a few minutes ago; and $174 million by temporary loans from the dominion Government. So that by and large it is expected that
as a result of this financing authorization
sought in this bill, and assuming all these
expenditures are made, the net long term
debt of the Canadian National Railways will
be increased by approximately $175 million.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am not clear in regard to
the amount of bonds. Is the Canadian National Railways going to float bonds to the
extent of that amount?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, that is not the way
it is done. The dominion Government makes
temporary advances to the Canadian National
Railways for these surplus expenses, and
those are sometimes funded by way of long
term debt from the Canadian National Railways to the Government, and sometimes they
are repaid by long-term bonded indebtedness
of the Canadian National Railways itself,
which are sold to the public and the proceeds
refunded to the Government.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: And you mentioned 4 per
cent?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Four per cent is the
dividend rate on the preferred shares, which
the minister buys every year from the Canadian National Railways to the extent of 3
per cent of the gross railway earnings of the
'company for the previous year.
Honourable senators, I admit this is rather
complicated, and it is somewhat difficult to

Hon. Mr. Davies: You are doing fine.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You are very clear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: So much for the first
item of capital expenditures sought under this

point, may I ask a question in connection with
the road improvements you mentioned for the

APRIL 9, 1957
There is one further thing I think I should
say, looking at this bill in a very general
way. These are very large capital expenditures proposed by the Canadian National
Railways, and I think we should look at them
against the background of the general
economic situation which exists in the
country at the present time. There is great
economie activity; there are excessive calls
upon the country's resources in men, materials and capital, and we have the resulting
increase in interest rates and the threat of
inflation.
I believe honourable senators will find that
the officials of the Canadian National Railways are alive to this situation, and that they
have sought, despite the very large figures
that I have submitted to you, to reduce their
capital requirements and cut them down from
what they would have felt justified in asking
for had conditions been different. In that
connection I should like to quote to the house
some remarks made by Mr. Donald Gordon,
the President of the Railway, when he appeared before the House of Commons Committee on Railways and Shipping, on
Tuesday, March 19 last. He said:
In developing the 1957 proposais we have had
particular regard to the impact on the Canadian
economy of large C.N.R. capital expenditures during
a period of heavy demand upon the resources of
the country. On the one hand we feel we have a
basic obligation to provide efficiently for an important proportion of the massive and expanding
transportation needs of the economy despite the
impact of rising costs, while on the other hand no
prudent and responsible management could ignore
the influence which the capital program of an
organization as large as the Canadian National has
on the general price structure. The development
of a capital program under such circumstances bas
not proved to be an easy task.
We decided to impose severe restraint on ail
recommendations reaching headquarters from our
field officers and to insist that a high degree of
essentiality must be demonstrated before projects
were permitted into the budget now before you.
In the course of this screening it will be of interest
to record that we made reductions totalling some
$120 million. This reduction was painful since it
entailed deferring projects from which we could
have derived economic benefits and limiting expenditures on self-liquidating projects to those
which will produce an unusually high rate of
return.

Mr. Gordon replied:
No. It means that the rate in spending had got
to the point that we were involved in projects
that could not be stopped. A great deal of our
1957 expenses arise out of commitments which have
been entered into. For instance, there was the
matter of equipment. We had placed orders for
equipment last fall in connection with the diesel
program. We had to do so in order to get delivery
any time this year. I can give you a general
picture in that respect: that we had estimated our
requirements in the first approach, what we would
need in the way of equipment requirements on the
basis of traffic our retirements of equipment and
the figure for the utilization of equipment, and we
budgeted for 7,600 units of equipment to take care
of equipment of all kinds.
But we cut that
arbitrarily in half. We have not yet placed our
orders for box cars because we are not satisfied
with the prices quoted. We are now negotiating
with the car companies telling them that we think
their price is too high.
We have cut our planned dieselization program.
We had it in mind this year to start complete
dieselization by areas. You may remember that I
said in previous committees that we would attack
our dieselization program on the basis providing for
specific services, in a five year program. We finished
it last year and this year we started on complete
dieselization on a territorial basis. Our plan was
to start on each coast, west and east, and gradually
complete it right towards central Canada. On the
basis of that program we planned 654 units but we
eut that down to 373 units. In other words we
reduced it by 281 units which meant about $58
million.
That means that the progressive rate
of our dieselization bas been slowed down. We
have just slowed the whole thing down on the basis
that we are attempting to do too much and that the
country is attempting to do too much having regard
to its productive capacity.

I thought that that would be of interest
to honourable senators as indicating that the
officials of the Canadian National Railways,
notwithstanding these enormous amounts to
which I have referred, are fully aware of the
necessity of not over-burdening the economy
of the country.
If this bill receives second reading I will
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications, and as is customary, officers of the
railway company will appear before that
committee and be prepared to answer questions, not only on this particular bill, but any
other questions which honourable senators
may wish to ask them with reference to the
operations of the Canadian National Railways. As honourable senators know, this is

the Judicature Act of that province has been

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No change in salaries.
Hon. Mr. Davies: That's tough luck.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is equity, but

The other provision is with respect to the

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot moved, pursuant to notice:

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators I rise on a point of privilege. From
time immemorial in the desks of all members, bilingual or not, there has been only
stationery with an English letter-head. It
is time for reform and I suggest that the
Senate should give instructions to whom it
may concern that at least one pad of stationery with a French letter-head, and a
package of envelopes printed in French,
should be put in the desks of all bilingual
senators. It would be an opportunity to
win an easy victory over routine.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I shall be glad to
bring the request of the honourable senator
to the attention of those concerned. I see
a possible difficulty, however. Whom would
the honourable senator include within the
term "bilingual"?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: By "bilingual" I mean
the senators who speak English and French,
and those who speak Gallic, and any other
language besides the official languages of
Canada. I thank the honourable gentleman
for helping the Senate to win another victory
over routine.

That, in the opinion of the Senate, Canada
should have a distinctive national flag consisting
of a large green Maple Leaf (the colour of the
House of Commons) as the National Emblem of
Canada, on a red background (the colour of the
Senate) without any other emblem of any kind on
the fly.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. A. K. Hugessen, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, presented the report of the
committee on Bill 411.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to whom was referred the Bill (411)
intituled: "An Act to authorize the provision of
moneys to meet certain capital expenditures of the
Canadian National Railways System during the
calendar year 1957, and to authorize the guarantee
by Her Majesty of certain securities to be issued
by the Canadian National Railway Company",
have in obedience to the order of reference of
April 9, 1957, examined the said bill and now
report the same without any amendment.

The report was adopted.

He said: Honourable senators, I hope that
all of you will consider my brief remarks as

tioned a proposal for a Canadian flag, and
the motion as it is before us is just an illustration of an idea, which would be represented by other illustrations. I mean that
the flag which Canada will fly may be very
different from the one that is mentioned in
my motion-future generations may adopt a
different national emblem to put on the
national flag.
I wonder if you would be interested,
honourable senators, in being made acquainted with the answers that I have got
since I spoke about the flag a few days ago.
From Toronto I received this impressive
design which I am showing you, with three
gold lions, three red maple leaves, and next
to them three fleurs-de-lis and three other
maple leaves. This is so complicated that
it may cause a headache. The lion, being
part of the royal arms, could not be put on
any flag without special permission of the
Herald in London. I wonder if the permission has been obtained. Anyway, we have
no lions in Canada. The only lion we have
in Canada is the cougar, which is called the
wild lion of our forests, and it is not an
animal which deserves to be on our flag. This
is the first reply that I got and it comes from
a gentleman in Toronto. It was the best flag
designed by an adult, according to Time
magazine, but Time magazine is not discrimiiating with regard to the designs of flags.
Another reply was from a young man in
Montreal. His design represents a small
maple leaf, which looks like a green apple,
and there is a small Union Jack, a small
French flag on a diagonal, and a star with
the letters "UN", representing the United
Nations. The maple leaf is for Canada, the

SENATE
tricolour for French Canada, the Union Jack
for the Commonwealth, and the United
Nations star for peace. The idea is fine but
the design is not good. I do not see how we
could fiy a flag like that.
I have another one. It shows a genuine
maple leaf pasted on red and blue sections,
the dividing line between them being vertical.
That comes from Quebec City.
From Quebec City and from Toronto I received letters advocating the so-called union
flag-not the Union Jack, but the league flag.
It is a maple leaf between two trianglesa white triangle to represent the people of
French origin, and a red triangle to represent the people of English origin.
I say
again I have never held that a white triangle
could represent the people of French origin
in Canada, nor that a red triangle could
represent Canadians of British origin. I will
read my letter: it was addressed to a correspondent in Toronto.
Many thanks for your letter of April 9, concerning a national fiag for Canada. The reason I am
not enthusiastic for the flag depicted on the letterhead of your stationery is that, according to the
standards of heraldry, triangular flags were those
of the illegitimate branches of a family.

For this reason I thought that that flag
was improper. I will not enlarge on this any
more, since there are ladies amongst us.
From the vicinity of Ottawa I received an
illustration of a proposed flag which I am
now exhibiting. It has a red background,
with ten small maple leaves in the left top
corner. You cannot imagine what is shown
in a circle on the red portion: it is a rodent,
a beaver. Although the beaver is a very
industrious creature, I do not think we should
have a rodent on our flag. I answered the
gentleman who sent me this illustration by
telling him that I congratulated him on his
interest as displayed in a so-called Canadian
flag. But evidently it is impossible to have
a true Canadian flag at the present time,
because the people of Canada must first be
educated in the meaning of a national flag
and the significance of the emblems which
appear upon it. That brings me to the
science of heraldry. The best description of
this science appears in a booklet entitled

to make known in a small space a surprising
amount of information about his social position and
family history.

So heraldry dates back to the time when
very few were taught to read and write.
But they could read pictures, just as threeand four-year-old children are able to read
pictures before they can read or write. Older
people in those times were able to read the
rneaning of the shields used by each
family.
With regard to the motion now before
the house, I described the same flag on
previous occasions and I received a letter
from an elderly gentleman who lives near
Montreal. He thinks that heraldry is the
most important science in the world. He
has the nobility particle in his name. He
wrote:
Let me tell you gently of all the arts it is the
heraldic art that you ignore most.
Your flag,
deprived of all eloquent symbolism, proves it. If
you had sent your design to the Parliamentary
Committee of 1954 . . .

His is all mixed up there.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That Joint Parliamentary Committee functioned in 1945 and
1946.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Yes. The letter continues:
. . . it would have been simply thrown into the
wastepaper basket.
A sincere friend, believe me.

It is signed "Mr. X".
There is some worry in the minds of
important people; for instance, in the minds
of no less important people than the General
Synod of the Anglican Church.
They
authorized as their official colours the red
cross of St. George set on a white field with
a green maple leaf in each of the quarters.
The idea is good, but I regret that the Anglican Church has left aside the crosses of St.
Andrew and St. Patrick. But it is a suggestion. They are in need of a new flag. And
the padre of the West Nova Scotia Regimental Association said at Charlottetown in
September of last year that we should have
a national fiag. Many others have said that
previously. Even the Indians have had some
trouble about their own flag. I have here a

navigation has made great progress, and I
repeat that I do not see why the Union Jack
should be minimized in the corner of the
Maritime flag, including the Red Ensign that
is used for the time being in Canada. It
should be flown full-size, in the same way
as the French flag, the American flag and
the flags of most nations of the world. They
are used for public and private purposes.
I have here a copy of an address I delivered
from the Toronto Junior Board of Trade at
the King Edward Hotel, Toronto, on March
22, 1955. However, there is nothing that
embarrasses me more than to quote myself,
so I will abstain from quoting any part of the
speech, but what I will say is that I took
to Toronto a design which consists of a bright
green maple leaf on a bright red background.
The only suggestion that I received which was
different from that design came from a member of the Junior Board of Trade, who told
me: "I am for your flag in reverse. I would
like a red maple leaf on a green background."
I have another suggestion, from a gentleman who lives in West Gravenhurst, Ontario.
He writes:
My suggestion for a flag for Canada is a maple
leaf in fall colours (red, shaded with gold or
brown) on a medium gray field.
Yours for a
decent future for our children, . . .

From the north, from Sudbury, I received

a different suggestion:
a single large green maple leaf on a gold
background would immediately be recognized as
the symbol and emblem of Canada ail over the
world as at the present time it is difficult for an
amateur to distinguish and name many foreign
flags.

The writer lives in the mining country,
and it is not surprising that he suggests gold
in the flag.
A young lady, a school child, wrote me
that on the flag there should be the words:
Dieu et mon droit. She wanted a truly
distinctive Canadian flag. I said, "If we consider your suggestion politically the Canadian
flag would be no longer the Canadian
flag, with those words; they come from the
arms of English royalty, and if you put it
as a prayer that ensign will not any more
be a flag, it will be a religious flag." she
did not answer.
Well, now, the trouble with the Red
Ensign is that it may be flown upside downand it happened. On March 12, 1955 there
was an item in the press to the effect that
Red Ensigns persist in flying upside down on
public buildings in Ottawa. At the recent
conference in Bermuda the Union Jack was
flown upside down, and it was taken for a
distress signal; everybody was very much
82719-34

concerned about it, according to the news in
the press. It is a curious thing that one day
I was passing the post office in Quebec
city and over the post office I saw the Red
Ensign with a big hole in it. When I
returned to Ottawa I asked the Minister of
Public Works if the hole in the fiag was a
part of our national emblem.
I could tell you much more, but I would
like to come to this part of my speech by
giving you a ray of hope. It is that there
are some youths who have the right idea
about the flag. Once one of my former colleagues of the House of Commons invited me
to meet at luncheon some students from
his county, in the province of Ontario. I
gladly accepted, and there I met some very
nice bright boys and girls who came from
western Ontario. Some time afterwards I
received the following letter from one of
those young ladies:
We are having debates in history. My debate
topic is "Canada should have ber own distinct
National Flag".
I was wondering if you have any information
about this. Could you send me designs of suggested
flags for Canada?
I am taking the affirmative side of the debate, so
I need about six substantial points for it.
Yours sincerely,
God be with you always!

Very nice! And this is her answer to my

reply to that letter.
Dear Sir,
Today I an writing you not for more information
about a fiag but to thank you for your kindness
in sending the information. It certainly came in
handy today. The affirmative (my side) won. The
students agreed that Canada should have ber own
flag.
Wishing you the best for the coming year, I
remain,
So-and-so.

It is comforting to me that we have the
right to expect that in the next generation,
or in the generation after the next, Canadians will have a flag with one national
emblem that will teach all the nations of the
world that Canada is the finest country of
the world.
But there are other signs of hope. Yesterday one of our esteemed colleagues showed
me his design of a flag. It is the maple
leaf as the emblem of Canada, with stripes,
red, white and blue alternatively, the bars
representing the provinces of Canada. It is
a beautiful flag, indeed. Today another one
of our esteemed colleagues told me that he
was in favour of a large maple leaf in the
centre of a white field; he prefers white to
red. But all this is immaterial. I am not
here to advocate the selection of one colour
rather than another. All I want you to
think about is that we should have a national flag in Canada. Three provinces out

SENATE
of ten have their own flags. Nova Scotia has
a beautiful flag, with the cross of St. Andrew
on a white field, and the arms of the province; it was given to Nova Scotia centuries
ago by King James. The next province to
have a flag was Quebec. It has a very fine
flag, which was adopted by the Legislature
without a dissenting voice. You sec it on
the provincial buildings, on homes, and elsewhere. And recently the province of Newfoundland adopted its own flag. The provinces, just the same as individuals, have
the right to have their own flag. Who can
prevent it? It is the symbol of a large
section of the country. And those three provinces are ahead of all the other provinces
because they have realized the importance
of having their own flags, which they
use on all provincial public buildings, in
Canada as well as outside this country.
If my honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) is interested in having an
answer to the question he asked a few days
ago, I will tell him what I think. An imperialist is a man who wants his country to
have a larger territory than its natural
limits. I will explain: some years ago in
the House of Commons I advocated the
establishment of Canada as an empire by
having the West Indies as our colony. We
have no tropical climate, and I thought it
was a bright idea that Canada should be an
empire. But Mr. Bustamente, one of the
leading statesmen of the Islands, said that
I did not know what I was talking about,
and his pride was offended. Instead of the
West Indies becoming a colony of Canada,
they became a dominion, part of the Commonwealth.
An imperialist is a gentleman who thinks
that his country should be greater, and I
admire him as long as hle remains a citizen
of that country. But if he goes elsewhere
to live with his family and still thinks that
the other country, any country, is greater
and more important than the one in which he
lives, then he is no longer an imperialist,
but has become a colonial. I hope I am
understood in that explanation. A colonial
is the counterpart of an imperialist.
I would like to give some more information
about a national flag, and I would like to
show other designs. Therefore, I ask honourable senators to allow me to adjourn the
debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pouliot, the debate
was adjourned.

ANSWER
Replies by the Honourable the Secretary
of State for External Affairs:
The Suez Canal
1. The preamble to the Constantinople
Convention of October 29, 1888 states that
the signatory powers-Great Britain, AustriaHungary, France, Germany, Italy, The
Netherlands, Russia, Spain and Turkeywere "desirous of establishing, by a Conventional Act, a definitive system intended to

SENATE

guarantee, at all times and to all the Powers,
the free use of the Suez Maritime Canal, and
thus to complete the system under which the
navigation of this canal has been placed by
the Firman of His Imperial Majesty, the
Sultan, dated February 22, 1866. .. ". They
agreed upon the following articles, which
make up the operative
part of the
Convention:
"Article I. The Suez Maritime Canal shall
always be free and open, in time of war as
in time of peace, to every vessel of commerce
or of war, without distinction of flag.
The Canal shall never be subject to the
exercise of the right of blockade.
Article II. The High Contracting Parties,
recognizing that the Fresh-Water Canal is
indispensable to the Maritime Canal, take
cognizance of the engagements of His Highness the Khedive towards the Universal Suez
Canal Company as regards the Fresh-Water
Canal; which engagements are stipulated in
a Convention dated March 18, 1863, containing a preamble and four Articles.
They undertake not to interefere in any
way with security of that Canal and its
branches, the working of which shall not be
the object of any attempt at obstruction.
Article III. The High Contracting Parties
likewise undertake to respect the equipment,
establishments, buildings and work of the
Maritime Canal and of the Fresh-Water
Canal.
Article IV. The Maritime Canal remaining
open in time of war as a free passage, even
to ships of war of the belligerents, under the
terms of Article I of the present Treaty, the
High Contracting Parties agree that no right
of war, act of hostility or act having for its
purpose to interfere with the free navigation
of the Canal, shall be committed in the Canal
and its ports of access, or within a radius of
3 nautical miles from those ports, even
though the Ottoman Empire should be one
of the belligerent Powers.
Warships of belligerents shall not take on
fresh supplies or lay in stores in the Canal
and its ports of access, except in so far as
may be strictly necessary. The transit of the
said vessels through the Canal shall be
effected as quickly as possible, in accordance
with the regulations in force, and without
stopping except for the necessities of the
service.
Their stay at Port Said and the roadstead
of Suez shall not exceed 24 hours, except in
case of putting in through stress of weather.
In such case, they shall be bound to depart
as soon as possible. A period of 24 hours
shall always elapse between the sailings of
a belligerent ship from a port of access and
the departure of a ship belonging to the
enemy Power.

Article V. In time of war, belligerent powers
shall not discharge or take on troops, munitions, or war materiel in the Canal and its
ports of access. In case of an accidental
hindrance in the Canal, however, troops
broken up into groups not exceeding 1,000
men, with a corresponding amount of equipment, may be embarked or disembarked at
the ports of access.
Article VI. Prizes shall in all respects be
subject to the same rules and regulations as
the warships of belligerents.
Article VII. The Powers shall not keep
any warship in the waters of the Canal
(including Lake Timsah and the Bitter Lakes).
They may, however, have warships, the
number of which shall not exceed two for
each Power, stationed in the ports of access
of Port Said and Suez.
This right shall not be exercised by belligerents.
Article VIII. The Agents in Egypt of the
Signatory Powers of the present Treaty shall
be charged to see that it is carried out. In
any circumstance threatening the security
and free passage of the Canal, they shall meet
at the summons of three of them and under
the presidency of their Doyen, to make the
necessary verifications. They shall inform the
Khedivial Government of the danger perceived, in order that it may take proper steps
to assure the protection and the free use of
the Canal. In any case, they shall meet once
a year to take note of the due execution of
the Treaty.
These latter meetings shall be presided over
by a Special Commissioner appointed for that
purpose by the Imperial Ottoman Government. A Khedivial Commissioner may also
take part in the meeting, and may preside
over it in case of the absence of the Ottoman Commissioner.
They shall demand, in particular, the removal of any work or the dispersion of any
assemblage on either bank of the Canal, the
purpose or effect of which might be to interfere with the freedom and complete safety
of navigation.
Article IX. The Egyptian Government shall,
within the limits of its powers based on the
Firmans, and under the conditions provided
for in the present Treaty, take the necessary
measures for enforcing the execution of the
said Treaty.
In case the Egyptian Government should
not have sufficient means at its disposal, it
shall appeal to the Imperial Ottoman Government, which shall take the necessary measures
for responding to such appeal, give notice
thereof to the other Signatory Powers of the
Declaration of London of March 17, 1885, and,
if necessary, consult with them on the matter.

APRIL 10, 1957
The provisions of Articles IV, V, VI, and
VII shall not stand in the way of the measures
taken by virtue of the present Article.
Article X. Likewise, the provisions of Articles IV, V, VII, and VIII shall not stand
in the way of any measures which His
Majesty the Sultan and His Highness the
Khedive in the name of His Imperial Maiesty,
and within the limits of the Firmans granted,
might find it necessary to take to assure by
their own forces the defense of Egypt and
the maintenance of public order.
In case His Imperial Majesty the Sultan
or His Highness the Khedive should find it
necessary to avail himself of the exceptions
provided for in the present Article, the
Signatory Powers of the Declaration of
London would be notified thereof by the
Imperial Ottoman Government.
It is also understood that the provisions
of the four Articles in question shall in no
case stand in the way of measures which the
Imperial Ottoman Government considers it
necessary to take to assure by its own forces
the defense of its other possessions situated
on the eastern coast of the Red Sea.
Article XI. The measures taken in the
cases provided for by Articles IX and X of
the present Treaty shall not interfere with
the free use of the Canal. In the same cases,
the erection of permanent fortifications contrary to the provisions of Article VIII is
prohibited.
Article XII. The High Contracting Parties,
by application of the principle of equality as
regards free use of the Canal, a principle
which forms one of the bases of the present
Treaty, agree that none of them shall seek,
with respect to the Canal, territorial or commercial advantages or privileges in any international arrangements that may be concluded.
Furthermore, the rights of Turkey as the
territorial Power are reserved.
Article XIII. Aside from the obligations
expressly provided for by the clauses of the
present Treaty, the sovereign rights of His
Imperial Majesty the Sultan and the rights
and immunities of His Highness the Khedive
based on the Firmans are in no way affected.
Article XIV. The High Contracting Parties
agree that the engagements resulting from
the present Treaty shall not be limited by
the duration of the Acts of Concession of the
Universal Suez Canal Company.
Article XV. The stipulations of the present
Treaty shall not interfere with the sanitary
measures in force in Egypt.
Article XVI. The High Contracting Parties
undertake to bring the present Treaty to the
knowledge of those States which have not
signed it, inviting them to accede thereto.

Article XVII. The present Treaty shall be
ratified, and the ratifications thereof shall be
exchanged at Constantinople within one
month or sooner if possible."
Egypt was not a signatory to the Convention of 1888. At that time Egypt was
a part of the Ottoman Empire. Since attaining independence it has affirmed that it is
bound by the Convention.
2. A statement by President Nasser, giving assurances that freedom of navigation in
the Canal would not be affected by the
nationalization of the Suez Canal Company,
was circulated on July 31, 1956, to all -diplomatic missions in Cairo. It was worded
as follows:
"On July 26 the Suez Canal Company was
nationalized. This exercise by the Egyptian
Government of its rights has, however, given
rise to some opposition from a few Governments, particular those of France and
Britain. Such opposition is devoid of all
foundation. The Suez Canal Company has
always been an Egyptian company, and, like
all other Egyptian companies, liable to be
nationalized. This nationalization does not
in any way or to any extent affect Egypt's
international commitments.
"We are determined as ever to honour all
our international obligations, and both the
Convention of 1888 and the assurance concerning it given in the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1954 will be fully maintained. Freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal is
neither affected nor involved in any manner
or to any degree. No one could be more
interested than Egypt in the freedom of
passage through the canal.
"We are certain that traffic through the
Canal will in the coming years justify all
our hopes and those of the whole world.
Egypt is confident of the righteousness of
her stand. She will not be deflected from
the course she has charted for herself, but
will proceed in the service of her own interests and those of the world community of:
nations."
3. The text of the "Anglo-Egyptian Agreement Regarding the Suez Canal Base" dated
October 19, 1954 is as follows:
"The Government of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
the Government of the Republic of Egypt,
Desiring to establish Anglo-Egyptian relations on a new basis of mutual understanding
and firm friendship, have agreed as follows:
Article 1. Her Majesty's Forces shall be
completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory in accordance with the Schedule set
forth in Part A of Annex I within a period
of twenty months from the date of signature
of the present agreement.

SENATE
Article 2. The Government of the United
Kingdom declare that the Treaty of Alliance
signed in London on the 26th of August, 1936,
with the Agreed Minute, Exchanged Notes.
Convention concerning the immunities and
privileges enjoyed by the British Forces in
Egypt and all other subsidiary agreements,
is terminated.
Article 3. Parts of the present Suez Canal
Base, which are listed in Appendix A to
Annex II, shall be kept in efficient working
order and capable of immediate use in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of
the present Agreement. To this end they
shall be organized in accordance with the
provisions of Annex I.
Article 4. In the event of an armed attack
by an outside Power on any country which
at the date of signature of the present Agreement is a party to the Treaty of Joint Defence between Arab League States, signed in
Cairo on the 13th of April, 1950 or on Turkey,
Egypt shall afford to the United Kingdom
such facilities as may be necessary in order
to place the Base on a war footing and to
operate it effectively. These facilities shall
include the use of Egyptian ports within the
limits of what is strictly indispensable for
the above-mentioned purposes.
Article 5. In the event of the return of
British Forces to the Suez Canal Base area
in accordance with the provisions of Article
4, these forces shall withdraw immediately
upon the cessation of the hostilities referred
to in that Article.
Article 6. In the event of a threat of an
armed attack by an outside Power on any
country which at the date of signature of
the present Agreement is a party to the
Treaty of Joint Defence between Arab League
States or on Turkey, there shall be immediate
consultation between Egypt and the United
Kingdom.
Article 7. The Government of the Republic
of Egypt shall afford over-flying, landing and
servicing facilities for notified fiights of aircraft under Royal Air Force control. For the
clearance of any flights of such aircraft, the
Government of the Republic of Egypt shall
accord treatment no less favourable than
that accorded to the aircraft of any other
foreign country with the exception of States
parties to the Treaty of Joint Defence between Arab League States. The landing and
servicing facilities mentioned above shall be
afforded at Egyptian Airfields in the Suez
Canal Base area.
Article 8. The two Contracting Governments recognize that the Suez Maritime Canal,
which is an integral part of Egypt, is a
waterway economically, commercially and
strategically of international importance, and

express the determination to uphold the
Convention guaranteeing the freedom of
navigation of the Canal signed at Constaninople on the 29th of October, 1888.
Article 9. (a) The United Kingdom is
accorded the right to move any British equipment into or out of the Base at its discretion.
(b) There shall be no increase above the
level of supplies as agreed upon in Part C
of Annex II without the consent of the Government of the Republic of Egypt.
Article 10. The present Agreement does
not affect and shall not be interpreted as
affecting in any way the rights and obligations of the Parties under the Charter of the
United Nations.
Article 11. The Annexes and Appendices to
the present Agreement shall be considered
as an integral part of it.
Article 12. (a) The present Agreement
shall remain in force for the period of seven
years from the date of its signature.
(b) During the last twelve months of that
period the two Contracting Governments
shall consult together to decide on such
arrangements as may be necessary upon the
termination of the Agreement.
(c) Unless both the Contracting Governments agree upon any extension of the
Agreement it shall terminate seven years
after the date of signature and the Government of the United Kingdom shall take away
or dispose of their property then remaining
in the Base.
Article 13. The present Agreement shall
have effect as though it had come into force
on the date of signature. Instruments of ratification shall be exchanged in Cairo as soon
as possible."
It should be noted that the signatory
powers, in an agreed Minute related to the
signing of the Agreement, specifically agreed
that the term "outside power" used in
Articles 4 and 6 should not include the State
of Israel.
4. Discussions with Egypt regarding the
provision of a total of $70 million by the
United States and the United Kingdom toward the cost of construction of the Aswan
Dam project had been going on since late in
1955. The "offer" by the two governments
may for practical purposes be said to date
from December of that year. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development had also agreed, in February 1956, to
participate "when requested" in the foreign
financing of the Aswan scheme to the extent
of $200 million.
5. Although there were numerous press
reports late in 1955 and during the first seven
months of 1956 about offers of financial assistance by the Soviet Union for the Aswan

APRIL 10, r957
project, the Government has no official information as to the existence or extent of any
such offers. It may be of interest to note
that on July 22, 1956, three days after the
State Department announced withdrawal of
the United States offer, the Soviet Foreign
Minister stated publicly that the Soviet Union
did not regard the question of financing the
Aswan Dam as an urgent problem, since
there were "many other problems not less
vital for the Egyptian economy, particularly
those connected with industrialization". He
reiterated that the Soviet Union would give
"favourable and friendly consideration" to
any request for economic aid which Egypt
might make.
6. The Egyptian Government was informed
by the United States on July 19, and by
the United Kingdom on July 20, that US
and British participation in financing the
projected Aswan Dam was "not feasible in
present circumstances". The following explanatory statement was issued by the State
Department:
"At the request of the Government of
Egypt, the U.S.A. joined in December, 1955
with the United Kingdom and with the World
Bank in an offer to assist Egypt in the construction of a High Dam on the Nile at
Aswan.

This project . . . would require an

estimated 12 to 16 years to complete at a
total cost estimated at some $1,300,000,000,
of which over $900,000,000 represents local
currency requirements.
It involves not
merely the rights and interests of Egypt, but
of other States whose waters are contributory, including the Sudan, Ethiopia, and
Uganda.
The December offer contemplated an extension by the U.S.A. and the U.K. of grant
aid to help finance certain early phases of the
work, the effects of which would be confined solely to Egypt, with the understanding
that accomplishment of the project as a
whole would require a satisfactory solution
of the question of Nile water rights. Another
important consideration bearing upon the
feasibility of the undertaking, and thus the
practicability of American aid, was Egyptian
willingness and ability to concentrate its
economic resources upon this vast reconstruction program.
Developments within the succeeding seven
months have not been favourable to the success of the project, and the U.S. Government
has concluded that it is not feasible in present circumstances to participate in the project. Agreement by the riparian States has
not been achieved, and the ability of Egypt to
devote adequate resources to assure the project's success has become more uncertain
than at the time the offer was made.

This decision in no way reflects or involves
any alteration in the friendly relations of
the United States and Egypt. The U.S.A.
remains deeply interested in the welfare of
the Egyptian people and in the development
of the Nile. It is prepared to consider at an
appropriate time and at the request of the
riparian States what steps might be taken
toward a more effective utilization of the
water resources of the Nile for the benefit of
the peoples of the region. Furthermore, the
U.S.A. remains ready to assist Egypt in its
efforts to improve the economic condition of
its people, and is prepared .. . to discuss these

matters within the context of funds appropriated by Congress."
No statement was issued by the United
Kingdom Foreign Office, other than the
announcement that United Kingdom participation in the project was "not feasible in
present circumstances".
The International Bank announced on July
24 that its off er of a loan of $200 million had
automatically expired, upon withdrawal of
the United Kingdom and United States offers.
7. It is not possible to examine exhaustively
within the scope of this reply the complex
effects of the closing of the Suez Canal on
the economies of the United Kingdom and
France. However, some general statistics on
United Kingdom and French traffic through
the Suez Canal give an indication of the
extent of the dislocation involved.
During 1955, the latest full calendar year
during which the Canal was open to regular
traffic, about 21 million tons of crude oil, or
about 75 percent of the United Kingdom's
requirements, came through the Suez Canal.
Oil satisfies about 15 per cent of the total
energy requirements of the United Kingdom.
Nearly 25 percent of the United Kingdom's
total import and export trade is with countries normally reached via the Canal.
About 22 percent of France's imports, including oil, and about 11 percent of its exports
pass through the Suez Canal. Roughly 45
percent of France's oil supplies are normally
imported through the Suez Canal.
8. Article VIII of the Anglo-Egyptian
Treaty of Alliance of 1936 states that the
Canal is an "integral part of Egypt" and there
is an identical statement in Article 8 of the
Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1954. There is
a divergence of views concerning rights relating to the use of the Canal. Egypt's obligations regarding the operation of the Canal
derive primarily from the provisions of the
Constantinople Convention of 1888, the interpretation of which also is a matter of dispute.
(See for example Article I of the Convention.)
9. A brief factual account of the major
developments in the Suez Canal dispute up

SENATE
to the end of December, 1956 may be found
in the White Paper entitled "The Crisis in
the Middle East".
Israel and Egypt and the Actions of the
United Nations
1. (a) The State of Israel was created by a
proclamation issued on May 14, 1948 signed
by 37 persons representing the Jewish people
in Palestine and the World Zionist Movement,
who together composed a provisional government pending the establishment of duly
elected bodies of the new state.
(b) Those mainly responsible for Israel's
establishment were:
(i) The persecutors of Jews in Europe.
(ii) The World Zionist Movement, which
for decades advocated and worked for
a Jewish national revival in Palestine
with the aid, particularly after 1929, of
many non-Zionist Jews. Founded in
1897, the Zionist Movement "accepted a
two-fold task, one the external struggle
for political independence and the
other the internal struggle to convince
the Jewish masses to re-adapt their
lives to the requirements of national
independence". After years of internal
educational work through Zionist federations in countries having considerable Jewish populations, and after
failing in efforts to enlist the support of
the Ottoman government then in control of Palestine, Zionist leaders secured
from the British Government in the
Balfour Declaration of November 2,
1917 a promise of support for the principle of the establishment in Palestine
of a national home for the Jewish
people. In 1919, after the British
occupation of Palestine had begun, a
survey of the situation in Palestine was
made by a Zionist Commission and the
work of raising funds for the establishment of Jewish immigrants in Palestine,
for the purchase and development of
land in the name of the Zionist movement and for the development of agricultural and industrial enterprise and
a well-organized Jewish society in
Palestine under Zionist auspices entered a new and more active phase. In
1942 the Zionist Movement, no longer
willing to acquiesce in the regulation
by others of Jewish immigration and
land purchase in Palestine, committed
itself publicly to the principle of creating a "Jewish Commonwealth" in
Palestine in which Jewish control
would be established over immigration
and development policy. In 1947 the
Zionist Movement accepted and worked
for the principle of the partition of

Palestine in order that a Jewish sovereignty might be established in part
of the country upon the termination of
the British mandate.
(iii) The Government of the United Kingdom, which administered Palestine
under the terms of a League of Nations
mandate providing among other things
for the establishment in Palestine of a
"national home" for the Jewish people
without prejudice to "the civil and
religious rights of existing non-Jewish
communities in Palestine, or the rights
and political status enjoyed by Jews in
any other country". The British administration continued until the Jewish
population of Palestine had increased
from approximately 80,000 in 1919 to
approximately 750,000 in 1948 and until
about 7 per cent of the land of the
mandated territory, including urban
land, had passed into Jewish possession
by gradual purchase. The United Kingdom Government, considering that the
further development of the Jewish
national home in Palestine was a matter
on which the Jews and Arabs would
have to agree between themselves in
the interests of both parties, declined
to be responsible for permitting Jewish
immigration to continue indefinitely in
the absence of such agreement and in
April 1947 referred the question of the
future of Palestine to the United
Nations General Assembly.
(iv) The United Nations. The General
Assembly recommended on November
29, 1947 that the British mandate should
be terminated in 1948 and that there
should be created in Palestine independent Arab and Jewish states of
approximately equal area, together
with an internationally administered
City of Jerusalem, the three political
units to be within the framework of a
single economic union. (For text of
resolution see United Nations, Official
Records of the Second Session of the
General Assembly, Resolutions, pages
131-150 and end-map.) This recommendation was not accepted by the
Arabs, who demanded the creation of
a single independent Palestinian state
with its existing population, one third
Jewish and two thirds Arab. Claiming
that they had a right to resort to arms
to prevent the loss of territory involved
in the Assembly's partition plan, part
of the Arab population of Palestine engaged in guerrilla warfare against the
Jews, with the aid of irregulars who
came to their assistance from neighbouring Arab countries. The Assembly

APRIL 10, 1957
resolution, which called for a phased
transfer of authority by the mandatory
power through a United Nations Commission to Jewish and Arab Provisional
Councils of Government, could not be
put into effect in the disturbed conditions then prevailing, but having
recommended the principle of partition
the majority of members of the United
Nations continued to give it the benefit
of their moral support. The Security
Council intervened, beginning in the
first week of March 1948, in an effort
to bring hostilities in Palestine to an
end. Its continuous intervention and
the various truce arrangements made
(see 2(a) below) had some effect on
the fortunes of the contestants and on
the ultimate position of the truce lines.
It was also due in large part to the
efforts of the Security Council and
United Nations personnel that armistice
agreements were concluded in 1949
which gave sufficient promise of stability to permit the United Nations to
admit Israel to membership on May 11
of that year.
(V) The Jews of Palestine. Under British
protection and with aid sent by Jews
and other sympathizers living abroad,
the growing community of Jews of
Palestine established for themselves the
elements of the national home foreshadowed in the Balfour Declaration of
November 2, 1917. This involved the
rapid absorption of Jewish immigrants
simultaneously with the development
of agricultural setlements, industrial
enterprises, educational and social institutions, health services and all other
activities required for the growth of a
closely knit, well-organized society.
As the tide of Jewish immigration
swelled and the Arab majority in
Palestine began first to be apprehensive of the effects of the continued
growth of the Jewish national home
and later to resist that growth by
demonstrations, strikes, riots and finally
by open violence, self-defence took an
increasingly important place in the program of the Jewish community.
Trained Jewish para-military formations were available to retaliate against
the Arab irregular forces which took
up arms in December 1947 to prevent
the partition of Palestine. When the
mandate ended on May 14, 1948 the
army of Israel came into conflict not
only with Arab irregulars but also
with units of the regular forces of
Egypt in the south, of Transjordan
and Iraq in the centre, and of Syria

and Lebanon in the north which had
entered Palestine to fight against the
implementation of the United Nations
decision on partition and for the establishment of a government responsive to
the wishes of the Arab majority. The
fighting increased in scope and intensity
as the British withdrew and was carried on in areas populated largely by
Arabs as well as in areas of Jewish
settlement. After the arrival of adequate supplies of arms in June 1948,
the Israelis launched drives through
which they gained possession of roughly
three-quarters of Palestine, the Arabs
remaining in control of two distinct
areas. The first of these was the small
Gaza strip, on which Egyptian forces
were based. The second was central
Palestine west of the Jordan River,
defended by Transjordanian and Iraqi
forces, which was incorporated in the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in April
1950. Israel claimed sovereignty over
the remainder of Palestine, although in
demilitarized zones on the Syrian and
Egyptian frontiers it agreed to certain
restrictions pending the conclusion of
a peace settlement.
Mutual responsibilities of the mandatory
power and the Jews of Palestine were set
forth in articles of the mandate and in regulations issued by the mandatory power. These
came to an end at midnight on May 14-15,
1948, at the moment when the State of Israel
came into existence, the mandate being then
extinguished.
Reciprocal responsibilities of Israel and the
United Nations, to the extent that they are
defined in the Charter, are the same as the
responsibilities existing between the United
Nations and all other member states, who
are bound under Article 25 of the Charter
"to accept and carry out the decisions of the
Security Council in accordance with the
present Charter". Like other parties to the
Palestine conflict, Israel is bound by the
Security Council's resolution of July 15, 1948,
in which the Security Council ordered the
parties "to desist from further military action"
and decided that "subject to further decision
by the Security Council or the General
Assembly the truce shall remain in force ...
until a peaceful adjustment of the future
situation of Palestine is reached". Although
in its resolution of August 11, 1949 the
Security Council considered that the armistice
agreements "supersede the truce" provided
for in the resolution of July 15, 1948 it
reaffirmed "pending the final peace settlement" the "order" contained in that resolution "to the governments and authorities
concerned pursuant to Article 40 of the United

SENATE
Nations Charter to observe the unconditional
ceasefire". The United Nations undertook
for providing
responsibility, meanwhile,
through its Truce Supervision Organization
the officers required both to observe the
carrying out of the truce order under the
July 15, 1948 resolution and to provide the
international element required for the proper
functioning of the Mixed Armistice Commissions. For specific references in the armistice
agreement between Israel and Egypt to other
Security Council resolutions see 2 (b) below.
Mutuai responsibilities of Israel and the
World Zionist Organization, known also as the
Jewish Agency for Palestine, are set forth
in a Covenant dated July 26, 1954 which
was based on a law on the status of the
Jewish Agency adopted by Israel's Parliament
on November 24, 1952. This law opened with
a declaration that "The State of Israel regards
itself as the creation of the entire Jewish
people, and its gates are open ... to every
Jew wishing to immigrate into it". In a
second paragraph it went on to declare that
"The World Zionist Organization .

.

. with the

assistance of other Jewish circles and bodies,
carried the main responsibility for establishing the State of Israel". The State of Israel
recognized the World Zionist Organization as
"the authorized agency which will continue
to operate in the State of Israel for the
development and setlement of the country, the
absorption of immigrants ... and the coordination of the activities in Israel of Jewish
institutions and organizations active in those
fields". The State of Israel "expects the
co-operation of all Jews, as individuals and
groups, in building up the State and assisting the immigration into it of the masses of
the people and regards the unity of all sections of Jewry as necessary for this purpose.
The State of Israel expects efforts on the part
of the World Zionist Organization for achieving this unity". The Covenant of July 26,
1954 between the Jewish Agency and the
State of Israel set forth in greater detail the
functions of the Zionist Executive or Jewish
Agency Executive. It provided that "Any
activity carried out in Israel by the Executive
or on its behalf for the purpose of carrying
out the said functions, or part of them, shall
be executed in accordance with the laws of
Israel." In organizing immigration and the
handling of immigrants the Executive was to
act "on the basis of a plan agreed on with
the Government or authorized by the Coordination Board". The Executive might not
"delegate any of its functions or rights under
the Covenant without the agreement of the
Government". The Executive would "be responsible for the mobilization of the financial

and material resources required for the execution of its functions," by means of two funds
of long standing "and other funds".
2. (a) (i) From May 14 to June 11, 1948
Egypt and Israel were engaged in open
hostilities. An Egyptian military force
occupied part of the area recommended
by the General Assembly for inclusion
in the Arab state and held as well
certain areas which had been recommended for inclusion in the Jewish
state.
(ii) From June Il to July 8 both sides
observed more or less fully an agreed
one-month truce reached with the help
of the United Nations Mediator, Count
Bernadotte. Hostilities were renewed
for a week after this agreed truce
ended.
(iii) On July 15, 1948, in the absence of
a renewal of the agreed truce, a truce
was imposed on the parties by the
United Nations Security Council.
(iv) This was more or less effective until
October 15. On that date Egyptians
attacked an Israeli food convoy in
southern Palestine. The Israeli army
retaliated in a drive which lasted for
a month and resulted in reducing the
area held by Egyptian troops to the
small Gaza strip, the Falluja pocket
near by and an area farther east.
(v) From November 16 to December 22
there was a relative degree of compliance with the Security Council's
imposed truce.
(vi) On December 22 there began a second
Israeli drive, which ended with a brief
invasion of Egyptian territory in the
Sinai Peninsula.
(vii) On January 4, 1949 the Security
Council's truce was effectively reestablished and continued to regulate
the relations between Egypt and
Israel until February 24, 1949, when
an armistice agreement betweeen the
two countries was signed at Rhodes.
(viii) From February 24, 1949, to October
29, 1956 the armistice regime continued, but with violations by both
sides.
(ix) On October 29, 1956 Egyptian territory
was invaded by Israeli troops, whose
withdrawal in accordance with requests
from the United Nations General
Assembly was completed on March 8,
1957.

Supplement No. 3. The following is a condensed summary of the provisions, with the
addition
of
explanatory
material
in
parenthesis:
Preamble
The parties are described as "responding
to the Security Council resolution of 16
November 1948 calling upon them, as a
further provisional measure under Article
40 of the Charter of the United Nations and
in order to facilitate the transition from
the present truce to permanent peace in
Palestine, to negotiate an armistice". The
parties are also described as "having decided
to enter into negotiations under United
Nations chairmanship concerning the implementation of the Security Council resolutions
of 4 and 16 November 1948". The purpose
of the first of the resolutions referred to in
this passage was to put a stop to the fighting
which had broken out in southern Palestine
on October 15, 1948 in violation of the
Security Council's truce order of July 15, and
to have "permanent truce lines" established
either through direct negotiations between
Israel and Egypt or "through the intermediaries in the service of the United
Nations". The resolution of November 16,
the second mentioned in the preamble,
recalled the Security Council's resolution of
July 15, 1948 "which determined that the
situation in Palestine constitutes a threat
to the peace within the meaning of Article 39
of the Charter". It went on to say that "in
order to eliminate the threat to the peace in
Palestine, and to facilitate the transition
from the present truce to permanent peace in
Palestine", the Security Council had decided
that "an armistice shall be esablished in all
sectors of Palestine". It called upon the
parties "as a further provisional measure
under Article 40 of the Charter, to seek

"2. No aggressive action by the armed
forces land, sea or air, of either party shall
be undertaken, planned or threatened against
the people or the armed forces of the other ...
"3. The right of each party to its security
and freedom from fear of attack by the
armed forces of the other shall be fully
respected;
"4. The establishment of an armistice by
armed forces of the two parties is accepted as
an indispensable step toward the liquidation
of armed conflict and the restoration of peace
in Palestine."
Article Two
"1. In pursuance of the foregoing principles
and of the resolutions of the Security Council of 4 and 16 November, 1948 a general
armistice between the armed forces of the
two parties by land, sea and air is hereby
established;
"2. No element of the land, sea or air
military or para-military forces of either
party, including non-regular forces, shall
commit any warlike or hostile act against the
military or para-military forces of the other
party, or against civilians in territory under
the control of that party; or shall advance
beyond or pass over for any purpose whatever the armistice demarcation line . . .
(except as in Article III) .

.

. and elsewhere

shall not violate the international frontier (a
line running from the south end of the Gaza
strip to the Gulf of Aqaba) or enter or pass
through the air space of the other party or
through the waters within three miles of the
coastline of the other party."

. (b) such with-

The single exception to the rule against
allowing armed forces to cross the armistice
line was to permit the Egyptian military unit
which had held out for months at Falluja
to be withdrawn (with arms and equipment)
under United Nations supervision.

drawal and reduction of their armed forces
as will ensure the maintenance of the
armistice during the transition to permanent
peace in Palestine".
Article One. "With a view to promoting
the return of permanent peace in Palestine
and in recognition of the importance in this
regard of mutual assurances concerning the
future military operations of the parties,
the following principles, which shall be fully
observed by both parties during the armistice,
are hereby affirmed:
"1. The injunction of the Security Council
against resort to military force in the settlement of the Palestine question shall henceforth be scrupulously respected by both
parties;

Article Four
"With specific reference to the implementation of the resolutions of the Security
Council of 4 and 16 November 1948, the
following recognized principles and purposes
are affirmed:
"1. The principle that no military or political advantage should be gained under the
truce ordered by the Security Council is
recognized.
"2. It is also recognized that the basic purposes and spirit of the armistice would not
be served by the restoration of previously
held military positions or changes from those
now held, other than as specifically provided
for in this agreement, or by the advance of

agreement forthwith . . . with a view to the

immediate establishment of the armistice,
including (a) the delineation of permanent
armistice demarcation lines .

.

SENATE
the military forces of either side beyond positions held at the time this Armistice Agreement is signed.
"3. It is further recognized that rights,
claims or interests of a non-military character in the area of Palestine covered by this
agreement may be asserted by either party,
and that these, by mutual agreement being
excluded from the armistice negotiations,
shall be, at the discretion of the parties, the
subject of later settlement. It is emphasized
that it is not the purpose of this agreement to
establish, to recognize, to strengthen, to
weaken or nullify, in any way, any territorial,
custodial or other rights, claims or interests
which may be asserted by either party in the
area of Palestine or any part or locality
thereof covered by this agreement", whether
these rights, claims or interests are derived
from Security Council resolutions or from
any other source. "The provisions of this
agreement are dictated exclusively by military considerations and are valid only for the
period of the armistice."

Article Seven
This article provides for a limitation of
armed forces to "defensive" strength in certain areas. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7
refer to the fact that the position in the
eastern half of Israel will depend on arrangements to be made in the forthcoming armistice agreement with Jordan.
3. Egypt may have only "defensive forces"
in the area between El Arish and Abu
Agheila (or Abu Aweigila) and the armistice demarcation line. All other forces must
be withdrawn. (See map in monthly bulletin
External Affairs, February 1957.)
4. In the western half of Israel, from a
point above the northern end of the Gaza
strip down to the Gulf of Aqaba, only "defensive forces" may be maintained. All other
forces in this area must be withdrawn north
of a line whose approximate position is
shown in the map referred to above.
5. The term "defensive forces" is defined
in an annex to the agreement.
Article Eight
1. On Israel's side of the Egypt-Palestine
line "is de- frontier, about a quarter of the way between
purpose and the Mediterranean coast and the Gulf of
the Security Aqaba, in a locality where several strategic
roads converge, "the area comprising the vil1948".

Article Five
1. The armistice demarcation
lineated in pursuance of the
intent of the resolutions of
Council of 4 and 16 November
2. It "is not to be construed in any sense
as a political or territorial boundary, and is
delineated without prejudice to rights, claims
and positions of either party to the armistice
as regards ultimate settlement of the Palestine question.
"3. The basic purpose of the armistice
demarcation line is to delineate the line beyond which the armed forces of the respective parties shall not move except as
provided in Article 3.
"4. Rules and regulations of the armed
forces of the parties which prohibit civilians
from crossing the fighting lines or entering
the area between the lines shall remain in
effect . .. with

application

to

the

armistice

demarcation line defined in Article 6."
Article Six
1. Description of the armistice demarcation line marking off the Gaza strip.
2. Evacuation of Israeli forces from positions within the Gaza strip.
3. Time limit for evacuation of various
points. Provision for Israeli outposts, each
limited to platoon strength, at certain specified points on Israel's side of the armistice
demarcation line.
4. Withdrawal of Egyptian and Israeli
forces from the Bethlehem-Hebron area.

lage of El Auja and vicinity . . . shall be

demilitarized and both Egyptian and Israeli
armed forces shall be totally excluded therefrom. The Chairman of the Mixed Armistice
Commission .. . and United Nations observers
attached to the Commission shall be responsible for ensuring the full implementation of
this provision".
2. Definition of the limits of the El Auja
demilitarized district.
3. No Egyptian defensive positions to be
closer to El Auja than El Quseima and Abu
Agheila (Abu Aweigila) shown in the map
referred to above.
4. No military forces whatsoever to enter
Palestine by the road from El Quseima to
El Auja.
5. "The movement of armed forces of either
party to this agreement into any part of the
area defined in paragraph 2 of this article,
for any purpose, or failure by either party to
respect or fulfil any of the other provisions
of this article, when confirmed by the United
Nations representatives, shall constitute a
flagrant violation of this agreement."
Article Nine
Provisions for exchange of prisoners of war
within a month after the signing of the
armistice agreement.
Article Ten
1. A Mixed Armistice Commission, composed of three Egyptian and three Israeli

APRIL 10, 1957
representatives under the chairmanship of the
Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organization, or a senior officer of that body
designated by him after consultation with
both parties, shall supervise the execution of
the provisions of the ageement.
2. The Commission "shall maintain its
headquarters at El Auja" but hold its meetings wherever and whenever required for the
effective conduct of its work.
3. "To the greatest extent possible" decisions of the Mixed Armistice Commission
"shall be based on the principle of unanimity".
4. Otherwise decisions are to be taken by
a majority vote of members present and
voting. Decisions of the Commission are to
be final except for questions of principle if
appealed within a week. Such appeals are to
be considered by a Special Committee composed of the Chief of Staff of the Truce
Supervision Organization and one Israeli and
one Egyptian senior officer. Decisions on
these appeals reached by the Special Committee are final.
5. Rules of procedure.
6. The Commission is empowered to employ
observers, who may be drawn from the military organizations of the parties or from the
Truce Supervision Organization or from both.
United Nations observers are to remain under
the command of the Chief of Staff of the
Truce Supervision Organization, and assignments given to them are subject to the
approval of the chairman of the Mixed
Armistice Commission.
7. Claims or complaints are to be referred
immediately to the Commission through its
chairman. The Commission takes appropriate
action by means of its observer and investigations machinery "with a view to equitable
and mutually satisfactory settlement".
8. The chairman's interpretation of the
meaning of a particular provision of the
agreement prevails, subject to the right of
appeal. "The Commission, in its discretion
and as the need arises, may from time to
time recommend to the parties modifications
in the provisions of this agreement."
9. Reports are made by the Commission to
both parties and to the Secretary-General of
the United Nations.
10. Members of the Commission and its
observers are to be accorded such freedom
of movement and access in the areas covered
by the agreement as the Commission considers necessary. If the vote on a decision of
this kind is not unanimous, however, only
United Nations observers are to be employed.
11. Expenses of the Commission, other than
those relating to United Nations observers,
are shared equally by the two parties.

Article Eleven
"No provision of this agreement shall in any
way prejudice the rights, claims and positions
of either party hereto in the ultimate peaceful
settlement of the Palestine question."
Article Twelve
1. The agreement to come into force upon
being signed.
"2. This agreement, having been negotiated
and concluded in pursuance of the resolution
of the Security Council of 16 November 1948
calling for the establishment of an armistice
in order to eliminate the threat to the peace
in Palestine and to facilitate the transition
from the present truce to permanent peace in
Palestine, shall remain in force until a peaceful settlement between the parties is achieved,
except as provided in paragraph 4 of this
article.
"3. The parties to this agreement may, by
mutual consent, revise this agreement or any
of its provisions, or may suspend its application, other than Articles 1 and 2, at any time."
In the absence of mutual agreement, any time
after February 24, 1950 either of the parties
may ask the Secretary-General of the United
Nations "to convoke a conference of representatives of the two parties for the purpose
of reviewing, revising or suspending any of
the provisions of this agreement other than
Articles 1 and 2. Participation in such
conference shall be obligatory upon the
parties."
4. If such a conference does not result in
agreement "either party may bring the
matter before the Security Council of the
United Nations for the relief sought, on the
grounds that this agreement has been concluded in pursuance of Security Council
action toward the end of achieving peace in
Palestine".
(c)-(d) There have been thousands of
individual complaints of violations of the
armistice agreement by Israel and Egypt.
These have concerned alleged violations of
every article of the agreement except
perhaps Article III, V and XI. More particularly they have been concerned with
Article I: 1, 2, 3 and 4; Article II: 1 and
2; Article IV: 1 and 3; Article V: 2, 3
and 4; Article VI: 2 and 3; Article VII:
3, 4 and 5; Article VIII: 1, 3, 4 and 5;
Article X: 1, 2, 4 and 10, and Article XII: 2.
Familiar types of complaint examined by
the Mixed Armistice Commission have
included alleged overflights of territory by
aircraft of the other party, alleged violation
of territorial waters by a ship belonging to
the other party, alleged firing across the
demarcation line by one party or the other,
alleged crossing of the demarcation line by

SENATE
military units, with or without firing, alleged
mining of roads by either party and alleged
attacks on civilians by civilian infiltrators
or by armed forces of one party or the other.
The great majority of the complaints were
concerned with alleged violations by one party
or the other of the armistice demarcation line
separating Israel from the Gaza strip, where
some 312,000 Palestinian Arabs, for the most
part refugees and now completely destitute,
having lost their property and means of
livelihood, have been crowded into an area
less than 30 miles long and about six miles
wide under Egyptian military and administrative control. In these conditions even the
vigilance of joint Egyptian-Israeli patrols
in the first year of operation of the armistice
agreement failed to prevent infiltrators from
crossing the armistice line from the Gaza
strip into Israel, chiefiy for purposes of
theft or smuggling. Eventually the system of
joint patrols broke down and contact between
Egyptian and Israeli guards for purposes of
preventing infiltration was lost.
Complaints of violations of the armistice
line have usually been made in the first instance to the Mixed Armistice Commission.
If possible the complaints have been investigated by United Nations observers, who are
officers of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization drawn from the armed
forces of several countries, including Canada.
The regular procedure has been for complaints to be considered by the Commission
in the order of their inscription. In the case
of serious violations, however, it has been
usual for the aggrieved party to ask for an
emergency meeting of the Commission,
which has dealt with the incident immediately, considering the evidence available
and recording its opinion as to where the
blame should be placed and the degree of
culpability involved. In 1952 the Chief of
Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization reported to the Security
Council that the governments of Israel and
Egypt had been able to agree through their
representatives in the Mixed Armistice
Commission to file 324 unheard complaints
without further deliberation and that thenceforth no further complaints would be brought
before the Commision. The parties would
maintain direct and frequent contacts between
their representatives instead and would
resume joint patrolling of the demarcation
line, discontinued earlier. This agreement
had a good effect but was of short duration.
Incidents soon continued as before to be
brought to the Commission for its attention.
There have been a number of appeals to the
Special Committee under Article X: 4 of the
armistice agreement, but when one of the

parties has not wished the appeal to be considered means have been found to delay
the meeting of the committee indefinitely-a
situation to which the Chief of Staff of the
Truce Supervision Organization has drawn
the attention of the Security Council on
more than one occasion.
Although the decisions of the Special Committee are final, there were several occasions, as will be seen below, on which either
Israel or Egypt considered it necessary to
appeal to the Security Council. From 1955
onward the Security Council was confronted
by a situation in which increased tension
and higher causualty rates went hand in
hand. For the protection of its citizens
Israel adopted a policy of military retaliation
for attacks within its own territory by
Although as
Egyptian-trained saboteurs.
the reports submitted to the Security Council
showed, these retaliatory raids resulted in
several times as many casualties among the
inhabitants of the Gaza strip as the casualties suffered by the inhabitants of Israel, the
problem of sabotage in Israel by so-called
"fedayeen" was not eliminated. Eventually,
as will be seen below, the Secretary-General
himself was sent to the area to see what
could be done to reverse the trend toward
a complete breakdown of the armistice
agreement.
The failure of the parties to move forward
to an early peace settlement prevented the
fulfilment of one of the main purposes of
the armistice agreement. Israel was anxious
to secure a permanent settlement with
Egypt as soon as possible, but wanted the
position prevailing under the armistice agreement rather than earlier resolutions of the
General Assembly to be used as the point of
departure for the peace negotiations. Egypt
and Israel's other Arab neighbours, on the
contrary, declined to be drawn into negotiations on that basis since this would have
involved recognition of the sovereignty of
Israel in three quarters of Palestine. From
November 1952 until October 1956 they continued to assert publicly that they were willing to negotiate a settlement with Israel as
soon as the latter accepted the General
Assembly's recommendations for (a) an
approximately equal division of the territory
of Palestine between Israel and the Arabs,
(b) the internationalization of Jerusalem.
(c) the repatriation of "refugees wishing to
return to their homes and live at peace with
their neighbours" and (d) compensation for
the property of those choosing not to return
and for loss of or damage to property in
To these suggestions
defined categories.
Israel objected that it could not be expected
to give up territory which it had won during
a military conflict that had been forced upon

APRIL 10, 1957
its citizens by the Arabs themselves in 1948.
It insisted that the negotiations should be
"free and untrammelled" and declined to
participate in negotiations if compliance
with past Assembly resolutions was to be
required as a "pre-condition". The Arabs,
meanwhile, would negotiate on no other
basis.
A Conciliation Commission appointed in
accordance with a resolution adopted by the
General Assembly on December 11, 1948,
made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to
compose these differences. After the conclusion of the armistice agreements the
General Assembly twice adopted resolutions
which were designed to encourage the parties
themselves to reach a settlement. On December 14, 1950, "recognizing that, in the
interests of the peace and stability of the
Near East, the refugee question should be
dealt with as a matter of urgency", the
Assembly urged "the governments and authorities concerned to seek agreement by
negotiations conducted either with the Conciliation Commission or directly, with a view
to the final settlement of all questions outstanding between them". In a resolution of
January 26, 1952 the Assembly said, furthermore, that it considered "the governments
concerned have the primary responsibility for
reaching a settlement". It went on to urge
them to "seek agreement with a view to
an early settlement of their outstanding
differences in conformity with the resolutions
of the General Assembly on Palestine; and
for this purpose to make full use of United
Nations facilities". It asked the Conciliation
Commission "to continue its efforts to secure
the implementation of the resolutions of the
General Assembly on Palestine" and asked it
to "be available to the parties to assist them
in reaching agreement on outstanding questions". In December 1952 an attempt was
made in the Assembly to secure a different
form of resolution urging the governments
concerned "to enter at an early date, without
prejudice to their respective rights and
claims, into direct negotiations" for a settlement, "bearing in mind the resolutions as
well as the principal objectives of the United
Nations on the Palestine question, including
the religious interests of third parties". This
effort to provide more latitude in the starting-point for negotiations by merely "bearing
in mind" past resolutions of the United Nations, failed to win the support of the requisite two thirds majority in the Assembly,
where no further resolution was passed on
the subject prior to the invasion of the Sinai
Peninsula. In the Security Council, however, the parties continued to be reminded
of their obligations to reach a peaceful settlement of their outstanding differences. (See

resolutions of November 16, 1948, August 11,
1949, November 17, 1950, September 1, 1951,
and March 29, 1955).
Except in 1952 and 1953, the Security
Council has had on its agenda each year
from 1950 onward at least one item relating
to alleged violations of provisions of the
armistice agreement between Israel and
Egypt. Israel's complaints to the Security
Council in 1950, 1951 and 1954 with regard
to Egypt's restrictions on navigation, which
Israel regards as a standing violation of the
armistice agreement, and the action taken
on these complaints by the Security Council
are summarized in section 3 and 4 below.
Israel's complaints of violations of the armistice agreement by Egypt prior to its own
invasion of the Sinai Peninsula are listed in
section 5 (a).
Other charges of violation of the armistice
agreement considered by the Security Council
included the following:
Egypt complained that in violation of
Article VII of the agreement Israel had sent
a military force southward to the Gulf of
Aqaba in March 1949 and had left in occupation of Bir Qattar, near the Egyptian
frontier, a larger military unit than was
permitted under the definition of "defensive
forces". The Mixed Armistice Commission
decided that Israel should withdraw the
force it had maintained here "to positions
authorized by the armistice agreement". On
March 20, 1950, the Special Committee upheld
this decision. On November 17, 1950 the
Security Council, to whose attention Israel's
non-compliance with the decision had been
drawn, took note of a statement of the Government of Israel that the forces in question
would evacuate Bir Qattar. On March 25,
1951 Israel announced its actual compliance
with the Security Council's request.
A second Egyptian complaint dealt with
by the Security Council on November 17,
1950 concerned the alleged expulsion of over
7,000 Arabs from Israel into Egypt in the
months following the conclusion of the armistice agreement. The Security Council
asked the Mixed Armistice Commission "to
give urgent attention to the Egyptian complaint", called upon the parties "to give
effect to any findings of the (Commission)
regarding the repatriation of any such Arabs
who in the Commission's opinion are entitled
to return", authorized the Chief of Staff of
the Truce Supervision Organization to recommend to the parties "such steps as he
may consider necessary to control the movement of...

nomadic

Arabs...

by mutual

agreement", and called upon the governments concerned "to take in the future no
action involving the transfer of persons across

SENATE

international frontiers or armistice lines
without prior consultation" through the commission. The Security Council also reminded
Egypt and Israel as member states of the
United Nations of their obligations under
the Charter to settle their outstanding differences, and that the armistice agreement contemplated "the return of permanent peace
in Palestine", and therefore urged them "and
other states in the area to take all such steps
as will lead to the settlement of the issues
between them".
On March 5, 1955 the Security Council
received an urgent request from Egypt that it
should consider "violent and premeditated
aggression committed on 28 February 1955
by Israeli armed forces against Egyptian
armed forces inside Egyptian-controlled territory near Gaza, causing many casualties,
including 39 dead and 32 wounded and the
destruction of certain military installations
. . .". Israel immediately asked the Security
Council to put on its agenda a complaint
of "continuous violations by Egypt of the
General Armistice Agreement and of resolutions of the Council, to the danger of international peace and security, by means of:
attacks of regular and irregular Egyptian
armed forces against Israel armed forces;
assaults of raiders from Egyptian-controlled
territories on lives and property in Israel;
failure of the Government of Egypt to adopt
and enforce executive measures against such
acts of violence; assertion by Egypt of the
existence of a state of war and the exercise
of active belligerency against Israel, particularly the maintenance and enforcement of
blockade measures; warlike propaganda and
threats against the territorial integrity and
political independence of Israel; refusal of
Egypt to seek agreement by negotiations for
an effective transition from the present
armistice to peace".
When Egypt's charges against Israel with
regard to the attack on Gaza were taken up,
the Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision
Organization reported to the Security Council
on March 17 that the Mixed Armistice Commission had found Israel responsible for the
attack and considered that it had violated
Articles 1: 2 and 3, II: 2 and V: 3 of the
armistice agreement. The following are extracts from the Secretary-General's summary
of the Security Council's proceedings:
"Reviewing the general situation along the
armistice demarcation line, the Chief of Staff
said that the number of casualties prior to
the Gaza incident reflected the comparative
tranquillity which had prevailed in that
area during the greater part of the period
from November 1954 to February 1955. However, repeated minor incidents had helped to

create a state of tension, and although infiltration from Egyptian-controlled territory
had not been the only cause of the present
tension, it had undoubtedly been one of its
main causes. The Chief of Staff recalled that,
in an earlier report to the Council, he had
suggested that, in order to decrease tension
along the demarcation line, the two parties
should examine in an informal manner the
possibility of agreeing on certain measures,
namely: (1) institution of joint patrols along
sensitive sections of the demarcation line;
(2) negotiation of a local commanders' agreement; (3) erection of a barbed wire obstacle
along certain portions of the demarcation line;
and (4) manning of all outposts and patrols
by regular Egyptian and Israel troops. In
conclusion, the Chief of Staff said that he
was still of the opinion that, if an agreement
were effected between the two parties on the
lines he had suggested, and if an honest
attempt to fulfil the conditions were made
by both parties, infiltration could be reduced
to an occasional nuisance, a kind of thieving
which Israel must probably regard as inevitable so long as there were vast numbers of
poverty-stricken refugees on its bordersmore than 200,000 in the Gaza strip alone ...
"On 28 March, France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America submitted a joint draft resolution providing that
the Security Council, after noting that the
Egyptian-Israeli Mixed Armistice Commission, on 6 March 1955, had determined that
a pre-arranged and planned attack ordered
by Israel authorities had been committed by
Israel regular army forces against the Egyptian army force in the Gaza strip on 28
February 1955, would: (1) condemn that
attack as a violation of the cease-fire provisions of the Council's resolution of 15 July
1948 and as inconsistent with the obligations
of the parties under the General Armistice
Agreement between Egypt and Israel and
under the Charter; (2) call again upon Israel
to take all necessary measures to prevent
such actions; and (3) express its conviction
that the maintenance of the General Armistice
Agreement was threatened by any deliberate
violation of that agreement by one of the
parties to it, and that no progress toward
the return of permanent peace in Palestine
could be made unless the parties complied
strictly with their obligations under the agreement and the cease-fire provisions of the
Council's resolution of 15 July 1948.
"Another joint draft resolution was submitted on the same date by France, the
United Kingdom and the United States of
America, according to which the Security
Council, taking note of those sections of the
report by the Chief of Staff which dealt with

APRIL 10, 1957
the general conditions on the armistice demarcation line between Egypt and Israel
and the causes of the existing tension, and
Deing anxious that all possible steps be taken
to preserve security in the area, would: (1)
request the Chief of Staff to continue his
consultations with the Governments of Egypt
and Israel with a view to the introduction
of practical measures to preserve security in
the area; (2) note that the Chief of Staff
had already made certain concrete proposals
to that effect; (3) call upon the Governments
of Egypt and Israel to cooperate with the
Chief of Staff with regard to his proposals,
bearing in mind that, in the opinion of the
Chief of Staff, infiltration could be reduced
to an occasional nuisance if an agreement
were effected between the parties on the lines
he had proposed; and (4) request the Chief
of Staff to keep the Security Council informed
of the progress of his discussions.
"Both draft resolutions were adopted unanimously at the 695th and 696th meetings
held on 29 and 30 March."
On April 6, 1955 the Security Council took
up fresh complaints by Israel, which now
cited "repeated attacks by Egypt with special
reference to (1) the armed assault at Pattish
on 24 March 1955; (2) repeated attacks by
mining and gunfire on Israel army units
patrolling the Israel-Egyptian border at the
Gaza strip between 26 March and 3 April
1955; (3) the attack on an Israel army patrol
and on the village of Nahal Oz on 3 April
1955". Israel invoked Article 34 of the
Charter (investigation of disputes by the
Security Council), charging that overt acts of
violence by Egyptian armed forces had replaced infiltration as the main cause of
tension between Israel and Egypt. A report
from the Chief of Staff of the United Nations
Truce Supervision Organization said the mining of tracks used by Israeli army vehicles
had been the most important factor contributing to the increased tension. This might
well be "retaliatory action by certain elements following the Gaza incidents". He
went on to discuss once more the importance
of restoring joint patrols, and a local commanders' agreement and the erection of
barbed wire fences.
On April 19, 1955 the President of the
Security Council "observed that the consensus
of opinion was that there was no need for
any new action by the Council, inasmuch as
the facts brought to the Council's notice and
the possible measures to avert frontier incidents in the area of the demarcation line
between Egypt and Israel had been fully
covered in the resolutions adopted by the
Council on 29 and 30 March. He trusted
that he was expressing the general view of
the members of the Council in appealing to

both sides to give full effect to those resolutions, which were aimed at averting frontier
incidents. To achieve that purpose, he urged
them to co-operate sincerely with one another".
The Security Council met again on September 8, 1955 to consider another outbreak
of violence in the Gaza strip. This began on
August 22 with an Israeli attack on an Egyptian post near Gaza, when 3 Arabs were
killed and 3 wounded. There followed an
organized series of Arab reprisai attacks on
vehicles, installations and persons in Israeli
territory iri which the Chief of Staff of the
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization told the Security Council 11 persons had
been killed and 9 wounded. The nature of
the latter attacks suggested, he said, "that
they are the work of organized and well
trained groups . . .

The sudden resumption

of this type of incident after they had practically ceased for three months is significant."
On the night of August 31-September 1 an
Israeli light-armoured unit attacked and destroyed the police station at Khan Yunis in
the Gaza strip. It was alleged that 36 persons had been killed and 13 wounded. A
cease-fire did not go into effect until September 4.
The Chief of Staff recommended to the
Security Council the erection of an effective
physical barrier along the demarcation line
and the withdrawal of patrols and defensive
positions at least 500 metres on either side
of the line. The Security Council adopted
unanimously a resolution summarized in the
following terms by the Secretary-General in
his Report on the Work of the Organization,
15 June 1955-15 June 1956: The Council,
among other things, "called upon both parties
forthwith to take all steps necessary to bring
about order and tranquillity in the area, and
in particular to desist from further acts of
violence and to continue the cease-fire in full
force and effect; endorsed the view of the
Chief of Staff that the armed forces of both
parties should be clearly and effectively
separated by measures such as those which
he had proposed; declared that freedom of
movement must be afforded to the United
Nations observers in the area to enable them
to fulfill their functions; called upon both
parties to appoint representatives to meet
with the Chief of Staff and to co-operate fully
with him to these ends."
In March 1956, the United States asked
for a meeting of the Security Council to
consider the status of compliance with the
various armistice agreements between Israel
and its neighbours and with the Security
Council's resolutions of 1955. In explaining
this request the United States mentioned
particularly a "build-up of armed forces on

SENATE
either side of the armistice demarcation lines"
and developments "which might endanger
the maintenance of international peace and
security". On April 4, 1956 the Security
Council adopted a resolution noting "with
grave concern" that the parties had not taken
the steps recommended with a view to reducing tension in the area. It considered that
the situation on the armistice lines between
Israel and its neighbours was such that "continuance is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security". It
therefore asked the Secretary-General to
undertake a survey of the various aspects of
enforcement and of compliance and to arrange with the parties "for the adoption of
any measures which after discussion with
the parties and with the Chief of Staff he
considered would reduce existing tensions",
including: "(a) withdrawal of their forces
from the armistice demarcation lines; (b) full
freedom of movement for observers along
the armsitice demarcation lines and in the
demilitarized zones and in the defensive
areas; (c) establishment of local arrangements for the prevention of incidents and the
prompt detection of any violations of the
armistice agreements."
The Secretary-General went to the Middle
East, talked with government leaders about
measures which might reduce the toll of
violence and on May 9, 1956 reported to the
Security Council that the parties had given
him "unconditional assurances" that they
would maintain the cease-fire. A reservation
for self-defence was recognized by the Secretary-General, but he had made it clear that
this did "not permit acts of retaliation, which
repeatedly have been condemned by the

Security Council."
Secretary-General, one of the gains made as
a result of his conversations was that each
party now agreed to observe the cease-fire
whether the other party complied with other
provisions of the armistice agreement or not.
The Secretary-General's report of May 9,
1956 also indicated that a little progress had
been made toward carrying out practical
measures to reduce tension on the demarcation line. Both Egypt and Israel had accepted the proposal for "an equal number of
fixed United Nations observer posts on each
side of the line". Egypt had agreed to withdraw its patrols and defensive positions some
distance from the demarcation line, although
Israel still reserved the right in certain circumstances to send its patrols right up to the
line. Joint patrols were not likely to be
accepted by either party. It was too soon
yet to try to conclude a local commanders'
agreement. Marking of the demarcation line
had not yet begun. Both parties appeared to
be violating Articles VII and VIII of the

armistice agreement, the Secretary-General
reported. Israel had the equivalent of "three
companies of infantry" in the El Auja demilitarized zone and proposed to keep them
there so long as Egypt kept defensive forces
on its side of the line not far from the demilitarized zone in contravention of Article
VIII of the agreement. Each party charged
the other with having introduced prohibited
arms into this region in violation of Article
VII. The Chief of Staff had proposed that
the parties should comply simultaneously
with Article VII and subsequently withdraw
their armed forces, the withdrawals to be
verified by United Nations personnel. Meanwhile the Security Council's attention was
drawn to the fact that freedom of movement
of United Nations personnel continued to be
impeded by the attitude of both the parties in
the "defensive areas" and the demilitarized
zone.
On June 4, 1956 the Security Council adopted
a resolution noting that despite the assurances
given to the Secretary-General by all the
parties that they would unconditionally observe the cease-fire, "full compliance" with
the general armistice agreements and with
the Council's resolutions of March 30 and
September 8, 1955 had not yet been effected.
The Security Council declared that "the
parties to the armistice agreements should
speedily carry out the measures already agreed
upon with the Secretary-General, and should
co-operate with the Secretary-General and
the Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision
Organization to put into effect their further
practical proposals, pursuant to the resolution
of 4 April, with a view to full implementation
of that resolution and full compliance with
the armistice agreements." It declared that
"full freedom of movement of United Nations
observers must be respected along the armistice demarcation lines, in the demilitarized
zones and in the defensive areas as defined in
the armistice agreements, to enable them to
fulfil their functions". It endorsed the Secretary-General's view that "the re-establishment of full compliance with the armistice
agreements represents a stage which has to
be passed in order to make progress possible
on the main issues between the parties".
Among other things it asked the SecretaryGeneral to continue his good offices with the
parties and to keep the Security Council
informed.
After further study of the situation in the
Middle East the Secretary-General reported
to the Security Council on September 12,
1956 that the governments in the region had
"not taken any initiatives which could help

Security Council or the International Court

There were many protests from governments against the regulations, which for
practical purposes restricted the free use
of the Canal to those of their ships which

did not carry cargo to Israel; but Egypt did
not alter its policy. The issue was therefore
submitted by Israel to the Security Council

a second time in July 1951. The specific
complaint on this occasion was that certain
types of cargo destined for Israel were still
liable to confiscation at Suez Canal ports,
while ships which had called at Israeli
ports were placed on an Egyptian blacklist

and were denied water, food, supplies and
services on arrival at Suez Canal ports.
Crews were not permitted shore leave. The
result was that few ships using the Canal
would touch at Israeli ports and much of the
trade Israel would otherwise be enjoying was

thus cut off. Most serious, however, from
the point of view or Israel, was the fact that
oil tankers bound for Israel could not use the
Suez Canal.
The arguments put forward by the representatives of Israel and Egypt before the
Security Council were summarized as follows
in the Annual Report of the Secretary-General
on the Work of the Organization,1 July 1951-

30 June 1952: "During the general discussion,
the representative of Israel pointed out that,
in its resolution of 11 August 1949, the
Security Council had requested the signatory
governments to observe the Armistice Agreements and had reminded them that those
agreements 'include firm pledges against any
further acts of hostility between the parties'.

That resolution had been considered by its
sponsors to mark the end both of restrictions
on the sale and purchase of arms and of restrictions on the free movement of shipping.
The records of the Council and contemporary
exchanges of letters proved that those two
things were contingent. The Security Council's very decision to restore freedom of sale
and purchase of armaments to all governments in the area could not be reconciled
with the view that a state of war continued
to exist. The representative of Israel considered that the Council was obliged by the
Charter to act for the 'suppression of acts
of aggression', no matter by what instrumentality they were committed. Israel was not
in a state of war with Egypt and denied
that Egypt had the right to be at war with
Israel. The right of ships to traverse the
high seas and international highways was
a cornerstone of the law of nations. He drew
attention to the economic damage caused by
the blockade and emphasized that, if the

Security Council acquiesced in its continuation, a fatal doubt would spread throughout
the region concerning the impartial maintenance of the Armistice Agreement. The questions before the Council could not be decided
on the basis of the traditional pre-Charter
law. The issue was whether, after the signature of the Charter and after the
Egyptian-Israel Armistice Agreement had
been in force for two and a half years, a
Member State could ask the Security Council

allowed a nation to undertake action in selfdefence on two conditions only, both of
which were absent in that case.
"In reply, the representative of Egypt considered that, under article X, paragraphs 4
and 8, of the Armistice Agreement, the
Special Committee's decision of 12 June 1951
was final. The obiter dicta of the Chief of
Staff were not connected with his official
duties and did not properly belong in the
records of the Security Council. The representative of Egypt submitted that article I,
paragraph 2, and article II, paragraph 2, of
the Armistice Agreement were not innovations but were based on precedents and on
generally accepted doctrine regarding armistices. The precedents and the writings
of well-known jurists established that the
rights of the parties under an armistice
agreement also included the right of blockade, the right to capture neutral vessels
attempting to break the blockade, and the
right to seize contraband of war. He argued
that Egypt was exercising only a fraction of
its rights under the armistice. The existence
of a state of war between Egypt and Israel
was pointed out by the Armistice Agreement
and while it continued Egypt had no other
choice than to exercise its right of selfpreservation. He then referred to certain
attitudes of Israel which were blocking the
road to peace in the Middle East and which
were responsible for the Egyptian measures
about which Israel had complained. Hardly
any arguments had been advanced during
the debate in the Council to substantiate the
claim that Egypt had violated the Suez Canal
Convention. The complaint of Israel was
not receivable, since the powers and duties
of the Security Council were limited and
should be strictly regulated by the fundamental principles and purposes laid down in
Chapter I of the Charter. Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Charter required that the
adjustment or settlement of international disputes should be 'in conformity with the
principles of justice and international law'.
However, the joint draft resolution was
mainly based on the termination or the denial

APRIL

of rights of belligerency exercised by Egypt
in conformity with the Armistice Agreement
and with the principles of international law."
At the end of its deliberations in July
and August the Security Council adopted the
following resolution on September 1, 1951,
the USSR, India and China abstaining:
"The Security Council
"1. Recalling that in its resolution of 11
August 1949, (S/1376) relating to the conclusion of Armistic Agreements between Israel
and the neighbouring Arab States it drew
attention to the pledges in these Agreements
'against any further acts of hostility between
the Parties';
"2. Recalling further that in its resolution
of 17 November 1950 (S/1907) it reminded
the States concerned that the Armistice
Agreements to which they were parties contemplated 'the return of permanent peace in
Palestine', and therefore urged them and the
other States in the area to take all such steps
as would lead to the settlement of the issues
between them;
"3. Noting the report of the Chief of Staff
of the Truce Supervision Organization to the
Security Council of 12 June 1951 (S/2194);
"4. Further noting that the Chief of Staff
of the Truce Supervision Organization recalled the statement of the senior Egyptian
delegate in Rhodes on 13 January 1949, to
the effect that his delegation was 'inspired
with every spirit of co-operation, conciliation and a sincere desire to restore peace in
Palestine', and that the Egyptian Government has not complied with the earnest plea
of the Chief of Staff made to the Egyptian
delegate on 12 June 1951, that it desist from
the present practice of interfering with the
passage through the Suez Canal of goods destined for Israel;
"5. Considering that since the Armistice
regime, which has been in existence for
nearly two and a half years, is of a permanent character, neither party can reasonably
assert that it is actively a belligerent or requires to exercise the right of visit, search,
and seizure for any legitimate purpose of
self-defence;
"6. Finds that the maintenance of the practice mentioned in paragraph 4 above is inconsistent with the objectives of a peaceful
settlement between the parties and the establishment of a permanent peace in Palestine
set forth in the Armistice Agreement;
"7. Finds further that such practice is an
abuse of the exercise of the right of visit,
search and seizure;
"8. Further finds that the practice cannot
in the prevailing circumstances be justified
on the ground that it is necessary for selfdefence;

"9. And further noting that the restrictions
on the passage of goods through the Suez
Canal to Israel ports are denying to nations
at no time connected with the conflict in
Palestine valuable supplies required for their
economic reconstruction, and that these restrictions together with sanctions applied by
Egypt to certain ships which have visited
Israel ports represent unjustified interference with the rights of nations to navigate
the seas and to trade freely with one another, including the Arab States and Israel;
"10. Calls upon Egypt to terminate the
restrictions on the passage of international
commercial shipping and goods through the
Suez Canal wherever bound and to cease all
interference with such shipping beyond that
essential to the safety of shipping in the
Canal itself and to the observance of the
international conventions in force."
(The
latter have to do with such things as the
protection of the Canal, the observance of
sanitary regulations and control of the slave
traffic and the traffic in drugs.)
Egypt continued to apply the restrictions
in varying forms and degrees. On January
28, 1954 Israel appealed once more to the
Security Council. It argued that Egypt's
interference with shipping in the Suez Canal
constituted hostile action and that it violated
the Constantinople Convention of 1888 and
international law, the purposes of the Charter and the spirit and letter of the armistice
agreement, as well as the Security Council's
resolution of September 1, 1951. Israel asked
the Security Council to establish machinery
and procedures which would enable it to
follow up the course of its resolutions and
receive reports on their fulfilment or nonfulfilment. A draft resolution introduced by
New Zealand's representative called on Egypt
to comply with the Security Council's resolution of September 1, 1951. On March 29,
1954 this was vetoed, however, by the
U.S.S.R. for two reasons. It was impossible
Mr. Vishinsky said, to settle international
problems by imposing on one of the parties a
decision which from the outset it had declared to be absolutely unacceptable. The
parties should be asked instead to settle their
differences by direct negotiation.
In the
second place, he said, the principle of free
navigation in the Suez Canal must be respected. The task of supervising the observance of the Constantinople Convention
providing for freedom of navigation had not
been assigned, however, to a body like the
Security Council, in which non-signatories
of the Constantinople Convention constituted
a majority. It had been assigned, under
Article 8 of the Convention, to the agents in
Egypt of the signatories themselves. Only
four of the signatories and the successor

SENATE

states were now represented in the Security
Council. The New Zealand draft resolution
having been vetoed, no other draft resolution
was put forward in its place.
On September 28, 1954 Israel complained
to the Security Council that the "Bat Galim",

Eritrea for Haifa, had been seized by Egyptian authorities at the southern approach to
the Suez Canal and its crew of ten Israelis

Both the Mixed Armistice Commission and
the Special Committee, to which Egypt appealed, upheld Israel's view that no provision

case. Egypt withdrew its original charge

resolution on this issue. The majority of its
members supported, however, the principles
set forth in the Council's resolution of September 1, 1951. The President of the Council
suggested on January 13, 1955 that since Egypt
had expressed willingness to release the ship
and its cargo, the Chief of Staff of the Truce
Supervision Organization might extend his
good offices, if the parties so desired, to expedite a settlement. Israel reported to the
Security Council on September 19, 1956 that
the vessel and its cargo had later been confiscated. It also reported that on May 25,
1956 a Greek ship, the "Panagia", carrying
cement from Haifa to Eilat, was detained at
Port Said for four and a half months, its
crew not being allowed to go ashore except

4. It should be explained that at the southern
outlet of the Gulf of Aqaba the shores of
Saudi Arabia and the Egyptian-owned Sinai
Peninsula are about eleven miles apart. The
mouth of the Gulf is blocked by two islands
and by shoals and reefs. There is only one
navigable channel, which is about 550 yards
wide. This is found in the three-mile-wide
strait lying between the island of Tiran and
a stretch of the Sinai Peninsula coast above
Sharm al-Shaikh. One hundred and ten miles
further north, at the head of the Gulf to
which these straits give access, are two seaports. One is the long-established port of
Aqaba, which is Jordan's only seaport. The
other, less than ten miles from the Jordanian
seaport, is the new Israeli port of Eilat,
which is now being developed to serve as a
centre for trade with East Africa, South
Africa and Asia.

Before the end of 1949 Egypt occupied the
uninhabited islands of Tiran and Sinafir at
the mouth of the Gulf, which in the past have
been claimed by Saudi Arabia. In a note of
January 28, 1950 addressed to the government
of the United States it stated that "This
occupation being in no way conceived in a
spirit of obstructing in any way innocent
passage through the stretch of water separating these two islands from the Egyptian coast
of Sinai, it follows that this passage, the
only practicable one, will remain free as in
the past, in conformity with international
practice and recognized principles of the law
of nations". Egypt later set up guns on the
Sinai Peninsula coast commanding the navigable channel in the Straits of Tiran. Ships
intending to pass through the straits, like
ships intending to pass through the Suez
Canal, were required to give advance notice
of their intention, together with information
as to the nature and destination of their
respective cargoes. In a few cases the alleged
right of visit and search was exercised, and
certain ships which tried to proceed without
complying with the regulations or without
stopping were challenged.
On July 26, 1951, when the Security Council
was considering Israel's second complaint
about interference with shipping in the Suez
Canal (see 3 (b) and (c) above), the representative of Israel said that there were "signs"
of an Egyptian intention to extend these
practices "to other waters" in which Israel
"possesses and intends to use its full maritime
rights". Not until January 1954, however,
did Israel specifically ask the Security Council
to consider the question of interference with
shipping proceeding to the port of Eilat. The
Security Council discussed this question in
February and March 1954, along with Israel's
third complaint of restrictions on shipping in
the Suez Canal. The representative of Israel
on February 5 cited in particular three cases
of interference at the Straits of Tiran-that
of a Danish vessel escorted by an armed
corvette to an Egyptian command post and
detained for 24 hours during a voyage from
Eilat to Mombasa, that of a United States
vessel carrying wheat to the Jordanian port
of Aqaba, which was fired on at the entry
to the Gulf, and that of an Italian vessel
fired on at the straits on a voyage from
Eritrea to Eilat. Israel's representative maintained that the effect of the restrictions had
been to hamper the legitimate development
of Israel's trade through the port of Eilat.
He held that they violated the armistice
agreement and Security Council resolutions of
August 11, 1949, November 17, 1950 and September 1, 1951. Here, as in the case of the
Suez Canal, the chief grievance was not the
actual number of ships visited and searched

APRIL 10, 1957
but the very much greater number of ships
which did not attempt to carry cargoes to
Eilat at all because of the risks involved.
The representative of Egypt in replying on
February 15, 1954 stated that since October
1951, 267 ships had passed through the Gulf
of Aqaba, of which 214 were British and 35
German, while the remainder flew the flags
of nine other countries. He stated that only
three of these ships were actually visited and
searched. The Egyptian position in this case
was similar to the position described in section 3 (b) and (c) above.
The New Zealand draft resolution vetoed
by the USSR on March 29, 1954, which had
to do in the first instance with the removal
of restrictions on Suez Canal traffic, closed
with a paragraph relating to interference
with ships proceeding to the port of Eilat.
The concluding paragraph was in the following terms: "(The Security Council) considers
that, without prejudice to the provisions of
the resolution of 1 September 1951, the
complaint referred to in sub-paragraph (b)
above ('Interference by Egypt with shipping
proceeding to the Israeli port of Elath on
the Gulf of Aqaba') should in the first instance
be dealt with by the Mixed Armistice Commission established under the General Armistice Agreement between Egypt and Israel."
This draft resolution was vetoed and Egyptian regulations regarding the passage of ships
through the Straits of Tiran continued to be
applicable until Israel occupied the southern
tip of the Sinai Peninsula at the beginning
of November 1956 and opened the Gulf of
Aqaba to all ships, regardless of cargo, bound
for the port of Eilat, as well as to all ships
bound for the port of Aqaba.
5. (a) The representative of Israel, speaking before the Security Council in defence of
Israel's invasion of the Sinai Peninsula, said
in part on October 30, 1956:
"The object of those operations (the invasion by Israel of the Sinai Peninsula) is
to eliminate the Egyptian fedayeen bases
from which armed Egyptian units, under the
special care and authority of Colonel Nasser,
invade Israel's territory for purposes of murder, sabotage and the creation of permanent
insecurity to peaceful life ... The system of
waging war against Israel by fedayeen units
is the product of Colonel Nasser's mind...
After intensive preparation during the spring
and summer of 1955, this new weapon was
launched in August of that year, breaking a
period of relative tranquillity". (See 2 (c) and
(d) above.)
After listing forty separate fedayeen attacks
which had occurred between April 20 and
October 28, 1956, the representative of Israel
went on to say, referring to a longer period
of Egyptian hostility:

"During the six years during which this
(Egyptian) belligerency has operated in violation of the armistice agreement, there have
occurred 435 cases of incursions from Egyptian-controlled territory, 1,843 cases of armed
robbery and theft, 1,339 cases of armed
clashes with Egyptian armed forces, 172 cases
of sabotage perpetrated by Egyptian military
units and fedayeen in Israel. As a result of
these actions of Egyptian hostility within
Israel, 364 Israelis were wounded and 101
killed. In 1956 alone, as a result of this
aspect of Egyptian aggression, 28 Israelis
were killed and 127 wounded. It cannot be
seriously suggested that these activities are
not the direct responsibility of the Government of Egypt."
Although the greater part of the address
of the representative of Israel was devoted
to a description of attacks on Israel from
Egyptian-controlled territory or by Egyptiancontrolled fedayeen operating from bases in
various Arab countries, he also drew the
attention of the Security Council to (i) Egypt's
purchase of large quantities of arms from
abroad which in the spring of 1956 "was
running most drastically to Israel's disadvantage"; (ii) the theory of continuing belligerency
proclaimed by Egypt, under which it "asserts
a right to perform hostile acts of its own
choice against Israel"; (iii) Egypt's conversion
of the Suez Canal "into an instrument for
unilateral national pressure, while maintaining a constant violation of international maritime law".
Explaining why the attack on Egypt had
been launched at the end of October the representative of Israel asserted that his government "had ample reason to fear that this
(fedayeen) activity was to be renewed on a
scale unprecedented even during the first
wave of fedayeen invasion in August 1955 or
during its recrudescence in the spring of
1956". (See also section 2 (c) and (d)
above.) It was a fact, he said, "that there
have never been any resolutions adopted by
the Security Council designed specifically to
protect the Israel civilian population against
the encroachments and the depredations of
the fedayeen units .

.

. Following the meeting

of the Chiefs of Staff of Egypt, Syria and
Jordan in Amman" on the occasion of the
signing of a tripartite military agreement on
October 24, 1956, "we had stronger reason
than ever before to believe that this recrudescence (of fedayeen activity) would take place
... The very day after we gave notice of this
apprehension, the fedayeen units began to
arrive." In 1948 it had taken the Security
Council "something like eight weeks" to
secure the withdrawal of Egyptian and other
Arab armies from Palestinian territory now
under Israel's control. Facing "alone" the

SENATE
issues inherent in the situation existing in
1956, Israel had made a decision to invoke its
"sovereign rights of self-defence".
(b) The following is an English translation
of the terms in which the Prime Minister of
Israel stated these objectives in speaking in
the Knesset, the Parliament of Israel, on
November 8, 1956: "We set ourselves three
main roles in the Sinai operation-(i) the
destruction of the forces which lay in wait to
destroy us; (ii) the liberation of the territory
of the homeland which had been occupied by
the invader (this was a reference to the
occupation of the Gaza strip); and (iii) the
safeguarding of free navigation in the Gulf
of Eilat (the Gulf of Aqaba) and the Suez
Canal."
6. (a) No.
(b) The Gaza strip was a small part of the
area which the United Nations General Assembly recommended for inclusion in the
Arab state in its partition resolution of November 29, 1947. When the British mandate
ended in mid-May 1948 Egyptian forces
occupied the Gaza strip and territory beyond
it and in the course of the 1948 hostilities received some 200,000 Arab refugees from other
areas seeking asylum behind the Egyptian
lines. When the Egyptians were forced back
(see 2 (a) above) fighting with Israelis occurred in this small area, but under Article
VI: 3 of the armistice agreement of February
24, 1949 all Israeli miiltary forces were to be
withdrawn from the Gaza strip, which was
to remain under Egyptian military control
pending a peace settlement.
(c) In comparing the two situations the
following points should be borne in mind:
(i) the Gaza strip is less than 30 miles long
and about six miles wide; (ii) its inhabitants
are not Egyptians but Palestinian Arabs;
(iii) Egypt has not annexed the Gaza strip
but bas been administering it on behalf of
the Palestinian Arabs pending a peace settlement; (iv) in the peace settlement "the rights,
claims and positions of either party" are not
to be prejudiced "in any way" by the present
location of the armistice demarcation line or
by any other provision of the armistice agreement (see Article XI, section 2(b) above).
7. (a) On February 2, 1957, the General
Assembly adopted a resolution "recognizing
that withdrawal by Israel must be followed
by action which would assure progress towards the creation of peaceful conditions" in
the area. This resolution went on to request
the Secretary-General, in consultation with
the parties concerned, to carry out various
measures either specifically enunciated in the
resolution or defined therein by reference to
previous reports of the Secretary-General
which had been approved by the Assembly.

The Secretary-General has since been devoting his attention to the tasks assigned to
him under the resolution. A fundamental
responsibility, arising out of the General
Assembly's exhortation to Egypt and Israel to
observe scrupulously the 1949 Armistice
Agreement, involves the implementation of the
Assembly's directive that maintenance of the
Agreement "requires the placing of the United
Nations Emergency Force on the Egypt-Israel
Armistice Demarcation Line." The SecretaryGeneral also has been concentrating on working out special arrangements for the Gaza
Strip, not only with regard to the interposition of UNEF between the armed forces of
Egypt and Israel, but also for utilizing, in the
Secretary-General's words, "the assistance of
the United Nations and its appropriate auxiliary bodies . . . toward putting a definite end

to all incursions and raids across the border
from either side." The efforts of the SecretaryGeneral to promote progress towards the
creation of peaceful conditions are being
actively supplemented by diplomatic efforts
on the part of many governments interested
in the welfare of the Middle East, including
the Government of Canada.
(b) To secure and supervise the cease-fire
in accordance with resolutions of the United
Nations General Assembly.
(c) The Secretary of State for External
Aff airs reviewed the question of consent to
the presence of the United Nations Emergency Force in Egypt in a statement in the
House of Commons on March 15, 1957, when
be said:
"Last November 5, . . . the Egyptian Gov-

ernment formally conveyed to the SecretaryGeneral explicit acceptance of the General
Assembly resolution of that date, which established the United Nations Force to perform
the tasks which I have already outlined.
Egypt's acceptance of this resolution was a
v oluntary act, by which the Egyptian Government imposed on itself a qualification upon
the exercise of its sovereignty.
"This decision was formally conveyed in
an aide-memoire on the basis for the presence
and functioning of UNEF in Egypt, an aidememoire submitted to the General Assembly
by the Secretary-General in his report on
November 20, and subsequently noted with
approval by the Assembly. In this aidememoire, . . . the terms of which had been

agreed between the Secretary-General and
the Egyptian Government, the Government of
Egypt declared:
'When exercising its sovereign rights on
any matter concerning the presence and
functioning of UNEF, it will be guided, in
good faith, by its acceptance of the general
resolution of November 5, 1956.'

APRIL 10, 1957
"This is a quotation from the Egyptian
communication. And that declaration was
balanced in the aide-memoire by a declaration on the part of the United Nations,
through the Secretary-General, and I quote,
that 'the activities of UNEF will be guided,
in good faith, by the task established for the
Force' in the resolution of the General Assembly, and that-again I quote-'in particular,
the United Nations, understanding this to correspond to the wishes of the Government of
Egypt, reaffirms its willingness to maintain
the UNEF until its task is completed.'
"This, then, . . . is the nature of Egypt's

consent to the presence and functioning of
the United Nations Emergency Force on
Egyptian territory. There has been no intringement on the sovereignty of the Government of Egypt by the action of any other
government or governments. But in the
arrangements made and in the agreement
which I have referred to, the United Nations,
which established this Force to do certain
tasks, clearly bas a right to be consulted as
to whether and when these tasks have been
cischarged, as it would if they were to be
extended. From this, it follows in our view,
and this is the view of the Secretary-General
also, that if Egypt should at any time make a
request for UNEF's withdrawal, the appropriate procedure would be for that request
to go first to the Advisory Committee on
UNEF through the Secretary-General. There
it would be discussed by the Committee which

82719-35

was set up for that purpose by the Assembly,
and if necessary and desirable the whole
matter could then be referred to the full
Assembly for decision. And therefore any
question of whether UNEF should be withdrawn would become a matter for discussion
with and decision by the United Nations. This
is this government's understanding of the
procedure which should be followed.
"Having said that, however, I should add
if Egypt refused to accept the United Nations
view that UNEF's task was still unfinished,
and that UNEF should not be withdrawn,
Egypt would, in our view, be nullifying its
acceptance of the Assembly's basic resolution
establishing the Force and laying down its
function.
"Nevertheless, the Assembly does not have
any authority under the Charter of the
United Nations to create binding legal obligations on member states, and Egypt, therefore, could not, in the last resort, be compelled by the United Nations Assembly to
continue to accept any resolution or to cooperate in carrying it out. The Assembly
cannot force its view on any state although
in certain contingencies the Security Council
can attempt to do that."

HOSPITAL INSURANCE

AND

DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill No. 320, an Act to authorize contributions by Canada in respect of
programs administered by the provinces, providing hospital insurance and laboratory and
other services in aid of diagnosis.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: I move the
second reading now.
Honourable senators, this bill is generally
known as the Hospital Insurance Bill. It
provides hospital insurance, and laboratory
and other services in aid of diagnosis.
Personally, it is a great satisfaction to me
to be here to present this bill to this chamber.
For many years, and particularly while I
was a member of the House of Commons, I
have been very much interested in this subject. It is also of great interest to the community from which I come, the city of
Brantford, and as well to the whole industrial area of western Ontario. I was highly
pleased to see that the young man who succeeded me as Member of Parliament for
Brantford, Mr. James E. Brown, also took a
keen interest in this legislation. I can assure
the house that the people of my district at
least are delighted that this hospital insurance plan is now to come into effect.
As honourable senators know, this is another step in the Government's plan to provide social services to all people in Canada.
It is not necessary for me to review the
history of this type of legislation over the
past 40 years. The Right Honourable Mackenzie King, as we all recall, looked forward
to a measure of this kind, and it was when
he was Prime Minister that the national
health grants program was put into effect.
Under that program Parliament voted the
sum of $35 million per year to provide and
improve health services throughout Canada.

It was from that beginning that the groundwork for this legislation was laid. Thousands
of technical persons have been trained and
hospitals have been enlarged-in fact, more
than $200 million in all has been spent in
preparation for this step.
The interest in hospital insurance was
continued by our present Prime Minister;
and throughout the whole period the Minister of National Health and Welfare has been
keenly interested in this subject and has
been very persistent in keeping it in the
forefront. I think the country as a whole
should be very pleased and happy that we
have the present Minister of National Health
and Welfare in that portfolio. We ail owe
a debt of gratitude to him for the interest
which he has taken in this subject. It must
have been a great day for him, a historic
occasion, when he introduced this bill in the
House of Commons and when it was passed
by that house.
At the dominion-provincial conference on
fiscal matters which was held in Ottawa on
October 5, 1955, arrangements were made
for a subsequent conference to discuss the
subject of hospital insurance. The subsequent conference, January 1956, was attended
by representatives from the provincial
departments of health and also from the
federal department. After four days deliberation the Prime Minister of Canada and
the Minister of National Health and Welfare
made statements setting forth a proposal
which the dominion Government hoped
would make it possible to have hospital
insurance in Canada.
Briefly stated, the proposal of the federal
Government is to pay to each province which
enters into an agreement 50 ýper cent of the
cost of operation of its hospitals in connection with the ordinary care of patients, and
50 per cent of the laboratory and other
Honourable
services in aid of diagnosis.
senators know that many patients go to
hospitals merely for examinations, for
diagnosis.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is this provision for
everyone, or only for indigents?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is for everyone;
there is to be universal coverage. The 50
per cent which I mentioned will be arrived
at as follows: 25 per cent of the actual cost
within a province will be paid by the
federal Government to that province, plus
25 per cent of the cost on a per capita basis
throughout Canada. I will explain later the
purpose of this provision. The plan can be
put into operation when a majority of provinces, representing at least 50 per cent of
the total population of Canada, have entered
into the agreement.

APRIL 11, 1957
I have prepared some notes which set
out in more detail what I have said; and
there are a number of very interesting tables
which, I think, honourable senators would
like to see included in Hansard. I do not
recall having seen them in the House of
Commons Hansard, and I do not think they
were presented in that house, although they
may have been produced in committee.
The purposes whieh this bill seeks to
achieve may be summed up as follows:
(a) It seeks to embody in legislative form
the details of the federal offer to the provinces of hospital insurance and diagnostic
services as announced by the Prime Minister
on January 26, 1956.
(b) It authorizes the negotiation of agreements providing that the federal Government
shall share with participating provinces the
costs of insured hospital in-patient and outpatient services as well as diagnostic
services.
(c). It defines the nature of the services
whose costs the federal Government will
share, as well as those which are excluded
from the sharing arrangement.
(d). It establishes the actual formula on
which the federal contribution to the participating provinces is based.
(e). It provides that the arrangement for
federal sharing of the costs of provincial
schemes shall commence when:
1. a majority of the provinces, representing at least half the population in
Canada have
(i) entered into agreements with the federal
Government under this act;
(ii) passed the necessary provincial legislation that will enable the provinces to
carry out the undertakings required
of a provincial law in accordance with
this legislation;
2. the provincial law in each of the
provinces is in force.
Honourable senators, the provincial law
may in some instances be already in force.
In others, as new legislation is passed, it may
be provided that it shall come into force on
receiving Royal Assent, or on a specific date
mentioned in the provincial law, or by proclamation, or on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor in
Council.
If those provisions are included in the
legislation, then it will be accepted.
Whatever the means adopted for bringing
the law into force, this bill stipulates that
only when six provinces have passed their
definitive legislation and put it into force
can the federal contributions commence.
Let me give an illustration of the way in
which this provision operates. It may be
82719-35i

that in a given province the provincial law
will provide that registration is to commence
on a specific date; that premiums shall commence to be paid on a subsequent date, also
specified; and that benefits shall not commence
to be paid under the plan until six months
after the collection of premiums has commenced. Now, that is not a far-fetched illustration. In fact, unemployment insurance
started in a way similar to this. Contribution
collections began six months before benefits
began to be paid. I might also say that at
least in one province, Nova Scotia, the commission appointed a year ago to study the
federal proposal has recommended to the
provincial Government a plan under which
benefits would commence to be paid several
months after the commencement of the premium collections. In the event of legislation
along these lines, the Government requirement would be met as soon as the act itself
was in force.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think it was some time
ago, about a year ago, that this commission
was appointed in Nova Scotia. Is that not
right?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable
friend is right: it was about a year ago.
And if its recommendation is carried out
the province can enter into an agreement
with the federal Government.
These are the main points embodied in the
legislation now before the house.
May I draw the attention of the house to
what was said in the other place in January
1956 concerning federal legislation.
The
Government said, in effect, that as soon as
six provinces representing a majority of the
population declared themselves ready to introduce hospital insurance, it would come
to Parliament with a request for legislation
authorizing grants to cover a share of the
cost of these -agreed services-that is, hospital
insurance and diagnostic services. Honourable
senators, the plan has been accepted already
by five provinces, namely, British Columbia,
Saskatchewan, Alberta, Newfoundland, and,
last but not least, Ontario. With Ontario's
acceptance of the federal proposal we now
have the required majority of population,
and need the accession of only one more
province to have the required majority of
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What are the prospects?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, I would say the
prospects are very good. The Government
and several of the provinces have been negotiating. I do not like to name provinces, but
we are close to agreement with several of the
other provinces.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Baird: What is the object of
bringing the bill in at this time? Only five
provinces have accepted, so is there any great
urgency now?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is a very pertinent question, and I am just coming to that
point. My honourable friend asks why the
Government has come forward with this
legislation without waiting for the sixth
province. I will give the reasons. First: the
Government wishes to let Parliament and the
provinces sec, understand and approve the
exact nature of the legislation as contemplated. Second: the Government feels that
the provinces will naturally want to study this
legislation with the greatest care. Third:
within the limits prescribed by the complex
legislation we shall then want to move on
to the task of drawing up the necessary regulations, and after that to the still more important business of negotiating and concluding
the actual operating agreements between the
federal Government and the six or more provinces which intend to participate.
Honourable senators, I have gone to some
pains to prepare this statement, because
I expected questions would be asked.
I wish to point out that draft copies of
the agreements have already been sent to the
five agreeing provinces, and the Government
is now awaiting the comments of those provinces on these proposed agreements.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Mr. Leader, before you
leave the agreements, may I ask if those
five agreements are uniform with regard to
terms? I ask that question because I was
unable to understand why negotiations were
necessary. You have laid down the formula,
and I was wondering if you would cover
that point.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The agreements are
not necessarily exactly the same, but the
principle is the same in all of them. The
question may come up as to just what institutions are hospitals, for instance. One province may say that a particular institution is
a hospital, while another province rnay say
that some other type of institution is a hospital, but the principle in the agreements will
be the same.
May I say a word as to financial considerations? The contribution of the federal
Governnent will amount, as I have stated,
to 50 per cent of the .cost of standard ward
care across the nation as a whole. The
honourable member from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies) asked if this was to be just for
indigents, and I replied that it would be
universal in its coverage. Of course, hospital
expenses of those persons taking private

wards, having private nurses, would be included in this to the extent only of the cost
incurred for standard ward care.
Hon. Mr. Davies: The private patient
would get a deduction?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The private patient
would get a deduction.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is there provision for
people who become ill and do not go to
hospital?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, just for diagnostic and radiological services.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Well, if they are still in
their own homes that is not provided for?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, it is not provided
for here. But this 50 per cent is a very
large contribution; it amounts to paying half,
or almost half, of every individual's hospital
bill, except for private or semi-private
charges, and then, as the honourable senator
from Kingston has said, there is a credit.
I think honourable senators will be interested to know that on the basis of the carefully prepared 1956 estimates the total cost
to the federal Government, with all ten
provinces participating, would have been
Of this amount,
$182.5 million for 1956.
$158.5 million would have been for hospitalization, and, $24 million for diagnostic
services. The 1957 estimates, with slightly
higher costs, more hospital beds, and larger
population, would closely approximate $200
million for the federal share.
I have referred to what I might call the
double-barrelled nature of the formula as
it applies to individual provinces. Instead
of payments being based on 50 per cent of
the provincial average per capita cost, they
are based on 25 per cent of the provincial
average and 25 per cent of the national
average. The effect of basing contributions
in part on the national average is to benefit
the poorer provinces whose expenditures are
For
lower than the national average.
instance, for Newfoundland, whose expenditurcs on hospital care in 1956 were estimated
at $3,700,000 under this arrangement, the
federal contribution would have amounted to
72 per cent, or to $8.77 per capita. In fact,
based on the 1956 estimates, six provinces,
Edward
Prince
Newfoundland,
namely,
Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec
and Manitoba, would have received, under
the formula, more than 50 per cent of the
actual costs. On the other hand, the provinces whose costs are higher than the
national average would have received something less than 50 per cent of the actual
costs. The four provinces in this category
are: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. I would draw attention

APRIL 11, 1957
especially to the fact that ail the provinces
which will receive less than 50 per cent have
now accepted the federal proposai and have
indicated their readiness to proceed.
I have before me, honourable senators, a
table which. sets forth for each province the

per capita amount and the corresponding percentage whîch the provinces would have
received in 1956. Perhaps instead of reading
the figures now I could, with the consent of
the house, place them on Hansard.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
it has been said in some places that the
federal Government's proposai to the provinces has not been generous. I arn quite
sure you will agree that the Government
has been generous in its proposal if I were
to indicate the actual amounts that the
Government would have been called upon
to provide under this formula in the year
1956, compared with the amounts that the
provinces would have had to raise from
premiums or other sources.

Hon. Mr. Davies: May 1 ask a question?
Who will lay down the regulations as to
what coverage a patient will get under particular circumstances? As honourable senators
probably know, the regulations o! the commercial insurance companies which operate
hospital insurance plans have some strange
provisions. For instance, if a patient who
requires a diagnosis, say for a basic metabolism test that takes only part of a day,
wishes to enter the hopsital the night before
the test is to take place, hie is told that no
bed is available and he must corne in the
morning. He enters the hospital on the
morning of the test, the doctor attends him,
and later in the day hie is allowed to go home.
In those circumstances the insurance company makes no contribution towards the cost
of service because the patient was not in
hospital over night.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am sure that bef ore the Government enters into an agreement with a province the kind o! case to
which the honourable senator has referred
will be provided for. There is provision,
as I have already pointed out, whereby
when a person goes in for an examination
or for diagnosis the Government will pay

SENATE
50 per cent of the cost, and that of course
includes the cost of the over-night stay in
hospital.
May I draw the attention of honourable
senators to one important difference between
the contribution to be provided by the
federal Government in each province and
that which is being made by the provinces
themselves? The federal Government's contribution in every case is almost 100 per
cent new money. That is, it is in its entirety an added charge on the federal exchequer. This is not the case with provincial
contributions. In fact, the provincial contributions represent to a considerable extent
moneys which are already being paid out for
hospitalization by the provincial and municipal governments; consequently, the net
amount of new money to be found by each
provincial Government is very much less
than the provincial share of the costs which
I have just given. I have a table which

gives that picture very clearly, and with
the consent of the house I would place it
also on Hansard.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would
the honourable leader give an example from
the table?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will take the
first province mentioned, Newfoundland.
Under this proposal the cost to the Government of Newfoundland would be $1,500,000.
In 1955, the year given in the table, that
province was paying out $3,300,000. So
under this plan Newfoundland would save
$1,800,000. Let me take the figures for Nova

it would have to find is $2,400,000.

Even this, honourable senators, does not tell
the whole story, for while the provinces
have to find a certain amount of new money
through the levy of premiums, or in other
ways, a very much smaller sum has to be
obtained by new premiums or taxation than
the amounts presently paid under voluntary
insurance plans and as direct payments by
individuals on account of hospitalization.
Almost without exception, the amount of
money now being contributed by a part of
the provincial population toward voluntary
insurance plans is more than enough to

would supersede it.

province can make an arrangement to allow

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What this amounts
to, honourable senators, is this: in each province the provincial share of cost can be met
by continuing present provincial and municipal contributions to hospital care, and by
collecting from all the population of the
province an amount equivalent to that being
contributed at present for voluntary hospital
insurance premiums by a portion only of
the population.
Honourable senators, I have nothing more
to say except probably to repeat just what
the purpose of this bill is. The purpose is to
give the Government parliamentary authority
to negotiate the agreements we now have to
negotiate with the provinces.
Honourable senators, I think we can confidently hope that by 1958, or any event
not later than January 1, 1959, hospital
insurance will be in actual operation in most
of the provinces, for most of the people of
Canada.

Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: May I ask the
honourable leader a question? Can he say
whether or not there is any precedent in the
history of our legislative procedure for presenting a bill in anticipation of the approval
of the different provinces-that is, setting
out the basis of legislation which the federal
Parliament is willing to implement if in the
future a sufficient number of provinces
approve? Has not the procedure in the past
been to wait for the provinces to enact implementing legislation?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not sure
whether this procedure bas been followed
before or not.
I think that, generally
speaking, the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) is correct. However, I am not sure whether the unemployment insurance agreements were negotiated
in that way.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am not speaking of
insurance legislation particularly.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Or whether old age
pensions came into effect in 1926 in that
manner.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No. One province waited
four years, and another waited nine years.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But what the
honourable senator from Ottawa asks is, if
we ever passed legislation which enabled the
Government to enter into agreements in the
future?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That is right-anticipatory legislation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should think we did
that in the case of old age pensions legislation. My recollection is that all the provinces did not come into the plan at the same
time.
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh: Honourable
senators, may I direct a question to the
With regard
Leader of the Government?
to the amount of the payment that will be
made by the federal Government, will the
amount be half of what the patient pays or
half of the hospital costs? Now, I will explain
that a little bit. I am a member of a hospital
board. We charge the patient only $1 a day
but the actual cost to the hospital district is
over $7 a day, and the difference between the
$7 and the $1 is made up by taxation of the
people in that hospital district. What I would
like to know is if that hospital will receive
half of the $7 or half of the $1?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If the hospital
charges the patient then the province will not
get a share.
Hon. Mr. Sambaugh: Will the taxpayer in
that hospital district still have to make up
that $6 or will a part of that be paid by the
federal Government? That is the question.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If the patient is
charged $7 a day and it cost the hospital $13,
then the province would get a share of the $6.
Hon. Mr. Sambaugh: That does not answer
the question at all.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I cannot add very much to the excellent
detail presentation which the Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) has given us. Yet because of
my long association with the objectives of
this bill I feel compelled to make a few
comments and some observations. They will
be of a more general nature.
Passage of this bill is, in my judgment,
the most important social welfare achievement of this Twenty-Second Parliament. It
has been one of the most important items of
unfinished business on our calendar; and,
as far as Liberals are concerned, it has been

on our conscience for a great many years.
Throughout the period of my own participation in public life it bas been an active
public issue, an unsolved problem. I have
spoken on the subject hundreds of times, in
and out of the House of Commons. My first
speech in the Senate, on January 18, 1956,
dealt with the national health program which
I hoped would be brought in soon to complete the magnificent program of social
security legislation planned and carried out
by the Liberal Government.
The groundwork was commenced on May
14, 1948, under the national health grants,
and it has brought forward this measure
which is by far the most important social
advancement in a decade.
Now, at last, after years of waiting, we
are finding in this bill an important part of
the solution of the problem. For that, every
member of this Twenty-Second Parliament
has the right to feel a real measure of
satisfaction. More particularly it is to the
credit of the Government as a whole, and
to the Prime Minister and leader of the
Liberal party, that this important advance
in social progress is now being made.
But more than to any other individual in
the Government and in this Parliament,
credit and praise for this achievement must
be given to the Honourable Paul Martin,
Minister of National Health and Welfare.
He, more than any other single person, has
brought this about. In all the years of his
service as minister of the department he
has persisted in his purpose. He has never
lost sight of his objective. Through many
periods of discouragement and delay be has
continued to fight for what he believed in;
and the result, in the form of this present
measure, must give him abundant satisfaction.
There have been many Ministers of Health
down through the years since 1920, when
that department was established. Many of
them have been interested in the achievement of health insurance. But it took Paul
Martin, with his tireless energy and persistent dedication to a cause in which e steadfastly believed, to accomplish in 1957 what
others before him had tried without success
to achieve.
The honourable Leader of the Government
has mentioned that the total cost involved is
approximately $400 million, which is to be
shared on a 50-50 basis by the dominion and
the provinces.
It is interesting to note the movementthe precipitate movement-of public opinion.
The Gallup poll indicates that in 1956, 62
per cent, and in 1957, 72 per cent of the
people of Canada were in favour of a health
plan paid for by taxes. It is also interesting

APRIL 11, 1957
to know the number of people now covered
by various health schemes. Seven million
have surgical insurance, 5.4 million have
medical coverage, and 3.2 million-most of
them in Saskatchewan, British Columbia and
Alberta-are included in hospital schemes.
Nevertheless, there is an overwhelming demand for the Government to take action in
the form of a national health plan. It stems,
I think, from the realization that the Government has been constantly concerned with
human needs of individual Canadians.
This particular social measure produces
adventure as well as security. It is just the
first step: there is much more to come to
fully complete the Canadian social mosaic.
The Government plans give the most value
per dollar spent on health insurance, since
there is no need for selling, advertising, or
profits. The latest figures which I have been
able to find indicate that, in 1953, for every
$1 of premium subscribed administrative
costs were as follows: a casualty insurance
company, 42.6 cents; a life insurance company, 17.5 cents; Ontario Blue Cross, 7 cents;
British Columbia Hospital Insurance Service,
6 cents; Saskatchewan Hospital Service, 4
cents.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): Per
premium dollar collected?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes. These figures, I believe, are authentic and should be studied
and understood by all Canadians, especially
those who still believe that the words "Government" and "waste" are synonymous.
Now that we are embarking on this scheme
it is interesting to take a look at the Ontario
plan, with which many of us are familiar. It
will provide standard ward care in either
active treatment hospitals or hospitals for
the chronically ill, including mentally il and
tuberculosis hospitals; unlimited in-patient
diagnostic services; all necessary hospital
extras such as transfusions, X-rays, drugs,
operating room and the like; certain outpatient services and, at the outset or later,
out-patient, diagnostic services. At the very
minimum the plan will provide all the hospital benefits now available through the
Ontario Blue Cross standard ward care plan,
plus no limit on duration of necessary stay
or amount of necessary extras, plus certain
out-patient services, plus no limit on necessary hospital maternity benefits, plus hospitalization for tuberculosis and mental
illness.
From all we have been able to gather, the
premiums are not likely to exceed $2.25 per
month for a family and $1.50 a month for a
single person-which is one-half the present
cost of Blue Cross standard ward care. No
private plan can possibly compete. The Government plan is by far the best and the
82719-36

cheapest. I think that indicates what is
involved in the Ontario plan and speaks for
itself. It will be some time, however, before
it will be possible to integrate the various
private schemes which are now available.
Five years ago, in 1952, only two provinces were interested in hospital insurance.
Under this legislation five provinces have
publicly declared their desire to proceed,
and I venture to predict that by the time
the program gets under way in Ontario at
least eight provinces will have come into the
scheme. In view of the dominion paying out
50 per cent of the cost annually, I cannot
foresee how any province will be satisfied to
pay into the public treasury and not take
some benefit from it. If they stay out it will
be for a very short time.
Honourable senators, let me just close by
saying that this would not have been accomplished, this would not have become a
reality in the lives of 16 million Canadians
in 1957, had it not been for Paul Martin.
For this, the crowning achievement in his
ten years of accomplishment as Minister of
National Health and Welfare, Canadians of
the present and the future will be for ever
in his debt.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this sitting of the Senate puts me in mind
of two previous occasions when I had the
honour of being here, some years ago, both
of which have stood out in my memory
ever since. The first was in the year 1940, when
the measure for unemployment insurance was
introduced into this chamber. The second
was a year or two later, when the first measure of family allowances was brought in
here.
I welcome, as indeed I think every member
of this house welcomes, this important and
far-reaching measure of social benefit which
is before us today. In brief, honourable
senators, when it has been fully implemented
it will ensure that the benefits of hospital
care and basic diagnostic services will be
available to all Canadians on an orderly and
economically-sound basis.
I have a few observations, very general
in character, to make on this legislation.
The first deals with a point that was raised
by my honourable friend from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Crol). I think it is perfectly
clear that the great majority of Canadians
are in favour of a scheme of hospital insurance of this kind. As he said, the Canadian
Institute of Public Opinion, our Gallup Poll,
showed that 72 per cent of the people polled
last September were in favour of such a
scheme, and that this was 10 per cent more
than were in favour of it only six months

SENATE
earlier. So I think we can be certain that
the people of Canada support this measure
which we are considering today.
The second observation that I would make
is this. When this scheme goes into operation
it will be of enormous help to the average
Canadian family-the family with a modest
income derived chiefly from earnings and
having nothing very much in the way of
savings or capital accumulated against the
misfortune of serious illness. Anyone who
has ever had anything to do with social work
has been brought face to face time and again
with the devastating effect of long and serious
illness upon the means and the morale of
the average family. That was brought very
clearly to my attention in the days of the
war when I was chairman of the Dependents'
Board of Trustees for Military District No. 2
in the District of Montreal.
The average family can stand a short illness. It can stand minor ailments, but the
thing that unbalances its budget and brings
it closer to ruin than anything else is prolonged hospitalization of one of its members.
That is especially so in these days of
increasing costs of hospitalization, of which
all of us are fully aware. You cannot blame
the hospitals for these increasing costs. They
are of course subject to the same rules of
economics as everybody else is. The burden
of the wages they pay and the supplies they
require is becoming heavier all the time. In
addition, the hospitals are constantly introducing new equipment, new techniques and
new technicians to improve the lot of humanity as new methods and means are discovered in the medical world.
All these
things cost money and every one of them is
reflected in the substantially increasing cost
of hospital care today.
My third observation, with which I shal
close, is that this legislation will of course
result in considerable expense. As the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) has said, it is estimated that
if it becomes universally applicable throughout Canada it will cost the federal Government in a full year $182,500,000. Incidentally,
with that in mind perhaps honourable senators will agree with me that it was a
prudent thing for the Minister of Finance to
budget for a surplus in his current budget.
But I believe the people of Canada will be
willing to meet this expense, heavy though
it may be. I believe the people will realize
that this expenditure will mean spreading the
cost of hospital protection for the nation as
a whole, thus relieving individuals and individual families of the excessive burden of
paying for prolonged hospitalization, which
sometimes financially ruins them today.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I would like to give a brief account of
what is happening in my province of Quebec.
We now have a measure of public assistance for our poor people, those who are
unable to pay anything for hospitalization.
These people are assisted by a fund to which
50 or 60 per cent is contributed by the
province and the balance by the municipalites. But take the white-collar workers who
pay income tax,Hon. Mr. Hugessen: They are not indigents.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: That is right, but
they are unable to meet their medical
expenses, especially with regard to hospitalization. Under this federal health plan these
people will for the first time be able to
receive some assistance with respect to their
medical costs. The white-collar workers in
Quebec contribute a large amount of taxes
to the federal treasury, and I hope that the
Government of Quebec will come into this
federal-provincial plan so that these people
may receive assistance under it.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Is it intended that this
scheme will be administered by a commission or by the Minister of Health?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Each province will
administer its own hospitals, and I presume
that at the end of every year it will send
an account to the federal Government, which
will pay its share of the cost after examining
the provincial ex-pense sheet very carefully.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Will

a

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, I think so.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I rise on a point of
privilege. In bis remarks the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) classified
Newfoundland as one of the poorer provinces.
I object to that. We may not have all the
money we need, but there are many other
things besides money; we have many other
kinds of wealth.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I quite agree with the
honourable gentleman. I did not mean the
word "poorer" to apply in any way to the
wonderful manhood and womanhood of that
province; they are not surpassed elsewhere in
Canada.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I ask for further enlightenment on one
phase of this bill, which was referred to
by the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croll), namely, the lesser
cost of this plan as compared with the cost
of the voluntary plans, such as Blue Cross. I
have maintained a current interest in the
development of this question of national

APRIL
insurance, but have not looked carefully into
the details of this bill. Generally speaking,
I take it that the plan is one of endowment
on the part of the federal Government, which
the provinces will administer at their own
levels of efficiency and need, according to
the requirement of each province.
I think one very important principle involved is the extent to which this plan, if
adopted by a sufficient number of provinces,
will supersede entirely the present voluntary
efforts of a vast number of people in this
country to provide for their own needs, and
those of their families, in time of illness
and when the need for hospitalization arises.
I know of many cases of younger people who
through the co-operative effect of such movements have been able to relieve themselves
of many of the heavier costs that prevailed
in years gone by. It seems to me that a line
of demarcation might be drawn in the application of this plan which would enable those
who are able to bear the cost of voluntary
hospitalization for a period of, say, three
months, to do so. I say three months purely
as a tentative period. After a period of,
say, three months a great many victims of
illness in need of hospitalization could then
come within the scope of a public insurance
plan in each province. I mention this from
the point of view of economy only. I do not
like the idea of establishing a level of payments to the provinces before it is known
exactly how much they require. There is an
estimated cost of $182 million or $200 million
connected with the application of this legislation. If the provinces are to administer this
whole plan, in addition to their own donations, it seems to me-and this has already
been suggested in the province of Manitobathat the plan should be based to a certain
extent on a means test. It should not
eliminate or supersede entirely the desire Of
people to avail themselves of their own voluntary services in times of difficulty, when
they are perfectly capable of maintaining a
voluntary insurance plan. Why eliminate that
very desirable factor in the life of this
country?

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: For instance, I doubt if
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) is in need of an old age pension
nearly as much as I am.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You are not getting
one.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I know. I also know
that legislation in this country, as in other
countries, is based on the greatest good to
the greatest number, a principle to which I
subscribe, as a liberal of the John Stuart
Mill school. At the same time, I also put a
premium upon the willingness and the
desire of people, especially young people
coming into good-earning years of responsibility, to pay their own way as far as they
are able to do so. It seems to me it should
be made very clear that this plan of health
insurance should be extended to benefit that
section of our population which is below the
average economic standard of our country,
so that when sickness or misfortune overtakes them, they can be provided for. I
think that should be kept in mind, and that
a line of demarcation should be established,
in the way of a means test of some kind, to
lessen the cost of the service, particularly
from the point of view of the federal treasury, which in the end is not going to be the
controller of this situation at all. The controller is going to be each province which
administers the act.

Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the leader
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to clarify the position?
I am somewhat 'concerned since hearing
what the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) said. Will this legislation completely wipe out the insurance which,
for example, industries have taken out for
employees in the Blue Cross plan or the
Physicians and Surgeons plan, or will industries continue to have the privilege of maintaining
their
own
private
insurance
agreements?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That would be a
matter for each province to decide. But if
they do maintain agreements such as my

and no doubt that statement would apply to

not have to take the old age pension.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is so, but the

measure that could be devised, in the light of
experience available at this time. I would
like to think that as time goes on and as
experience is developed the measure can be
improved and strengthened. I have particular reference at this time, not so much to
the great need of people for some hospital
insurance-I think that has been well
demonstrated in the speeches we have heard
this morning-but, as this is an attempt to
provide hospital insurance, to the hospital
facilities themselves.
May I refer to the interpretation section
of the bill, section 2, and in particular to
paragraph (d) which reads:

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I too regret that situation, but I do not
know what can be done about it. We adjourned our sitting yesterday afternoon waiting for the legislation to come forward
so that we might consider it last evening.
But it did not pass the House of Commons
until a late hour.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is it not a fact that
in the other house several amendments were
made to this bill?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No. Some amendments were proposed but none were made.
In answer to the question raised by the
honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly), I can assure him the problems which lie has mentioned have already
come to the attention of the minister and
officials of the department and will continue to receive their attention.
While we are giving credit to those whose
efforts have brought about this bill, I think
I should not sit down without also expressing our appreciation to the Deputy Ministers of the Department of National Health
and Welfare, Dr. Cameron and Dr. Davidson.
Over the years they both have taken a
great interest in hospital insurance, and
I am confident that they will most carefully
examine the agreements which are to be
entered into between the federal Government
and the provinces.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

do so I wish to review some of the circumstances which have led to the necessity for
marketing legislation.
I think it is agreed that from time immemorial there have been two major problems
in relation to the great and important industry of agriculture: first, that of production; second, that of marketing. In the field
of production great strides have been made,
particularly over the last 20 years. This progress has been due primarily to new techniques, research and experimentation, and
the mechanization of Canadian farms. It has
resulted in the farm people themselves as
operators becoming familiar with the knowhow of modern techniques in relation to production. We still have a long way to go,
because there will always be changes, resulting from scientific research and so on; but

at the moment, it seems to me, our greatest
problem is in the field of grading, packaging
and marketing.
I believe the first piece of legislation on
marketing in Canada was passed in British
Columbia in 1927. At that time the conditions in marketing processes were chaotic,
particularly with respect to vegetables and
fruit, and in desperation, because they were
facing bankruptcy, the producers in British
Columbia appealed to the Legislature to pass
a provincial marketing act. The request was
favourably received, and pursuant to the act
of 1927 boards were set up and functioned
reasonably satisfactorily until 1931. In that
year a dispute relative to the jurisdiction or
authority of these boards went before the
courts; the act was declared ultra vires, and
In 1934 anthe boards ceased to function.
other marketing bill was introduced into
and passed by the British Columbia Legislature, based on their experience of previous
years and their conception of the kind of act
which would be constitutionally valid. Before the act went into operation it was referred to the courts, by whom it was declared

APRIL 11, 1957
intra vires; and under it the boards are still
carrying on, not entirely under the old law,
but with appropriate amendments.
In 1933 the Legislature of New Brunswick
passed a bill known as the Dairy Products
Act, which gave the Government authority
to set up a commission and confer upon it
the power to regulate prices and spreads as
between producers and consumers, and the
margins permitted to dairies, and prices in
not only retail but wholesale transactions
with institutions such as hospitals. The reason for this legislation was the unsatisfactory
fluid milk situation in relation to the market.
At that time the farmer was receiving about
36 cents of the consumer dollar. In three
years of operation the situation had so improved that the farmer's share of the consumer dollar had risen to about 68 per cent
of the consumer dollar without an increase
to the consumer of so much as a cent or a
fraction of a cent. I think this sufficiently
indicates the satisfactory way in which the
act was administered and the effect of it.
Admittedly its operation was mandatory;
there was no option as regards people who
were and were not under its operation, although there was this element of choice in so
far as the producers were concerned, that it
was for them to apply to the department for
permission to set up a zone or area which
would come under the jurisdiction of the
commission. The system has been carried on
satisfactorily until the present time.
It was in 1934, also, that the first dominion
marketing act was passed. It included within
its scope not only the marketing of agricultural
products, but the produce of forest, land and
sea; and I believe certain items were specifically included afterwards.
I think most honourable senators will recall
that there was a feeling in the minds of a
good many people in Canada that this legislation was unconstitutional, in that it was to
apply to and control the marketing of products produced and consumed within a province. However, a few boards were set up
under the act. One which was set up in my
province was the Grand Manan Herring
Board. It functioned particularly well up
until 1937. It may be recalled that in the
previous year the Supreme Court of Canada
declared the act ultra vires, and in 1937 their
decision was upheld by the Privy Council.
As the New Brunswick board which I have
mentioned was operating under dominion
legislation-I recall this very definitely, because I happened to be provincial Minister
of Agriculture at the time-a delegation came
before me during the legislative session of
1937 to ask for the passing of a provincial
measure under which the board could function. Accordingly, and very hurriedly, our

Legislature passed that year what was, I
believe, the third provincial marketing act
in Canada. If my memory serves me correctly, British Columbia was the first province to pass such legislation, followed by
Ontario and then New Brunswick. While I
must admit that the operation of this particular board in New Brunswick was not
constitutional, inasmuch as their product was
going into the export market, nevertheless
no objection was made to it and they continued to function under the act until 1949.
Although the British Columbia Marketing
Act of 1934 was declared satisfactory and
constitutional for marketing within that
province, it was determined that the province
did not have authority to market interprovincially or to export. By reason of that fact,
in 1938 the province asked for federal
marketing legislation that would permit the
federal Government to transfer its authority
in this field to the provincial boards. Such
legislation was considered but was not introduced. In 1939 representations were again
made to the federal Government for the
introduction of a bill transferring this authority, but owing to the outbreak of war and
the setting up of controls under the War
Measures Act the federal Government asked
the provinces and the provincial boards to
reconsider their request and for the time
being to leave this whole field of marketing
to the federal Government, under the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.
Everything done under the Dairy Products
Act, which is purely a provincial act, was
constitutional in that the products originated
and were sold entirely in the province of
New Brunswick, but by reason of controls
and so on we were asked to discontinue the
operation of our commission for the duration of the war. We agreed to this request
and the federal Government, through the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, took control of prices and marketing to a great
extent. There was therefore no particular
need of any federal marketing legislation
until after the war.
In 1949 after the wartime prices and controls were released, legislation known as
Bill 82 was introduced in the House of Commons. That was passed, and many of the
provincial boards have been functioning
under that legislation, some of them illegally.
I know this is true with respect to New
Brunswick, and I would like to give an illustration of two boards functioning - under
provincial legislation with authority under
the federal act in relation to export and
interprovincial trade. The first was established in 1939 and was known as the Cheese
Board. This board was set up because under
the marketing system in existence at that

SENATE
time we could not receive a fair price within
1½ to 3 cents a pound below Montreal prices.
The cheese was sold on an auction basis, and
the buyers realized of course that it would
cost us a considerable amount to sell it outside our province. After the board came into
operation we were able to pay our producers
a price equal to the Montreal price, and on
most occasions a fraction above. This was
achieved without costing the cheese consumer in New Brunswick or anyone else in
the Martimes an additional cent.
Perhaps I should have pointed out before
that the provincial marketing acts are not
mandatory. The state does not carry out
the operation of marketing in a compulsory
manner. The legislation, which is merely
permissive, enables groups of producers of
any one commodity to get together and agree
by vote on a percentage basis whether or not
they want to establish a marketing plan. In
most cases this requires at least a two-thirds
majority of the people engaged in the production of a specific commodity. In other
cases it requires 80 per cent of the producers, who must apply to the department
administering the act for the authority to
set up a board under which they can operate.
Honourable senators, at this time I should
like to pay tribute to the farm organizations
for the tremendous job they have undertaken
and accomplished. I should like to refer
particularly to the Canadian Federation of
Agriculture, and to the provincial federations
of agriculture and local organizations. They
have had to do a tremendous selling job
among the producers. After the Cheese Board
had been established we recognized that there
was a problem in relation to the marketing
of hogs. On the livestock markets in New
Brunswick-the packing houses and the processing plants-we could not receive a higher
price than from 2 to 5 cents a pound below
the Montreal price. We were never able to
get above it. There again the farmers recognized that something ought to be done in
relation to the orderly marketing of this product. As a result, an educational program
was put into effect by the farming organizations of New Brunswick. They went into
all areas in the province to tell their story
and ask the farmers to vote on the question
of coming under a provincial marketing plan
with respect to all live hogs sold. A vote
was taken, and 98.3 per cent of the farmers
voted in favour of such a plan. The board
was established, and the farmers today are
receiving almost the same price as farmers
of Quebec and Ontario are receiving on the
Montreal and Toronto markets.
I should like again to point out that, while
these boards function under provincial legislation supplemented by federal authority,

never for one moment have the farmers or
producers felt they have been compelled to
operate in this way. Once a board has been
established the farmers regard it as an entirely co-operative enterprise.
Because of
that fact I think a great deal of credit is
due to the farmers and the farm organizations.
It is not any easy task to sell individual
farmers on the idea of letting an organization
market their product, for the farmers have
always been in the habit of marketing their
own products. One reason for this is that
the farmer, by the very nature of his occupation, is more or less independent in his thinking. He is a sort of individualist. By reason
of the fact that no two farmers have exactly
the same problems, farmers have become individualistic.
However, over a period of
years they have come to realize that in their
field of operations the fundamental problem
facing the farm producer is that of the grading, packaging and marketing of their
products.
As a result of difficulties that different
boards encountered, particularly the Ontario
board, in relation to interprovincial marketing of products, they assess on the producer
a certain tax or levy. Of course, the producers register each year, and as the product
is marketed a commission or a levy is charged
to cover the board's operations and so on.
During the past year, I believe, it was decided by the courts in Ontario that inasmuch
as this levy is an indirect tax the provincial
act has no authority or jurisdiction in that
field, and therefore the provincial authorities
have asked the federal Government to introduce in Parliament a bill to amend the act
of 1949, which is Chapter 6 of the Revised
Statutes of 1952, to provide for those things
that are lacking in their present act.
I now come to the bill itself. Section 1
strikes out of the preamble the words "outside the province". It adds to the preamble
the following words:
and whereas it is desirable to facilitate such
marketing by authorizing the imposition of levies
or charges for the equalization or adjustment
among producers of the moneys realized from the
marketing of the products: . . .

This will give each provincial board authority to levy on the product which it is handling.
From section 2 also the words "outside the
province" have been struck out. There has
been added to that section the authority that
may be granted by the Governor in Council.
It reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may by order grant
authority to any board or agency authorized under
the law of any province to exercise powers of
regulation in relation to the marketing of any
agricultural product locally within the province,
to regulate the marketing of such agricultural
product in interprovincial and export trade . . .

APRIL
I do not think I need to go into that further,
for I hope I have explained it sufficiently.
Coming now to section 3, there is an amendment to section 4 of the old act; that is the
section that has caused some confusion and
concern, inasmuch as it adds an additional
subsection in these words:
In any prosecution for an offence under this
Act, the act or omission complained of, in respect
of which the prosecution was instituted, shall,
unless the accused proves the contrary, be deemed
to relate to the marketing of an agricultural
product in interprovincial and export trade.

That has been studied by a great many legal
authorities in Canada-for instance, the legal
authority of the Canadian Federation of
Agriculture, the legal authorities of all provincial boards and, I believe, most of the
provincial Attorneys General. An opinion has
been given by the Attorney General of Ontario to the effect that that is the only workable manner in which the section could be
worded.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I interrupt the
honourable senator? I think I am right in
saying that section 3 was amended late last
night in the House of Commons, on motion
by the minister, and I do not think it reads
now exactly as the honourable senator
read it.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): Honourable
senators, I am sorry I have not the amendments here, but I think I can state them to
you, briefly.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I suggest to the
honourable senator that we might rise now
until 3 o'clock this afternoon?
The Senate adjourned until 3 p.m.

At 3 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
SENATE CHAMBER
PRESENCE 0F STRANGERS DURING
LUNCHEON RECESS

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before we commence our proceedings
this afternoon I should like to report to
the house that it was brought to my attention
a few minutes ago that during the luncheon
recess, and while the Mace was on the Table,
a number of persons came into the Senate
lobby, passed the bar at the south entrance
to the chamber and came on to the floor of
this house. That, of course, should not have
been allowed.
Directions should be given to the officers
of this house that when the house is in
session, and even while it is in recess, no one
except senators and officials should be allowed

to come on to the floor of the chamber. I
believe we should go further and direct that
even at other times no one apart from
senators and officials should be allowed on the
floor of the chamber, without the permission
of His Honour the Speaker or the Clerk of
the Senate.
This chamber is not open to the publie
to come in at any time and sit in our seats.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I wondered where the
cigarette butt on my desk came from.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have been told
that some persons were smoking. That, of
course, should not be allowed in the chamber
at any time.
I felt, honourable senators, that this matter
should be brought to the attention of the
house.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Should
any other action than that suggested by the
honourable leader be taken?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have taken the
action of reporting it to the house, and of
suggesting that, in future no one who is not
a member of the chamber or an official should
be allowed to come on to the floor without
the permission of His Honour the Speaker or
the Clerk of the House, particularly when
the Mace is on the Table.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I will take steps to ensure that the appropriate
officials are advised accordingly.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
MARKETING BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland) for the
second reading of Bill 403, an Act to amend
the Agricultural Products Marketing Act.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): Honourable
senators, before the recess I was endeavouring to explain section 3 of the bill. The
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) asked a question in connection
with an amendment to that section. I now
have a copy of the bill as amended in the
other house, and I believe honourable senators
have copies.
Section 3 has to do with an amendment
to section 4 of the present act, which is
chapter 6 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1952. By the amendment the present section
4 now becomes subsection 1 of section 4,
with the exception of three words "Outside
the province", which are struck out. Subsection 2 of section 3 of the bill now becomes
subsection 2 of section 4. It reads as follows:
In any prosecution for an offence under this Act,
the act or omission complained of, in respect of

SENATE
which the prosecution was instituted, shall, unless
the accused proves the contrary, be deemed to
relate to the marketing of an agricultural product
in interprovincial and export trade.

I am explaining this bill from the layman's point of view, and I accept the decisions and recommendations that have been
given by the various legal authorities in
Canada. I understand that the legal representatives of all the provincial boards, and,
I believe, most of the provincial Attorneys
General, have approved of the wording of
Certainly the
section.
this particular
Attorney General for Ontario has approved
it, as has the Minister of Justice for Canada.
The reason for this subsection, as I understand it, is this: in the province of Ontario,
for instance, there are at the present time
17 boards marketing products under provincial legislation, and handling about 30
commodities, such as small fruits and vegetables, peas, corn, tomatoes and the like.
When a board sells a product to a processor
it has no way of knowing where that
product is sold or consumed. Only the
processors and certain transportation organizations know where products, after they are
processed, are sold and consumed within
Canada. This section is required in order
to clarify the situation and to legalize what
is being done, and to make the various boards
operative to the greatest possible degree.
Honourable senators, I do not think I need
say anything further about this proposed
legislation, except to repeat what I said
earlier, that in the field of agriculture, great
strides have been made over the past decade
in the matter of production. This is due
largely to mechanization, new and modern
techniques, and the know-how by the
producers themselves. This
agricultural
progress is evidenced by the fact that between
the years 1946 and 1955 Canadian farmers
produced 30 per cent more than they had
prior to that time, with 30 per cent fewer
That

people
indicates the reasonably good job that has
been done in production.
With respect to grading, packaging and
marketing, the farmers themselves realize
the burden of the undertaking, but they
want to do the job themselves. They do not
want to ask Governments to do it for them;
they ask their Government to give them the
machinery whereby they can do the job
themselves. So at this time I want to pay
tribute again not only to the farm organizations, and to the members of the various
boards, but to the individual farmer who
has made possible the setting up of organizations for proper packaging and grading, so
that there will be an orderly marketing
program.

I approve of this bill in its entirety, and
I trust that honourable senators will vote
unanimously for its adoption.
Before resuming my seat I should like to
take this opportunity of making a personal
reference. I trust honourable senators will
forgive me for doing so. Prior to October 8,
1952 it was claimed that I had the distinction
of holding a portfolio in agriculture for more
consecutive years than any other person in
the British Empire. I have been told that is
true, and I believe it is true.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
(Wesmorland): On
Hon. Mr. Taylor
October 8, 1952, the day I resigned from the
provincial cabinet along with my colleagues,
that mantle of distinction as to length of
tenure of a portfolio in agriculture fell upon
the shoulders of my good friend the Right
Honourable James G. Gardiner, about whom
I would like to say a few words.
I doubt if anyone in this chamber knows

Mr. Gardiner in his official capacity better
than I do. During the 17 years that I was
a minister in my own province there were
many occasions when I appeared before him
and the other members of the cabinet with
respect to matters pertaining to agriculture.
May I say that we did not always agree;
indeed, we often had a bonnie scrap. The
right honourable gentleman was always at
his best when in a fight. But I wish at this
time to express my warm regards for Mr.
Gardiner, who to me is a great agriculturist,
a great administrator and a great Canadian.
The record shows that he has been in public
life since 1914, during which time he was
out of Parliament for only five years. He
served some 12 years or more in the
Saskatchewan Government, four years as a
minister and four years as Premier. For
twenty-two consecutive years he has served
as Minister of Agriculture for Canada. That,
I believe, is not only a British Empire record
but a world record. It is a fine record in
any man's language. And while, as I say, I
have not agreed with him on a number of
occasions, I must admit that to me he bas
been and is the greatest Minister of Agriculture Canada bas ever had.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Weslmorland): He has
been foremost in recognizing farmers' problems from coast to coast. I say that for
eastern Canada as well as western Canada,
because I know something of his activities.
At times some of us thought he did not act
soon enough or quickly enough, but I think
when you go back over his record in the
application of policies and the working out of
legislation which he has introduced there

ÂPRIL 11, 1957
have been very few occasions when his decisions have been proven wrong. In that
connection I think even his strongest political
opponents have great admiration for him.
So on behalf of eastern Canadian farmers,
particularly the farmers of my province, I
want to pay a tribute to this great man. I
hope he will be spared for many years to
serve as Minister of Agriculture of Canada.

when it came to me that we must have 100
per cent co-operation of this group before
we would think of bringing a board into
existence.
It is true that the authority of any board
does not necessarily cover all the province;
it may only have authority over a commodity
produced in a certain area of the province.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): First of
all, honourable senators, I do not think
there is an exception to the rule that all
provincial marketing boards in Canada have
co-operated with each other in relation to
the orderly marketing of products of any
province. But if difficulties should arise,
there is authority under this bill for the
Governor in Council, by order, to revoke
regulations or to set up regulations.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Thank you. I would
like to mention another point that was
not clear to me. The marketing board in
each province will have authority to require
that all agricultural products marketed in
that province be channeled through its organization. The bill, however, refers also to
the interprovincial movement of agricultural
products. In the exercise of its authority how
will a provincial marketing board distinguish
between the amount of product which is
marketed for local consumption, and that
used for interprovincial movement and for
export?
I might say here that in various parts
of this country there have been rather acute
cases of overproduction; for example, of hogs
in Alberta and poultry and eggs in British
Columbia; and in each case much difficulty
has occurred occasionally in finding markets
for these products in other parts of Canada.
With the co-operative principle which underlies this bill I am in complete agreement.
As the honourable senator knows, I have
had some contact with it in connection
with agricultural affairs in this country, and
I think it is a sound principle. However,
because of climatic and other factors which
influence the production of this, that and
the other commodity, economic conditions
sometimes work hardship. For instance, the
producers of Alberta might be prevented
from shipping butter, eggs or hogs to an
eastern market; and in such cases the decision will have to be made by the Minister
of Agriculture or the Governor in Council.
That is a problem which, I believe, will
confront the Government in the administration of this act.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Weslmorland): I would
like to try to answer the honourable senator's
question in two phases. When in any province a marketing board is set up, all agricultural products do not come under its
control. Usually each commodity group sets
up its own board. In New Brunswick, aside
frorm the potato marketing board, which,
owing to various difficulties with which I
believe some honourable senators are familiar, is not functioning at the present time,
there are two operating boards for cheese
and hogs, and commodity groups which want

to avail themselves of this marketing legislation can bring themselves under it. That
is to say, a certain commodity group may be
organized within a particular area and come,
under the board; but producers outside that
district are not included.
As to the second part of the question: by
this amendment the Governor in Council has
authority to grant jurisdiction to provincial
boards in matters of export and international
trade; but, while a board, say in Alberta,
without this authority has no right to shipinto another province, if this amendment
should be adopted, and if the buyers of hogs
should try to put a squeeze on producers in
New Brunswick, the board has the right,
under this legislation, to authorize shipments to, say, Montreal or Toronto-something they could not do before.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It works both ways.
Hon. Mr. Taylor
works both ways.

(Wes±morland): Yes, it

Hon. Arthur Marcoite: Honourable senators, I came into this chamber a few
minutes ago when the honourable senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) was
referring to the gratitude felt toward the
Minister of Agriculture and the great respect
in which he is held. For a long while the
minister and I have been politically opposed,
but I stated years and years ago that I was
a great admirer of James G. Gardiner, and
I am very glad indeed to pay him the tribute
that he is, possibly, the best Minister of
Agriculture we have had.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcoite: I have not had time to
study the bill carefully, but it seems to me
that there is something wrong about it. I
know that some honourable senators will
smile when I say that I do not agree with
the principle of delegation of powers which
I find in it. It is absolutely unconstitutional.
Delegation of power frorn a province to the
federal Government is wrong. I have not
time to argue the point; I wish I had, for I
would be very glad to do so. It may be said
that it is right because it is wrong, for in
the wrong there is a right; we are to do well
with what we have. With that I agree, but
I would remind honourable senators that I
am speaking only for myself, not for those
on this side of the house. That has been my
position for the last three or four years, and
it is so now, when I am alone at the end
of the session.
Let us think for a moment of what is
involved in this proposed delegation of
powers. Honourable senators have no doubt
about it in their minds? Perhaps not, but if
I had the chance to speak at length I would

APRIL 11, 1957

.create a doubt. However, at this time I will
.only repeat that it pleased me very much to
hear what fell from the lips of my honourable friend about James G. Gardiner, for in
my opinion he is the best Minister of Agriculture the country bas had.
Hon. A, K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I should like to refer for a moment to a
remark made by my honourable friend from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte), that a wrong
is involved in a right. I have no objection
whatever to the principle of the bill, but I
find something at the end of it which I think
is wrong and to which, not only as a member
of this house, but as a lawyer, I should direct
attention. Section 4 of the act is to be
amended by adding a subsection which reads
thus:
(2) In any prosecution for an offence under this
Act, the act of omission complained of, in respect
of which the prosecution was instituted, shall,
unless the accused proves the contrary, be deemed
to relate to the marketing of an agricultural
product in interprovincial and export trade.

In other words, this subsection violates the
good old British principle that a man is
innocent unless he is proved to be guilty.
My honourable friend from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Taylor) said that this section had
been approved by various Attorneys General
and by the Minister of Justice. I do not care
how many Attorneys General or how many
Ministers of Justice approved it. I think it is
wrong. The further explanation which he
gave was that it might be difficult for one of
these provincial boards to prove in a prosecution that the defendant was doing something
which related to interprovincial and export
trade. Now, I have never before heard it set
forth as an argument in connection with a
criminal offence that it should be made easier
for the prosecution to prove the commission
of the offence just because it would be difficult to obtain a conviction otherwise. It
seems to me that if there is a prosecution
under this section it should be perhaps a little
more difficult for the prosecution to prove,
say, that a sale bas been made to another
province. I do not know why in this bill,
introduced at the last stage of the session, we
should incorporate the vicious principle that
a defendant is presumed to be guilty unless
he can prove his innocence. For the lif e of
me I cannot understand it, and I am afraid
that unless this section is stricken out I shall
have to vote against the bill on second
reading.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is this the section which
was amended by the House of Commons last
night?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No. It was the previous
one that was amended by the striking out of
a few words. My honourable friend from

Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) tells me that the
House of Commons did not discuss at all the
subsection which I have just dealt with.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wes±morland): Honourable
senators, as I have said before, I am not a
lawyer, and therefore I am not competent to
discuss this legislation from a legal point of
view. I would point out that it would be very
difficult for an informant to prove a violation
of a regulation, and in many cases it would be
impossibleHon. Mr. Hugessen:

Why?

Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westimorland): Because he
would have no knowledge of where the product goes. Only the processor or the man who
purchases it and transports it can prove where
it goes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Then the only thing
to do is summon the processor as a witness
and ask him.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): As I say,
I cannot argue this from the standpoint of
law, but I do know that quite a number of
bills with provisions similar to this have been
passed. We all recognize the force of the
suggestion made by the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) and I
know that many people do not feel they
want to break away from the old British
tradition of justice. I appreciate that sentiment, but I am considering this in the terms
of the workability of the boards functioning
under this act.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
am neither an agriculturist nor a lawyer, but
I rise to ask a question and get some enlightenment as to whether this bill means
what I think it may mean. I quite agree
with the argument presented by our colleague from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
but I would like to point out that two or
three years ago, on the very last day of the
session, there was introduced in this chamber,
a bill affecting the Department of Agriculture, making it possible for the minister
to prohibit the carrying of a product from
one province into another. That bill went
through over the protest of a number of us
here. At the next session I introduced a bill
to repeal that particular provision, and the
Government consented and the provision was
repealed. It may be that I am entertaining
fears unnecessarily, but would the measure
now before us interfere in any way with
the right of any producer in any one province
to ship his goods into another province?
If it would, I am opposed to it.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): As I understand it, this bill would permit the authorities
within a province to sell to other provinces
without violating the provisions of local
boards.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But under this bill would
the federal Government have the right to
say that a producer in any one province may
be prohibited from exporting his goods to
any other province?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): It is just
the opposite.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am glad to know that.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Taylor, seconded by Hon. Mr. Davies, for
the second reading of Bill 403, an Act to
amend the Agricultural Products Marketing
Act. Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time, on division.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Weslmorland): Honourable senators, on the grounds of urgency, and
with the unanimous consent of the house, I
would move that the bill be now read a
third time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed, on division.
UNITED KINGDOM FINANCIAL
AGREEMENT BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 238, an Act to amend the
United Kingdom Financial Agreement Act,
1946.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read a second time?
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, I move the second reading now.
This is a bill to ratify a new agreement
between the United Kingdom and Canada,
the signing of which was announced in the
House of Commons by the Minister of
Finance on Wednesday, March 6, 1957.
The new agreement takes the place of the
financial agreement signed between
the
United Kingdom and Canada on March 6,

1946, which called for the waiving of interest instalments only on the part of Canada
under certain conditions relating to the state
of international exchange and the level of
the United Kingdom gold and exchange reserves. Another agreement signed that year
between the United Kingdom and the United
States called for the waiving of interest instalments only on the part of the United
States under similar conditions.
The new
agreement is not for any waiver of interest
but for deferment of both the interest and
the principal
instalments under certain
conditions.
When I was asked by the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to introduce this
bill I thought to myself how true is the saying that chickens come home to roost. In
1946, after Parliament had agreed to lend
the United Kingdom Canada's share of the
full loan of $5 billion-Canada lent $11 billion, and the United States $34 billion-I was
in London attending the meeting of the
The
Commonwealth Press Union Council.
next meeting, in 1950, was held in Ottawa,
and I have no doubt that a number of senators were at the garden party given by the
High Commissioner of the United Kingdom on
that occasion. While I was in London a dinner was given at Claridge's by the late Lord
Astor, the husband of Lady Nancy Astor.
Lord Astor was the publisher of the Sunday
Observer, a very prominent newspaper. All
the Astors are in the newspaper publishing
business; I know them well.
The Astor
family bas a definite relationship with
Canada. John Astor, publisher of the Times,

Canada.
arises from the fact that Lady Violet Elliott
married first into the Lansdowne family, and
today her eldest son is the Marquis of Lansdowne, a descendant of another former
Governor General. I mention that in passing.
To continue my story: At the dinner many
prominent financial people were present.
I was invited as a Canadian senator. Those
present were discussing the prospect of getting this loan passed, for it had not yet passed
the United States Congress, although it had
been approved by the Executive and signed.
Among the guests was the very distinguished
financial authority Lord Balfour of Burleigh.
They put me on the spot as
to what the attitude of Canada would be if,
for instance, Britain was unable to pay the
interest on the loan. I replied, "Well, of
course I cannot speak officially, but in view
of the fact that the British people stood up
to the Hitler crowd for two years, almost
alone, I do not think Canada would be
ungenerous if Britain were not in a position

APRIL 11, 1957

to meet her payments." However, the difficulty was that one of the newspaper lords
over there who owned a paper with a very
wide circulation was constantly arguing in
big type on the front page that Britain did
not need the loan. I said to Lord Balfour:
"Why are we meeting and discussing this
matter, when a very prominent newspaper,
owned by a rich baron, says Britain does
not need the loan?" I shall always remember
his reply: "That is nonsense. I will put it
this way: If we do not get the loan we shall
not for many years have butter on our bread,
or sugar in our tea." When I said that I did
not believe Canada would be ungenerous, I
little thought that some day I would be introducing this bill.
So I have stated, the 1946 agreement
between the two countries was for a loan
of $5 billion, the United States' contribution
to be $31 billion, and Canada's contribution
$11 billion. Interest and principal payments
were to be made annually by the United
Kingdom. Honourable senators will recall
that late last year, owing to difficulties in
which the United Kingdom found herself,
she asked to be allowed to take advantage of
the waiver clause in the 1946 agreement.
The new agreement, which has already been
signed by the two countries, will defer the
interest payment of $22 million, which was
due to Canada in 1956, but honourable
senators will be glad to know that the instalment of principal due in 1956, amounting to
$15 million, bas been paid. In future we
possibly shall be asked to defer both the
interest and principal payments on specific
occasions.
Article I (i) of the schedule to the bill
provides:
No more than seven such annual instalments
may be so deferred. The first of any such deferred
instalments shall be paid on December 31, 2001,
and the others shall be paid annually thereafter,
in order.

Paragraph (iii) reads as follows:
Deferred instalments shall bear interest at the
rate of two per cent per annum payable annually
on December 31 of each year following that in
which deferment occurs.

This loan agreement of 1946 was known
as a "package deal"; that is, it was contingent on Canada and the United States
agreeing to the terms of the loan. That
agreement contained three provisions. The
first related to the general balance of payments; the second related to the level of
United Kingdom exports; and the third provided that any waiver of payments had to be
agreed to by both Canada and the United
States. A fourth provision, in the United
States agreement only, was very complicated,
but it could not affect Canada unless the
United States refused to waive a payment.

It might interest honourable senators to
know that the provisions of this Bill 238 bas
already been passed by the United States
Senate, and by the House of Representatives,
I think, as recently as yesterday. So the
agreement now awaits only our consent. The
changes proposed in this bill are exactly the
same as the changes in the United States bill.
In view of the fact that the recent British
budget estimates expenditures of $12 billion
in the coming year for a population of 52
million, while our own budget estimates
expenditures of over $5 billion for a population of only 16 million, some people may
think that the United Kingdom does not need
any financial concession by Canada at this
time. Nevertheless, we can be sure that
Britain is going through a very difficult
period. Wages are fairly low. I happen to
know that the superintendent of a big transport corporation, which operates 35 large
lorries, is paid 10 pounds a week, or about
$28 in Canadian currency. The rate of pay
for a comparable position in Canada is $75.
Taxes in the Old Country are very high.
As you know, almost every wage earner bas
to pay income tax. For instance a person
getting as little as $21 or $22 a week pays
a tax. Furthermore, all wage earners are
subject to payroll deductions for social
security purposes. A man making 7 or 8
pounds a week is subject to a deduction of 5
his
shillings for social security, and
employer has to better that by one shilling.
So the Government collects through that one
worker 11 shillings per week.
However British people are happy and
contented, and doing the best they can under
difficult conditions. They have not the money
that we in Canada have to spend on luxuries;
they must economize in various ways.
Honourable senators, I have no hesitation
in recommending that the Senate pass this
bill and ratify the agreement which has
already been signed. I believe that by doing
so we shall be making a fine gesture toward
Great Britain and be doing ourselves a good
turn as well.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend what

Hon. Mr. Davies: The payment of any deferred instalments will not start until the

CANADA-NETHERLANDS INCOME TAX
AGREEMENT BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 413, an Act to implement
an agreement between Canada and the
Netherlands for the avoidance of double
taxation with respect to income tax.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I move the second reading now.
The purpose of this bill is to give legal
effect in Canada to an agreement between
the Government of Canada and the Government of the Netherlands for the avoidance of
double taxation and the establishment of
rules for reciprocal fiscal arrangements in
the matter of income tax. The agreement was
signed at Ottawa on the 2nd of April, 1957.
Honourable senators are familiar with bills
of this type.

The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte), who has been a member of
this house over a long period, will recall that
we have passed bills to give legal effect to
agreements for the avoidance of double taxation regarding income tax with the following countries: In 1943, with the United States;
in 1946, with the United Kingdom; in 1948,
with New Zealand; in 1951, with Sweden and
France; in 1955, with Ireland; in 1956, with
Denmark and West Germany.
A bill passed by the House of Commons
approving a similar agreement entered into
between Canada and the Union of South
Africa will be coming over to us this afternoon, so the remarks I make now can be
applied, generally speaking, to that bill also.
The agreement is designed to avoid double
taxation, and it provides for exchange of
information. By means of the exchange of
reciprocal tax credits the country of residence
gives credit for the tax in the country in
which the actual tax had its source.
Also, under this agreement, as under the
others which have been entered into by the
Government and approved by this house on
previous occasions, taxation by a state on
trade profits of an enterprise in the other
state is limited to those profits attributable
to the permanent establishment of such enterprise in the first-mentioned state. In addition, certain specifie provisions are made
regarding the profits from the operation of
ships and aircraft, and the exemption from
taxation on the exchange of teachers and
students.
The taxes to which the agreement refers
will be found in Article I of the agreement
or convention, which is a schedule to the
bill. In Canada these are income taxes, including surtaxes, imposed by the federal
Government. Naturally an agreement between the federal Government of Canada
and the Government of a foreign country can
have no effect on provincial income tax laws
of this dominion nor on provincial or state
laws of the other country. In the Netherlands the taxes subject to this convention
are income tax, wages tax, company tax,
dividends tax, and the tax on fees of directors.
In this agreement provision is made for
taxation upon companies doing business in
both countries.
As regards individuals, the agreement deals
with the limits upon the withholding tax on
dividends paid by a company in one country
to residents in another country. It follows
the existing practice under similar agreements between Canada and other countries:
if a Canadian company pays dividends to
residents of the Netherlands, the withholding
tax which Canada can exact from the dividends is limited to 15 per cent, and vice versa.

schedule to the bill, gives a good idea of the
way in which corporation tax is to be applied
to an asset in the two states, Canada and
the Netherlands. This article refers particularly to immovable property, or real estate.
It says, in effect, that the income received
from real estate is normally taxable in the
country in which the real estate is located.
When a company has an established operation in one of these countries, the normal
thing would be for the company to pay tax
on the income attributable to that establishment in that country. In other words, if a
Canadian company has an establishment here
and is doing business here it will be paying
its tax on its Canadian income. If it has,
let us say, a subsidiary in the Netherlands,
then the income attributable to the work of
that subsidiary in the Netherlands would be
taxed in the Netherlands, that being the place
where it is located.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Under this agreement, there is no limit to the amount he can
receive in the Netherlands, but the Netherlands can withhold only 15 per cent of that

income.
Honourable senators, there are the other
usual provisions, including one whereby a
resident of Canada who receives an annuity
or a pension from a source in the Netherlands is not subject to a tax on that annuity
or pension in the Netherlands. There is a
reciprocal arrangement so far as Canada is
concerned.
Honourable senators will realize that this
is relieving legislation. It relieves Canadians
from double taxation on income derived from
the Netherlands, and likewise it relieves
people in the Netherlands from double taxation on income derived from Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does this convention
have any corporate application? I mean, is
there any reciprocal arrangement between
the two countries relating to taxation of
corporation income?

Perhaps where the convention really helps

APRIL 12, 1957
Let me take another example. A group of
Canadians own a company that does business
in the Netherlands. That company, because
it has a principal establishment operating in
the Netherlands, will not only be subject to
corporation tax in that country, but when
the company accumulates money from profits
and decides to pay dividends to its several
Canadian shareholders, those dividends, when
paid to the Canadian shareholders, will be
subject to the 15 per cent withholding tax.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I reply to the
question asked by the honourable senior
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)?
I think Article IV has a direct bearing on
the question. The first part of that article
reads:

merchandise within that other state by the

Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the junior
senator from Ottawa a question? He took
as an example a Canadian corporation doing
business in the Netherlands. Would a company in Canada which owned a subsidiary
in the Netherlands be in the same position?

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, the same thing has happened to me today as happened on the

Hon. Arthur Marcoite: Honourable senators,
I do not know anything about this bill: had
it not been for the kindness of a colleague I
might not have had a copy, and I have not
had time to read it. Therefore I depend on
the good faith of the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), who
has told us that this is good legislation. I cannot say any more. My associates have left,
and I did not receive notice that I would be
the lone representative of the Opposition. So,
as I have said, I am relying on the assurance
of the Leader of the Government that this
is good legislation. I shall support it.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I thank the Acting
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Marcotte)
for the confidence he has expressed in me.
Speaking only for myself and for the Government, I will say we think that the bill is a
good one. I suppose that my honourable friend
also believes that it is sound legislation,
because, if my memory serves me correctly,
he supported similar bills previously when
agreements which have been entered into
with other countries were before us for
approval.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: I move the second reading now.
Honourable senators, this bill, an Act to
implement an agreement between Canada and
the Union of South Africa for the avoidance
of double taxation with respect to income tax,
is similar to the bill which has just been
passed by this house in respect to an agreement with the Netherlands.
The contents of this agreement are practically the same as those of the agreement
with the Netherlands, except that there is no
reference in this agreement to a 15 per cent
withholding tax. Our Income Tax Act provides for a 15 per cent withholding tax on
dividends payable to persons living outside
this country, but there is no withholding tax
provided for in Union of South Africa legislation. It was impossible to work out a satisfactory mutual agreement with the Union of
South Africa in this respect, but I would
point out that we are in no worse position
than before. As a matter of fact, we are still
in an advantageous position in that at the
present time there is no withholding tax in the
Union of South Africa.
Honourable senators, I think I can safely
say that in every other respect this bill is
practically the same as that just passed by
the house.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

amount of $9,635,679.50. Honourable senators recall that on April 1 this year we passed
an interim supply bill providing one-twelfth
of the total amount of the supplementary
estimates, so with the passage of this bill we
shall have ¡provided supply to the extent of
seven-twelfths of the supplementary estimates. That will take us up till the end of
October.
There is also an amount to cover additional
proportions of four special items in the supplementary estimates to provide for services
of a seasonal nature. The reason for this is,
as I said in connection with the main estimates, that certain departments have heavier
expenditures during the summer than later
on in the year. This amount is $224,500.0l.
Provision is also made in this bill for
various proportions of the items to be voted
in the further supplementary estimates to
provide for payments which are expected to
fall due during the first seven months of the
year, that is, two-sevenths for family allowances which become effective September 1;
four-ninths for pensions and related items,
namely veterans' pensions, war veterans'
allowances, etc., and two-thirds for payments
under the Maritime Freight Rates Act. The
amount for these items in the bill is
The total of the various
$38,555,555.56.
amounts I have mentioned is $1,714,109,433.08.
In addition, the bill would authorize the
Governor in Council to borrow during
1957-58 a sum not in excess of $1 billion, by
the issue and sale of securities, such as
treasury bills, Canada Savings Bonds and
other bonds. Authority to raise money by
such means is given in supply bills every year.
From 1952-53 through 1954-55 authority to
borrow up to $500 million was granted annually. In 1955-56 the limit was raised to $1
billion, and in 1956-57 it was raised to $1.5
billion. The increase over the past few years
results mainly from increased sales of
Canada Savings Bonds. The amount of $1
billion requested in this bill is required to
meet the issue of Canada Savings Bonds prior
to October 1, 1957, and other normal operations. Honourable senators may be interested
to know that the Canada Savings Bonds
issued in 1956 totalled approximately $800
million.
The amount being voted by this bill-the
general proportion of one-half of all items
plus the additional proportions for certain
special items-is intended to provide all
necessary requirements of the public service
during the period from the end of this month
to the end of October, that is, from May to
October inclusive. April requirements, as I
have already mentioned, were provided for

in the bill which was assented to on April 1.
In no instance is the total amount of any
item being released.
I can assure honourable senators that the
form of the bill is the same as that of similar
bills passed in previous years. The passing
of this bill will not prejudice the rights and
privileges of members to criticize any item
in the estimates when they come up for consideration in this house. The usual undertaking is hereby given that such rights and
privileges will be respected and will not be
curtailed or restricted in any way as a result
of the passing of this bill.

Honourable senators, the estimates of the

difference between the amounts set out in the
main and supplementary estimates and the
amounts already provided for those items in
the interim supply bills passed to date, that
difference being $63,057,096.18. For no other
item is full supply being requested. Therefore, in reply to a question asked by the
honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth
(Hon. Mr. Isnor), may I say that the passage
of this bill will provide the Post Office
Department with sufficient moneys, according
to the estimates filed, to carry on its work to
the end of the present fiscal year.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I should like to ask the
Leader of the Government in the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) whether these estimates for the Post Office Department, which
we are about to pass take into consideration the restoration of two deliveries a day

will you permit me to say a few words?

SENATE
I have always been a supporter of the
honourable senator opposite (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). I have confidence in him.
My friends left me with no notes of any
kind, so I am quite free to express my own
sentiments. I appreciate the good co-operation in this bouse. As honourable senators
know, at all times I have been willing to
co-operate with them in the work of the
Senate. I respect the Senate as a body, and
I love and admire each and every one of
its members. It is always a pleasure when
my health permits me to attend its sittings.
Until I die I will always maintain a spirit of
confidence in my fellow senators, and be ready
to co-operate with them. I know that the
Senate will continue to serve the people of
Canada faithfully and well, thus fulfilling
the purpose for which it was created. Legislation will always be considered thoughtfully
in this house, in a spirit not of criticism, but
of co-operation, which is as it should be.
Honourable senators, if my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) were here he would
express my sentiments much better than I
can. However, it is my privilege to say how
much I appreciate my associations in the
Senate, and I repeat once more my sincere
wish to co-operate in the furtherance of the
work of this house.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, if I am not able to express my sentiments as clearly as I should, I trust
honourable senators will appreciate the sincerity with which I speak.
I have been greatly honoured by an
appointment to this august body. It was my
desire when I came here, and it always will
be, to serve the people of Canada as best
I can with what ability I may have. I
must admit that I received my summons to
the Senate with a certain amount of fear
and trembling, for while I had some experience in legislative matters I knew very
little about this chamber and how its work
was conducted. Indeed, I knew very few
honourable members of this house.
On the day I arrived at the Parliament
Buildings I went to the office of the Clerk
of the Senate, and immediately I met Mr.
MacNeill I realized that we were old friends.
He and I had lived in the same area for a
period of about 15 years. I trust he will
forgive me for the reference I am about to
make to his family. I knew Mr. MacNeill
well, but I knew his father, the Reverend
Dr. N. A. MacNeill, perhaps better. He was
pastor of my church for 15 years and had
extended to me the right hand of fellowship
there. He was one of the ablest speakers
I have ever listened to; and he loved to sing
and was a very accomplished singer.

So, as I say, when I came to Ottawa I
found in Mr. MacNeill an old friend. I
should like to express to him my sincere
thanks for making me feel at once that I
was among friends. And I am grateful to
him and all the officers of this house for the
co-operation and assistance they have shown
me.
I believe that a friend is the greatest asset
a human being can have, and that for every
friend I make my life becomes that much
richer and fuller. I should like all honourable senators to know that in me they have
gained a friend, and I feel I have gained
many friends among them. No doubt during
my first session as a senator I have made
many mistakes. I hope honourable senators
will attribute my mistakes to my zeal and
desire to serve the Canadian people, and forgive me for them.
May I express appreciation especially to my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for
his thoughtfulness and friendship. He was
the second man I met when I came here,
and he also immediately made me feel at
home and with friends. On the day that I was
sworn in His Honour the Speaker of this
house, in a few words and a kindly smile,
gave me further assurance that I was among
friends. Now I want you all to know that
I appreciate more deeply than I can express
in words the friendship, the co-operation and
the tolerance that all members have shown
toward me during this session. May I join
with the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), the Deputy Leader (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt), 'and the Acting Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Marcotte), in expressing
to Your Honour and all honourable senators
my best wishes and the hope that next session
we shall all be back together working in the
interest of the finest people on earth, the
Canadian people.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I would suggest that we adjourn now until
the call of the bell, at approximately ten
minutes to nine.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

PROROGATION
SPEECH

FROM

THE THRONE

The Honourable the Deputy of the
Governor General was pleased to close the
Fifth Session of the Twenty-second Parliament with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The unstable situation in the Middle East
has continued to give concern to Canadians
throughout the session which I now bring
to a close.
My Government has sought both inside
and outside the United Nations to play a
constructive part with a view to reducing the
risk of renewed hostilities between Israel

APRIL 12, 1957
and Egypt; to facilitating the early clearance and reopening of the Suez Canal, which
is so important to the waterborne commerce
of our friends in Europe and Asia; and,
through Canada's participation in the United
Nations Emergency Force, to establishing conditions conducive to a long-term solution of
the political problems of that area.
In March, discussions were held between
my Prime Minister and the Prime Minister
of the United Kingdom at Bermuda which
dealt with a wide range of matters of international concern and in particular with questions of primary interest to Canada and the
United Kingdom. The possibility of a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers early
this summer was also discussed.
The emergence of the former colony of the
Gold Coast into full Commonwealth membership as the independent state of Ghana was
welcomed by all Canadians as a further confirmation of the value and the adaptability of
our free association of sovereign states linked
by common interests and common loyalties.
One of my ministers represented Canada at
the inaugural ceremonies.
During the present session useful discussions were also held with the Prime Minister
of France, who addressed a special joint
meeting of both Houses of Parliament.
The brutal suppression of the Hungarian
people by the armed forces of the Soviet
Union served to emphasize the continued need
for the greatest possible degree of unanimity
of purpose among the nations of the free
world and the importance of maintaining an
adequate system of collective defence.
My ministers continue to believe that our
position in the Commonwealth and firm support of the United Nations and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization are essential
contributions to the advancement of our aim
of preserving peace and promoting prosperity
throughout the world.
In the course of the present session you
have approved important items of legislation
of lasting benefit to the Canadian people.
You have authorized the Government to
enter into agreements with the provinces for
the establishment of a nation-wide system
of insurance programs for hospital care and
diagnostic services. This legislation constitutes
an important step forward in helping to improve the standard of health for the Canadian
population and in relieving individual citizens
from the worrisome burdens of large hospital
bills.
You have approved legislation for the
establishment of a Canada Council for the
Encouragement of the Arts, Humanities and
Social Sciences. Undoubtedly, both the fund
for scholarships and grants and the fund

for assistance to universities for capital expansion projects will accelerate the cultural
and intellectual growth of the nation.
To the same end the annual federal grants
for universities have been doubled.
Provision has been made to assist the transportation to Canada of Hungarian refugees.
Special arrangements have also been made for
the movement of large numbers of British,
French and other immigrants to this country.
Canada's development is proceeding at such
a pace that it continues to place a strain on
our human, material and financial resources.
In order to hold infiationary tendencies in
check, my ministers have urged that governments and private enterprise exercise restraint in their expansion projects.
A special committee of the Senate has begun
a comprehensive investigation of the use of
our land resources to contribute more effectively to the improvement of agricultural
production and the incomes of those engaged
in it.
The Report of the Royal Commission on
Economic Prospects has been laid before you.
In accordance with its ýrecommendation that
special consideration be given to assisting the
economies of the Atlantic Provinces, the
Government has announced its intention of
undertaking a detailed examination of transportation conditions in that area. In the
meantime, increases in the payments under
the Maritimes Freight Rates Act have been
authorized. An offer has been made to construct interconnection facilities between the
electricity systems of the provinces of Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick and to build and
operate large thermo-electric plants in the
Atlantic area to meet at the lowest possible
cost the power requirements of growth and
industrial development in that region. The
recent adjustment in the tariff on potatoes
should also have a favourable influence on
its economy and on the economy of other
farming areas.
A Royal Commission has been established
to review the financial position of the province
of Newfoundland in accordance with the
Teris of Union of that province with Canada.
The Report of the Royal Commission on Radio and Television Broadcasting has been completed and presented for your
consideration.
In furtherance of the Government's policy
to maintain a high standard, of social welfare
in this country, increases are being made
in the scale of payments to veterans under
the Pension Act and the War Veterans AIlowance Act, as well as payments under the
Family Allowances Act, the Old Age Security Act, the Old Age Assistance Act, the
Disabled Persons Act and the Blind Persons
Act.

SENATE

You have approved a measure authorizing
the payment of the equivalent of full taxes
on federal property in all municipalities
where such property receives normal municipal services.
You have approved legislation authorizing
the continuance of the Canadian Wheat Board
as the sole marketing agency for western
You have also
wheat, oats and barley.
enacted amendments to the Agricultural
Products Marketing Act, the Prairie Grain
Producers Interim Financing Act and the
Prairie Farm Assistance Act, as well as a
measure extending the scope and provisions
of the Canadian Farm Loan Act.
Other measures enacted during this session included the Pacific Salmon Fisheries
Convention Act, the Pacific Fur Seals Convention Act, the Windsor Harbour Commissioners Act, the Fertilizers Act, and
amendments to the Export and Import Permits Act, the Territorial Lands Act, the

Canada Shipping Act, the Currency, Mint and
Exchange Fund Act, the Export Credits
Insurance Act, the Judges Act, the Exchequer
Court Act, the Quebec Savings Banks Act,
the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act,
the Eastern Rocky Mountain Forest Conservation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Act, and the Prisons and Reformatories Act.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for making provision for the
public service during the period required for
the holding of a general election and the
assembling of a new Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Let me give expression to our humble
gratitude for the great blessing which Divine Providence has bestowed upon us and
upon our beloved country. May He continue
to guide us as we work together to maintain and secure the peace, prosperity and
well-being we now enjoy.

Later this day the Twenty-Second Parliament was dissolved by Proclamation
of His Excellency the Governor General.
