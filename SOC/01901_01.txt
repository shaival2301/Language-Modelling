Ceneral to mýeet this day for the dispatch
of business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
Prayers.
OPENING 0F THE SESSION
The Bon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
froma the Governor General's Secretary informing bim that Bis Excellency the Governor
General would proceed to the Senate Chamber
to open the session of the Dominion Parliament this day at three o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock Bis Excellency the Governor
General proceeded to the Senate Chamber
and took bis seat upon the Throne.
Bis
Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the Bouse of Commons, and
that Bouse being come, with their Speaker,
Bis Excellency was pleascd to open the Sixtb
Session of the Eighteenth Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
During the months which have elapsed since
the close of the special session, my Ministers
have gîven unremitting attention to the organi.
zation and prosecution of Canada's war effort.
The Government has been in constant consultation with the Government of the United
Kingdom, and the measures adopted have been
those which it is believed will best serve the
common cause.
Vigorous action has been taken through all
branches of the armed forces to provide for the
security and defence of Canada, and for cooperation with the Allied forces on land, on sea
and in the air.
For the effective prosecution of the war,
Canada's industrial, financial and other resources
are being steadily mobilized and aIl war
activities co-ordinated.
The production and
marketing of agricultural and other primary
products ave been given constructive direction;
and safeguards have been provided against
undue enhancement, under war conditions, of

the prices of food, fuel and other necessaries
of life.
Since last you met the developments of the
war have made increasingly clear the nature of
the struggle in which we are engaged. The
very existence of nations that cherish independence andi democratic ideais is menaeed by encmy
forces of ruthless aggression which aim to

Canadian people have shown their determination
to share with Britain and France to the utmost
of their strength in the defence of freedom.
My Ministers are of the opinion that the
effective prosecution of the war makes it
imperative that those wbo are charged with the
grave responsibility of carrying on the government of Canada should, in tliis critical period,
he fortified by a direct and unquestioned mandate from the people. My advisers, accordingly,
having regard to existing conditions and the
stage of the life of the present Parliament,

His Excellency the
At three o'clock

His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House being come with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the First
Session of the Nineteenth Parliament with the
following speech:
Honourable Members of the Sonate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Yeu have been summoned to the first session
of a new Parliament at a time of the greatest
conflict in the history of mankind. Upon the
outcome of the struggle will depend the maintenance of civilized society and the inheritance
of human freedom for our own and future
generations.
Since Parliament last met, the nature of the
conflict, the character of the enemy, and the
perils which menace all free nations, have
become only too clear. In that short space of
time, the world bas seen the peaceful and
peace-loving peoples of Denmark, Norway,
Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg made the
victims of the treachery and barbarism which
have marked the successive outrages of Nazi
Germany. It bas also witnessed the invasion
of Finland, and, despite the epic resistance
of its heroic population, the partition of that
unoffending country. At any time, the lust of
conquest may vastly enlarge the theatre of
war. These tragie events have but served to
intensify our determination to share in the
war effort of the Allied powers to the utmost
of our strength. In this resolution the Government bas been fortified by the direct and
unquestioned mandate of the Canadian people.
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

The organization and prosecution of Canada's
war effort have commanded the unremitting
attention of my Ministers. The constant consultation and complete co-operation maintained
with the Governments of the United Kingdorn
and France have been materially strengthened
by the recent visit to those countries of my
Minister of National Defence.
You will be fully informed of Canada's action
both in the military and economic fields. You
will be asked to consider measures deemed
essential for the prosecution of the war, and
for the social and economic requirements of
the country.
While the present session of Parliament will
necessarily be mainly concerned with Canada's
war effort and the measures essential to the
achievement of ultimate victory, my Ministers
are of opinion that, despite what to-day is being
witnessed of concentrated warfare, it is
diesirable, as far as may he possible, to plan
for the days that wili follow the cessation of
hostilities.
As a contribution to industrial stability in
time of war, and to social security and justie
in time of peace, resolutions will be introduced
for an amendnent to the British North America
Act which would empower the Parliament of
Canada to enact at the present session legislation to establish unemployment insurance on
a national scale.
The report of the Royal Commission on
Dominion-Provincial Relations, whieh bas just
been received, will be tabled immediately.
Members of the louse of Commons:
You vill be asked to make financial provision
for expenditure necessitated by the existing
state of war.
The estimates for the current fiscal year will
be submitted to you without delay.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Since the last session of Parliament, a much
beloved Governor General bas passed fron
our midst. In the death of Lord Tweedsmuir,
Canada mourns one whose character and
achievements had endeared him to our people;
the British Commonwealth bas lest a wise and
understanding counsellor, and the fellowship of
avriters a gifted interpreter of the graces and
humanities of English literature. I join with
yen in the expression to Lady Tweedsmuir and
the members of her family of the deep sympathy
of the Canadian people.
His Majesty the King has been pleased to
appoint the Earl of Athlone as his representative in succession to the late Lord Tweedsmuir.
The sense of duty and the public services which
have distinguished the lives of the Governor
General designate and the Princess Alice ensure
for His Excellency and Her Royal Highness an
eager and cordial welcome to Canada.
As you assume, in these dark and difficult
days, the grave responsibilities with which you
have been entrusted by the Canadian people,
may your resolution be sustained by the
knowledge that it is the liberties of all free
peoples that you are helping to preserve. Unless
the evil powers, which threaten the very existence of freedom, are vanquished, the world
itself will inevitably be reduced to a state of
international anarchy.
I pray that Divine Providence may guide
and bless your deliberations.
The House of Commons withdrew.
His Excellency the Administrator was pleased

to retire.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, since our meeting in September last
we have had the misfortune to lose five of
our colleagues.
Senator John S. MeLennan was one of our
elders. He was born in 1853 and was with
us since 1916. He belonged to an influential
Montreal family. His father, Hugh MeLennan.

Montreal. The laite senator's brothers, highly
cultured, have ail been interested in Canadian
history and literature. Our departed colleague
took his degrees at McGill University and
Cambridge, winning ionours in philosophie
and moral scences. He- was a writer of note,
and owned and cdited a newspaper in Cape
Breton. Ail the social problerns of the day
retained bis attention, and lie treated tbem
in this Houise, as well as in the pr-ess, in bis
usual spirit of nînderation. He wvas always
most considerate of the feelings of others.
His gentlemanly instincts were apparent in ail
bis movements, and hie was often quite
apologetie whien his views differed frorn those
of his colleagues, w-ho gav e himn their esteemn
and friendship.
Major Genenîl the Honourable Archibald
Hayes Macdonell, C.M.G., D.S.O., was one
of the gallant and brilliant representatives
of the Canadian Armiy in this Chiamher who
higlv distinguishied theinselves during the
Great War. Senator Macdonell had a most
active career on miany a field with the British
Imperial troops. He w-as essentially a soldier.
He joined the Canadian Militia in 1886 and
the Permanent Corps in 1892. He serve d in
the Canadian Contingent in South Africa and

Senator Joseph Marcelin Wilson will be with
us no more, but lie stili follows our deliberatiýons as reports of tbem reacli him daily.
Senator Wilson lias p]ayed so important a
part in our financial and industrial institutions
in Canada and in our educational activities
that I arn sure ail my colleagues will join with
me in lioping that this springtirne may bring
him enjoyable sunny days.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honou-rable members, tlie lieavy exigencies; of this
time would indicaté that, brief references to
the d-eparted wou]d suffice, particularly aftýer
the complete, and most appropriate recital of.
their chief achievements and characteristics
by the honoýurable leader of the Huse. But
I do flot want it. to. be thought, because I arn
brief, that I or my associates on tihis side,
do not fully share in the pain of severance and
in sympathy with the famnilies of the departed.
As toi Senator McLennan, I would only
mention bis culture, bis distinctly gen.tleman]y
characteristics, bis wide reading, bis devotion
to public business to the full extent of bi&
capacity.
Senator Macdonell. a soldier almost, by
birtb, a Britisher by blood and conviction,
neyer failing in 'bis duty as a Canadian or as
a subject of this Empire, served on fi'elds of
pernt in no fewer than baîf a dozen wars
and pursued to the very end of bis life the
true, direct course of a loyal citizen.
Senator Gillis was, just as the leader of the
buse tells us, a rugged Westerner, rugged
from the days of bis young boybood in Nova
Scotia.
is personality and bis wbole outlook reflccted that sturdy pbysique wbichb li
possessed througb nearly ail bis life. bIis
service to tbe West was great indeed, and the.
love of bis friends wýas without reservation.
Senator Lynch-Staunton was one of tbe oldest of our number. one of tbose longest among
us. His great distinction was bis standing
at tbe Bar. H1e was one of its senior members
and bis authority was higbly regarded. Tbe
Irisb in him appeared in every accent and
every sentimrent. It was not surprising that ho
returned to the Emerald Isle wbenever lie
felt -the need of relaxation and desired to
taste again the lore of tbat borne of bis
ancestry. We delighted in liaving hirn arnong
us. We lamnent tbat lie too bas been called,
tbough in the fullness of years.
i was depressed indeed to bear, just as the
session opened, of the death of Senator
Bourgeois. Not baving beard of bis illness,
I was shocked by the naws. Many of us
bave been warrned and deligbted by bis kindly
manner, expressive of tbat friendliness witb
wbýich hie was andowed, and we were glad to

see birn here, accompanied always, until very
recently. by bis beautiful dauglter. It is

7"

regrettable that. be sbould bave been, called
so soon. Senator Bourgeois was a scbolar,
a man whio loved the learning of bis professioný, and who contributed to the advancement of tbat learning in bis province.
I arn at one ýalso witb tbe leader of tbe
House in my admiration of the former Senator
J. M. Wilson. and regret that bis long-continued îll-healtýh should bave convinced bim
that lie should give up bis seat in Vhis Chamber. Thougli speaking witb bim very little
in tbe sphere of public affairs, whare bis iiihealth bas long continýued, I did meet with
hirn in other ways, and I wisb to record tbat
I neyer in my life encountered a fairer or
more liberal-minded man. Senator Wilson
merited bis success-and bis succeiss was great;
be rnerited the esteern and admiration of us
all; lie mnerited tbe elociuent, words of the
leader of thbe House, and in those words, I
arn sure. alI wbo know Senator Wilson will
join.
The sincere sympathy of ail 'bonourable
members, and our sense of loss, we would
express to the survivors, the widows and
families of the deceased.
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS (Translation) :Honourable senators, three days ago I
bad the sad privilege of conveying to bis final
resting-place the regretted colleague whose loss
wve
rnourn. And to-day I cannot refrain frorn
associating myseif with the cloquent utterances which we bave just heard in praise of
1111.
Senator Cliarles Bourgeois was truly and
in every sense of the word a good citizen.
H1e wvas moreover a remarkably gifted man.
bis extrerne modesty could not conceal his
great worth.
Born sixty years ago in the ancient and
historie rity of Trois-Rivières, of a family in
wbich the purcst Canadian traditions had
been handcd down frorn generation to generation, he received an education based on tbe
sternest discipline and the noblest aspirations. It was at tbe tirne when a great and
eloquent bishop distributed to bis flock the
substantial food of an apostolic eloquence
and an inspiring doctrine. In so favourable
an
atmosphere
our
regretted
colleague
aequired the firm principles and bigli ideals

wvhicla were so greatly admired in hirn.
He embraccd the legal profession, in the
practice of which lie was very successful.
lis study of jurisprudence oftan enabled
him to throw liglt on obscure points of
law. His thinking wvas as straight as bis
judgment wvas snund. Witb him, knowledge
and conscience went band in band. Witbin a
few years lie aequired a hiel reputation at
tbe Bar, and the confidence of bis fellow-

îawyers i'trried him suceessix ely to the posts
of Bâtonnier of the Bar cf the district of

Ilis reputation and prestige naturally led
bis frieods to urge him to enter the political
arena. 11e could not refuse. Undeterred by
ain initial setback, he was soon elected mcmber for his native city in unfavourable
eireumstanees ivbich gave to bis victery the
sense cf a personal triumph due to bis
prestige and to, the support from ail quarters
wbicb bis devotion to the common good bcd

prospects, will be from a six to ten per cent
larger acreage and, if all goes well, will be of
generoos proportions.
We are clearing from Canada approximately
4,000,000 bushels a week, which would be
ample to fill all requirements of the British
Isles, even if they took all their wheat from
Canada. But we supply only a portion of
their requirements, because they necessarily
must take some grains from Australia and
other countries; so our continued clearance of
approximately 4,000,000 bushels a week will
depend upon our ability to ship to other
countries the portion of that 4,000,000 bushels
whieh does not go to Great Britain. And it
is questionable whether we shall be able to
do this if further countries are involved in
the war.
The Government are to be commended and
congratulated on handling the 1939 cip in
such a manner that the market bas not been
depressed, and embarrassing congestion bas
been avoided. The clearing of the quantity
of wheat that bas been cleared, at the prices
that have prevailed, bas been an enormous
accomplishment, and one of great benefit to
the whole Dominion.
The business of financing and storing the
coming crop will require a steady hand and a
clear brain and must be the deep concern of
the House of Commons and this honourable
body.
WVe in Canada are most fortunate in having
abundance, as against the spectre of famine
that may face our enemies and some of their
victims through disruption of transportation
and through prospective bad harvests.
Broomhall, under date of April 23, reports
that England is increasing its crop acreage by
1.900.000 acres.
The New York Times reports from Broomhall's Corn Trade News on European trade
conditions:
The shortage of labour, with wet, stormy
weather at seeding time, bas reduced the acreage.
The inadequate preparation of the soif, the severe
frost during the winter imonths and the cold

Hon. Mr. PATERSON.

It is interesting at this time to read three
items which I ran across in the London Times.
The first is a quotation from a message sent
by the Nobles and Commons of Scotland to
the Pope in 1320:
We fight iot for glory, nor for wealth, nor
for honour, but for that freedom which no good
man w ill surrender but with his life.
The other is from a speech delivered by
William Pitt in 1803:
We ought to have a due sense of the
magnitude of the danger with which we are
threatened; we ought to meet it in that temper
of mind which produces just confidence, which
neither despises nor dreads the enemy; and
while on the one side we accurately estimate
the danger with whieh we are threatened at
tis
awful crisis, we must recollect on the
other band what it is we have at stake, what
it is we have to contend for. It is for our
property, it is for our liberty, it is for our
independence, nay, for our existence as a
nation; it is for our character, it is for our
very name as Englishmen, it is for everything
dear and valuable to man on this side of the
grave.
Finally, I quote Abraham Lincoln:
The struggle of to-day is not altogether for
to-day. It is for a vast future also.
May I express what I know to be the
sentiment of this honourable Senate in our
sincere regret at the passing of our beloved
friend, the fate Governor Ceneral, Lord
Tweedsmuir. Canada little realizes wha't a
friend she has lost; but the loss is to some
extent made less severe by the appointment
as his successor of His Excellency -the Earl of
Athlone, who comes to us ripe with experience,
widelv travelled and with very high traditions.
We look forward to hie influence with hope
and pleasure.
Thomas à Kempis said:
Count not of great importance wlo is for
tiee or against thee. but let this be thîy aim
and care--that God be with thee in everything
thou doest.
May I close by pledging to the Covernment
of Canada and our Allies the support of this
honourable body to the last ditch in the
immedinate and most pressing prosecution of
our war effort.
Hon. ARISTIDE BLAIS (Translation):
Honourable senators, it is with deep emotion,
nmingled with a sense of pride, that after listening to the interesting speech of the honourable
senator from Fort William (Hon. Mr. Paterson) I rise for the first time in this Senate
Chamber to fulfil the perilous and delicate task
of seconding the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. This great honour
which has befallen me, you will readily
understand, was not intended for my humble
person. It is rather meant for the province
from which I come and for the minority

MAY 21, 1940
which I represent. May I be permitted to
tender to the honourable leader of this buse
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) my sincere thanks for
having thus honoured me.
1 also wish to express to bim *my great
admiration and regard for bis high moral qualities, hbis noble character and the prestige
which emanates from bis kindly person. I
arn happy to see him at bis post, loaking so
welI and fit, and to congratulate him on the
cheery and courteous manner with which he
greets the new recruits, as well as on the masterly fashion in which he conducts the debates
of this House.
lu this Chamber, in which everything betokens majesty and serenity and where political
passions have been dulled by age, I feel quite
at ease in paying a ýpersonal tribute to the
Right flonourable the Prime Minister of
Canada and telling hirn what everyone, tbinks
-that he deserves well of bis country.
Indeed, his enligbtened patriotism, bis
respect for the Constitution, that spirit of
unity which is sa dear ta hirn and wbich he
bas succeeded in instilling tbroughout the
whole of Canada, make of bhim one of the
most eminent statesmen in the history of this
country. His indornitable confidence in. the
under]ying forces of the country and bis determination to conquer the difficulties of the
present hbour bave generated courage and
strength everywhere. It is not surprising,
therefore, that the entire country sbould bave
rallied to bis support in the battle to be
fougbt for the common good and the preservation of bhumanity. As my young friend tbe
distinguished son of the Rigbt Honourable the
Minister of Justice said on Friday last in another place, "The collective spirit of the
Canadian nation found its expression in the
recent vote and the Prime Minister's victory
was the triumph of common sense."
Honourable senators, the more and more
tragie events wbich are occurring eacb day,
the violent emotions which we feel when
reading the war bulletins, especially those of
us wbo took part in the last war, make us
realize what holocausts of buman lives and
what enormous sacrifices the Allied nations
are making at this moment for the defence of
rigbt and the preservation of tbe British institutions under which we are living. And I
cannot belp tbinking that wbile we sit bere
the fate of Europe. nay, the fate of aIl mankind, is at stake in the fertile plains of France
and Belgium.
During the dark days of the Frenchi Revolution, Mirabeau said to the representatives of
the people: "Bankruptcy is at your door, and
you deliberate 1" At this moment it is not
bideous bankruptcy that is at our door; it is
the conscience of burnanity wbich is at stake.

i

It is aIl that we bold most dear and most
sacred-our religions beliefs, our freedom, aur
bornes, our country. AIl -that is in the balance.
Will God permit suob a terrible cataclysm
to enguîf the world? Will He allow victory ta
desert the camp of the Allied armies wbo are
fighting for Hie glory and for the preservation
of humanity? Will God permit brute strengtb
ta be exalted as a principle and to become
predorninant in future times? No, bonourable
senators. Saint George and Joan of Arc are
now standing guard over the ballowed soil of
France and they will not permit this modern
Attila to advance with bis Hunnish bosts and
swoop down upon the ancient city of Lutetia.
From ber lofty tower, Saint Genevieve is
watcbing and will once again shield Christian
civilization frorn the assault of barbarians.
Through the prayers of millions of Christians,
the intercession of the Sovereign Pontiff, the
gallantry and the beroic courage of the Allied
armies, and the ability of their commanders,
these blood-thirsty and butcberly Vandals will
be balted on the shores of a new Marne and,
once again, they will fail ta pass.
You realize, honourable senatars, that this
is no tirne for speeches, or for bitter criticism;
the bour bas corne for action, for a wbalebearted union of aIl energies toward the complete mohilization of the nation's vital forces,
and 1 know bow anxious tbe Government are
to act prornptly and ta leave notbing undone
to make victory a certainty.
Above ahl, let us not be deluded by the
positive assurance and the cornforting tbought
that our neighbours will help us if we are
attacked.
The best way of defending our coasts consist-s in making victoýry a certainty on the
soil of France. Besides, the neighbouring republic would perbaps prove no obstacle ta a
victorious 'Germany, for we cannot forget
that the United States are harbouring ten
million Germans w.bo would not fail to bail
their deified leader.
Even now, on the other side of the boundary, uneasiness is becoming manifest, and
it, is realized in well inforrned circles that
at certain tirnes neutrality rnay mean complicity.
The indifference sbown by sorne democracies about the present confiet is truly
amazing and almost disbeartening.
They
bave permitted entire nations to be butcbered
under their very eyes and tbey did not bave
the faintest tbougbt of going to their rescue.
Tbey went no fartber than to authorize the
exportation of n certain amount of capital
in order to alleviate the sufferings of tbose
nations, and this tbey did in the name of the
strictest neutrality.

12

SENATE

Two chivalrous nations only, England and
France, each of them a champion of right
and Christian civilization, fully aware of
their duty-in spite of inadequate preparedness for war-did not hesitate to challenge
the aggressors and to rush to the rescue of
oppressed nations. They are now in danger
of losing their ancient culture under the
attacks of Vandals who have not the slightest respect for the principles on which life
and liberty are based.
We, the sons of those gailant men, we who
have inherited the two great cultures that
stand as bright beacons in the world, have
felt a deep thrill of patriotism and national
pride, and instinctively we have been eager
to join them in the defence of those essential principles that are the heritage of free
nations. We have done so cheerfully, knowing that we were fighting for international
morals, for the sanctity of treaties, and for
the preservation of our racial characteristies
and our respective cultures.
To us, Canadians, this close co-operation
between England and France, in the military
as well as in the economie sphere, and this
spiritual and intellectual union of those
two great nations, are auspicious. They will
make still closer the bonds that unite us.
They will bring us closer together by enhancing the mutual respect that is so essential te national unity, and they will be a
pledge of future peace not only for Canada,
but for the whole world.
Along with concentrating all their efforts
on the prosecution of war, the Government
are not unmindful of the measures which
nay consolidate and improve our economic
position. Experts are working unceasingly
on such reorganization so that our normal
life may net be too much disrupted by the

prcsent difficulties.
moreover quite anxious to plan for the afterwar period.
Measures have aiready been taken to provide for the re-establishment in normal life
of those who were not afraid to endanger their
very future in order to serve the cause of
justice and prevent subversive ideas from
finding their way into their hearts and making
them followers of rampant Comimunism.
This war has also put an end to that selfishness which has maniftsted itself, until now,
in certain provinces and threatened the existence of Confederation. A spirit of closer
solidarity has been established between them
and tho Government, andi the recommendatiens of the Sirois commission, charged with
the study of the relations and spheres of
activity of tii Parliament and the provincial
legislatures, will have to be considered in a
spirit of justice and equity.
Hon. Mr. BLAIS.

I should not like to conclude these few
remarks without paying a tribute to a great
man who has passed away, Lord Tweedsmuir.
While he was visiting Edmonton, I had the
pleasure of listening to him and of admiring
his high culture, which was equalled only by

beautv of the Mackenzie with its variegated
waters, at times still and at times tumultuous,
with its high, abrupt banks, painted by tho
sun in countless hues. He loved the calm of
our great lakes, which induced him to reverie
and opened up to him new horizons.
He wrote to Lord Bessborough, at the end
of March, that he had decided net to prolong his stay in Canada, because his delicate
state of health forced him to return te
England, and that he was preparing to make
a farewell trip to the Western Provinces, for
which he had a particular affection.
" My roots have gone down pretty deep in
this beautiful country of Canada," he wrote,
"land I have a melancholy feeling when
iravelling through it that I shall be very sorry
to leave it." In fact, he was not to leave
it, and to-day Canada mourns for him as for
one of ber beloved sons.
Honourable senators, this country has always
been fortunate in the choice of the representatives of His Majesty, and we have
lcarned with joy and pride of the coming
of His Excellency Lord Athlone and his
gracious consort, Her Roval Highness Princess
Alico. They may be sure of finding everywhber
in Canada a nost hearty and eager welcome.
Their nobility and their great distinction are
for us the most precious evidence of Their
Majesties' love for our beautiful country.
(Text) Honourable senators, may I now utter
a few words in tho language of the majority in
Permit nie to say how proud
this House?
I am of the great leader of the Liberal party.
and how pleased I am te offer hina my most
sincere congratulations upon the greatest
political victory that was ever won by any
party in the history of Canada. It is a pleasure
to note how the people of all the provinces
stood by our leader in his respect for the Constitution, in his attitude on the question of
ivar, and in the prosocution of theiwar effort of
this country.
I am equally happy to congratulate the
honourable leader of the Government in this

MAY 21, 1940
Huse (lion. Mr. Dandurand) on bis long
and useful career. His reputation, bis abilities,
his sterling qualities are k-nown the world over,
and there is no need for me to elaborate
further, except to add the expression of my
personal esteem and admiration for this great
Liberal.
I arn also proud to point out that after
the heat and turmoil of the October elections
in Quebec and of the federal elections last
Mardi, Quebec re'rained faithful to the ideal
of Liberalisrn and to the policy of the Liberal
Administration at Ottawa. This close union
between Quebec and Ottawa is the resuit of
the friendship between the two great leaders,
the Right Hon. Mr. King and the Riglit Hon.
Mr. Lapointe. The latter has won the
esteem, respect and gratitude, not only of
French Canada, but also of ahl other Canadians, because neyer in the past lias a Quebec
Minister contributed sn much as lie to the
building of a strong and united country in
peace and in war. Neyer has this country
shown so fine -a spirit of solidarity, determination and co-operation. In these dark
and trying hours it is gratifying to see the
nation united under the leadership of these
two great statesmen.
It was also a pleasure for me, last Friday,
to note the speech delivered in the other
bouse by the son of the Riglit lion. Minister
of Justice, as he followed in the footsteps of
bis illustrious father. May he accept my
congratulations, Énd at the saine time my best
wishes for a successful political career.
Before taking my scat, I should like to
express rny personal feelings of regret, which
are, I arn certain, those of every member of
this honourable House, for the loss this
country has suffered in the untimely death
of lis Excellency Lord Tweedsmuir, Governàr
General of Canada. We have been happy to
learn that Lord Athlone lias been named as
his successor. Ail Canada has learned the
news with pleasure, and I arn glad to extend to
the Earl of Athlone and lier Royal liighness
the Princess Alice aur most sincere welcome to
this country.
Right lion. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: lionourable members, it is proper that my first
reference should be to the loss by death of
our late Governor General, Lord Tweedsmuir.
To hin and to bis memory I pay tribute for
bis devotion to duty as he understood it. lie
was a great and loyal Britisher, a student of
distinction and a writer of lasting farne. bis
contribution to the world is embalmed in his
books, which are among the finest productions
in our language. Sad indeed it was that bis
last days should have been days of suffering,
and bis tenure of life so brief.
The news of the appointrnent of bis successor is welcome to us ail. I arn sure the

13

Earl of Athlone and lier Royal liigliness will
be heartily received in Canada, and that
they will contribute mucli in this Dominion,
as they have already done in another, to
the establishmnent of close and helpful relations between our country and the Motherland
and the world.
I congratulate the mover (bon. Mr. Paterson) and the seconder (lon. Mr. Blais) of
the Address on the discharge of their duties.
Both are from the West, one coming from the
Middle West and the other from the farther
West. The first has achieved marked success
in the business world; the second lias attained
erninence in bis profession and is universally
esteemed. I commend the words,' which I fully
understood, of the mover of the Address.
As to the seconder, I regret that I can only
express the hope that when I arn aile to
translate the first part of bis remarks I shaîl
find in them more with which I can agree
than I could find in bis rernarks, save in their
purely personal phases, in English.
The responsihility which one always feels in
discharging one's duties as a member of tic
liouse, particularly wien discharging thern
in tirnes of crisis, is very specially present to
rny mind now. I arn sure honourable members
will ail feel that they have neyer in the past
arisen to do their work as parliamentarians
with a greater sense of difficulty, with the paîl
of responsibility hanging over them more
heavily, than in these rather tragic hours.
But we must all remember that reverse, to
the races from which we are so proud to
spring, is usually only the starting point where

liere in Canada it is no pleasure to me to
rise for the purpose of calling attention to
what 1 feel to have heen great errors on the
part of this Dominion. There are those who
will say you should get behind and cheer in
the critical moment-you should not find
fault. But the time lias corne when we must
criticize, when we cannot hope to get what
is vital, rnomentously vital, unless we do.
Reference lias been made to the recent
election. I do not know of any event ini our
history less creditable to our country than the
late election, and I arn not referring to the
preponderance in favour of one party in the
resuit. When I heard from bis Excellency
in this House words which. dissolved Parliament the moment we met, I could scarcely
believe my ears. I could not have thought it
possible that any Prime Minister would put

SENATE

14

into the mouth of the representative of the
Throne in Canada words which embodied
such insolence and rudeness to the Parliament
of this Dominion. The dissolution of that
Parliament was a breach of the solemn pledge
given Parliament by the Prime Minister in
the session of last fall-an open, defiant
breach.
To tell members of this House
and of the House of Commons, immediately
they set foot in this Chamber, that they had
been brought here from the ends of Canada
only to be sent home, is insolence unforgivable. The practical effects are even worse
than the character of the deed.
An clection on a party basis in war-time
can be nothing but a catastrophe, no matter
how it results. I well recall that when the
last war broke out-it was not so near the
end of the term of the then Government, but
still it was fairly near-the cry went forth
throughout Canada that there must be no
party election, and the very purple was torn
from the clouds by the Liberal press, one
and all saying such an act would be the
vilest of our history, because both sides supported the war effort and in that great issue
both sides were one. The same demand
prevailed after the term of Parliament was
ended, and so long as there was anything like
unanimity on the war issue; and only when it
became essential in the view of one side and
of many on the other that a very drastic and
momentous step should be taken, in which all
the other side could not concur, was there an
election. Even then it was not on a party
basis. The party basis was removed to the
utmost within the power of men to remove it.
What bas occurred now? While both sides
were one behind the war, while the voice of
every man on either side of either House
supported the strongest possible prosecution
of the war, the Prime Minister, suddenly and
with affront, dissolved the Parliament of
Canada and called upon the people to defeat
supporters of the war because they had not
the proper party label on their backs. That
action split the war support of this Dominion
down the centre; that action paralysed and
benumbed this country in its support of the
Government in this war. The Prime Minister
of Canada has had a long and distinguished
career, but to the last page of our history that
arrogant dissolution of Parliament will blight
and stain his entire record.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I want to
make some very earnest references to the
progress of our war effort, As I make these
references I ask the House to believe me when
I say I know something of what a war effort
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

means; I know something of its difficulties.
There are those who think regiments fall from
the clouds; there are some who think it takes
only ardent desire to get more things donc in
quicker time; that it matters little whether
you are prepared or not; that if you are just
eager enough you can do everything in a
moment. These miracles cannot be performed.
Even with the utmost unanimity in our country it would have been difficult indeed to
satisfy the nation with the progress of
war effort.
I think unanimity could have
been secured. Parliament had lasted nearly
five years, and had I been in the place of the
Prime Minister I would have reorganized my
Government on the widest possible basis at
once. I would have had represented in it
every considerable element of this Dominion
which supported the war, and with that Government I would have gone to the country
for a mandate and would have backed every
man in Parliament who supported the war.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mous mandate.

We had a unani-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And you split
the Dominion to get it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

We did not.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You proclaimed everywhere that the important thing
was the triumph of the Liberal party.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:-The country was
split in two in 1917 by my right honourable
friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have shown
how the best results could have been obtained.
I know that, had the best results been ohtained, it would have been difficult to satisfy
people that all was being donc that could be
donc. If, however, the Government had gone
about it in a spirit of goodwill I should have
had some sympathy with them under criticism.
I inquire now into what bas been achieved.
We have been nearly nine months at war.
Truc, we have spent vast sumas of money, and
we contemplate the spending of more. What
I have witnessed most until very recent days
bas been the total or almost total absence of a
real war spirit in this Dominion. There is no
honourable member who bas net noted it.
Many have noted it with despair. I have
already stated one of the main causes for
this situation, and I am going to state what
I think is another equally important cause.
Unless a war spirit permeates this country
our utmost effort cannot be exerted.
The second important cause is that the
occurrence of the conflict found this country
without a proper appreciation of its Empire
relationship. This country had been taught

MAY 21, 1940
for years, flot that our defence rested in
British strength, flot that we could best
serve our own security by adding to that
strength, not that there was such a tbing as
the common defence of this Empire, but that
our defence was -a thing separate and apart,
and that our money should be spent for defence separate and apart. That teaching was
fathered and prosecuted down the years by
none more than the present leaders of both
our flouses of Parliameut. So when the war
began this country faced the great confliet
without « sense of wbat in reality it depended
upon for its life, and under the delusion of a
false security.
I recaîl, only a year ago, in the 1939 session,
listening to a Speech frorn the Throne which
referred to expenditure for the defence of Canada, wbich asked support of Parliament for
that expenditure, but made no reference at ail
to that cardinal and vital feature of our true
defence which overwhelms ail other features:the fact that our security necessarily rests
upon the basis of co-operation with Britain
and the other Dominions.
There was no
reference at ail to co-operation, and on that
ground I took exception to the Address. But
1 was ridiculed by tbe honourable leader of
the flouse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I was told
by bim that we could not co-operate with a
wobbling British Government, and he referred
to a difference of policy in relation to
some optional clause in the League of Nations
Covenant, as if that had anything to do with
the principle of co-operation in defence.
In uphiolding such a view the leader of this
flouse bas not been alone. Time and again
the leader of the other flouse (Right Hon.
Mr. King) bas been a party to persuading
Canadians that co-operation in defence with
the Empire was not the principal or any necessary feature of our defence policy, and wben
estimates have been brought down bie bas been
at pains to explain that those were for Canadian defence, not Empire defence-at pains to
banish from the mind of our people any
thought of sucb a thing as couinln Empire
defence.
Anyone wbo wishes to do so eau procure
the Prime Minister's references to these estimates and their purpose. I should like, with
the consent of the flouse, to read briefly from
what were almost his latest words upon this
subjeet. Speaking in the flouse of Commons
on March 30, 1939, after cailing attention to
the great need in Canada for roads, and to
our heavy burden of debt, and so forth, bie
followed with this language:
There is no great margin of realizable wealth
for this purpose; we must, to a greater or les
extent, chouce betweeii keeping our own bouse
in order, and trying to cave Europe and Asia.

How well designed those words wcrc to mndicate wbere, as we ail know now, our defence
really lies!1
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
fence.

Not our de-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The Prime
Minister went on to say:
The idea that every twenty years this country
should automnatically and as a matter of course
take part iii a war overseas for deniocracy or
self-determination of other smnall nations, tlîat
a country whicli las ail it eau do to run itself
should feel called upon to save, periodically, a
continent that cannot l'un itself, and to these
ends risk the lives of its people, risk bankruptcy and political disunion, seenis to many
a nightmare and sheer madness.
Tbere is no difficulty in ascertaining tbe
purpose, certainly no difficulty in ascertaining
the effeet, of language of tlîat character on
the Canadian people. Such language was not
designed to briug us to the point wbere, if
danger loomed in, front of this Empire, we
sbould be able to help in the common
defence. The result was inevitably altogether
in the other direction.
Ail this bas been
supplemeuted by conduet of others, of ton
many otbers, throughout this Dominion. 1
ar n ot estimating bow many would agree
with the two leaders, and bow many wouid
disagree. Others are better judges of public
opinion than I. But the balance of public
opinion matters little in the presence of life
and death. Throughout this country dissemination of such views has been encouraged for
years, and nowhere bas it been given greater
encouragement than under the neis of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. A public
man in Canada could not hroadcast loyal
words favouring defence for us and the Empire
unless somneone else, probably a semi-pink
professor, was subsidized to traduce Great
Britain, to tell the people of Canada that
Britain was a traitor to democracy, and that
the United States would soon be taking over
leadership of democracy throughout the world.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Where did my
right honourable friend get that?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I heard it.
One speaker uttered certain parts of wbat 1
bave referred to, and I wrote the Broadcasting Corporation to find out about it, and was
told that be was paid. Tbe rest of what I bave
indicated was heard from other radio speakers.
This kind of tbing bas been going on unchecked, certainly iu no way resisted by Government members or by leadership from. persons in authority in Canada.
Two or
three editors of this country bave done their
noble much to the samne end. In consequence
we faced this war as au Empire country

broken and benumbed, and in no spirit to rise
immediately to the common defence. These
things went on for a long time and one of
the consequences is that our war effort has
not been anything to be proud of. It is only
lately, under pressure and impact of terrific
events, that the people of Canada have risen
te a sight of the reality. Now they are very
much dissatisfied, now they are restive, now
they are determined. Had the authorities of
Canada long ago helped them to develop a
spirit of that kind, we should have made a far
greater war effort, and there would never have
been the lethargy now complained of, nor
some of the conduct which has been indulged
in in the course of our recent history.
What is the sum of our war effort? Anyone
speaking on this subject is apparently expected
to utter the words of the Prime Minister;
otherwise he may be charged with violating
the Military Secrets Act, or something else,
or with giving encouragement to the enemy.
There is no man in this Dominion who wants
to encourage the enemy less than I do. I
speak with a depth of conviction born of
many things which I am not particularly eager
to expose to this House. It is my judgment,
eone the less, that we have now to realize
just where we are, or we shall not get farther
very soon.

After nearly nine months we have, I suppose, about 20,000 men in England. They
have been there, or nost of them, for about
four to five months. We have a Second Division mobilized in Canada, but, as I am informed, net yet completely mobilized, not all
We now have
the units being complete.
promise of a Third Division to be mobilized,
and are told that at some time in the future
a Canadian corps will be in France. It sounds
well, but from the point of view of real immediate progress towards actual fighting I fear
it is not much better than a façade of words
and visions.
Our First Division had in it twelve infantry
units, of whom nine were rifle units and three
machine-gun units. It also had a complement
of cavalry and artillery, and in personnel, seo
far as I know, was complete. That division
went over with rifles, with machine guns, with
artillery equipment. But when one has said
that one has not told the whole truth. The
rifles, I am ready to agree-I am no expertare such that they cean be used in the field. I
hope that concession is net too great. The
machine-guns could net be used. The artillery
weapons were net modern, and only under
bitter necessity could they be taken to the field
at all, and they are used to-day only under
the stern necessity of scarcity.
But had those rifles, those machine-guns,
those artillery weapons been modern in every
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

way, that division as it went over would have
been very far from being equipped. We have
to keep in mind that to-day, relatively speaking, rifles have not great importance. They
still are important. Besides, every unit of the
whole nine-I take the rifle units first-must
have 22 anti-tank guns, 14 infantry mortars
and 24 signal pistols, a total of 60, or 540 in
all; and of these they had none at all. The
rifles presumably they still have. The machineguns and the artillery weapons are being
replaced on the other side by Great Britain.
Whether they are all replaced I cannot say;
I do hope they are.
In addition to all these regiments, wheeled
vehicles are vital. Every infantry division has
to have 66 wheeled vehicles-lorries, trucks,
Bren gun carriers-or a total of 594; and they
had none at all. To go further, the artillery
and cavalry and three machine-gun units.
called infantry, must as well have those vital
accessories and in large numbers. These thousands of vehicles apparently have to be supplied by the over-strained factories of Britain.
These things we should bave had done in
Canada.
We have learned of late-I do not know
how soon others learned-that in addition to
all this mechanized infantry and cavalry there
niust be the fighting vehicles for the whole
division, consisting of 86 anti-tank guns, 49
scout carrier cars and 38 other armoured cars.
Those are big fighting vehicles the division
had to have, and they had none of them.
I wonder now whether someone would
undertake to question those figures-someone
who listened before the election te assurances
that the division went over equipped. It is only
fair to say that in my opinion, in the state
we were in when the war broke out, no
those

Government
vehicles at once, or all of them; but I do
object to the dissemination over the radio and
otherwise in this Dominion of assurances that
the division went over equipped. I object
to it with all the earnestness of which I am
capable.
Now, the young men of this country have
special adaptabilities. They showed it in the
last war. In the air they were very, very
distinguished and successful. They would be
the same in this war. One air squadron has
gone over, which would include, I should
think, about 40 pilots and a number of ground
men. As yet, to the fighting front in the field
we, as Canada, have contributed nothing.
We have air men there who went over and
enlisted in the British Air Force, and it is
those men we hear of in the casualty lists
to-day.
Besides, this country is specially qualified
te provide railway troops, forestry men, tun-

MAY 21, 1940
nellers, tank-drivers, and signallers. We have
young men im our agriculture, indeed in all
spheres of our activity, who are accustomed to
driving over territory such as in tanks they
would have to traverse.
Where are we
with tanks? We have some light tanks at
Camp Borden. They are so light and so
small in number that they are not even part
of the equipment of our Second Division. They
are used for training, it is true. There is no
country in the world better equipped to make
tanks than we are. We could make them in
Hamilton alone in .two factories, and one
factory there could make 250 in a month, and
do so right along. If there is a weapon that
is essential in this mechanized conflict, it is
the tank. We could provide tunnellers with
our miners and signallers. I make this statement, that in signalling we have not equipment to -train the men. We have no modern
equipment with which to train them yet. I
mentioned railway troops. A public man in
Ontario made the statement some months ago
that the British Government had requested
railway troops, but these had never been
sent. So far as I have been able rto find,
that statement has never been denied. I do
not know whether the request' from Britain
took the form of an inquiry as to whether we
should like to do so. If it did, this Government would not consider it a request at all.
They would just say, "No, we had no request."
It may have taken any form; I know not
what. But personally I believe the statement.
When the Prime Minister of Canada tells us
that he is in constant consultation with the
British Government, I believe him. But if
he wants us to infer that he is meeting
Britain's urgent requests for 'this war, then I
cannot accept his statement. I do not think
he himself has ever gone so far as to say that;
but he has a Minister who did, and newspapers who do. One of them is in Brockville.
They have assured us we were doing all we
were asked to do. It is all right to talk about
being in consultation, but it is not fair and
it is not right to give the people of Canada
the impression that consultation means
practical and full co-operation on our part.
I do not know what other requests have
been made; I may have no right to know; but
in the last war I had experience sufficient to
convince me that there are things Britain
would have liked us to do that we were not
always able to do. Nobody who was through
the last war could be ignorant of that fact.
Possibly we cannot do all we are asked to do,
but we can do much more than we have done.
I know that we could send railways troops
and forestry troops. They did wonderful
work in the last conflict. But, though we
may not be able to do all we are asked, surely

it is wrong to lead the people of Canada to
think we are doing so; and this they have been
led to believe to be the fact all through these
months.
Now I make another complaint. Home
defence is part of our work, though not
the major one, for we defend ourselves
best and most effectively by strengthening
in our own appropriate way the arm of
Britain and the Allies. If they go, we go.
There are not very many in this country
trying to find other sources of comfort now;
there were months ago. To-day I cannot
find any, no matter where I go. We know
where the fortress is behind which we are
going to live-or beneath which we are
going to perish if it falls. There are some,
even across the line, who are not of the
view to-day which they held months
ago. To-day they are not so confident
that they could win after the great democracies of Europe have failed, and win after
the might of those totalitarian powers is
multiplied and they have come closer to our
continent. There are, I know, somé who so
believe, but they are mostly confined over
there to fifth columnists or to petted children
of fortune. The United States people are
coming to the view of their President,
the mightiest and brainiest of their sons,
who from the altitude of his high position
and in the light of his luminous mind, unsurpassed in our day, sees the situation as

it is.

Over there is our defence.

Over there

is their defence. Let us act on that knowledge. Let us not live in a paradise that we
know is false.
Let us not invite the
day when we shall have to stand beside our
neighbours and fight the totalitarian world in
possession of our home islands.
Home
defence, none the less, is still part of our
duty.
According to a Government spokesman, we
need for our home defence-I take no exception to his statement-six divisions. Have
we them? We know we have not. What

have we?

I referred to the condition of

those of our men who went overseas. I
hope they are equipped with
modern
weapons of warfare now. I do not know.
But I do know this, that, in order to get them
over, our non-permanent units were largely
stripped of their military clothing and training equipment.
In that plight they are
lef t.
Further, among the nine infantry battalions
that went over, there were our only three
permanent-force infantry battalions, the Royal

Princess Patricias. What was the purpose of

everything would be over soon; I do net
know; but I cannot sec any justification for
stripping the Dominion of a force so vital,
so esscntial to the prosecution of this conflict.
Sucli is the condition of our non-permanent units. They were stripped of clothing.

The Second Division cannot commence

now, they cannot possibly be trained in less
time than six months. That is the minimum.
Two years is usually considered necessary,
but under war conditions the aim is to have
it done in six months. This means it will be
near the end of the year, anyway, before the
Second Division is trained. And we are asked to
breathe happily because a Third Division is
promised! What is going to happen them?
Outside of the training at Aldershot, we have
wasted about nine months in preparing our
men for the front. This is the condition of
affairs, and the people of Canada feel it.
They did not feel it nearly as soon as they
should have felt it, but thcy <lo now under
the strain and the crash of the nightiest

What is to be done?
I have read the
programme which is now foreshadowed. Programmes we have had in plenty; it is in
realization that we have failed-and we bave
failed tragically.
Our effort is to-day the
scorn of many in Canada, and I must say
I am afraid it is the scorn of nany outside
our country. We have been no examuple to
our friends to the south. Read their press.

Canada for permission to establish, wholly at
the expense of the British Government, a training school in Canada for flyers. One can
understand that on account of the large open
spaces such a location migbt be desirable for
the purpose of such training. The request, I
am advised, lias been made on two occasions
and refused by the Government of Canada. I
would ask whether the information has any
truth in it, and, if so, why the request is
refused.
To this the honourable leader of the House
replied:
I am quite ready to confess to my right
honourable friend that for several reasons I
cannot at this moment answer his question.
He occupied this position for a number of years
and was sometimes unable to attend Council,
so much was he engrossed with the work of
the Senate and of its committees.
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: I am in the same
position to-day. So I must askc my riglit bonourable friend to give me twenty-four hours
in which to furnish an answer to his question.
Next day, June 15, there was this:
Hon. Raoul Dandurand: Honourable senators,
yesterday my riglit honourable friend opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) asked me whether
"the British Government bas made a request
to the Goverument of Canada for permission to
establish, wholly at the expense of the British
Government, a training scliool in Canada for
flyers." And he added:
"The request, I am advised, bas been made
on two occasions and refused by the Government
of Canada. I would ask whether the information bas any truth in it, and, if so, why the
request is reftused."
My answer is that no such request lias been
made te the Canadian Government.
A blank negative.
I then rose, and these were my words:
Would the bonourable leader of the Government be sufficiently non-technical with the
House to follow up his answer with some statement as to just what the facts are in this
connection? It may be that exactly in the terms
in wbicl I have asked the question there bas
not been a request, but bas there net been
one on the same subject-matter and not very
far unrelated to the very terms which I used?
And if so, what bas been the reply? And what
is the policy of the Governnent of the day?

To which the leader of this House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) replied:
I eau perbaps enlarge upon the answer I
have made. There bas been no request to the
Federal Government eitber in the terms in
wlich my right honourable friend's question of
yesterday was couched or in those be bas just
used to obtain further information. In a word,
there bas been no request from the British
Government to the Canadian Government in any
shape or formI ask the House to remember these words.
-concerning
the matter mentioned in the
query of the right honourable gentleman.
I then asked:
Will the honourable leader of the Government say there bas been no inquiry95832-2j

19

Honourable members will note the word I
used there, "inquiry."
-of the Canadian Government as to what its
attitude would be with respect to the subjectmatter?
My honourable friend replied:
That I am unable to answer.
This was on June 15. He went on to say:
I asked the department, "lias any request
been made by the British Government to the
Canadian Government?"
The answer was in
the negative.
I then added:
I have put the question in the broadest
terms I can, and for the time being I shall have
to accept the reply. I find it very difficult te
conclude in my own mind that the information
given to me is wholly unfounded.
The matter was closed on that day by these
words from the honourable leader of the
House:
I am unable to enlarge on the statement I
have made to the right honourable gentleman.
It will be noted that I asked whether there
lad been an inquiry as to what our attitude
would be. I was told there had been no
request, and on the matter of the inquiry no
answer was then or even later vouchsafed.
Six days after, on June 21, I again rose on
the Orders of the Day, and asked this question:
Honourable members, last Tuesday, on information I then luad, I addressed a question to
the Government as to its attitude towards
giving permission to the British Government
to establish flying school facilities in Canada.
On Wednesday I received an answer to the
effect that no request had been made by the
British Government for such permission. I then
took the liberty of following up the question,
my only purpose being to have it in such a
general form as would enable the Administration to enlighten this House as to what, if
any, conversations there had been on the subject. Wben I put my question in that general
form the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) answered as follows, as reported
at page 503 of the Debates of the Senate:
" Tbat I am unable to answer. I asked the
department, 'Has any request been made by
the British Government to the Canadian Government?' The answer was in the negative."
Then I xent on:
I wish to-day to renew the question, emphasizing particularly the generality of its form.
I earnestly hope the Government will see its
way to take the House into its confidence in
respect to a matter of such vital and perhaps
permanent consequence, not only to the Empire,
but to this country.
Then there was the following interehange:
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: Of course, I could at
the time only give the right honourable gentleman the answer that I had received. Now be
is asking whether there have been conversations.
Is that the meat of the question?
Riglht Hon. Mr. Meighen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: I will get an answerfor my right honourable friend.

20

SENATE

The following day, June 22, the subject
was discussed for the fourth time in this
House, as follows:
Hon. Raoul Dandurand: My right honourable
friend yesterday asked me whether I was in a
position to answer a certain question. Last
week he asked me whether the British Government had made a request to the Government of
Canada to establis a training school for flyers
here. I answered him that no such request had
been made. Yesterday my right bonourable
friend asked whether any conversations on the
subject had taken place.
Requests have been reccived from the British
Government during the past year regarding
short-service commissions for Canadians in the
United Kingdom Air Force. and the Canadian
Government bas co-operated in making the
arrangements proposed.
That, I suppose, was a kind, of red herring.
It had nothing to do with the question. My
honourable friend went on:
No requests have been received from the
British Governmsent for the establishment in
Canada of an air school or other agency of the
Some informal
United Kingdom Air Force.
conversations have taken place with persons
who did not indicate they had been authorized
or instructed by the British Government to
make any proposals.
I direct special attention to this statement
he then made:
It is not custonary or desirable to refer to
inquiries of this description.
It was not "customary or desirable" that they
should even be mentioned! In other words,
it was none of our business! My honourable
friend added:
Should any suci proposals be made by ic
Government of the United Kingdom, tbe Canadian Government would of course be prepared
to discuss them with that Government, and at
the proper time to make its position k"nown to
tihe Canadian people.
I then asked:
Would the honourable leader of tise Government state w'hether tie persons witlh whom the
Government iad conversations were Canadians
or citizens of the British Isles?
To this my honourable friend replied:
It seems to me that informal conversations
can hardly form the basis of an inquiry in this
Chamber or the other wlien they are not
followed by some official action.
If tire British Government's suggestion is declined, that is no business of the Canadian
Parliament! My honourable friend added
these words to his statement:
I simply submit that as my own answer to
my rigbt honourable friend; not as an answer
from tie Government.
The matter was pursued that day in the
following manner:
Right Hon. Mr. Meigien: What I am getting
at is this. Informal conversations may be just
as important as if all tbe fornalities in the
world were attached. It depends on whoin they
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

were with. Will the honourable leader of the
Government say whether the informal conversations were not with a person who miglit
reasonably have been expected to be feeling out
the position of this Government on behalf of
the Government of Britain?
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: I cannot answer the
query of my right honourable friend as to whom
they were with. It would strike me as extraordinary that informal conversations should
produce rumours whieh would reach this Chamber or the other and form the basis for a queiy
as to the action of the Government on such
conversations.
Riglit Hon. Mr. Meighen: I do not sec anything extraordinary about that.
On July 1, 1938, the last day of that year's
session, this subject came up again in a debate
in the other Chamber, and with the permission
of the House I should like to read brieflybut as much as anyone wants-from a statement of the Prime Minister. The subject
having come up at the instance of the then
Leader of tise Opposition, the Prime Minister
was, as will he seen from the report,
incensed that any news of these conversaWhether for
tions should have got out.
the purpose of wreaking vengeance on an
informant, I know not, but he did his utmost
to find out where the news came from, and
souglit to pour abuse on anyone who would
not disclose the source of his informationas if the source were important, and not the
information itself. He said this:
Confidential and informal exploratory conversations witi respect to training of British
air pilots have taken place, but notbing has
developed wlich it was felt warranted a statement of policy.
I will inquire in a moment whether policy
had not ailrcady been determined and concealed from the people of Canada and their
representatives.
Now I will quote something more. A radio
speech was made by the Prime Minister on
the eighth day of March this year. I have
here the Globe and Mail's report of the next
day, which says it was a fifteen-minute speech.
The heading is, "King denies he delayed air
scheme," and the report in part reads:
In May of 1938, tie Prime Minister said,
Sir Francis Floud, then British High Commissioner in Canada, told him the British Government "wished to explore tie possibility of sending to Canada, for further training in Canada,
some British air pilots who had already
received training in the United Kingdom."
I hope honourable menbers have noted the
language. The British Government "wished
to explore the possibility" of getting done that
which they desired donc. Then the report
goes on:
The British Government had wished to ascertain if there would bc any objection to such
training in Canada in establishments to be
owned, maintained and controlled by Britain.
"I diid not gather from him"-

MAY 21, 1940
Oh, this is characteristic:
-"that there was so much as a suggestion of
any plan for the general training of British
pilots in Canada."
What kind of training was it to be? But
listen to this sentence:
"Partnership in the Empire was never men-

tioned," said Mr. King.
How amazingl Before he would know, I

suppose, that we were partners in the Empire,
it would have to be mentionedi Why that is
inserted passes my comprehension. But listen
further:
"I pointed out to the British High Commissioner that, apart from any possible controversy which might arise, for the Government of
the United Kingdom to own, maintain, control
and direct any air training establishment in
Canada would involve certain questions of
jurisdiction and administration.
"I explained that our position in the British
Commonwealth demanded that .all military
establishments in Canada should be under control of the Canadian Government. With that
stand I believe all true Canadians will agree."
Now I proceed to discuss the effect of all
that I have quoted. The replies given to me
in this Chamber are, I believe, not ultimately
attributable to the leader of the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). They were given, I
doubt not, at the direction of the Prime
Minister of Canada. Obviously they should
have been so given, because he is head of the
department that has to do with this subject.
Furthermore, on July 1, 1938, referring to the

questions which had been asked here and the
replies given, he confirmed the accuracy of
those replies by saying he did not want to
add anything at all to them. Therefore he is
responsible.
Now, where does this place him? In May
he was approached by the British Minister in
Canada and asked what would be our attitude
towards a wish of the British Government to
establish air training facilities in this Dominion. I ask the honourable leader of the
Government who sits in front of me: Does he
think the Prime Minister of Canada gave us
an honest answer when he told us no request
had been made? Does he?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the form of a request.

It

was not in

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is
distinction between a request and what
British Government did? I will tell you
distinction. In what they did they took

the
the
the
care

that no difference should arise between them
and this country. That care they always
take. Even at the price of flattery and
extreme courtesy they will always take care to
have no difference with Canada. If they had
made a formal request -and received a negative
answer, there would have arisen a difference

21

between them and this country, which might
have been harmful to the Empire. No; their
request takes another form. They inquire
what our attitude would be, and say they
would like to do certain things. We say, " No,

you cannot." And the Government of Canada
tells Parliament that no request at all was
made. I ask, can we trust the Government of
Canada again?
Never was there a more direct request.
Yet, not only was Parliament informed that
no request at all had been made, but when
I followed the matter up I was told by the
Prime Minister of Canada, through the honourable leader of this House, that it was none
of the business of the Senate or Parliament
what the Government's attitude was toward
the British inquiry.
We were told that
policies going to the very root of our right
to live can be determined by the Government and concealed from Parliament, and
that conversations entered into for the purpose of finding out what we are ready to do
are none of our business. We were told
that by the Government which is in office
to-day, the Government which is conducting
this war. This is the Government which tells
us it is in consultation with the British

Government, and wants us to infer that it
is doing what the British Government wants.
This is the Government upon which, in the
blackest hour we have ever faced, we are
asked to depend. When I asked whom those
conversations were with, I was told that the
information could not be given. In Germany
it is the custom to decide upon policies, no
matter how vital they may be, without the
knowledge of parliament and behind its
back. Is that to be the case in Canada?
Now, what are the consequences of the
refusal to give this information? The first
consequence is to destroy trust in the Government of this country. No longer can we
rely on its answers with respect to subjects
the most vital to Parliament.

The next consequence is this: two years'
delay in the provision of the most vital arm
that is going to save the Allies and ourselves.
In the name of the sovereignty of Canada!
"Ah," we are told, "all they wanted were
just a few men." I do not know how many
they wanted, nor on how large a scale they
desired to train, but I know the nature and
the reasonableness of the request, and I know
that the living up to the opportunity, if it
had been given, would have been, or would
have become, commensurate with the peril.

But the gates of Canada were locked to our
partner who desired to help in the defence
of this country, as of their own, in the air.

What a record! Who in this Dominion cares
whether British officials or our own train our

22

SENATE

men if they are properly trained and if our
nationhood is saved? There is not a soul in
Canada who does not know that we had not
the facilities for training. and that it would
take months, if not years, to get us the facilities.
But peril meant nothing; national
sovereignty meant all. There sits the Government of this Dominion. Ah, when the Allied
effort failed in Norway because of the deficiency in planes, the man who should have
resigned was not in Great Britain, he was
right here in Canada.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Shame.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Rubbish.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, I thought
something like that would come from the honourable member. I have watched him. There
never was such a sin conmitted against our
security as the sin committed there. No one
knows the air strength we might have achieved
had we met our partner in the spirit of partnership, and not in the spirit of a contention
that it would oust the sovereignty of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right bonourable friend is totally unfair in bis conclusions, as I shall prove to him when I
speak.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
can, but I know you cannot.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I hope you

We shall see.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We are partners, or we are not. If we cannot trust Britain
in matters of our common defence we might
as well dissolve this Empire.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right bonourable friend speaks of 1938?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I know
I am mentioning only two years yet. I am
by no means certain it is only two years we
have lost.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

We have not

lost three months.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We are told
now we are going to bave 169 pilots by
November, and we bave not lost three months.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, if that
is the best we can do, it is better to depend
on others.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We shall discuss the negotiations of 1938.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know what
they have done over there in Britain. I know
our limitations and I am very doubtful that
we are going tu get even what is foreshadowed
by the Government to-day. Britain knew she

had to get an organization in Canada to prepare for our common defencoe. If we cannot
trust ber, then the Empire bad botter be
dIissolved; and I would rather see it dissolved
by ourselves than by somebody else. I feel
strongly on this subject.
There is not a
doubt in my- own mind that that was not the
first approach. tlough perhaps it was the first
official approach. How do «e explain that the
Vancouver Sun. a ioading Liberal paper on
the coast, announced in July, 1937, that there
hiaI alirady been a refusal to a request by
the itish
ornmn to establishl air training favilities bere? I nover read the announcement until a year after. Are we to be
asked to believe that that was just based on
a myth? Statements of that kind are not
based on myths. What g-ound there was for
the pronouncement I do not know, but I
have every reason to feel that the approach,
in whatever form it was made, was made a
year before 1938.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Riglht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know we
have a Governmnent who dony having a request unless it is put in writing-maybe under

printed or net, is net a request; and when we
ask if there was anything more they.,tell us
it is none of our business. I know that, and
I should like imv lonourable friend te take
tiat sentence and dispute it. Again I ask,
is this to be the Government upon which this
country is to rely for conduct of this crisis?
Now. I say this. Until this Government is

Ir. DANDURAND:

Until?

Riglht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Until it is
rcorganized or changcd, tntil it is placed on
a basis best odapted to gain tle following of
every war element in this country, it cannot
have lthe confidence of Canada. Until it is
reorganized or clanged-and I do not want
it cbanged on a party basis, no matter what
tie party-it is not going to command that
confidence. J asik the Government to move to
bring about unity in Canada. You do not
bring it about by trying to destroy your
political foes whbile the nation's foes flourish.
This Government can îlo something te bring it
about. Therc is nobody in the Dominion

Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: But do not

thern up to now. It will take a long tirne to
bring us to real participation. How long a

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
.senators, I rnust try to calm the storm raised
by rny right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) by turning to the mover (Hon.
Mr. Paterson) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Biais) of the motion and congratulating thern
upon their addresses. I wish to say to the
mover, who cornes from the Upper Lakes,
that this Chamber dlaims to be fairly representative of ail elements that go to make
up the nation, and 1 arn sure that the contribution which my bonourable friend wilI
make to our deliberations will prove that the
Government was right in caliing hirn to our
ranks.
The honourable senator who seconded this
motion cornes from Edmonton. I iistened to
him closely. I feel -le was too kind in bis
references to the leader of the Senate, but
apart froma that I may say bis address was
very weil prepared. We know that ini bis
province hie stands bigh in the medical fraternity and is looked up to, by ail the members
of bis profession. lis reputation goes beyond
the borders of Alberta, and I arn sure that
the Senate will be the better for bis presence.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meigben) bas ailuded to the demise of
Lord Tweedsmuir and to the eoming of the
Earl of Athione and Her Royal Higbness the
Princess Alice. I join with him in the encomiurns that bave falien frorn bis lips, and
wvitb the Government in the statement contained in the Speech from the Throne. I
remember the day wben my right bonourable
friend rose and stated that a commoner, John
Buchan, had been appointed G-overnor Generai.
I should have rnuch preferred the Governor
ýGeneral's retention of that name,' which bie
had made so illustrious. We found in him
a wise statesman with the poise of a cultured
gentlemnan, and with a clear understanding of
the needs of Canada, and lie soon endeared
birnself te flie hearts of ail Canadians.

23

I feel that we are honoured by the appointment of the Earl of Athione, wbo will be
accompanied here by bis brilliant consort, the
Princess Alice. We await their arrivai, and
we shaîl try to make them as happy among
us as were Lord Twcedsrnuir and bis farnily.
Now, I eonfess that I was flot mucb
surprised at my rigbt honourable friend's
oration. He bas shown in days past bis
strong dissatisfaction witb the Administration,
and I thiak'bis state of mind bas becorne more
and more pessirnistie since grave news bas
been corning daiiy from Europe. I cannot
for a moment believe that my right honourable friend represents any widespread sentiment in Canada when hie utters the strictures
that we have heard from him. A " National "
Government was offered the people of this
country on the 26th of Marcb, and was
rej ected almost unanimously. The Conservative party disappcared even before the
electors reached the polis. I do not know
that haîf a dozen candidates presented themselves as Conservatives. Dr. Manion made
a special effort to carry a mai ority of the
electorate wvith bima on bis proposai to form
a National Government such as my right
honourable friend suggests to-day.
The
electors have been heard from, and they bave
rejected the proposai. They bave decided that
in comparison wjth that unknown National
Government wbich ivas to contain the "best
brains of the country," the men at the belm
were the best men to continue ini the conduct
of affairs during the wvnr, surrounded as they
were by tbe best brains of the country, to be
caiied into, their councils. My right bonourable friend wvill not deny that the present
Governiment, in tbe formation of boards for
the earrying on of war work from A to Z,
bas the support of the best men who couid
be seiected. I could narne such men, on
various boards, and individualiy they wouid
receive the commendation of my rigbt honourable friend.
An Hon. SENA'1OR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is the
Government that bias been carrying on during
the last six months.
My right bonourabie friend spent baîf an
hour in trying to establish that the Government was false to the Parliament of Canada
wben it refuscd to state that conversations
were going on, which did flot ripen into
decision, and in maintaining that these shouid
now be rehiearsed before this Chamber, in
order to show that the Government is
unworthyRight Honi. Mr. MEIGEEN: The Prime
Minister said a refusai was given.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The whole question discussed by my rigbt honourable friend
was put before the people of Canada in one
or two broadcasts by the Prime Minister,
and the people stood by the decision of the
Government not to allow even the British
Government to take possession of forty or
fifty aerodromes for the purpose of establishing a system under its own laws while we
had our own men, our own administration and
our own system which could give it what it
wanted.
The Prime Minister, in the conversation ho had with the High Commissioner,
said it was preposterous that there should be
two powers in Canada deciding on matters of
importance such as that. He said what the
people of Canada believe.
I know that
Imperialists like my right honourable friendand Imperialist he is to the core-do not
accept the idea that we should say this is an
autonomous Canada with ber own laws, and
she is mistress in her own household. I know
my right honourable friend's sentiment, but
I tell him it is shared by but few. The people
at large supported the Government, which
said that Canada would furnish all the facilities
required, but would furnish them under its
own laws; that there could not be two Governments in this country at the same time. This
was submitted to the people of Canada on
the 26th of March last, and we know the
result. I will refer to it again in a moment.
It

would secm

that mv

right

honourable

friend hiad fallen fron Mars, and had come
to this Chamber without any past, without
any record, te tell us what should be done
in this country. But ho was in power from
1930 to 1935, and I would askz how the Federal
Government-the Bennett-Meighen Government-administered the affairs of the country
and provided for the defence of Canada and
the British Empire.
The answer is very
simple. Nothing was done except to starve
ll the services and reduce our air force almost
to the vanishing point.
When we came into power in October,
1935, what did we do?
We hastened to
attend to Canadian matters. Within three
weeks the Prime Minister had obtained
reciprocity with the United States, and a
treaty was signed on the 1lth of November,
1935. We then proceeded to prepare for
the session of 1936; and in 1937, after looking around at the situation and making a
survey of our various departments and finding
that for five years our army, our militia, our
air force and our navy had been practically
starved by my right honourable friend's Government, we decided that something should
be d'one. Throughout 1937, 1938 and 1939
the present Government felt the necessity of
preparing, first, for the defence of Canada,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

and it appealed to Parliament to vote money
for that purpose. That was a sentiment to
bring together all Canadians. As my right
honourable friend knows, there is such a thing
as preparing public opinion, and matters
like the equipping and outfitting of soldiers
attract the masses only when they sec men
marching in the streets with bands in the
lead.
There was such a thing as preparing the
country for the defence of Canada and indueing the people to think nationally. All the
provinces did not feel alike on this matter,
but the Government succeeded in securing
increasingly large votes of money from year
to year for the defence of Canada.
This showed courage. I am not sure that in
this respect my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meigien), who has crossed swords
with the Prime Minister boti in the Commons and before the people, would not think
that at tiues ho was weak and indecisive, Yet it
required courage to vote millions for the
defence of Canada. We iad to educate the
people to the needs of the day, so that
public opinion would support the action of
the Government. This is what lias been done
and is being done in every other country.
We may ask why President Roosevelt, strong
as he is, does not do certain things. The
answer is that publie opinion muîst be formed;
the people must be educated. In order to
get the people of Canada to work togetlier in
unity, the Governinent had to hring them to
a realization of the necessity of doing sonething for this country first. But my right
honourable friend says, "No, the Empire is
first."

Well, the war came and we had to prepare
the defence of our coasts. We spent large
suns of money in trying to revivify our
militia and our air force, and to enlarge our
navy, to enable us to take our position by
the side of Great Britain. Of course it is
easy for critics-I am not speaking of honourable members of this Chamber-to say
we should have donc more, and that in 1938
we should have foreseen the threat to Great
Britain and to France and what was coming in Europe. My answer to that is that
Canada was not at the controls. London had
its diplomatie service, which was covering
the whole of Europe, and yet the day after
Munich it was admitted that Great Britain
was unprepared.
I will cite the speech delivered by the Right
Hon. Winston Churchill, present Prime
Minister of England, on the Sth of May. He
said:
Jn this war we are frequently asked why
we do not take the initiative. The reason for
this serious disadvantage of our not baving
the initiative is one whicl cannot be speedily

MAY 21, 1940
removed. It was our failure in the last five
years to maintain or regain air parity with
Germany. That is an old story, and it is a
long story.
That statement carries with i
Winston
Churchill's criticism of the inaction of the
British Government in preparing its defence.
The Opposition, and my right honourable
friend, whom I call the leader of the Conservative party in this House despite the
fact that that party ceased to appear before
the people-for I still believe the old guard
surrounding him can claim to form part of
the Conservative party-have alleged that the
Government lost two years in launching the
British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.
This, I think, can be disproved, and I intend
to try to disprove it. Great Britain's offer
of May, 1938, made through its High Commissioner, Sir Francis Floud, was to train
British air pilots in Canada. The Canadian
Government said: " We do not like the form
in which you present this proposal, because
you seem to desire to come into the country
and to organize a whole department of British
Government on Canadian soil and under your
own laws. But there is one thing which is
quite satisfactory to us. We will give you
all the facilities available and will work with
you.,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

gentleman tell us?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have some
proof, though, as to when it was given.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For the satisfaction of my right honourable friend I will
read from page 10 of the Prime Minister's
address, one page ahead of where I had
intended to read. He said:
It has been asserted that the air training
plan would have been in existence before this
had the present Government not declined to
meet an earlier request of the United Kingdom
Government for the training of British pilots
in Canada. Within the past week or two, it
lias, for example, been said: "Had we agreed
to the British proposal of two years ago for
the establishment of air training facilities in
Canada, to-day, Canada would be, in reality,
the air training centre of the Empire."
95832-3

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Will the honourable gentleman allow me? He says the reply
given to the British Government was that our
facilities would be placed at their disposal,

The Prime Minister continued:
More recently it has been said that "so far
as the Empire air training scheme is concerned
this was proposed by the British nearly two
years ago, but apparently discouraged by the
King Government until after the outbreak of
war."

Canada which took place, not two years ago.
but in May and June of last year.
It was in December, 1939, that the Prime
Minister was speaking. He went on:
The facts were clearly set forth in a statement I subsequently made to Parliament.
The conversations did not relate te a joint
air training plan.
That is what the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister had alluded to earlier. He went on:
Their purpose was to ascertain whether it
would be agreeable to the Canadian Government to have United Kingdom schools for the
advanced training of pilots of the Royal Air
Force established in Canada, under the authority and direction of the Air Ministry of the
United Kingdom. It was represented that it
was becoming increasingly difficult to secure in

Mr. MEIGHEN: That was

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of this Chamber to the fact
that this was a, peace-time proposai. This
was in 1938. Great Britain was not suffering
from any jitters; she was simpiy looking ahcad
and sayiog that there were fine young men in
Canada who could be called to the colours
-as airmen. And 1 quite believe that the big
sceeme that is now under way wiil train
Canadians, and that we shall see hardly one
British air recruit coming here, because they
have their own system in Engiand. But they
have succeeded in their suggestion for cooperation, because in Canada wc have perhaps
the greatest centre in the world for air development and recruiting. We have now a vast
expansion of the scbeme which in the spring
of 1938 was aiready under way as the resuit
of joint explorations by the Governments of
Canada and the United Kingdom. This fact
disposes of unjustifiable strictures on our supposed diiatoriness prior te the deciaration of
war.
I wouid point out to my right honourabie
friend this further fact, that in the session of
1939 ail that could be done in peace-time by
the two Goveraments, British and Canadian,
by collaborating and exploring the situation,
was donc. The Canadian Government did
not lose aay time in making preparations for
the smaiier scheme, which has since developed
into the large undertaking of to-day. At
that session Parliament appropriated the sumn
of $6,000,000 for the joint training of pilots.
As I have aiready pointed out, the British
Secretary of State for Air said, as eariy as
July 7, 1938, that bis Government were
warmiy appreciative of the offer m-ade by
Canada and were sending a representative
over here to explore, in co-operatien with our
Government, the possihility of working out a
scheme for training- faciiities in Canada. That
representativc came, a scbeme was agreed
upen, and at the vcry next session, in 1939,
the sum of 36,000,000 was voted for it.'

In telling you this story of the many and
varied activities of our Navy, I must not omit

1 spoke of the control of merchant shipping.
The convoy system. was instituted at once
upon the outbreak of war, and one of our
eastern Canadian ports has become one of
the most important convoy assembly ports,
if flot indeed the most important, in the British

Empire. In the past eight months hundreds
of ships have been assembled in this great
natural harbour, organized into convoys, and
sailed safely across the Atlantic ocean. In
point of tonnage, some of the largest convoys
ever to sail the seas, in this or any other war,
left our eastern ports during the period when
one of the enemy's so-called pocket battieships was known to be at large in the North
Atlantic. The administrative side of the
convoy systemn is carried out by the naval
control service, and Canadian naval control
service officers and staffs are functioning at
ahl important ports in the Dominion. The
unification of control of this vast, world-wide
systema is maintained by the Admiralty, with
Naval Service Headquarters as ifs immediate
liaison on the North American continent.
Our Canadian Navy has received the highest
commendation from the British naval authorities.

Although my description of naval activities
bas been so far confined to the east coast of
Canada, to a large extent the saine may be
said for the Pacific coast, except that at

clouds appeared on the horizon. Since then
these squadrons have patrolled our coastal
waters from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and
its two entrances, from the open sea to the
southern tip of Nova Scotia. Twin-engined
bombers of great flying range, fast singleseater fighters, flying boats and pontoon
equipped machines cruise over the Atlantic
sea lanes, ready for swift action against any
enemy on surface or aloft and acting as the
eyes of our convoys and shipping off our coasts.
In the same way, on the Pacific, the Western
Air Command is engaged in the constant protection of our shores and ships at sea. At all
stations the Royal Canadian Air Force is performing its duties with skill and efficiency: as
a fighting force, on the one hand, and as the
eyes of the Navy, on the other. Its present
strength, I nay add, is over 12.000 officers and
men, and is growing rapidly. The Force also

brigade and regimental appointments were
selected solely by consideration of merit. It
was judged necessary to dispatch the division
at that time so that complementary training
could be received in a milder climate.
I might add that a division, as at present
organized, is not a fully self-contained and
self-supporting organization. The approximate
strength of the First Canadian Division is
16.000. In the field it will function as part
of an ariy corps, a formation which contains
two or more divisions and a number of supporting units which serve the corps as a whole.
These extra divisional uînits are referred to as
corps troops.
Then there are ancillary troops. In order
that the First Canadian Division may carry
its full weight in the army corps of which it
will ultimajt y forn a part, the Canadian
Governnient decided, in consultation with the
British Government, to dispateh overseas a
due proportion of corps troops, in addition to

First Canadian Division to be administered
as a Canadian entity, certain administrative
units have also been sent to Great Britain.
The total of all these extra divisional units
is betwcen six and seven thousand men. They
include mediuim and field artillery and an
artillery survey unit; engineers, signal units,
arniy service corps, ordnance corps, certain
base details, and medical and dental units.
I should mention that in this war the
counîtry's existing militia formations have
been used as the basis of recruiting men for
active service. They arc organized into eleven
territorial regiments. Our battle units actually
are the iilitia regiments, whose insignia they
wear. What is more, units have been mobilized
in siich a way that representation has been

other uînits are associated witli this army cooperation squadron in order to give representation to both Western and Eastern Canada,
and to provide for the inclusion of personnel
from both the permanent and auxiliary
branches of uir Air Force. This army cooperation squadron of the Royal Canadian Air
Force is in addition to the special Canadian
Squadron of the Royal Air Force, which has
been formed of Canadian pilots now serving
with the Royal Air Force in England.
The Second Canadian Division has been
organized for service abroad and is at present
in training in Canada. It, too, will represent
as fairly as possible our various provinces.
Tiere are also being recruited supporting
ilements
for the First Canadian Division,
whicli is now abroad. apart from the Second
Canadian Division, which is still in this
countrv.
I now come to the British Commonwealth
Air Training Plan, which will represent, perhaps, the main effort of Canada in this war.
When announcing agreement by the several
governments interested on the principle of
the proposal, the Prime Minister stated:
The Goveronient of the United Kingdom had
inlieated its opinion that with the facilities
whieh Canada possesses. this co-operative effort
mav prove to be of the miost essential and
decisive character.

MAY 21, 1940
The Prime Minister further stated, on the
17th of December last:
The United Kingdom Government had informed
us that, concerning present and future requirements, it feels that participation in an air
training scheme would provide for more effective assistance towards an ultimate victory
than any other form of military co-operation
vhich Canada could give.
The Government bas been fortunate in enlisting the services of a well-known industrialist, who volunteered to serve his country
during the war as Acting Deputy Minister
of National Defence for Air Services. I refer
to Mr. James S. Duncan, who is General
Manager of the Massey-Harris Company.
With permission of the House I will quote
some statements that were recently made by
Mr. Duncan about the British Commonwealth
Air Training Plan, as it appeared to him after
a careful study. It seems to me his views
shou-ld carry all the more weight because he is
an outsider, a prominent industrial executive
who, as Acting Deputy Minister of his department, has the. duty of examining all the
My
varions elements under his command.
right honourable friend and others who are
critical of the Government's actions may feel
that statements emanating from members of
the Government are less convincing than any
made by an outsider, like Mr. Duncan. I
feel that much of my right honourable friend's
criticism bas been based upon information
that he bas obtained from persons other
than those who are, as we say, working on the
job. He bas apparently not seen fit to go
for his information to the source of the facts,
to question the actual officials concernedsome of whom, perhaps, were appointed by
his Government-from whom be could get
first-hand knowledge, which would no doubt
completely satisfy him. So in the circumstances I think it would be well worth while
for me to rend what was said by Mr. Duncan
after be had made a study of the British
Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Speaking
at Ottawa on May 3 to the executive of the
Canadian Weekly Newspapers' Association,
he said:
I am here to tell you about one of the
greatest, perhaps the greatest task to which
Canada bas ever set ber hand . . . the British
Commonwealth Air Training Plan, with which
it is my great privilege to have become recently
associated. . .

. It

is essential that we attain

not only air equality with our enemies, but air
supremacy-supremacy in men, in aircraft, in
equipment, in training and morale.
To attain this end, it was felt that superimposed upon the greatly expanded training
effort of each of the countries concerned, a
joint effort should be made by Great Britain,
Australia, New Zealand and Canada to set up
in this Dominion facilities to train, in the
advanced stages, and in the most economic
and efficient manner, the personnel of their

31

respective air forces in order to fit them to
take up service overseas in defence of our
common beritage of freedon -and democracy.
It will provide our Empire with an everincreasing flow of highly trained pilots, air
observers, and air gunners.
Canada would have found it difficult indeed
to set in motion a training plan of such vast

proportions had it not been for the highly
competent and experienced staff officers, mostly
all of whom have graduated from the Royal
Air Force Staff College in England and who
were serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force
at the outbreak of the war, and the quality
of the officers carefully and intensively trained
under their orders during the preceding twelve
The close co-operation of Great
months.
Britain's Air Ministry, upon whose suggestions
the Joint Air Training Plan bas largely been
moulded, and the guidance and co-operation of
their officers have also proven to be of inestimable value.
The British Commonwealth Air Training Plah
lias been established upon a solid foundation.
Aerodromes are being surveyed, developed, or
are already in operation. buildings of forty
or more different types and designs are either
in the process of being constructed or already
terminated. Hangars are being erected. Sites
are being selected. Public buildings or institutions are being taken over. Thousands upon
thousands of men are at work. Every province
of the Dominion is playing its part or will be
called upon to do so. In a word, the greatest
single enterprise Canada bas ever known is
launched and well under way.
To help you visualize the proportions of this
organization, I shall ouline briefly some of the
principal units which go to make it up:
4 training commands. situated respectively
at Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, and
Regina,
2 manning depots,
20 R.C.A.F. recruiting centres,
3 initial training schools,
26 elementary flying training schools,
16 service flying training schools,
10 air observers' schools,
10 bombing and gunnery schools,
2 air navigation schools,
4 wireless schools,
4 repair depots,
4 equipment depots,
and several other important units, such as
a technical training school and air armament
school, a central flying school, etc.

In all, provision bas been made for approximately 110 formations and units which will be
established throughout the Dominion from Nova
Seotia to British Columbia, and when the
plan is in full operation, over 40,000 officers,
airmen and civilians will be required to man
the various schools, equipment depots, repair
depots. and other units.
It is well -to point ont at this stage that the
word "school" is far from representing what
is generally accepted by this term in civilian
life. Like most things connected with this enterprise, it represents something much more vast.
A service flying training school, for instance,
comprises:
(a) 3 aerodromes, situated at a distance of
between 5 and 25 miles from one another
with landing strips 3,000 feet long and
750 feet wide.
(b) 45 acres of building area.
(c) 38 buildings, including 5 hangars.
(d) A practice bombing range of a 660-yard
radius.

SENATE
Before taking up my official duties in Ottawa,
I heard much talk concerning the fact that
the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan
was not progressing as it should. I am glad
to be able to say to you, and this most emphatieally, that, quite to the contrary, great progress
has been made to date, and that the programme
is being carried out entirely in accordance with
the prescribed and pre-arranged schedule.
And I may add the pre-arranged schedule
came from Great Britain.
Since the inception of the plan, the following uits have been opened up and are in
operation:
Training comrmand headquarters, Toronto
Air armament school, Trenton
Central flying scheol, Trenton
Air navigatien school, Trenton
Service flying training school, Camp Borden
Equipment and accounting training school,
St. Thomas
Manning depot, Toronto
Technical training school, St. Thomas
Initial training school, Toronto
Equipment depot, Ottawa (being moved to
Toronto)
Equipment depot, Winnipeg
Wireless school, Montreal
Training command headquarters, Montreal
School of aeronautical engineering, Montreal
Repair depot, Trenton
School of administration, Trenton
Training command headquarters, Winnipeg
Manning depot, Brandon
A.ID. inspectors' school, Toronto.
In addition to which over 20 recruiting
depots are actually funcctioning throughout the
country.
The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan
provides for the training of many thousands
of pilots, air observers, .and air gunners eaci
year. Practically all air recruits in the United
Kingdom will be trained at home.
I draw the attention of my rigit honourable
friend to that statement.
Those from New Zealand and Australia will
receive their preliminary training in their own
country and will come to Canada to complete
their courses in our service flying training
schools, air observers' schools, bombing and gunnery schools, etc., in readiness to go overseas
with our own Canadian airmen to join the
Royal Air Force in Great Britain.
Estimates of the cost of this project are naturally subject to wide variations, but the total
cost of the entire programme up to the expiration of the agreement on March 31, 1943, is
expected to approximate $600,000,000. and
Canada's share of the expenditure will be
around $350,000,000.
Canada will, of course. bear the whole burden
of the initial and elementary training because
these services will be exclusively devoted to
the training of ber own men.
A supervisory board meets in Ottawa at frequent intervals under the chairmanship of the
Minister of National Defence. The other members of the Board are the Minister of Finance,
the Minister of Transport, the High Commissioner of Great Britain. the High Commissioner of Australia, a representative of New
Zealand, the Deputy Minister of National Defence for Air Services, the Chief of the Air
Staff, and the financial and technical advisers
of the various governments concerned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Among -the many factors which have contributed to the successful planning and the
remarkable progress made by the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan since its inception, one should especially mention the quality,
ability, and experience of the splendid staff of
officers of the Royal Canadian Air Force, of
which we are all so justly proud.
There are these further remarks by Mr.
Duncan:
We should mention the splendid co-operation
of the Department of Transport, inder the
dynamic leadership of the Hon. C. D. Howe,
who iiot only bas placed at our disposal the
facilities of the Trans-Canada Air Lines,I may say the Trans-Canada Air Lines are
practically the creation of Mr. Howe.
-but
the highly trained executives of his
department, who have co-operated with us in
the selection, surveying, and development of
aerodroie sites throughout the Dominion.
As an outsider wholias suddenly been interjected into this plan, I marvel at the work
which lias been accomplislsed, at the knowledge
and resourcefulness displayed by the vast body
of carefully selected officers, operating under
the outstanding leadership of Air Vice-Marshal
Croil, and above all, at the spirit of selfsacrifice and devotion to duty which exists
amongst all those who are co-operating in the
development of this tremendous enterprise.
I think this commendation by Mr. James S.
Duncan is worth presenting to honourable
members.
I will add these further details of the acreplane work at present under way in Canada,
giving the names of the companies to which
contracts have been awarded. These contracts
may be divided into three cateories: Canadian Government contracts; British Government contracts; British Commonwealth Air

National Steel Car Corporation Limited.
Ottawa Car and Aircraft Limited.
Canadian Vickers Limited.

The work on the 80 Hampdens is subcontracted to the six parent companies and the
work at St. Hubert, P.Q., and Malton, Ontario,
consists only of the assembly of the aircraft.
At the present time preliminary work is
being carried out by these companies for the
manufacture of 130 Stirling aireraft, a very
large 4-engine bomber.
This contract is
expected to total between $30,000,000 and
$40,000,000 and is expected to follow the
Hampden contract. The component companies
have begun the manufacture of tools for making
Stirling aircraft.
Negotiations by the Canadian Associated
Aireraft are carried on direct with the British
Air Ministry and its operations are conducted
solely in accord with British requirements.
The companies listed in the foregoing summary are the larger aircraft manufacturers
in the Dominion. In addition there are a
variety of industrial companies which are now
producing aircraft parts and equipment in
co-operation with the aireraft companies.
The following companies are solely engaged
in assembly aircraft engines in Canada:
Canadian Pratt & Whitney Limited.
Canadian Wright Limited.
All the contracts on behalf of the Canadian
Government and the B.C.A.T.P. have been
aw.arded by the Department of Munitions and
Supply and its predecessor purchasing organizations.
The production of planes in Canada since
the outbreak of war has totalled approximately

It is now rcalized-in. May, 1940-that the

the total of our war expenditures during the

Constant study given to tbe increased use of
Canadian materials in the production of

On the very day when war was declared by
Great Britain, the Government hastened to
appoint a War-time Prices and Trade Board
-under the chairmanship of Hon. Mr. MeLarty.
It was compoged of very able men from the
Governinent service.
It had to direôt its
energies towards the prevention of profiteerlng, uf hoarding, and of any undue enhancement in the prices of the necessaries of life.

The board bas now been funetioning regularly since its appointment. I that time it
bas maintained the distribution of the necessaries -of lufe 'at fair and reasonable prices. If

commodities, a few of the more important
ones, by way of illustration, being wool,
leather, coal, bc-ans and sugar.
The work wbich this board bas performed

cati perhaps be best illustrated by the action
taken in the case of sugar. Before the board
bad been appointed the run on sugar had
commenccd.
Housewives were protecting
themselves against the anticipated rise. Between twenty-five and thirty million pounds
of sugar were remnoved from circulation. Complaints came pouring in by the thousands. The
board summnoned the sugar refiners, who, agreed
to increase by 25 per cent their normal release in September, without any increase in
price. The board made a wide inspection of
the retail stores, which were selling the sugar
as rapidly us tbey could receive it. Apprehensivc' bousewives kept buying. In the Okanagan
Valley sugar was wanted to save from rot
two thousand cars of fruit. The sugar was
furnished. Two hundred beekeepers tbreat-

ened t0 destroy their colonies of bees if not;
supplied with sugar. They got the sugar.
Manufacturers, large and small, would have
had to close their doors if they had no sugar.
They were furnished witb sugar.
The board then appealed f0 the refiners and
to several large industrial users of sugar, wbo
made a generous response. September alone

'absorbed. forty million pounds of sugar above
normal consumption.
On the 3rd of October, 1939, the board
appointed Mr. S. R. Noble as Sugar Administrator. To prevent a panic, Mr. Noble and
the board rccommended a temporary suspension of the dumping duty on refined sugar.
This recommendation wvas carried out. The
board appcaled to the British Sugar Controller. who was then about to purchase ail
the raw sugar grown in the British Empire.
Tbrough tic Britisb Sugar Controller, Canada got in ifs iaw sugar requirements of
450 tons a year, at practically pre-war prices.
We cati now look forward f0 a reasonable
stabilization of sugar prices for the durafion of the war.
At the saine fime the board lias had to
deal with other commodifies, one of the most
important being wool. It succeeded in that
field as well as with stigar. Without the intervention of the board the price of wool
would have risen f0 unprecedenf cd heights.
Sugar and wool are cif cd f0 illustrate the
funictioning of the Wartime Prices and Trade
B3oard.
Many other exemples could be
brought forward.
Hon. Mr. McLarty, in bis broadcast staf ement in December lest, touched upon an

SENATE
aspect of the activities of the board, which is
of considerable importance. He concluded
his statement with the following remarks:
The experience of the last war clearly demonstrates that higli prices, high w-ages, high costs
-produced by the artificial stimulus of warhave a very definite and very painful reaction
wien we return to the normal and unstimulated
economie levels.
One of the main purposes whieh this board
will serve is this: by maintenance cf fair and
reasonable prices during the war-time period,
we shall not wear the false face of false prosperity during that period on the one hand; on
the other hand. we shahl net have to endure
the severe pains of economie contraction.
While the board may be fairly regarded as a
board to protect consumers, its influence should
be much wider than that. It will be of advantage to our wage-earners in maintaining a
sound basis of the cost of living and in mainIt
taining real as against nominal wages.
will b of advantage to our producers in the
stabilizing of the prices of their products and
in eliminating the unfortunate and precipitate
fall which inevitably follows an unregulated
advance. It will be of advantage te all our
citizens in that its tendency is to bring order
out of chaos and stability out of confusion.
Such interferences with normal life as have
been set up are to the end that all of our
resources may be marshalled and ordered and
made available where and when they are needed
the most, and such control is also for this purpose and to this end-that at a time when our
enemies, who have sworn our destruction, stand
in arms .against us no one within our own
gates shall be allowed te wax fat on his
couîntry's necessity; no one shall be permitted
to make greedy gain out of our common need.
Apart from the important mandates given
to the various boards and departments which
I have mentioned, I must add that the Government was faced with the problem of maintaining and organizing the production and
marketing of foodstuffs generally, and of
solving the difficulties arising out of the dislocation of the markets for Canadian foodstuffs, due to the war. Three departmentsTrade and Commerce, Agriculture, and
Fisheries-have co-operated in this work.
Existing agencies of the Government, such as
the Canadian Wheat Board and the Salt Fish
Board, have also assisted the Government, as
has the Bacon Board, which administers the
Bacon Agreement entered into with the United
Kingdom.
In nearing the close of my remarks I may
be permitted to give a summary of additional
measures. In view of the critical turn of
events in Europe during the past few days,
and in the light of the information obtained
by the Minister of National Defence -on his
recent visit to England, the Canadian Government have decided:
To advance the date of the dispatch overseas of the Second Division of the Canadian
Active Service Force.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

To advance the date of the dispatch of such
further reinforcements of the First Division as
have not already proceeded overseas.
To push forward the recruiting of reinforcements for the Second Division of the Canadian
Active Service Force, who will follow the
division overseas at the earliest possible date.
To form a Canadian Corps in the field, in
accordance with arrangements which have been
discussed with the British War Office. Besides
the two divisions and 'their ancillary units, the
corps will include the necessary additional
corps troops and will involve the dispatch
overseas of several thousand men, beyond
those already mentioned.
To undertake the raising of a Third Division, to be available for such service as may
be required in Canada, or overseas.
To assign, at the request of the Government
of the United Kingdom, certain naval and
military formations to active duty in the
Caribbean and North Atlantic areas.
To dispatch overseas No. 112 Army Cooperation Squadron, to act as a reserve for
No. 110 Co-operation Squadron, now overseas.
To adopt every feasible method of accelerating the output of pilots and air crews from
Canada, for service in the field at the earliest
possible date. Certain methods have already
been formulated by the Canadian Government
both to accelerate and to supplement the Joint
Air Training Plan in Canada, in order that
pilots, observers and air gunners may be made
available more quickly for active service.
Steps have been taken in order to expedite
the preparation of aerodromes and hangers.
To confer upon the Ministry of Munitions
and Supply certain special powers which
would not be accorded in normal times, to
enable it to expedite the provision of equipment and materials of war, for the armed
forces.
These decisions are being translated into
action.
The measures announced to-day are in
addition to the vigorous conduct of the Canadian war effort, already under way, in the
military, naval and air spheres, and on the
economic front.
Inasmuch as the Minister of Finance will
have to submit to Parliament the ways and
means to finance this increased expenditure, I
have obtained an estimate of expenditures
for the fiscal year 1940-41, which I shall impart to the Senate. The total expenditure for
all purposes is estimated at over $1,150,000,000,
or more than $3,000,000 a day. Ordinary and
special expenditure for other than war purposes is estimated at approximately $450,000,000. War expenditure is estimated at over
$700,000,000, or almost $2,000,000 a day. This

MAY 21, 1940
is already revised upwards from $500,0000,000,
as estimated by the Minister of Finance on
February 19, and is subject to further upward
revision. The actual war expenditure for
1915-1916 was $166,000,000.
I could perhaps continue with some further
details. The actual cash disbursements for
the first eight months of the war are more
than double those in the last war. Some of the
factors increasing Canada's war costs are the
following: (1) No air force, no air training in
the last war. (2) Increased naval expenditures: the estimate for 1940-1941 is more
than thirty times the actual expenditure for
1915-1916, and more than three times the
whole naval expenditure in the last war.
(3) The cost per man of maintaining an army
division has almost doubled since the last
war.
Conditions have changed since 1914. There
is now no United States borrowing, because
of neutrality legislation. There is no United
Kingdom borrowing. Instead, Canada is repaying the United Kingdom loan to provide
Canadian dollars for British purchases in this
country.
Now I revert to the remarks of my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen),
who vehemently condemned the dissolution of
Parliament in January and the appeal to the
people by the Government. He knew full well
that the session beginning in January was to
be followed by an election. The Prime Minister had announced that. And the Prime
Minister stated, just before or at the time of
dissolution, that he would have dissolved the
House the day after the Ontario Legislature
passed a condemnatory resolution, if he had
not promised Hon. Dr. Manion that there
would be no dissolution before Parliament
met.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That was
not his promise at all. I have it right here,
and shall read it to my honourable friend:
As to the question of a general election
before another session, my honourable friend
has been kind enough to say that I told him
some time ago I would not think of anything
of the kind or countenance it.
We had a session, had we?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my right
honourable friend will allow me to add an
explanation, he will understand why that
statement was made. It was made because
Hon. Dr. Manion was afraid there would be
dissolution before he had time to visit Canada
from the Atlantic to the Pacifie. I speak
whereof I know, for I was in daily contact
with the Government and the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister had promised Dr. Manion

37

that there should be no surprise dissolution,
that there should be no dissolution before the
House met. The House metRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He did not
say " before the House met."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, but I am
explaining that the reason for his statement
was a conversation with Dr. Manion, wherein
Dr. Manion said he was desirous of co-operating, but did not want to be taken by surprise,
and asked whether he could be assured there
should be no dissolution. And the Prime
Minister said there should be no dissolution
before a session. Then, a session having been
called, and there having been no dissolution
in the meantime, the Prime Minister's promise
bad been fulfilled. He then arranged for
immediate dissolution. Hon. Dr. Manion
was thereby given two extra months, from that
time up to the 26th of March, to carry on his
campaign throughout the country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Surely the
honourable gentleman does not think the
rights of this House depend upon some private
conversation between the Prime Minister
and Dr. Manion. We have the word of the
Prime Minister of Canada in Hansard, and
that word he broke.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have told of
the statement that was made between man
and man. My right honourable friend says
we had the word of the Prime Minister. But
what harm did the Prime Minister do to the
Senate of Canada, or to my right honourable
friend?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He did more
harm to himself, I admit. He broke his word
to the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
word given to the Senate.

It was not a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
promise to the country.

It was a

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend bas a right to say, "As a
member of Parliament I was called here, and
shortly after the Speech from the Throne was
delivered immediate dissolution was announced." He has a right to ask, " Why did
you bring me here to listen to the Governor
General, and then dissolve?" Well, it is the
prerogative of the Prime Minister to do so,
and he did so for a very good reason, a
paramount reason.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
nothing better than a poor excuse.

He

had

38

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He realized that
Parliament and his colleagues would be held
up in the House of Cemmons for three
months, prevented from attending to their
work, while the Opposition, who knew there
would he an election-the Prime Minister
having said so-were trying to find an issue
upon which to go before the people. So the
Prime Minister, having the fui! responsibility
of carrying on the affairs of the country,
decided it would flot bo in the best interest
of Canada that this should happen. When
the session wvas calicd I myseif f'eit that lIon.
Dr. Manion wouid ho in a very difficuit position: that, having nothing to compiain of,
and being satisfied with the work of the
Government, lie wouid be iooking for some
difference, seine issue whieh hoe couid presenit
to the people. I knew hie eould not êind any
practicai and serions point of dispute with
the Government, and that hoe and bis foliowers would try to keep the House in session
for three months, during which time they
Nvouid bc franking their speeches through
the mails. Had they got their way, the
members of the Cabinet would have been
kept aw9y from important duties during ai]
that tirno. Thon there wouid have been an
eleetion caînipaign, lasting two months. That
would have meant five months during which
the Ministers responsihle for carrying on the
government of the country wvouid have been
hamnpered in their work. Well, the Primo
Minister decided that three months' timo
could he saved by going before the people at
once. And it was ail the more important
that lie shouid do so, while tho miiitary situation in Europe wvas comparatively quiet.
The, Prime Minister ivent to the people, and
I w.înt to tell my righit honourable friend that
thec elcei ion caml)aign did not in any way
paralyse the Govcrnment. I asked the Clerk
off the Privy Couincil how rnany sittings of
the Couincil were hcld from dissolution te the
25th of Mai-eh, and bis answcr ivas that we
had iîad in that time eighteen Counicil meetings and îiassed 826 Orders in Council and
453 Trcasury Board minutes. I know something of wiîat I amn talking about, becauise I
had te coic here te mneetings. Not only did
Couîicil function efficiently, but ahl our war
boards were working liard.
My riglît lionourable friend says that the
calling of the election killod the wvar spirit
in tlîis country. \Vell, I disagree with that
statemient. There are tîvo ways in which the
feeling cf our people may be tested. In the
fir-t place, the cail to our young mon te serve

had the war spirit when, in response to a
request from the Minister of Finance for
$200,00,0O0, they subscribed
$300,000,O00.
Those two tests indicate t.hat the war spirit in
this country is alive.

Hon. Mr. KING: A War-time Elections
Act? No 1
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There still is
eaough water in the canal to receive me
before such legisiation would have my support.
When the then Government had thus
broken the morale of its opponents and
held them at its mercy, it obtained some
accessions to its ranks. Sir Wilfrid Laurier
said to me: "With such legisiation on the
Statuite Book, we need not go to the people.
The election iq settled. Ballot box stuffing
and ballot switching are sanctioned."l
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
honourable friend allow me?

WilI my

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course my
right honourablc friend benefited by that
legislation, and he is surprised that I stili feel
the pinch.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
apology whatover for the legisiation, notwithstanding the misrepresentations of it by my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Weil, I can say
to my right honourable friend that if he
thinks he was rejected three times by the
province of Queboc because of conscription,
he is wrong. He was rejected hecause of what
was called that " infamous Iegislation," the
War-time Elections Act and the Military
Voters Act. If ho had gone to the people
with a referendumi on conscription and the
people had docided by a majority in favour
of it, the province of Quebec would have
obeyed the Iaw. But he and his Government
did not dare to rely upon a referendum, even
in Ontario, because thousands and thousands
of Ontario farmers did not want their sons
to be conscripted.
My right honourable friend says, "You
have cxtinguiýshed the war spirit in the country
by going to the people as one party, instead
of doing as we did in 1917 and forming a
Union Government." I have stated how the
Conservative Goverament in 1917, after having
brokea the morale of its opponeots and
made it impossible for them to ho returned
unless they supported the Government,
succceded in attracting some members fromý

the ranks of the Liberal party. But the socalled Union Government went to the people
and split the country asunder. I said on the
floor of the Sonate in 1918 or 1919-my words
may be found in Hansard-that on a propor
franchise not one Tory would bo roturned

from the province of Quebec.

And in 1921

not a single member of my right honourablo

friead's party was returaod in that province.

39

The samo was truc in Nova Scotia and in the
Western Provinces. And my right honourable
friend's once proud party presented scareely
a candidate in my province in the last election,
most of the Government's opponents having
heon known as National Govorameat candidates.
I desire now to revort to a remark made by
my right honourable friend. Ho said that the
British Government neyer approached the
Dominion with a straight proposal which
might ho rojocted by a stcrn negativo. I
know that in the past the reputation of the
British Govornment for diplomacy was of the
highost.

I amrn ot spoaking of the last years.

They have a splendid civil service, and its
members know that a direct question may
entait a direct nogative, and theroforo they
bogin by sounding a Dominion. If there is
virtue in such a proceeding-and I think
thero is-I ask my right honourable friend
whether there is flot like virtue in the mothod
of the Prime Ministor of a Dominion who,
when approached under such circumstancos, bas
to sec that some alternative proposition may be
made before ho says no. Perhaps my right
honourable friead will find that when he was
pressing for an answor to the question, 'Have
there beon approaches or conversations by the
British Government on this matter?" the
Prime Minister considorod it good policy for
the Dominion of Canada to adopt the method
of the British Government: instoad of horalding to the people and to Parliament perhaps a
differonce of opinion which could be ironed out,
ho was asking my right honourable friend to
please stay bis hand, as matters boing discussod
needod to bc treated with some dolicacy in
order that a solution might be reachoed. The
righlt honourable gentleman had the answors
that came through me f rom the Prime Ministor.
Ho should realize, sioco he recognizes that the
British Governmont nover approach a Dominion with a blunt question which might caîl
for a nogative, that in adopting a similar
policy the Dominion could and ahuuld have
somo leoway to open a discussion with the
Imperial authorities .As
a matter of fact,
such was the case, and a few days afterwards,
in the British House of Commons, the Minister said, " Wc are highly plcased with the
proposaI of the Prime Ministor of Canada."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend takes that stand because he is
prejudiced and it pleases him to take it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; because
a Minister of the Crown of Great Britain said
they were over.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was not the
Minister of Air. He, on the 7th of July, said,
"I have received an offer from the Canadian
Government." I think that offer was based
on a statement made on the lst of July by the
Prime Minister in the House of Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was not.
The statement I read was by Mr. Stanley. He
said the negotiations were over.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right lionourable friend devoted a half lueur of his
speech te an apparent difference of opinion
with tbe British Government in June of 1938.
It seems to me that in order to maike some
constructive proposition ta this House he
should have swept aside all these matters.
They were discussed on every platforn before
the peopleSome Hon, SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -and the people
declared: "No. We are satisfied with the
present Governînent." Now my right honourable friend says, "I am not looking for political
preferment, I am not seeking responsibility,
but I tell the leader of the Government that
his Government must draw into their ranks
men from all parties, so that the whole country
wxill stand behind them." I tell him that most
of those men, men of importance in the
country, are working as dollar-a-year men on
many of these boards, and that all the leading
men in Canadian industry are at the disposal
of the Government. W/ben I look around the
Council table, having myself no department to
administer, I reflect that as an independent
witness I am free to judge the actions of the
heads of departments who form the Cabinet,
and I am astounded at the amount of work
which they regularly perfori and which comes
for examination before Couneil. I have described te you this evening a small part of
their activities. It will be readily understood
why I smile when I hear some self-appointed
critics-of course, I am not thinking of my
right honourable friend-in the press and elsewhere declare with an air of authority that the
Iight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

present Governrment is incapable of the task
it is attempting. Wbat marvellous leaders
those self-appointed crities would be if the
country only allowed them to settle all its
problems and direct its war activities! Luckily
for the country, the people have judged otherwise.
Honourable senHon. J. J. HUGHES:
ators, the speech with which lis Excellency
the Administrator opened Parliament, and
which we are now considering, naturally
dwells at considerable length on the perturbed
state of the world and the terrible wars now
raging and threatened. As I stated in my brief
remarks during the special session of Parliament in September last, this dreadful state
of affairs did not come about by accident, for
there is no such thing as blind chance. "Not
a sparrow falls to the ground without your
lavenly Father's knowledge and consent."
Hence there is a cause, and the cause is in
proportion to the results.
The last paragraph in the Speech from the
Throne on the 25th of January last reads as
follows:
Honourable Meibers of thie Senate:
Menbers of the House of Commons:
In all that pertains to the discharge of your
iesponsible duties, nay Divine Providence be
your strength and guide.
And on the 16th of this month the Administrator savs:
I pray that Divine Providence nay guide
and bless your deliberations.
These are solemn, pregnant words, addressed
directly to the members of Parliament, and
indirectly to the people of Canada, and I
must assume that the men who penned them
and the men who read them fully realized
their importance. Now, who and what is this
Divine Providence that is asked to be our
strength and guide, and to bless us in our
deliberations? If Christianity be truc, it is
not blind, impersonal force. It is the supreme,
infinite, eternal Intelligence: the Creator and
Preserver of all things, Who was manifested
in the person of one of our race, the Lord
Jesus Christ. This same Christ declared,
"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life";
and at another time and in another place,
"Without Me you can do nothing." As I
sec it, it is the denial and the wilful misapprehension of these transcendental truths
that are the cause of all our troubles. In my
feeble way I shall try to explain, and if Christianity be true the effort cannot be wrong.
In this connection plain speaking is surely
desirable.
Two nations, notably Russia and Germany,
led by Stalin and Hitler, have nationally and
officially denied Christ and His teaching;

MAY 21, 1940
therefore they typify anti-Christ. Hence the
war betwveen Christ and anti-Christ is on as
it never has been before, and its ground-work
was flot laid yesterday for yesteryear. This
is flot merely a war between human beings
as such; it is a war between powers and priacipalities, and many invisible agencies are at
work. It is flot confined to actual combat in
the air and actual conflict on and under
the land and the sea. It is being waged
on a thousand other fronts, and by a thousand
other forces as well. AIl this I shaîl try to
explain.
A year or two ago every English-language
newspaper in Canada that I saw-and 1 saw
most of them-commended in the strongest
terms a book that had been written by
Dr. Thomas Mann, called "The Coming
Victory of Demoeracy." The Ottawa Journal
was most eulogistic of this book, and this
caused me to read it. From my point of
view, there were many defeets in it, but
its greatest defect was its practical ignoring
of Gcod in Ris dealings with mankind, and its
studied elimination of ail idea of Jesus Christ
and Ris teaching in regard to the affairs of
this world. Dr. Mann practieally put the
form of government called "Democracy" in
God's place by saying in effeet that if ahl
nations adopted that form the troubles of the
world would be solved.
A littie Inter The Journal had a well
written editorial under the caption, "Are We
Losing the Essentials?"
This caused me
to write to that newspaper a letter saying that
the culogies which Dr. Mann's book had
received from the English-language newspapers of Canada were the best possible proof
that we had already, in large mensure, lost
the greatest of the essentinîs, namely, explicit
belief in the Deity *of the Lord Jesus
Christ.'
The Journal publishied this letter, but deleted
frorn it all reference to Jesus as God. I then
wrote another letter, complaining of the
deletion. This The Journal refused to publish, but courteously returned me the manuscript with the following written explanation:
Ottawa, Canada,
May 4, 1939.
Hon. J. J. Hughes,
The Senate,
Ottawa.
Dear Sir:
The Journal asks to be excused f rom printing
the enclosed. It does not wish to get into a
religions controversy. The reference made in
your first letter to which you refer was deleted
because Dr. Mann is a Jew.
So it amounts to this. In the opinion of
The Ottawa Journal, reference to Jesus Christ
es God would be likely to evoke opposition
and start -a religious controversy, and might
offend Dr. Mann and others. If a choice had
to be made between Jesus Christ and Dr.

41

Mann, Jesus had to take second place. If
this is not, a fairly pronounced form of
Hitlerism and Stalinism, I should like to know
what At is. One thing I do know: if the Bible
be true, this thing is not Christianity. Now,
the Ottawa Journal is a sane, respectable,
well-conducted secular newspaper, as newspapers go, and in my view is a good representative of the English-speaking secular press
and of the public opinion of Canada in most
non-political matters. And this is supposed
to be a Christian country in the twentieth
century!
The Bible and -the Church are my authorities for saying that when Jesus Christ was
bodily present on this earth He declared, "I
arn the Way, the Truth, and the Life," and in
another place, "Without Me you can do nothing." If these words came from the lips
of God Almighty we cannot ignore them without taking the risk of losing everything for
which we were created. On the other hand, if
they came from the lips of a mere human
being like one of ourselves, he was a crazy
man, and the Bible is worse than a book of
fables. This would make of Christianity the
greatest imposition that ever ivas foisted on
m'ankind. Under such circumstances, Hitlerism
and Stalinism might be right, and, if so, should
not be opposed.
If Jesus Christ was and is God, any form
of government with Him will give good results, and no form of goverfiment without Him
will be either permanent or beneficial. Therefore, Dr. Mann's book, "The Coming Victory
of Democracy," 'and aIl the newspapers that
went into ecstasies over it are on the wrong
track, and have some responsibility for the
spread of Ilitlerism, and particularly for the
spread of Stalinism.
The Mann famîly are, however, still at
work. In 1938 two of Dr. Mann's children,
Erica and Klaus, wrote a book called "Escape
To Life," which was published in 1939, a f ew
months before the present war began in

MAY 21, 1940
Virgin Birth and the bodily Resurrection of
our Saviour, thus declaring a fundamental
doctrine of Christianity to be an open question
-a mere opinion-in the Anglican Communion. I shall not attempt to comment on this.
It is so serious a matter that, in my view,
it necd only be stated. Our Saviaur said,
"He that is not with Me is against Me,
and ho that gathereth not with Me, scattereth."
If the Holy Ghost were guiding these bishops
they would ho in no doubt as to what to
bolieve and to teaeh. And the Holy Ghost
is, and bas been since the first Pentecost
Sunday, guiding the Church that Jesus Christ
founded.
Now, it is surely apparent to every thinkîng
mmnd that thore must ho a cause behind al
this spiritual confusion which prevails in
Christendom, and I think that cause is what
is known as " private or personal interpretation." This principle bas divided Christendom
into a lhundred and more denomînations or
sects, many of thorn strongly diffcring from
onc another even in essentials. A prominent
clergyman in Great Britain, Dr. Oldham by
namo, writes that the intra-denominational
differences are even greater than the interdenominational disputes. And, by the way,
Rev. Dr. Oldham did a great deal of preparatory work for the conference of the nonCatholic Christian and other churches of the
world, which was held at Oxford, England,
in the summer of 193,7. H1e was one of its
socretaries. Ho wrote a book in which he
deplored the doctrinal differences among the
denominations and exprossed the hope that
the thon coming conference would heal
thcm, but on another page of the same hook
ho statod, " These differences are in many
instances the resuit of the variety of finite
minds, and arc conscquently an enrichment of
the Christian fellowship, inasmuch as they
add to the fullness of apprehended truth'
So there you are; make what you like of
that. According to Dr. Oldham, the intra-and inter-denoininational differences are both
bad things and good things at the same time.
This state of spiritual confusion cannot ho in
conformity with God's will. It is not the resuit
of Christ's earnest and beseeching prayor for
the unity of spiritual belief among Ris
followers.
This principle of " private or personal
interpretation " has destroyed the Bible, so
far as man can dcstroy it, and bas injured
the Church, so far as man can injure it. Many
ýof the evangelical denominations, realizing the
terrible confusion in the spiritual order, hold
from time to time ivorld-wide conventions of
the non-Catholic C'hristian and other churches,
to heal if possible these divisions. However,
these well-meaning
but bewildered
men

43

soparate without doing anything more than
passing a f ew pious, platitudinous recommendations and making a f ew confused

reports. Nothing more can ho done while
the principlo of "private interpretation "
prevails. As already stated, one sucb conferonce was held at Oxford, England, in the
summer of 1937. There was another at Edinburgh, Scotland, a montb or two later, and
still another at Madras, India, in 1939. These
conventions might as well try to stop the
turning of the earth on its axis as to stop the

multiplication of now donominations, or to
heal the differonces in the old ones, while
the principle 1 have alluded to romains. Man
cannot accomplisb what to bim is impossible.
Nevertheless, these conferences and thoso
pious, platitudinous rocommendations do some
good. They serve to keep alive fragments of
the heliefs which have come down to us

from the centuries wbon Christendom was
practically united, so far as the faith was
concerned, and this is a contribution that
is not to ho despised.
Earlier in mv remarks I ventured to inquire
ivhether a large part of Christendom bad not
at some time or other committed saine great
fauît, or adopted some erroneous principle
that prevcnted it from reasoning logically in
spiritual things. As 1 se0 it, only sometbing
of that kind would account for the prosent
condition of Christendom, which is poorly
equipped to meet what are called Stalinism
and Hitlcrism. If my roasonings and conclusions ho correct, this spiritual darkness is
a worse affliction and a greater menace than
tle dre-adful wars now raging.
Ia fact it
may ho the cause of these wars, because, in
the last analysis, the spiritual dominates and
controls the temporal. And if this idea ho
correct, only H1e who said, "Let there be
light," and at whose command light was made,
can bring peace to this distractcd world.
Perbaps I sbould not close withouit referring
ta the lcading article in the Atlantic Monthly
for Decemhpr last, entitled, " The Man Who
Gave Us Christmas," by Winifred Kirkland.
Mrs. or Miss Kirkland says in polished
language that the man was Luke the Evangelist, and she thus rolog-ates Josus Christ to
sccond, or third, or fourth place, and in the
end to oblivion. This shows the determined
efforts that -are being made, in a large part
of Christendom. ta take Christ out of Christmias. and ont of evcrything else, ta reduce
Him to the lovol of a more man, and ta
convert the Day of Days into an ordinary
secular holiday. If this kind of thing continues ta grow, as it bas grown during the
hast quadrennium in the
English-speaking
and the German-speaking worlds, Jesus Christ
will soon have no place at ail in the sohieme

SENATE
of things. And, God help us, it is the secalled intellectuals in both the spiritual and
temporal spheres who are doing this work. In
this connection every true Christian in the
world must view with alarm the recent
appointment of that shameless, immoral pagan,
Bertrand Russell, to the chair of philosophy
in the City College of New York, and the
atheistical action of "The American Civil
Liberties Union" in regard thereto.
This
appointment and the support it bas received in
the name of civil liberty, together with his
more recent appointment te a chair of
philosophy in Harvard, are most disturbing
indications of the trend of the times, and are
a terrible warning to western civilization, both
spiritual and material.
One other thing, which arrested my attention
a few months ago. An editorial in the Montreal
Daily Star of December 6 last was headed,
"Federation as Europe's Best Post-War Way
of Escape." My comment on that is this.
If we had not lost the true Christian conception of life and its meaning, or if we fully
realized God's purpose in making this planet
our habitation for a little while, surely we
should say that a return to Jesus Christ, as
Creator and Sovereign Lord of Heaven and
earth and of all things, would be Europe's
and the world's best post-war way of escape.
But whether we say it or not, tirer( will tell at
least the few that it is the only way. Will
these few ever become the majority of mankind? Is it a dream to think so? Will the
time ever come, even in North America, when
the influential writers, readers, publishers,
preachers and teachers, will know that belief
in the Deity of Jesus Christ is the foundation
of everything that matters in the realms of
faith and morals? Let us at least cherish the
hope that that day will come. Otherwise there
is no such thing as peace for this weary world.
I will now draw to a close by repeating some
of the words spoken by the Ring in his Christmas broadcast:
I said to a man who stood at the gate of the
year, "Give mue a light that I may tread safely

into the unknown," and he replied, "Go out into
the darkness and put your hand into the band
of God. That shall be to you better than light
and safer than the known way."
The last sentence, I think, should read as
follows: "That shall be to you better than any
artificial light and safer than any known human
way." Tho sentence as it was broadcast by
His Majesty, and as it has been published in
the newspapers, is bad theology, but is a
good illustration of the bewildered spiritual
thought of the age, the thought of millions
of professing Christians in large parts of
Christendom. We may well say that the night
is dark and long. Also we are far from home,
much farther than the Prodigal ever was, and
Iton.

Mr.

IIUGIES.

far from the end of this Armageddon, which
is a manifestation of God's just wrath upon
a sinful earth. I do not know when this war
will end, but, being a Christian, I know how
i will end. God will not be dispossessed of
the world which He created, by anything that
man, prompted by Satan, can do. And a
whole-hearted return to Jesus Christ by the
professing Christians of even the democratie
countries would hasten the war's end, because
it would mean a whole-hearted effort to destroy
the forces of evil in the world.

IMMIGRATION FROM BRITAIN
AND FRANCE
On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, there is a matter which
may be worth while mentioning. I should
think it not impossible that from now on
there will be numbers of young people of
Great Britain and France who desire to come
to this Dominion. I just wish to express the
hope, in which I have not the least reason to
think the Government would not concur, that
our gates will be thrown open without reservation to such persons if they have the approval
of their respective governments.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I will make
it my duty to convey that statement, with
the hope expressed by my right honourable
friend, to the Ministers concerned.
THE ADMINISTRATOR'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Administrator's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Paterson for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, in rising to take part in this debate,
I can assure you that I shall not be long.
Mr. Speaker, will you first allow me to
congratulate you upon your elevation from
the ranks to the first office of this House?

MAY 22, 1940
Let me also congratulate the mover of the
motion (Hon. Mr. Paterson). In the part of
the country that I come from, if you know
anybody at all you know N. M. Paterson,
because you see his name well advertised all
over Manitoba, indeed from Western Ontario
to the borders of the Rocky Mountains, in
large letters which everybody can see.
I have not had the pleasure and honour of
meeting the seconder of the motion (Hon.
Mr. Blais), but I congratulate him also on
his speech. If a senator in his sophomore
term-following university custom, I am calling myself a sophomore, as we are now
beginning the second Parliament since my
appointment to the Senate-if I may, in ail
humility, say a word to a new member, it
would be this: I do not think he should
indulge in such laudatory references to the
two gentlemen whom he mentioned, because
I am one of those who are persuaded that
before the treaty of peace is signed a considerable quantity of water will have run
under the bridge.
I am delighted, as I think all honourable
members are, at the clear thinking of the right
honourable leader of the Opposition in this
House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
Also,
we are always delighted to hear one who
seems to typify a gentleman of France speak
on behalf of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). I do not know what a gentleman
of France is like, but from what I have read
in the pages of French history I think the
honourable gentleman would qualify for that
category.
I do not intend to discuss at this time the
late election. If I did. I might be able to
suggest-again in all humility-what was the
motive power behind the flood of votes in
one direction. Time alone will reveal the
inside story. I may be in a minority in the
view I am about to express, but I am persuaded that the avalanche of votes in favour
of the Government was not due to the cause
stated in the press, -the desire to get on with
the war. When peace is restored Canada will
take stock of what the present Government
did in this great crisis, and at the next election
the people will deliver judgment.
In my opinion, the issue uppermost in the
mind of every thinking Canadian, whether
he dwell on the Prairies, on our Atlantic or
Pacific coast, or on the banks of the St.
Lawrence, is: What are we as a nation doing
to-day when the Hun is hammering at our
gates? Have we in the front lines in France
any men, any tanks, any aeroplanes to help
stay the German hordes and so protect Canada? Some of us go so far as to picture the
day when we may have to rely on the
American nation to the south for the preserva-

45

tion of our national life. It may be said that
I am pessimistic. Well, if a week ago anyone had told us that in about a fortnight the
Hun would be at the Channel ports, we should
have regarded him as crazy. To-day the
people of Canada are worrying about what
this Parliament is doing to meet that menace,
and I am eonvinced that they will hold not
only the Government, but, worse luck, the
members of both Houses, responsible for any
failure to throw the full weight of Canada
into this momentous struggle.
The Government, according to the speech
which the honourable leader of the House
delivered to us yesterday, have planned for
a long war, a war in which finance and aviation and other factors would play a great part.
That plan may become effective in 1941 or
1942 or 1943, but by that time the Hun may
be on the St. Lawrence river.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend allow me to point out that he is
slightly in error in stating that the present
Government had planned for a three-year war
according to the schedule prepared for the
Commonwealth or British air plan. I may
tell him officially that that plan and schedule
came from Great Britain. We have gone
somewhat in advance of the schedule. My
honourable friend will therefore understand
that the plan visualizing a long war comes
from London.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I remind my honourable friend that in 1938 his Government
did not take dictation from London or from
any other source, and I am surprised at the
sudden change of front for the purpose of
evading responsibility. No, the Government
must take full responsibility and stand by
their programme for a long war. It makes no
difference what the British Government suggested should be done.
In 1938 the Government of Canada refused
to accept certain suggestions of the British
Government, and that decision will be reviewed by future generations. This Government must take full responsibility for the
present war plans, which apparently are based
on the probability of a long war. I should
like some member of the Government to tell
me when, under the air training scheme, we
shall be ready to send trained aviators to
France. I am credibly informed that the
Government have made arrangements with
the University of Manitoba for the use of
part of its buildings, but that they do not
desire to take them over until January, 1941.
This simply means that men who may be
trained there cannot be ready for active
service before September, 1941-a year and
three months from now. There is the very

SENATE
thing whichi is causing anxiety throughout
this country-the fact that the programme is
based upon a long xvar. The Government may
be right in this. but if the struggle be short
and adverse to the Allies, what would be the
use of planning for a long war?
When, about two years ago. the rig-ht
honourabie leader of the Opposition (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighien) asked the hionourable
leader of the Goverament about a request
from the British to the Canadian Goverament
foi thec eýtabliiment of air training schools
in tbb,ý coutry, I lii4ened very carefully to
the an.swers, and was convinced that soe
communication aiong the lines mentioned had
carne from the British Goveruneat. I received
confirmation of tliis when, in December last,
the righit lionourable Prime Minister addressed
the people of Canada over the radio. The
British Gavernment desired at their own
expense ta e'ttablish air training schools in
Canada pret.ty nîuchi according to the present
air t raining sceee but the Canadian Government said: "No, that wouid be a surrender
of part of our sox ereignty." The decision, I
a~dmit, rcsted with oui Govcrancint, but the
facts should have been ntesented to the
country during the recent ciection. 1 go

ready and awaiting the opportunity to do the
work.
That being so, it is fair to ask what we have
done in that respect. We were told in the
speech of the Prime Minister that we had a
number of light vessels under construction,
but so far as I can ascertain by inquiry from
informed sources, not one light cruiser has
been constructed in Canada up to the present
time. Just now we are wanting two new
cruisers, and we have ordered then from
Great Britain at a time when she has all she
can do to replace her losses and keep her own
strength up to that measure which will be
required for the winning of the war.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourable gentleman not mean destroyers?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No; I mean destroyers
and cruisers. I was told that we had facilities
for the building of light cruisers in this
country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was referring to the statement that they have been
ordered.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Oh, yes. I thank you
for the correction.
If we had realized two years ago what the
situation was-and it was so plain that he
who ran might read-we could have laid down
some of these ships in our own shipyards and
they would now be ready for launching,
because two years is a sufficient length of
time for the building of cruisers, and we
should be in a much botter position to assist
the Empire.
Every person in Canada who knows anything about the manufacturing industries of
this country knows well that in proportion to
our population, our facilities for the building
of tanks are oqual to the facilities of any
other country. The Canada Car Company
could build tanks; the manufacturers of locomotives could build them; the factories which
produce our tractors and other magnificent
farm machinery could build them. I am
informed by the heads of two or three companies in Canada that they are able and eager
to build tanks. But as far as I can learn
not one tank has yet been produced in this
country. If I am wrong in this I should like
to be corrected. Such is the situation as I
understand it. The only reason that I could
get for this condition of affairs came from a
person who said that in connection with the
building of tanks there were certain patents
which were not available for use. Imagine
a statement of that kind being made in
Germany. Do you suppose that patents on
some particular feature of a piece of war
machinery would hold up manufacture in that
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

country? All I can say is that had I been
the Minister of Munitions and Supply I
should have built the tanks first and talked
about the patents afterwards. If we are going
to win the war, we have to adopt that
principle. Such formalities as patents may
be all right in time of peace, but in time of
war they should be cast aside. We should be
making tanks to-day, and we are not doing so.
We sent our First Division overseas without
any equipment of that kind, and we are going
to send the Second Division over in the same
condition. i doubt very much whether any
tanks or big guns will be built in this country
before the war is over.
When the war broke out, the ports of
Halifax and Saint John, and possibly the port
of Vancouver, did not have a big gun that
was worth a bawbee; and those they have
to-day were not built in this country. Yet
we can build big guns in Canada, and ought
to be building them. Furthermore, I have
been told that we have not yet built any
anti-aircraft guns in Canada. I hope this is
not so, but I fear it is.
Aeroplanes have been mentioned, and we
have heard a great deal about the scheme for
creating an air force in this country. I believe
the seheme which has been formulated is a
good one, but it needs speeding up. I wonder
if any honourable gentlemen have read an
article appearing in this morning's Ottawa
Journal whieh mentioned something I know
to be a fact. Under the air training scheme
certain buildings were to be erected. As yet
they have not been built, and there is no
evidence of any real energy being put into
the project. I am told the same sort of
thing is characteristic of the whole scheme
throughout Canada. I am told further that
the original plans made for the buildings in
Ottawa, in the Maritimes and at other places,
including Vancouver, British Columbia, were
so defective that they have had to be completely rearranged. I could give particulars
of this, but as it might compromise someone
to do so, I shall refrain.
We have overseas at the present time one
flight squadron which, if I am correctly informod, consists of sixteen planes and personnel. Where did those planes come from?
We did not build them.
Another flight
squadron which is ready to go over comprises,
I understand, fourteen planes.
Where did
those planes cone from? We did not build
them in Canada.
When are we going to
start building planes in Canada?
That is
what I want to know. and that is what the
people 'of Canada want to know. Lack of
information on such subjects is just one of
the many reasons why the people of Canada
to-day are not at ease. There is a disturbed

who bas previously been under fire has a more
confident bearing. Now, I know it to be a
fact in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia that
a man who served overseas in the last war
is pretty well debarred from service in this
war. I say that is unfortunate.
Many of the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
younger veterans have volunteered and been
accepted.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: They represent a very
small percentage, I will tell my honourable
friend. My point is that veterans of the
last war should be used to the utmost. Those
who are not physically fit to go overseas,
but still are comparatively young, should be
employed in Canada for home defence. They
should be appointed to every job for which a
soldier is required in this country, thereby
releasing for overseas service those younger
men whom we shall need for replacements
in our First Division, as well as for completing our Second Division, which is by no means
ready to go overseas yet, and for recruiting
the Third Division, which is in process of
being organized.
Honourable members, I do not desire to
take up more of your time. What I have
said expresses my own opinion, an opinion
which I am firmly convinced is shared by an
large number of people
overwhelmingly
throughout Canada. I do ask the Government to get on with the war and with preparations for continuing the war. It is high time
that we began in earnest the manufacture of
war materials here. Why are our factories
not turning -out big guns, aeroplanes, antiaircraft guns, anti-tank guns, and more munitions of every kind? We have not yet touched
the fringe of our manufacturing possibilities.
And if it is necessary to reorganize the Government, do not be satisfied with merely
shifting a man from one Cabinet position to
another, unless you are sure he is the best
possible man for the job. Instead, go outside
the Govemment ranks and bring in the most
capable person that can be got. My reason
for making this suggestion is that the Government do not seem to have put their shoulders
under the load, and they do not seem to be
puhing together as the country would like
to see them do. Continuation of present complaints can be avoided only by prompt and
vigorous action on the part of the Government. Unless such action is forthcoming, the
people will see to it that a new Government
is brought in to do the work as it should be
done.
The Address was adopted.
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

ORGANIZATION OF COMMITTEES
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I move that the Senate adjourn
during pleasure. That will give an opportunity for honourable members nominated by
the Committee of Selection to meet right away
and organize their respective committees.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE
BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 15, an Act to amend the
Department of National Defence Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND, with the leave of
the Senate, moved the second reading of the
Bill.
He said: The purpose of this Bill is to
divide the work of the Department of National
Defence by the appointment of a Minister of
National Defence for Air to take charge of
that part of the work which bas to do with
the air service. I think the proposed change
will be helpful to the Minister of National
Defence, for at the present time lie has to
shoulder a very heavy burden.
In England the Government at first placed
the War Office, the Admiralty and the Ministry
of Air under a Minister of Defence, and later
under a Minister of Co-ordination to coordinate those departments. I hope we shall
not have to follow that pyramidal policy, but
shall be satisfied to see how under this arrangement the two Ministers discharge their duties.
This I hope they will do not only to the
satisfaction of the Commons, but of the
Senate as well.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Has there been
any suggestion that co-ordination may be
necessary? At the present time the senior air
officer is a member of the Defence Council,
on which he sits on terms of equality with the
Chief of the General Staff and the senior
naval officer, all being under the jurisdiction
of the Department of National Defence,
presided over by the Minister. Am I to
understand that with the creation of a new
Minister the senior air officer will withdraw
from the Defence Council, and the Air
Ministry will not carry on in co-ordination
with the Defence Council? Will the honourable leader inquire as to this?

MAY 22, 1940
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. I take it
for granted that the Ministry for Air which
is to be created under this Bill will act
independently in ail matters affecting the air
service, and there will be no other change in
the conditions which prevail to-day in the
Department of National Defence. The Minister for Air will be able to draw upon the
pay, engineering and other sections, but they
will remain under the Minister of National
Defence. If any situation should arise which
called for prompt action in relation to, those
various sections, and even the air service, the
Minister of National flefence would be
supreme; but for the earrying on of the work
of the air service he has as his associate a
Minister specially detailed for that service.
Otherwise, I think, nothing is changed.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That implies the
Minister for Air will be subordinate to the
Minister of National Defence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should flot
like to use that expression. I termn him an
associate.
Hlon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Perhaps the honourable leader will inquire whether after the
creation of the proposed Air Ministry the
senior air officer will be withdrawn from the
Defence Council. I think lie will.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: I doubt it very
mucli.
Hlon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I cannot see how
he can sit there after the creation of the
Air Ministry.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is a moot
question ini the mind of my gallant friend.
I order to satisfy bina I will get the information independently of this Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND, with the leave
of the Senate, moved the third readmng of
the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It will be
observed in sections 2 and 3 that the proposed
change takes effect on the passing of some
regulation under the War Measures Act. Does
it mean that the creation of the Air Ministry
rests upon the continuance of the regulation
so passed, and therefore disappears with the
repeal of the regulation?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is, this
Bill replaces the regulation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, it does
not.
DW32-q

51

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We could have
made the change by Order in Council, but
we are doing so by Act of Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is so.
Parliament hy this Bill authorizes the creation
of the new Ministry. But section 2 reads:
The said Act is further amended by ioserting therein, as section four A thereof, the
following section: 4A. (1) When sucli a proclamation as is
first rnentioned in section two of the War
Measures Act has been issued under the said
section, an additional Minister of National
Defence niay be appointed....
That is to say, the Government must first,
utilizing its powers under the War Mes.sures
Act, pass an Order in 'Council, and when that
is passed an amendment is automaticaily
made to the Department of National Defence
Act, which amendment lias the effeet of
erecting a Department of Air. Is not the effect
this, that the Department of Air necessarily is
temporary, because the amendment to the
Act takes its root and being in a regulation
*passed under the War ýMeasures Aýct? And
does it not follow that upon the repeal of'
that regulation the amendment disappears
and the Act stands as it did before, and thereis no longer a Department of Air Defence?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The proposed
appointment of this Minister for Air is simply
for the duration of the war.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is the
way it is done?
Hon. Mr. DANDUIIAND: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill wais
read the third -time, and passed.
ADJOURNMENT 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: Honourable
senators, I move that when the Senate adjourns this evening it do stand adjourned until

in order to get my motion properly before

honourable members to a question of national
importance, the Air Forée of Canada. We
have all received a supplement on the Air
Force agreement between Great Britain,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

The Common-

Hon. Mr. McRAE: The Commonwealth
agreement. I must say, however, it is not
very clear just what that agreement, carried
to its full extent, would mean. J intend, with
the -consent of the House, to deal with this
matter at some length. I am sure that nothing
in my remarks will give information to the
enemy or be unduly critical of what has been
so far accomplished by the Government. It
seems to me that in this trying period, in
view of the catastrophe confronting us, this
honourable House can do a great deal not
only to enlighten honourable senators, but
also to provide the country with information
that would allay much of the uneasiness
which, as we all must recognize, is very general
throughout Canada.
We must not deceive ourselves into the
belief that we should sit here ike men who
are speechless, or that we have not a function
to perform. I should certainly feel embarrassed
if this honouýrable House were to adjourn from
time to time without discussing the great
emergency that lies before us. Our effort
should be constructive, and surely from among
the membership of this honourable body
there will arise some helpful suggestions. Rules
or no rules, I cannot see why there should be
any hesitancy in discussing issues which are
worrying our citizens almost into nervous
prostration. In my opinion, rules should not
prevent us from considering these ýthings in a
proper manner. As the right honourable the
leader of the Opposition (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) has said, there is a simple way of
accomplishing what we desire. I do not wish
the honourable the leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) to feel that in my remarks
I shall transgress in any respect, or that the
matters I shall deal with will not be proper
subjects of discussion. Whether what I have
to say will be helpful to the Government I
do not know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I hope so.

Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I hope so too. There
are numerous subjects we ought to discuss,
such as the fifth column, home defence and
many other matters which are causing the

people of Canada considerable worry, much
of which, I believe, can be removed by the
application of the wealth of wisdom which
is to be found in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
tell my honourable friend that this Chamber
is entitled to obtain all the information the
House of Commons is entitled to receive.
The information may be a little slower in
coming to us, because I shall have to rely
for my information upon my colleagues in
the other Chamber. But any question that
can properly be raised in the other House
concerning the situation can be debated here.
TBE SITUATION IN EUROPE
INQUIRY

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before we
adjourn, is there any statement the honourable
leader of the House can make to us? I find
it impossible at this time to discuss matters
in the usual atmosphere, and I am wondering
if the leader of the House can give honourable
members any information regarding the
progress of the crucial conflict to which all
our minds are turned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: J am in hopes
of being able to make a statement to the
Senate to-morrow.
IMMIGRATION FROM BRITAIN
AND FRANCE
INQUIRY

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I refer
again to a suggestion I made last week, in an
inquiry I put to the Government, namely:
what is the Government's attitude towards
welcoming to Canada from Britain or France
any people who desire to come here and who
can do so with the approval of their respective
governments? I am quite sure that in this
regard, unless a suggestion first came from
Canada, there would be no request from the
British authorities, or, for that matter, from
the French authorities. There certainly would
be none from the French except through the
British. Under the strain of the present hour,
if such a suggestion has not already been
offered, I would beg of the Government to
make known at once to the British Government that arrangements will be made here
in some way to receive the people who are
able to come to our shores from those two
countries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know that
some little time ago the question was raised
somewhat informally of receiving children on
certain conditions from Finland, or Norway,

SENATE
or perbaps Denmark. Divers opinions were
expressed as to the wisdom of such action,
inasmuch as the children would, perforce, be
separated from their mothers and families.
I shall try to obtain the view of the Cabinet
before the House meets to-morrow at three
o'clock.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable leader bas perhaps misunderstood me.
I am not referring to the general refugee
question at all, or to the children of Norway,
or Denmark, or Finland.

I

have

in

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I meant refugees
from those countries. My right honourable
friend limits his question to refugees coming
frorn France and Britain.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
call them refugees. I refer to those people
who might ,desire to come here and who
would be permitted to do so by their governments.
As to the motion of which notice has
been given by the honourable senator frorn
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), I suggest that
the most general discussion of Canada's war

effort should be permitted, and that all kinds
of suggestions as to what may be done now
should be allowed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend will understand that the ministers
in charge of the various activities of the
Government are not sitting in this Chamber,
and at the least I should expect to have some
indication of the questions to be raised under
various heads, so that I might bring correct
information regarding them before this House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is quite
reasonable. I know we cannot expect the
leader of the flouse to give detailed answers,
except on the most important phases, already
well known to all mernhers of the Government.
But the discussion should proceed.
I refer especially

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.

CANADA'S AIR SERVICE
NOTICE WITHDRAWN
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
last evening I gave notice that I would call the
attention of the House to a matter of national
importance, the Air Service of Canada.
Developments in the interval would appear
te make this unwise, and I have neither the
spirit nor the heart to initiate discussion on
such a matter at this moment. I therefore
ask honourable members to consent to my
withdrawal of the notice.
While I am on my feet I would suggest to
the honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) that at some early date we
might have a meeting of senators, behind closed
doors, for the purpose of receiving a little
more detailed information than we now have
as to the situation confronting the country.
I may inforrm
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend that I had it in mind
we could have a meeting of senators in one
of our committee rooms, and the Ministers in
charge of the departments concerned might be
asked to attend for the purpose of giving us
the required details. In that way honourable
members would get information at first band.
If the idea is agreeable to my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and
his colleagues, I shall gladly pursue it.

to questions, or more than that, if desired.

THE SITUATION IN EUROPE
DISCUSSION

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) has asked that there be no discussion to-day on the matter uppermost in all
our minds. Is it the intention of the Government that we sit to-morrow?
My right honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend was not, I think, present at the
opening of the House. As a matter of fact,
I did not initiate that suggestion; it came
from my honourable friend from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae).
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
and heard what he said.

I was here

He said he
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
thought that this was not a propitious moment
to enter into a debate which would perhaps
be contentious, and he asked leave to withdraw his notice. I thought that probably we
should be sitting to-morrow. I intend, when
we reach the Orders of the Day, as there is
no further business before us, to move that
the Senate adjourn during pleasure, because
about half-past four we may receive a Supply
Bill for a vote of one-sixth of the annual
supply.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But there is
no reason why questions and motions may not
be placed before the Senate in the ordinary
way now. I believe the honourable senator
from Edmonton . (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) is
about to give notice of an inquiry. I should
not like to encourage any spirit of schism or
even embarrassment at this time, but I do not
think this is the time to abandon our funetions. If we are to meet again at half-past
four in order to vote supply, the Bill foreshadowed can then be made the occasion of
such discussion as honourable members feel
would be useful and appropriate at this hour.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not suggest ·to the honourable gentleman from
Edmonton that he withdraw or suspend his
inquiry. I merely asked that it stand, as I
had not the answer before me.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is all right;
but I have another inquiry.
While I am on my feet I may say that I do
not share the gloom and downheartedness of
many of the persons whom I have met to-day.
I have great faith that in the end everything
will come out all right.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: This is no time
for members of the Government to lose their
grip and to run around as distracted as
chickens with their heads off, seeking help
from outside sources. We have within our
own country the men and 'the material to
build up an adequate defence -if we undertake
it along the proper lines. What is needed
now is to put some buck under the tails of
members of the Government, and that I shall
be pleased te do out of the plenitude of it
that I myself have at the present moment.
I believe the French army has a strong and
powerful attack stilH to deliver from the region
of the Maginot line; I believe the British
army should not be moved out of Belgium,
but should be reinforced there; and I believe
that in the end it will be found that Germany
has shot ber bolt and that we shall win the
war.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. MT. GRIESBACH: But now is the
time to keep our heads up and our tails over
our backs rather than between our legs.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In order to
sweeten everybody, I desire to give notice,
for Friday next, of the following inquiry:
1. Has the Government of Canada, either on
its own behalf or for the British Government,
let contracts in Canada for the manufacture in
Canada of:
a. machine guns?
b. 3-inch mortars?
c. smaller mortars?
d. revolvers?
e. pistols?
f. rifles?
g. 25-pounder gun howitzers?

i. anti-aircraft guns?
j. anti-tank guns?
2. If so, will the Government identify said
contracts in the books recording the activities
of the Defence Purchasing Board and the War
Supply Board?
That is, will the Government in answering
this question give the pages in its books where
these contracts are set out?
3. In what quantities or numbers have such
contracts been let, and how many of such
articles above enumerated have been completed
and issued?
4. Has the Government of Canada, either on
its own behalf or for the British Government,
let contracts in Canada for the manufacture
in Canada of:
a. heavy tanks?

THE SITUATION IN EUROPE
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
I bave a suggestion to offer. We all, I am
sure, realize the situation at the present time.
As to that, I may say that I thoroughly agree
with the remarks that have fallen from the
lips of the honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach). This is no time to
be downhearted.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I can well remember
the feeling that existed in London in 1918,
particularly in official quarters. At that time,
as I have often said, the only man I met
who had a smile on his face was Lloyd
George. He never lest his belief that in the
end the Allies would win. When I passed
over to France and for many days mingled
with the soldiers there, I met not a single
man who was downhearted in any degree.
This was in absolute contrast to the situation
which existed in official quarters in London.
Wben I left the shores of England defeat
was in sight-well in sight; the Germans had
broken through again and had crossed the
Marne; but within three weeks Focb said,
"Now we have got them," and he struck,
and thore was no doubt about the result.
War is a tremendous game. Little successes
do net count for much. What really counts
is the strength to meet a situation that arises
out of the application of what I suppose yen
would call the science of strategy. In 1918
Foch saw his chance and took it, and within
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

a matter of two weeks the Allied drive was
on and was succeeding.
However, I rose to make a suggestion.
This is probably not the time to urge it,
and I shall net do se. I am sure the Governnient to-day have information that members
of Parliament cannot possibly have. In Great
Britain already two secret sessions of Parliament have been held, at which there must
have been very frank discussion and many
helpful suggestions.
In France a private
session was held for two days; all the members
were called in, and hour after hour they
were made thoroughly acquainted with the
situation.
Now, I xvould ask members of
both louses of this Parliament what knowledge we have of the situation-what practical
information we possess-and I suggest that
the leader of the House confer with his
colleagues to sec if an appropriate time cannot
be arranged for members of Parliament to get
some real knowledge of the truc situation
and of what is occurring. I think that would
be helpful to us all. Nobody desires te play
polities in this matter, and no one should
have the slightest desire to embarrass the
Government now. But for goodness sake let
us know, as for as can be told, what the
situation is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend's suggestion will be very sympathetically
conveyed by me to my colleagues. At the
present time the situation is somewhat difficult
and we are working on important problems,
but with stout hearts. I should be happy te
sec that there is given to the Senate, or, if
necessary, to a Senate committee, whatever
information can be imparted to members of
both Houses.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, it is unlikely that the interim Supply Bill
will reach us this afternoon. 1 would therefore
suggest that His Honour the Speaker call it
six o'clock, with the understanding that we shall
meet this evening at 8.30.

At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senalte resume at 8 p.m.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 21, an Act for granting to
His Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending the
31st March, 1941.
The Bill was read the first time.

second reading of the Bill.

moved the

He said: Honourable senators, this is the
customary Bill which is presented to us yearly,
generally after the lst of April, in order that
the affairs of state may be carried on.
In virtue of clause 2 a request is made to
Parliament for the vote ofa sum not exceeding in the whole $41,455,066.47
towards defraying the several charges and
expenses of the public service, from April 1,
1940, to March 31, 1941, not otherwise provided for, and being one-sixth of the amount
of each of the several items to be voted, set
forth in the estimates for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1941, as laid before the House of
Commons at the present session of Parliament.
As my honourable friends are aware, although
the total expenditure is $448,055,804.63, the
expenditure which must be voted yearly is
limited to the sum of $248,274,210.79. A sixth
of that is asked for under clause 2.
Under clause 3 there is an additional interim
vote of $2,318,646.13 towards defraying certain
charges and expenses of the public service
from April 1, 1940, to March 31, 1941, being
one-twelfth of the amount set forth in
Schedule A.
The fourth clause asks for an additional
interim vote of $507,316.67, on certain items.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable gentlemen,
we on this side of the House have no copies
of the Bill, and cannot follow the references.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend has-

My honourable

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I have not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I see that my
honourable friend now has a copy. I was
going to say that according to practice and
custom he would have to confide in and
follow his leader. Honourable members on
this side of the House must rely on the statements which I now read, because the Bill
just passed the House of Commons at six
o'clock. It might be otherwise, but it is the
general practice to accept the statement of the
leader of the Government, under the control
-I
was going to use a French expression,
which also may be English-under the
surveillance of my right honourable friend.
An additional interim vote of $5,543,071 is
asked for 1940-1941 on certain items. This
covers four months of the year. The reason
for this treatment is that the item represents
sums which are seasonal, and which must be
paid out early in the fiscal year. This is
under Schedule C.

The amount granted under Schedule B,
$507,316.67, is one-sixth of the amount of the
items and represents sums that must be
spent by the Department of Agriculture during
the period covered. The schedule provides
for compensation for animals slaughtered,
$543,900, and for the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, $2,500,000. This second item relates
to rehabilitation mostly in Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and includes irrigation schemes to
permit of corrals for the animals in certain
regions.
Schedule C is based on the main estimates.
The amount granted is $5,543,071.67, "being
one-third of the amount of each item in the
said estimates as contained in this schedule."
The total amounts to be voted include $65,000
for grants to fairs and exhibitions. I had
thought all grants to fairs had been eliminated.
These must be grants already made, which
must be met. For salaries and expenses of
the office of the Chief Electoral Officer there
is a total of $18,665. Under Justice there
is an annual contribution of $500 to the
Canadian Law Library. Under Mines and
Resources there is an item of $1,144,215 for
National Parks and Historie Sites.
For
Surveys and Engineering Branch the vote is
$8,000. For National Parks there is $171,125;
for Historic Sites $500, and for Forest Conservation $40,000. Under Indian Affairs there
is a sum of $146,210 to provide for the
completion, equipment and furnishings of
Indian residential day schools, which must
be carried on during the summer. For canal
improvements there is a sum of $35,000. I
am happy to see that all that is asked for the
Canadian National Railways' deficit is $15,000,
000. I hope they will have a surplus next
year.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I
hasten to explain to the honourable leader
that members on this side of the House do
not at all depend upon my judgment or
capacity for review of this Bill. They have
independent minds and are of course entitled
to receive a copy of the measure, so as to be
able to come to their own conclusions.
As to my honourable friend's last remark,
that he hoped the Canadian National would
have a surplus next year, I am afraid the
implication is something he did not intend.
The reason for the current reduction in deficit
is the war. I hope and pray the same reason
will not prevail next year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the Canadian National may carry on under acquired
momentum.

I hope my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

undertaking together and see what it means.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I see what it
means here. I do not think any Government
can ever mention the word "economy" while
engaged in that construction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, we have
crossed swords on that question.
Right Hon. MT. MEIGHEN: But the Bill
is still in front of us.
I notice the steady growth of the Department of External Affairs' expenses in respect
of representation abroad. In my judgment
these, in the main, are just moneys we are
paying out for our vanity. We had to
assume all the trappings and the suits of
nationhood, no matter whether we had any
of the real essence of nationhood, and so we
are running up 'this annual account, which
this year totals $626,575.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Our Belgian and
Netherlands offices have been discontinued, of
course.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: According to
the figures in front of me, our representation
abroad now costs about three-quarters as much
as the legislative branches of the Government
of Canada. Really, it is absurd.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Where are these
figures?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Schedule A,
page 3 of the Bill.
I know that our representation abroad was
begun when we sent a Minister to Washington-without any enthusiastie cheers from
me. But in the meantime the scheme has
grown un-til it nearly encircles the globe.
What will our Minister to Australia, for
instance, find to do? We have some trade
with that country, and we certainly ought to
increase its volume if we can. But, so far as
I could observe, our trade representatives there
were none too busy: I could not see any siga
of overwork on their part. In fact, good as
they were, and eager to do their part, they
seemed to me to be rather lacking in reasons
for industry. Yet we had to increase our
representation by establishing a full-fledged
ministry in Australia. We did the same, I
think, in New Zealand. I have no objection to
the man sent to Australia. Up to now he has
been one who liked work, and how he is going
to live under the conditions he will find in

it is utterly absurd to keep multiplying these
representatives abroad.

representatives abroad may do useful work.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Have we improved our relationship with Japan?
My right

is such a thing as intimate correspondence
between governments, and that it can be

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps my right

do not buy.

Bill B, an Act to incorporate Pool Insurance.
-Hon. Mr. Haig.
SECOND READING POSTPONED

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I should like to have the House consent to
the second reading of this Bill to-day. It is
a standard Bill, and complies with the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act,
except that the stock, instead of being under
the names of the directors, will be owned by
the constituting pool. The Superintendent of
Insurance bas approved of the Bill with the
exception of that provision.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it a new
company?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, sir; it is incorporated
in Manitoba and insures the grain of the pool.
The new Bill covers the pools of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The directors
are the president, the vice-president, the
secretary and the treasurer in each province.
As operations are being carried on in the
three provinces, it is deemed better to have
Dominion incorporation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Has the Bill the
approval of the Superintendent of Insurance?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, it bas. The solicitor
from Regina who asked me to introduce the
Bill informed me to that effect, and I took
the trouble to see the Superintendent of
Insurance for myself.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
that it complies with the Insurance Act in all
respects except that it deals with the ownership of stock by the directors. The stock in
this case, instead of being owned by the
directors, as provided by the Insurance Act,
is really owned by the pool.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is an
important divergence, but in my opinion it
bas much merit. I think our present Insurance
Act needs amendrnent in that respect. In the
Insurance Act we provide that directors must
hold, in their own right, quite a large amount
of stock. This sounds well, but what is the
practical result? If a company like this one
is formed by an organization which bas business for it to do, the directors have to buy
the stock. Why should they have to do that?
The stock may not be worth par or near it.
They must hold it in their own right, and
cannot hold it as proxies for the owners.
Five directors own, let us say, $10,000 worth

MAY 29, 1940
British Empire, outside of the two big armament firms in Great Britain, who ever produced
a 12-inch shell. This shell, in the rough,
weighed nearly a ton and stood about four
feet high. We also shipped a considerable
tonnage of shell steel to Great Britain.
In the public statement to which I have
referred, the speaker went on to say that if
there are other factories in the Maritimes
capable of doing this work, the doors of the
Department of Munitions and Supply are wide
open to them, and be would be glad to help
them place themselves in a position to manufacture the type of equipment that is going.
With reference to this I may state that the
works of the Nova Scotia Steel Company,
New Glasgow, are equipped now, as they were
during the last war, to suppily large quantities
of all types of shells, but so far not a single
order bas been placed there. New Glasgow
is within one hundred miles of Halifax, where
a protected convoy of shipping is 'leaving every
week for the other side. I am told that cast
steel shells, not forged shells, are now called
for. If that is so, two concerns in New Glasgow could provide them. Why orders for
munitions have not been placed with the New
Glasgow companies I fail to understand, and
an explanation of the prevailing attitude or
lack of action is, I submit, due from those in
authority, and should be given promptly.
I should
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
like to repeat the information given in another
place, that the reason why shells have not been
manufactured in as large a quantity as our
manufacturers could have turned them out is
that no orders came from Great Britain. I
am not prepared to say that orders will not
be forthcoming, and I am quite sure that, if
they are, Nova Scotia will not be neglected.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, so far as I know, there is on this side
of the House, and, I presume, also on the other
side, only one desire in our hearts and minds,
and that is to be of service in furthering
our war effort. But in order to be of service
we must know what is and what is not going
on. A few weeks ago, from his seat in the
British .House of Commons, Mr. Lloyd George
said that the last war was won by criticism;
meaning, I presume, that the criticism
of the Asquith Government, which resulted
in the establishment of a National Union
Government, was the prime cause of the Allied
victory. I think everybody who has read
the history of those days is familiar with the
fact that Mr. Asquith was one of the most
highly cultured men in English public life,
but as a war Minister he was a total failure,
and it was not until a man of wider knowledge,
better judgment and outstanding vigour

became Prime Minister that the situation in
England was cleared up.
My honourable friend from New Glasgow
(Hon. Mr. Cantley) has been modest indeed
about his firm's contribution to Canada's shell
production during the last war. As I recall
the facts, the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal
Company, which at great expense provided
its own machinery, produced millions of shells.
It seems to me that in contrast with what
was done then, all the talk about eight
factories somewhere or other in this province
being under a stupendous strain to produce
2,000,000 shells is almost a joke. At the rate
of rapid fire in action at the front these
shells would last, I suppose, about two days.
But, it must be borne in mind, they are not
nearly completed yet, notwithstanding that
some of the contracts have been under way
since 1937.
Although the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal
Company bas a magnificent plant under
capable management all ready to undertake
shell production, what does the Government
do? It goes down to Montreal and picks
up a building contractor-the man who built
the post office here-and gives him a contract
to make shells. It outfits his plant, provides
him with everything necessary for the production of shells, pays his rent, his interest,
his taxes, his insurance, pays for his telephone,
his light, his water-in short, everything down
to the shovelling of snow off the sidings at
his plant. I pointed out these facts last
session.
Personally, I am getting heartily sick and
tired of reading excuses. I read the statements of the Minister of Transport, I listen
to the radio, I read the newspapers. To-day
the newspapers are full of excuses by Cabinet
Ministers excusing this, that, and the other
thing, and offering these excuses on the ground,
if you please, that we in this country are
apparently, in their judgment, a lot of morons.
If we are to believe what these Ministers tell
us, we cannot make implements of war, we
cannot make munitions-the devil only knows
what we can do, unless it be to make gun
fodder of ourselves. I repeat, I am sick and
tired of hearing excuses all the time. Take
the statement made by the honourable Minister
of Transport not very long since: fifty per
cent of it consists of excuses. What do we
find to-day? The Minister of National Defence
issues a long rigmarole of excuses about the
manufacture of tanks. He says they are not
wanted in England. Well, what did I hear on
the radio at noon to-day? A Cabinet Minister
in London, England, calling for tanks, more
tanks, and still more tanks. And yet this
Minister of National Defence tells us they

SENATE

32

do net want tanks over there. "We cannot
make tanks, anyway," says Mr. Howe.
Why not?

Hon. Mr. CANTLEY:

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable members,
I do not believe that statement at all. I
am one of those who believe that so far as
fighting is concerned, a Canadian soldier is
as good as any soldier in the world, and
better than many.
Hear, hear.

Some Hon. SENATORS:
11n.

Mr. TANNER:

In

my opinion our

Canadian seaman takes rank below no one in
the world; the Canadian aviator is as good as
any man who ever went up into the air; and
the Canadian mechanic or engineer can stand
up beside his rival in any nation. The Canadian mechanic can make anything. Indeed,
there is not one thing needed in this war that
he cannot make. Yet it has been dinned into
our ears by Mr. Howe and by other members
of the Government that Canadian factories
cannot make this and cannot make that. We
are told it is necessary to go to the United
States or some other place to get war implements. Well, honourable members, if I were
a betting man, I would bet $100 to $1 that,
so far as the United States is concerned, it is
very likely that the men who are doing very
fine work there, and whom the Minister of
Transport admires so much, are Canadians
or the sons of Canadians.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY:

Bluenoses.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes. I warrant that
Canadians and the sons of Canadians are doing
over there the very work that we are told
cannot be done in Canada. I protest as
vigorously as I can against this state of affairs.
Minister of National
The honourable
Defence, I think it was, said something yesterday to the effect that we should not ask
questions or say things that might depress the
people. The people of Canada are not depressed; they are indignant. They are indignant because there is so little being done.
The people who are depressed are the members of the Government, and they have good
reason to be depressed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
fricend is now on the stump, and thinks the
elections are not over.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We do not want them
to be depressed; we want them to get to work
and accomplish something. I never had any
opinion about the elections but that they
were a criminal waste of time. While Hitler
was sharpening bis swords and getting his
guns and his tanks ready, we were frittering
Hon.

Mr. TANNER.

away three or four months in nrining elections
that were net at all necessary. Then there
was the aftermath-the holidays spent down
in Virginia while Mr. Hitler was putting on
the finishing touches. Here we are, with not
a Canadian at the fighting front.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend knows why the Canadian Division is
not at the front. That is because the War
Office has not desired it to be.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is another thing.
sik and tircd of the excuse that the
War Office bas said se and so. Bring the
Var Office statements down here and let us
read them. I do not believe the excuses.
T

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is net the proper
attitude for Canada. The attitude for Canada
to take is not to wait until we are asked to
do something, but to do it and keep on doing
it. We should not wait until we are kicked in
the backside and told to get ahead.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We do not want to
do that.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: That is on a par with
the rest of your speech.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We want to get
ahead. The three months spent on elections
were a waste of time that should have been
devoted to the work that has now begun. We
should have had a Minister of Munitions four
months ago; we should have had a Minister
of Air four months ago; but these four months
have been allowed to go by for the benefit of
Hitler and his German barbarians.
Now, honourable senators, I hope we shall
hear no more of these excuses. As I see it,
one of the greatest industries we have in
Canada to-day is the excuse industry on Par-

lianent Hill.

It is working

at maximum

speed.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

That is the way I

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
look at it.
My honourable friend from New Glasgow
(Hon. Mr. Cantley) is a modest man, and in
talking about munitions he did not tell you
that when the Nova Scotia Steel plant was
making shells he was sent to England by the
Department of National Defence. He got into
touch with the Master General of Ordnance
of the British Government, who sent him up
to see the plants in England that were making
shells. What did he find? He found plants
whose managers thought they were doing a

MAY 29, 1940
tremendous business in turning out fifty nineinch shells a day, and who asked him, "What
are you doing?" "Oh," said my honourable
friend, "we are turning out between three
bundred and five hundred a day." The
Englishmen did not quite believe him, and
when they asked, "How do you do it?" lie
explained how it was being done. They then
asked him to show them how to do it, and lie
sent the plans and specifications of his plant
over to England to enable them to come up
to the record made by the Nova Scotia Steel
and Coal plant in the liftle province of
Nova Scotia. So there, I say, is another illustration of what Canadian initiative, ability
and vigour can do as compared with what is
done by experienced engineers and mechanicians in old England. Let us hear no more
about Canada not being able to do these
things. Let us close up this excuse factory
and get to work. I am sure every honourable
member on this side of the House will be
found ready to co-operate and help in every
way possible to see that this country does its
duty.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I am quite sure that all honourable
members on both sides of this Chamber are
sympathetically disposed towards the suggestions of the last two speakers, who want to
press forward as much as possible Canada's
war effort. But I rather think that my lionourable friend who has just taken his seat
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) has somewhat twisted the
record we have received and read of what
was said in another place. It might not be
improper to put two or three paragraphs on

record here, so as to preserve the continuity.
May I first say, though, that my honourable friend who has just sat down is surely
not going to try to convince any of us that
the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company did
such wonderful things during the last war at
their own expense.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: He knows that we
know better. He knows that we know that
they were substantially paid for all they did
in getting ready to conduct the business of
making war supplies. I am sure, therefore, my
honourable friend would not want to "kid"
either us or the people outside into the belief
that the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company
were so magnanimous, or so desirous of extend-

ing Canada's war effort, that they made enormous outlays at their own expense.
The two distinguished gentlemen who have
just spoken seemed to be greatly concerned

over the fact that the Maritimes have not
got their full share.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Not at all.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Perhaps my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Tanner) did not read
the statement given in another place; so I

shall read one item, which is to be found
at page 145 of the House of Commons Hansard
of May 22. The Minister of Munitions and
Supply, speaking in that House, said:
Possibly one reason why not so many orders
have gone to the Maritime Provinces is that
the principal steel industry there is shipping
direct to Great Britain on orders secured well
before the war. I think some seventy-five to
eighty per cent of the output of the Dominion
Iron and Steel Company is being shipped direct
from Sydney to Great Britain without passing
through the War Supply Board. If there are
other factories in the Maritimes capable of
doing this work, the doors of the Department
of Munitions and Supply are wide open to them,
and we shall be very glad to help them place
themselves in a position to manufacture the
type of equipment that is going.
And further:
I may say that the textile mills in the Maritimes are, to my knowledge, operating at full
blast; I have yet to recall any manufacturer

in the Maritimes who has called on me for

assistance since I have been associated with
this board in the last several months.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That has nothing to
do with shells. The Dominion Iron and Steel
Company at Sydney bas been shipping to
England for years. If my honourable friend
knew anything about the matter lie would
know what I am telling him.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Of course I eaunot know as much as my honourable friend
does. His chief cause of complaint is that a
short while ago, in accordance with the laws
of Canada, we had a general election, and
it did not go as he wished. That is his
chief objection to what is going on now.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. QUINN:

Hear, hear.

Keep polities out of it.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I may tell my
honourable friend from Bedford-Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Quinn) that I will leave politices out of
it if the gentlemen who have been giving us
such a tale of woe and resentment about what
happened a couple of months ago will also
leave politics out of it.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There will not be
a word of politics from me if you just get
down to brass tacks and help the Government
of Canada in dealing with the war.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:

I am different from

my honourable friend.

While he was out

campaigning I was at home, taking no part
at all in the elections, because I thought

they should not be held.

SENATE
My honourable
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
friend is right. After great insistence I made
one speech. I did not cone up to the efforts
of my honourable friend from Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Who?

Me?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable the
junior nienîber from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig).
Now let us come to the point my two
honourable friends touched upon, and give
the record as if was given in another place.
I listened attentively to my honourable friends
and I thoughît neither of them gave the actual
facts or information brought out in another
place. I have here what the Minister of
Munitions and Supply said on this question.
If we analyse it we shall find that Canada's
record on this occasion is as good as it was
in the last war, whien the Nova Scotia Steel and
Coal Company, according to my honourable
friend's statement, went to such enormous
expense.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Yes, sir. May I
inform my honourable friend that we did
net receive a dollar fron the Government
towards fitting out the plant.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will my honourable
friend tell me that the Nova Scotia Steel
and Coal Company was not handsomely reimbursed for all the inoneys it laid out?
We won the war,

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
did we net?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes, we surely did,
and we hope and expect to win this war if
honourable gentlemen can only forget the last
election and get down to brass tacks.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Forget it.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: If your war strategy
were as good as your political strategy we
should win the war very quickly.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Eight Canadian plants are at present engaged
in the manufacture of 2,250,000 shells. These
plants have been equipped with modern shellmaking equipment.
Within a few days an
additional 2,250,000 shell order will be placed.
Thus within a few days twelve or more Canadian firms will be engaged in the manufacture
of 4.500.000 shells.
I might say by way of comparison that in
the seventeenth nonth of the Great War Canada shipped 5,380,000 shells to England--which
was a veiry excellent record at that time. We
have placcd orders up to the present time for
only about the sane quantity, which will mean
that wien that time is reached, based on
present ord esi we shall have delivered about
the sane anount as had been deivered in the
last war. The difference is, of course, that we
have installed much more modern machinery,
we liave larger plants engaged in the business,
and the business is not distributed to anything
like the extent that it was in the last war.
In other words, Tom, Dick and Harry are not
being made millionaires overnight in this
war.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Does the
honourable gentleman inean that the more
you distribute the business the more millionaires you make?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Not this time;
that is not being donc this time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My meagre
knowledge of arithmetie would suggest that
the wider the distribution of orders the les
likelihood there would be of making millionaires.
Hon. Mr. EULER:
way, though.
Hon.

Costs are higher that

Mr. MURDOCK:

payments

and

In the last war

allowances were

so magnani-

mous that ail and sundry could become fairly
well off.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Whom do you nean
by "Tom, Dick and Hai-ry"?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, my bonourable friend himself, and the honourable gentleman who spoke earlier, and myself-anyone
who arranges the business.

Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Go on. Finish it.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the bonourable
gentleman confine his rem:arks to the speech
of the honourable senator froni New Glasgow
(Hon. Mr. Cantley) and explain why so nany
excuses have been made and no results have
followed?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Thank you.
In another place information was given by
the Minister in charge of these matters which
my two distinguished friends have been discussing on the question now before us. Here
is what the Minister said on this particular
question:

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not understand that any excuses arc being made, except
as to the withholding of certain information.
During the past few months I personally have
resented the fact that I could not ascertain
just wbat was going on. But I think now,
as a member of the Senate, I know the reason,

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let us hope for the
best, as we did before.

Hon. Mr. TANNER.

65

MAY 29, 1940
and, as a good Canadian, I am satisfied. Let
me say that Tom, Dick and Harry cannot be
told all the underlying causes for everything
that is being done by the Canadian Government in conjunction and co-operation with the
British Government. I think that was proven
here yesterday, when a few of the distinguished
members of this House and of the other House
discussed, I am sure, matters that some of
us, including myself, know nothing about.
They were, no doubt, given information that
I do not expect to receive, for if I received
it many others would have an equal right
to it.
Now, may I continue with a direct quotation from a speech made by the Minisber
of Munitions and Supply in another place? I
am reading from page 145 of the House of
Commons Debates. The Minister went on to
say:
If we had the business to place, relative to
our productive capacity, that we had in the last
war, we could, of course, supply Britain with
many times the quantities of shells that we
supplied in the last war.
The shells which Canada now makes or will
make in the immediate future include 40 millimetre, 18-pounder, 25-pounder, 3.7 inch, 4.5
inch, 6 inch, and 9-2 inch shells. In order to
make the shells complete, Canadian plants are
at present engaged in the manufacture of
corresponding quantities of cartridge cases,
fuses, primers and other requisites. Some sixty
different Canadian companies are engaged in
this work. The Dominion arsenals are also
engaged in certain special munition work for
the United Kingdom.
Excluding certain explosives orders, for which
the capacity of the Dominion is being rapidly
increased, contracts totalling more than $40,000,000 have been placed for these munitions,
including 100,000,000 rounds of small arms
ammunition, individual gun barrels, anti-tank
carriages, and other items. I might say that
that item of 100,000,000 rounds of small arms
ammunition bas been very greatly increased
since these notes were prepared.
And then came an interjection by a Maritimer, eager to get jobs in the Maritimes,
more concerned perhaps with "whether we are
going to get our share" than whether the war
is being conducted to the best possible advantage of all Canadians in all provinces.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The Maritimes are just
to lie down and take it, then? Is that the
idea?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Not at all.
Hon. Mr.. QUINN: They are not going to
do it. You needn't worry.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
the Maritimes?

What is wrong with

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Nothing at all.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: The Minister of
Finance and the Minister of National Defence
come from the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is one of the
best parts of Canada, bar none.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What about Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Good. But I was
going to quote an interjection by one of our
Maritimers. They are always looking for what
is rightfully theirs. I do not blame them at all.

. Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
money.

They

need

the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Here is the interjection, by Mr. Brooks:
How many of these plants for the manufacture
of munitions, shells, cases, and boxes are
located in the Maritime Provinces?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I rise to
a point of order. Is it permissible to read

verbatim in this House a speech delivered in
the other House?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
members, I should like to intervene, to suggest that my honourable friend from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) abstain from reading
any questions asked or comment made by
private members in the other House, and that
he limit himself, as I would limit myself, to
reading the official statement by the Minister.
Official statements by members of the Cabinet
are, in essence, memoranda from their respective departments, and could be produced here
by me. In beginning his speech, Hon. Mr.
Howe made it clear that he would rely upon
departmental notes or memoranda, and these
belong to the Senate as well as to the House
of Commons.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am sorry, and I
apologize.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourable senators, may I interject a remark? Last year,
as I could soon show by reference to our
Hansard, the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) objected to my
making any reference at all to a speech
delivered by a Minister in the other House,
on the ground that the Minister was not here
to reply. To that objection I responded that
neither was I present in the other House to
reply to the Minister. Then the honourable
gentleman from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
rose and asked how public business in this
country could be transacted if we were prohibited from discussing in the Senate a speech
made in another place. The honourable leader
is in danger of reversing himself.

66

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I admit the
difficulty. But would honourable members
not be agreeable to the reading here of an
official statement presented by a Minister
in the other House-a statement which I
myself could produce here?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is exactly
what I wanted to do last year. I was criticizing a statement presented in another place
by the Minister of National Defence; , a
statement that was in statement form. Now
the bonourable gentleman from Parkdale is
discussing something that was said by a
Minister in speech form, not in statement
form at all. I warn the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to be careful. He
has many years to live yet, and he may find
himself confronted with his own precedents
before he gets much older.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It would please me
better if the honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) placed the whole
of the Minister's speech on Hansard, without
reading it.
I want to say, incidentally, that I do not
at all agree with the idea that, in an
emergency like this, we cannot refer to statements made by Cabinet Ministers in the
House of Commons. In England the practice
is that when the Prime Minister makes a
statement to the Commons, a similar statement is made in the House of Lords by its
leader.
Hon. Mr.
method.

HAIG:

That

is

the

correct

Hon. Mr. TANNER: In that way both
Houses are simoultaneously informed. However, I do not want to suggest any additional
burdens for the honourable leader of this
House. Wben any statement with reference
to the war is made in the other House by the
Prime Minister or any other Minister, we
should bc at liberty, I think, to discuss it here.
We should regard it as a statement, not to
the House of Commons alone, but to Parliament as a wvhole.
lon. Mr. QUINN: lonourable members, I
want to take exception to the statement of
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. ?MIur(lok) about Maritimers looking for
jobs.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I raised a
point of order, and I am still speaking to it.
Under our Rules it is not permissible to read
here a statement made in another place. If
the honourable gentleman from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) or the honourable leader
of the House (lon. Mr. Dandurand) wishes
to present to us facts and figures given by a
Minister in another place, he can get them
off by heart and deliver them to us in a
statement of his own. Then we are free to ask
questions about the statement, and to criticize
it. I submit it is not proper to read us a
Minister's speech. My objection is in accordance with the point taken last year on the
occasion referred to by the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach).
Mr. Speaker, I press for a ruling that a
speech made elsewhere cannot be quoted
verbatim here.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. J. A. CALDER: I well remember the
incident that occurred last session, as referred to
by my honourable friend from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach), and the position then
taken by the leader of the Covernment. Quite
frankly, I think the question involved in the
point of order is a difficult one to decide, but
it seems to me that if every senator is not
at liberty at any time to refer to an official
statement made by a Minister in the other
Chamber, this House cannot properly carry
on its business unless the leader of this House
presents that statement here as soon as
possible.
However, since it would be inconvenient, at
least, tbat the leader of the Senate should
have to do that on every occasion, I ihinmk a
committee of this House should diligently consider the advisability of amending the rule
prohibiting our referring to statements of fact
(I am not speaking of mere opinions) which
Ministers of the Crown bave given in the othber
place. In my opinion it would be better to
deal with the matter in this way than to
attempt on this occasion anything in the
nature of a final ruling.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman from Parkdale lias not finished his
speech.

Hon. Mr. DANDTIURAND:
I am of the
same opinion, and I suggest that His Ionour
the Speaer suspend his ruling on the point.
I woild( dirzw tlhe ai
of
o
Ite House to
the fact thiat IhPe addre
of the honourable
gentleman from New Glasgow (Hon. Mr.
Cantley) is based on the very statement
which Mr. Howe made in the House of Commons and which the honourable senator quoted.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: I can tell him of some
others, not Maritimers, who went looking for
jobs.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And read in part.
T understand that the rule as to reading has
often been ignored.

Hon.

Mr.

GRIESBACH.

MAY 29, 1940
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: According
to our rule, I do not think we are allowed
even to refer to a statement made in the
other House. I cannot say that I myself have
strictly lived up to the rule.
An Hon. SENATOR:
be such a rule?

Why should there

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may be
open for reconsideration, but in the absence
of such a rule I can see great danger of this
House becoming a sort of counter-debating
complement of the other House.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

It is one Parliament.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes; but
the matter is not as readily decided as the
honourable member thinks. If the rule were
abrogated, cross-firing would become the order
of the day, and each House would not be a
separate branch of Parliament, as was intended
by the Constitution. I quite agree with the
honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) that there have been other offences,
but it seems to me that when the rule is
invoked it should be applied and a decision
given. We have not always invoked the rule,
nor have the Commons always observed a
similar rule. I can give the name of the
offender who stood up in the other House and
made a violent reply to me-and he was not
a minor figure in the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

The leader.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The leader
himself. I knew he would be identified by
the senator from Kitchener, as very likely
he heard the reply made.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It was not the leader
of the Government either.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
of the Government?

The leader

Hon. Mr. EULER: I was thinking of the
Leader of the Opposition.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then the
offence is aggravated; it is worse than I
thought it was. According to the rule we cannot refer to a statement made in the other
House. If the rule is invoked, let us observe
it. If we are to reconsider our rules, I am
willing to sit down and do so. It may be, as the
honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) bas said, that an official statement
should be distinguished from remarks made in
the course of debate. That is a matter for
later consideration. While the rule continues
anyone bas the right to invoke it and ask
for a decision.

67

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
during my long career in this Chamber I
have observed the rule. When dealing with
a speech delivered in the other House, instead
of quoting it from Hansard, I have said,
" I have read such and such a statement as
reported in the press."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I deeply regret it
if I have in any way trespassed against the
rules of this House, but I do not think I
have undertaken to do anything that bas not
been done on other occasions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would it not
be well to have the rule stated by the Speaker
and his decision on the point of order? I
think the honourable senator from Winnipeg
South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) is right.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I was wondering
whether the honourable senator had concluded
his remarks on the point of order. Generally
speaking, in the Senate the rule bas been as
stated. If the honourable gentleman insists
on his point of order, I shall have to render
a decision.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, if the rules
are to be reviewed and the rule in question
is to be amended, I will not press my point
of order. I raised it for the reason that last
session the honourable member from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) did not, in my
opinion, get what I may term a " square deal."
In view of the ruling then given, I do not
think the honourable member from Parkdale
should now be allowed to do precisely what
my honourable friend from Edmonton was
then prevented from doing. In other words,
what is sauce for the goose should be sauce
for the gander. If the general opinion is
that we should not have such a rule, I have
no objection to its cancellation. I have no
personal feeling against the honourable senator
from Parkdale. I always enjoy his speeches.
In fact, when he rises he usually puts me in
mind of my old fighting arena in the Legislature of Manitoba. Still, I think the rules
should be enforced.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Again I wish to
express my sorrow if I have trespassed against
the rules of this House. I certainly would
not have spoken at all but for the fact that I
understood my honourable friend from New
Glasgow (Hon. Mr. Cantley) repeatedly towhat shall I say?-pervert or misquote statements made on the subject of munitions by
the competent Minister in the other House,
and I was only trying to place on the record,
immediately after~ my honourable friend's
speech, the actual statements of the Minister
in respect of munitions. I refrain from read-

SENATE
ing another short paragraph, because I think
I have quoted all the important facts that,
in ny opinion, rny honourable friend from
New Glasgow tried to pervert.
It seerns to me that my honourable friend
the junior senator froin Winnipeg referred the
other day with great enthusiasm to the fact
that we were not building tanks and antiaireraft guns. Who, might I ask, is handling
this war on behalf of the British Empire?
The other day J received a copy of a telegram
from a barrister in Toronto expressing extreme
dudgeon because there were no Canadian
troops on Vimy Ridge to proteet the fine
monument placed there to commemorate
mernbers of the Expeditionary Force who
made the supreme sacrifice in the last war.
Who has authority to dispose of our Canadian
troops after they reach England? Who bas
the ordering of tanks and anti-aircraft guns?
Is sone picayune barrister in Toronto to
decide where the First, Second, or Third
Division of our overseas forces should be
stationed? Is he running the show? If so,
i an all out of gait in iny understanding.
In the last war we equipped and sent our
sons to help the Mother Country in the war
against Gernany. My understanding is-and
let someone get down to brass tacks and
correct me if J am wrong-that the saine
condition applies now. I am sure that during
the last week Goebbels in bis propaganda
bas referred to the fact stated by my honourable friend the senator froi WinnipegHon. Mr. McMEANS: No, no. I am the
senator froin Winnipeg. I never made any
such stateient.
Hon. Mr. MUIRDOCK: I said the junior
senator from Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Excuse me, you did
not. You said " the senator from Winnipeg."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I beg my bonourable friend's pardon. I am referring to Senator
John Haig, from Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
for his sins.

Do not blame me

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I rise to
a point of order. Has the honourable senator
from Parkdale the right to refer to a senator
by naine? I submit his reference should be
stricken from the record.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If the honourable senator from Winnipeg South-Centre insists, no doubt the honourable senator from
Parkdale will withdraw.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
J am sorry if I
have hurt anybody's sensibilities, but I was
grieved and distressed the other day when I
heard ny honourable friend the junior senator
from Winnipeg make his statement, because
I believed Goebbels and his propaganda ministry would get it first-hand and broadcast it
throughout Germany to show his countrymen
what Canada was not doing. My honourable
friend, I am sure, knows as well as I do
that there are substantial reasons why no
tanks and no anti-aircraft guns are being built
in Canada, and his judgnent is just as good
as mine.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Tell us the
reason.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The reason is that
Great Britain bas not asked for thein.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Poor excuses.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Somebody says,
"poor excuses." In other words, while Great
Britain is handling this war, and Canada, New
Zealand, Australia and South Africa are cooperating and sending the supplies and the
men needed, it is a poor excuse te say that
we should hold the view that the British authorities w-ould request the tbings most needed
for the proper conduet of the war.
Hon. Mr. QTINN:
Whbat about the air
training scheme, the other request of the
British Government?
The air training
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
schene, as my honourable friend froin BedifordHalifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn) knows, is in an
le knows that
entirely different position.
the scheme was initiated and has since been
dominated and controlled by the British Government. I think, regardless of bow sone
gentlemen wouild like to disparage Canada's
connection therewitlh, this country- has been
doing a fairly good job in going forward with
the desired work in connection with the Empire
air training scheme.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Two years late.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: I rise to a point of
order. The air training seherne has nothing
to do with the question under discussion, introduced by the ionourable senator from New
Glasgow (Hon. Mr. Cantley), which deals
with munitions. I think if all iembers would
during these critical times try to make themselves as little offensive as possible in debate
we should get along very mucli better.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: "All members," I say.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

cludes me as well.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

Yes.

I judge that in-

MAY 29, 1940
Thanks. I do
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
not think it is necessary for me to take up
much more time. I would not have said a
word in this debateAn Hon. SENATOR:

You should not have.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am quite sure
the honourable gentleman would hold that
view. I would not have said a word except
for the fact that in my judgment my honourable friend was undertaking to disparage,
misquote and misrepresent the activities of
the Canadian Government in rallying Canada
as best they can to the assistance of the
Mother Country and the Empire carrying
forward this war.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators-Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: How wise my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. McRae)
was in deciding not to start the ball rolling
yesterday!
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: And I am not going to
start any ball rolling to-day.
The speech of the honourable gentleman
from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) has
afforded me an opportunity to smile, a facial
exercise I have not enjoyed during the last
two days. I would summarize his remarks by
saying he would appear to be quite satisfied
with fighting next year's war, if I may so
express it.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I correct my
honourable friend as to that? He is entirely
wrong. I am satisfied that to date we have
done as much as we could do, and as well as
we did before.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I do not wish to start
any argument. I regret that the debate has
taken the form it has.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Let us forget the election. Let us refrain from raising the question
which brings that back to the minds of many
honourable senators, and let us approach
matters in the calm atmosphere which makes
for useful deliberation.
I rise only to speak with respect to tanks.
I do so for the reason that I have had perhaps
more experience in that line than most honourable members. I well remember the time,
in the later stages of the last war, when Sir
Albert Stern, as he became later-for he was
knighted because of his work in that regardcame to me to have a man taken on my staffan American, afterwards assigned to the British
for pay and allowances. I remember him very

69

well as he came into the office to register. He
was a tall, lanky Yankee who gave his address
as Peoria, Illinois, and he was an expert mechanic of the Caterpillar Tractor Company.
That was the beginning of tanks in warfare.
The caterpillar tractor was undoubtedly the
ancestor of the tank.
The first caterpillar tractor I can remember
was one that was used for hauling logs on icy
roads into Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, thirtyseven years ago. It was a wood-burner. Since
then there has been a great transformation
in the caterpillar tractor. To-day we have
in our forests 120-horsepower caterpillar
tractors which are pushing their way through
dense forests and up mountain-sides on an
economic basis which would be impossible
by any other method. I happen to have in
the Yukon Territory two 90-horsepower caterpillar tractors building roads, and when I tell
you that in less than two months I was able
to build twenty miles of road you will get
some idea of the power of those machines.
The modern caterpillar tractor burns Diesel
oil. It cannot be operated on gasoline, the
reason being that when you stall a gasoline
engine it stops, and you have to start it again.
The Diesel engine, which is now used, operates
much like a steam engine and does not stall,
even when overloaded. In a country like
that in which I am operating, thirty miles
from the Arctic Circle, I would not use
gasoline if you gave it to me for nothing,
for it is an accepted fact that in such work
a gasoline engine is from four to five times
as costly as a Diesel engine.
In a recent report, which would appear ta
be authentic, it is stated that the new German
Diesel engine is ten times as efficient as the
gasoline engine. That does no-t necessarily
refer to cost. In war you do not measure
cost, for money signifies nothing. The mean,
ing is tiat only one-tenth as much fuel has
to be transported, and the reduction in quantity is a matter of some importance. If we
may believe the reports, the Germans have
made great advances with their Diesel engine.
Undoubtedly, Diesel engines are absolutely
essential in tanks. It is true that in this
country we make no Diesel engines, or at
least none of a type that meets the requirements of tanks. But we have in this country
branches of American plants which make these
120-horsepower caterpillar tractors, and it is
no great step from a tractor to a tank. The
basic structure of a tractor is practically the
same as that of a tank. Of course, it would
have to be protected and a house or room
would have to be built on it for guns and
men. Certain changes might have to be made
in order to arm the vehicle against an enemy.

70

SENATE

It is said there are a number of manufacturers in Canada who can make tanks, and
I have no reason to doubt that statement.
In any event, there are two or three companies in the United States, such as the
International Harvester Company, who could
make tanks; and if they could produce them
in quantities we could secure all we want at
a reasonably early date.
I am not familiar with what the eighty-ton
German tanks possess in the way of power.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:

And armour plate.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: And armour plate.
Tanks to-day are very rugged vehicles and
are heavily armoured.
The frames might
have to be stiffened, and the treads would
have to be widened sufficiently to enable them
to run over soft ground. But that is only a
detail. I am satisfied beyond question that
tanks can be built in Canada, although at the
present time even caterpillar tractors are not
built here, because there is not a sufficient
demand. However, plants across the line, such
as that of the International Harvester Company, are engaged in making caterpillar
tractors, and I am satisfied that if they were
furnished with blueprints they could turn out
tanks within a few months.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is said that the
armour plate is four inches thick, and that
there is no factory in Canada which could
make it.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Quite so; but I understand that in the last war we reached a point
where we could turn out that kind of plate.
Since then there has been no demand for it.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The honourable member from New Glasgow (Hon. Mr. Cantley)
did not hear the statement with respect to
armour plate, but when I drew it to his attention he said armour plate could be made in
New Glasgow.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I have no doubt it
could be made, but I do not think it is made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Neither are the
engines.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: That is quite right.
The engines would have to be imported.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company offered to build
tanks, relying on the importation of plate
and engines.
Hon. Mr. MoRAE: While it would be desirable to have the plate made in Nova Scotia,
we are facing a definite emergency, and I
think that in the meantime we should find two
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

or three companies in the United States who
turn out what I call battleship plate for the
Government of that country. It would undoubtedly be necessary in the immediate future to
import plate and Diesel engines, but there
is no reason why, if a sufficient output were
required, those things could not be made in
Canada within six or eight months. The
question is whether there would be a suflicient
demand after the war to justify such an undertaking.

New, I have a suggestion to make te the
Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Unless my honourable friend bas almost finished his remarks,
I would ask him to suspend them in order that
I may introduce a Bill which should receive
the Royal Assent at five-thirty.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I am almost finished.
I would suggest that in this energency we
should forgo the idea of building these tanks in
Canada for immediate requirements and should
approach one or more of the companies who
do build tractors and ask them to inform us
how many tanks they could deliver, say
within the next ninety days, and by the end
of the year, if we made a contract with them
under which we would protect them on their
capital investment. I am in favour of having
this work done by private industry, by men
who are familiar with the business and cen
get results in production.
WAR APPROPRIATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 18, an Act for granting to
His Majesty aid for national defence and
security.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

With leave

of the Senate, I move that second reading be

given now. This is a money Bill, of considerable importance, and I am quite sure all honourable members are sufficiently familiar with
the measure to deal with it this afternoon.
I will read the explanatory notes accompanying the Bill:
This Bill provides for the payment out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fond of a sum not
exceeding $700,000,000
in addition to the
ordinary grants of Parliarnent towards defraying expenses incurred by or under the authority
of the Governor in Council during the current

fiscal year inter alia for the security, defence,
peace, oider and welfare of Canada. Authority
is also granted to borrow the surm of $700,000,-

000 for any of the purposes set out in the Bill.

71

MAY 29, 1940
A similar Act (The War Appropriation Act,
1939) was passed at the session of Parliament
held in September, 1939.
The requirements of particular services on
war account will depend on the course and progress of the war in circumstances which cannot
now be foreseen. Therefore, it is clearly unwise
to attempt to make specific allocations of the
total appropriation to particular services. It
is nevertheless desired that members of Parliament shall have the usual opportunities for
discussion of expenditures which may be made
under various headings. Accordingly, there is
set out below a list of the principal objects of
expenditure under the Department of National

Defence and a list of the other departments
for which provision for expenditures on war
account is now known to be necessary.
The list then follows. I confess I was somewhat surprised to notice the number of departments concerned in war activities. The Minister of Finance told me that in this respect
the Bill is similar to legislation passed in the
Great War. I asked him to give me some idea
of the war activities of departments other than
the Department of National Defence, and he
has furnished the following statement:

Refunds may cause a further slight decrease in the above figures.
I hope this explanation of the Bill will be
satisfactory to honourable members.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I do net rise to express
opposition to this measure, but I feel I owe
it to the House to contribute what I can to
avoidance of any confusion as to my position,
at least, in relation to the tenure in office of
the Administration, having regard to its
history and its war achievements. Certainly
no one is less desirous of adding bitterness
to a discussion now than I am, and though
my convictions on this subject are deep, I
will seek to avoid that result.
We find ourselves in the most solemn
moment of our history.
It is an easy
thing, and it does net take much ability, to
say we are all behind the Administration,
applauding its efforts and supporting it. J
admit that at a time like this we should not
lightly refuse confidence to any government,
and while it is in office we should, for the
time being, help it in its efforts. But I have
already said this session that I do not think
the country can have confidence in this Government as it is now constituted. I say again
the Government should take stock of its
position, and make up its mind whether it can
command public confidence at this time, for
without that, whatever be its composition,
it cannot succeed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

We have had some discussion on the state
of our present war effort, as to tanks, as to
planes, and as to many of the various classes
of war equipment.
The facts are, as we
know, that we have none of these things on
hand ready to bc used in the struggle now
raging at its crucial stage. There are certain
planes on order, but after looking through
the statement made by the honourable leader
of this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) I should
conclude these are mainly preliminary training
planes. They, not others, are on order for
Canada. A very few fighting planes, such as
the Hawker-Hurricane, bave been and are
being produced for the British Government,
but there are none of them in Canada for the
training of our men. I believe a number of
preliminary training planes are on hand, and I
am at a loss to know why they have not been
employed for training purposes. I am sure
the Government will net dispute that training
planes have been lying idle, and training
grounds as well, for nearly two months. At
Edmonton, particularly, and at many other
points besides, preliminary training at least
might have been going on for some considerable time and to a vastly greater extent than
it has, if indeed it is going on at all even yet.
We have no large guns.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Ordnance guns.

MAY 29, 1940
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. We
have a considerable amount of small arms
ammunition. But as to the main weapons of
war we are just simply without them,
and it is no information to the enemy
to say so. For myself, I do not care
what any Minister says, he will never
convince me that if we had started in
time we could not produce any kind of tanks
in this country. I do not say we can produce
tanks at once-I know the publie expects
them to fall from Heaven-but if we had
started when we should have started we could
have produced them for our forces; and
undoubtedly we need them for our forces,
no matter what any Government may
say. Nobody would suggest at this time that
any outside country is in a position to supply
tanks. During the last war we were told,
"You cannot make this and you cannot make
that implement of war." But they were made.
It is marvellous what can be donc under the
spur of a terrible compulsion if there be
the will and the prevision. It may be, as the
senator behind me says, that we shall at first
have to import Diesel engines from Chicago.
It may even be, though I scarcely think so,
that we shall have to import the harder steel,
but I know that during the last war we
hardened steel in Canada. I am not sure we
have done so since, but that we can there is
no question. The 4-5-inch steel is needed
for the big tank, what is called the Mark IV;
but for tanks up to that dimension it is not.
My information is, and I rely on it, that
these other tanks we could have made right
along. We have not done so. I do not
excuse the Government in this respect or in
respect of our lateness in the manufacture
of fighting and air training machines by the
conduet of any other administration. I am
surprised that this Government in particular
should venture to suggest that, having declared
war on behalf of Canada, it permits itself to
be held back from the proper prosecution of
the conflict under pretence of the conduct
of any other GovernmentHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

attitude.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend allow me to interject one
word?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Commonwealth Air Training Scheme, which was
initiated on the other side, provided for
certain large works, representing $350,000,000,
to lie undertaken by this Government. Great
Britain's contribution was to be in kind, and
undoubtedly this meant the aircraft which
will be required for training. Su we are in
this position, that we have to rely upon the
terms of the agreement, and have been waiting
for those machines. We were getting some
from the United States, but Great Britain
stepped in there-I do not complain-and
asked for the very type of aircraft that we
could buy there, and so paralysed Canada's
action in the American market. That is a
fact. I wonder if there is any excuse in
explaining that situation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable leader has probably assisted me in making
clear what I want to make clear to this House
and particularly to himself. I shall not dispute his assertion that in the air training
scheme, as finally evolved, after all the resistance to the British proposal which this GovernmentHon. Mr. EULER: There never was any
resistance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What? To
the British proposal to establish their own
training schools?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I understood my right
honourable friend to refer to the Commonwealth Air Training Scheme.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

No.

Hon. Mr. EULER: I desire to repeat what
I said: there never was any opposition to the
British receiving training in this country,
even under the original scheme.

The statement might

see any ground for misinterpretation-nor for
interruption. This Government said it would
take the responsibility for training, and insisted
on its own administration as evidence of our
new nationhood.
But before the Government did that it resisted the British proposal,
and by its resistance it defeated the proposal
that the British authorities themselves would
train their air men in Canada. Can honourable members imagine an ex-Minister denying
that that stand was taken by his Government?
Why, his leader boasted that his Government
had resisted the proposal and baffled it.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Do not tell
me this is the proposal which came from
London.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Does my right honourable friend really reject the statement that
the Commonwealth Air Training Scheme was
initiated by the British Government?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly. The
training scheme of the British Government
was the training scheme described by the
Prime Minister himself in the other House
on July 1, 1938, and refused by him.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No. My right honourable friend made the statement-he will correct me if I am wrong-that we initiated the
Commonwealth Air Training Scheme. That
is not according to the facts. The proposal
came direct from the British Government, and
from no other source.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
know how to describe the honourable member's statement. "Hair-splitting" is not the
apt word.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We all know
that.

Hon. Mr. EULER:
splitting; it is the fact.

Hon. Mr. EULER:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. The
British Government proposed a plan of its
own to establish here in Canada air training
schools, which it would administer and in
which, at its own expense, it would train
pilots for the British Air Force.

Which was accepted

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Anything we proposed to the British Government would without any question be accepted

The British authorities were told, many weeks
after, that we would take care of training

MAY 29, 1940
under our own administration. That led to
the present air training scheme. Very well.
Having entered on the present air training
scheme, a co-operative arrangement among
all the Dominions, with Britain supplying
certain things in kind, we are now told the
British Government cannot supply them. That
may be. Under the exigencies of this hour
I do not wonder we have got into this position. But everybody must know and must
admit that if we had permitted the British
authorities to start at the time they wanted
to, whatever may have been the size of the
scheme as first planned, it would have grown
as the peril grew. We are in our present
position because we first rejected it and some
time after negotiated for another plan. We
entered into this other plan. We may have
got the British Government to propose it
finally as its own-I do not know-but for
us to say now, "This is your plan, and if
it does not work don't blame us," is not
courageous.
We do not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
say so, but we do say, "You indicated a threeyear plan."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very good.
All I am pleading is that the Government
discontinue this practice of saying, "The British
Government cannot do this, the British Government only asked for that," and at the same
time refusing .to this House .documents or
précis of telephone conversations, or whatever
they were, that would reveal the whole of
the facts. Now, when the Government, before
the people of Canada, seeks to lay the blame
on Britain, this should be remembered: the
British Government cannot defend itself. I
find no fault with this Administration for
not at this time producing documents. I know
it cannot be done without the consent of the
British Government. I know the British Government will raise no quarrel with Canada,
no matter what any member of this Cabinet
may say; but while the British Government
is in that position, unable to explain the
matter or to defend itself, surely it is not
courageous on the part of this Administration to seek to explain, if things are not
going as fast as they should go, that it is
the fault of another Government. The blame
is not there; it is here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is no
blame here.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No blame?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There are no

Hon. Mr. EULER: Much better.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Reasons for
not attaining results will not win a war.
I do not care how many reasons you give,
you can win a war only with munitions and
men.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is my right
honourable friend speaking of the British or
of the Canadian Government?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Canadian
Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, not the
British Government?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am speaking
of the Canadian Government's failure, and
I am speaking most earnestly about it. The
time from which dates our present failure
was not this spring; it was not last winter,
nor last fall, nor a year ago. Our failure
dates from years gone by, and I shall seek
to review its history, because that is vastly
important. It may not cure anything that is
past, but I do hope it will cure certain practices
for all time to come.
We were told by the leader of the House
there was a starving of our defences during
the tenure of the late Administration. Perhaps
there was.
Hon. Mr. KING: There is no perhaps
about it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Let us admit
there was. A depression was all about us.
There was at least the establishment at
Valcartier of an arsenal, which this Government abandoned. I admit that was not
enough. But surely we all know this. Those
were the days when, unwisely, as events have
proven, we, in common with other nations of
the world, all making the same mistakesHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Exactly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -relied upon
what we called collective security. We relied
upon a principle, as we then described it,
which turned out to be little better than a
phrase. That error was common in countries
more important in this conflict than we are.
That we erred along with others in that
respect, let us all admit. Very well. Clouds
of war arose, and as they arose the value of
League of Nations security, in the eyes of
the world, vanished. The value of that
security was pretty well gone after a couple
of years of Hitler ascendancy in Germany;
it was gone at the time of the invasion of
Ethiopia, and it became realized more and
more that again the time was coming when
arms, and arms alone, would save our liberties

and our lives. The Prime Minister of our
country bas told us that the clouds of war
hovered over his head two years before the
storm broke. I do not wonder that clouds
were hovering overhead. I cannot imagine
anybody believing otherwise who looked at
the world from the elevation at which he
stood.
Those conditions date from even
beyond the Munich affair, and that occurred
in the fall of 1938. They date from about
1936.
Hon. Mr. KING: From 1933.

Britain was very positive in 1933, and gave

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The difference is very marked. With the clouds of
war hovering as far back as even 1937, how,
to use the words of the Prime Minister, can
any Government be excused for not providing true defences for this country, the result
being that we have nothing to fight with
now? I shall give you the answer the leader
of this House gave the other day, and it is
the only answer. He said: "We did everything we could; we put through the House
of Commons everything we could get through.
We couldn't get any more done, the House
of Commons being as it was."

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the

the Government of Canada-that Government which must have publie confidence teday-tu present such au answer? Was their

of Canada.

With the people

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: "Oh," says
the leader of the House, "with the people
of the country." Against a school of opinion
represented in Parliament, we are told they
could go no faster. Furthermore, he said
that because of the strength of this school
of opinion they bad to proceed under cover
of pleading for defence of Canadian shores
in order to get the estimates through at all.
And that is true, as true as any words any
public man ever uttered.
But, I want to ask, who created that school
of opinion? Was it not those who throughout these years have been denouncing as
Imperialists all who wanted to stand with
Britain in defence? Have we not heard that
taunt hurled througout the length and
breadh of this country, all through these
years? The honourable gentleman himself
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) bas huried it at me
right up to this very heur. All the Imperialism of which I have been guilty bas been
to demand that the Administration stand with
Britain, to aid Britain in defence, as the best
means of protecting Canada. That and nothing else. I do net know of anything more
discreditable in the history of this Dominion
than the deliberate course, pursued over a
period of years, of generating anti-Imperialist
sentiment. Who are the fathers of that sentiment? Who are the progenitors of that school
of opinion? Who are those who have fed
and fertilized and fostered it all through
these years? They are the honourable gentlemen at the hcad of the present Government.

power year after year by reason of support from no other sort of public opinion
than that? Who capitalized on it election

selling your country for votes. And those
who have talked thus of Imperialism, even
up to this hour-for it is only two days since
I was taunted with Imperialism by honourable gentlemen opposite-cannot now stand
up and say that because of that body of
opinion among their own followers they have
had to go slowly and can get little results.
All of it has gathered under their wing. They
are the profiteers of that campaign, and they
have profited election after election. They
themselves are the progenitors of the lions
which, they now complain, stand in their path.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the right
honourable gentleman is getting the whip he
himself manufactured.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no. You
will never find anything to encourage that
thought.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about the
vote of the people for war?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
mind ordinary interruptions, but the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) always turns me back about an
hour, because he does not seem to be up to
what I am saying.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Asking embarrassing
questions?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. The
honourable gentleman could not embarrass
anyone except by noise.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Tell us about the
proposal to have the people of Canada vote.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Undoubtedly
I made it, and I would have dono just that
had I been in office at the outbreak of this
war. But I never would have had an election
on a party basis. I would have formed a
Government inclusive of every element that
stood for our war policy, and then I would
have sought a mandate, for a mandate has
proved essential in this country in the conduct
of a long conflict; and in that contest I would
have supported, no matter what his party,
every candidate who stood behind the war.
Of the obtaining of a mandate I do not
complain. I only complain that the appeal
was on a party basis, and that men, all of
whom supported the Administration in its war
declaration, were marked for defeat by the
very men who had just said they wanted unity
in Canada. All this, though, comes from an
interruption, and is beside my purpose. What
I want to drive home is this. The anti-Imperialist appeal in this country, which took this
form one day and another form the nextthat we had nothing to do with Britain's war;
that our defence did not rest under the British
shield, but was something separate and apart,
or could be entirely ignored; that all thought
of war was Imperialism-has been all through
the years the main source of the political success of honourable gentlemen, the certain
source of their success, and they cannot plead
now, in the presence of the people of Canada,
that they should be excused for failure to surmount the difficulties which confronted them because all about were demons they themselves
had roused. Those men to whom they were
afraid to present the real facts and adequate

SENATE
estimates were their own followers; and those
men were elected by, and in the House had
reacted to, the very sentiments which the
Government did not like to hear when the
day of danger came.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does my right
honourable friend not give credit to the Prime
Minister for having carried the whole of the
country into the war, with an increasing expenditure year by year? The Prime Minister
did that, but he did not divide the country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
a reason for confidence. He had no trouble
in carrying his political foes; he did not have
to address even a word to them. The trouble
he had was with his political friends, and he
had that trouble because of teachings of which
he was one of the fathers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No; because
my right honourable friend's friends had bedevilled the province of Quebec.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Let me
calmly ask a question. If this group was of
our creation, how did it come to be supporting the present Government? These people
were supporting the leader of the Government
of the day, and he was afraid to face them
with a programme that meant an adequate
discharge of the obligation of this country in
the war he feared.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The defence of
Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, the Government carried the country, it is true. But
how? In the province of Saskatchewan it
was on the promise of moderate participation; in other provinces it was on the promise
that we would go so far, but would not do
anything to embarrass the finances of Canada.
That kind of carrying into war is of doubtful
value. Did the Government carry the country in by rousing our people to a spirit of
immediate action?
Has anyone heard yet
from any member of the Administration one
single ringing appeal to rally tu the conflict?
I have not heard any. Was the spirit of this
country a week ago comparable with what
it was within ten days of the outbreak of the
last war? I say it was wholly different-and
there is no Canadian who does not know the
origin of that benumbing of the spirit of Canada. The Prime Minister has been associated
with the sort of Government whose leader in
this House at this very hour throws at me the
taunt of being an Imperialist and of looking
after the defence of Britain rather than that
of Canada. Such was his utterance only last
week. A Government so headed cannot command the confidence of Canada in a time of
crisis like this.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It cannot command the confidence of the Tory party.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It cannot
command the confidence of the people of
Canada, and it will not. The sooner the
Government realizes that, the better. Let the
members of the Government rest as long as
they like on the feather bed of an avalanche
of votes, if that satisfies them, but I warn
them that when the consequences of their
policies fall more heavily upon the country
they will wish they had never been provided
with that bed. The Government should follow
the advice I gave it a short while ago. It
will have to do so in time, and it had better
do so now.
I stand in front of the honourable leader
of this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), for
whom personally I have a high regard, and
I tell him again that this Government will
have to reorganize itself. Let it reorganize
itself now, let it unite all who are behind
this war, and let it have at its head one who
is deadly in earnest about the war and who
still has the confidence of a considerable part
of the country. There are men of that kind
even within the Government's ranks. But
let the Government not remain as it is to-day,
headed by those who are responsible for the
troubles which now have to be met, who
created the state of public opinion now or
until lately existing, who all through recent
years have pursued a course which has discouraged and dampened British sentiment in
this country, and who because of such conduct are responsible for no small measure
of the hardships and the griefs through which
we, in common with the Motherland, have
now unhappily to pass.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I have but a few minutes in which to
reply to my right honourable friend; se my
remarks must be brief. I would draw attention
to the fact that he suggests as an ideal Prime
Minister a colleague of the present Prime
Minister.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggested,
net an "ideal" Prime Minister, but a much
better one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, virtually
ideal, at all events. My right honourable
friend rests his confidence on one who is a
colleague of mine in the King Government.
He does not see that that colleague and all
the other members of the Cabinet have been
selected by the present Prime Minister, te
whom they look for inspiration, whom they
have known since 1922 and longer, and who
stands as their leader. It is strange, indeed,
that the Tory party, while attacking the

MAY 29, 1940
Prime Minister, admits that many of his
colleagues stand high in public esteem throughout the country. I want to tell my right
honourable friend that all these colleagues
have been sitting with the Prime Minister
daily, that they recognize him as one standing
higher than they do in political acumen, in
common sense and in clear judgment, and that
they would never for a moment think of
beheading the present Cabinet unless they all
went out of office with him. So if the old
Tory guard which is congregated in this
Chamber to-day, and whicli perhaps represents "the last square of Waterloo,'' thinks
that by its recriminations and cries it can
frighten the Liberal party and members of
the present Cabinet, and weaken their confidence in the Right Honourable William
Lyon Mackenzie King, it is vastly mistaken
and it will be disappointed.
Yes, there is a difference between my right
honourable friend and myself. We were born
in different atmospheres. He is, as I said,
an Imperialist to the core. I am a Canadian,
whose roots in this country are three hundred
years old. I would remind him that a good
Scotsman, by the name of John Buchanwho later became Lord Tweedsmuir-said a
Canadian's first duty was to Canada, and that
the first interest Canadians had to defend was
Canada.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: But net the only
interest.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: First Canada,
and then the Empire. Se we are at one
with a strong man, whose native home was
not in this country. He studied the situation,
and he said that the first duty of a Canadian
was to Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Who says
anything else?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will refer to a
well-known incident which shows how far
apart my right honourable friend and the
present Prime Minister stand. In 1922 Mr.
David Lloyd George, te whom Providence
might have been kinder if it had closed his
career on the llth of November, 1918, wanted
to know whether Canada would send troops
te Chanak. In the Great War Canada had
already lest 60,000 men and had 100,000
wounded; and we were faced with a Treasury
deficit of $100,000,000, plus a railway deficit
of an equal amount. Se the Canadian Government, headed by the present Prime Minister,
asked the British authorities for further
information as to the necessity of our sending
troops. My right honourable friend went te
Toronto and said that our Prime Minister
showed no sympathy with the British Govern-

79

ment, and that if lie had been in office he
would have replied to the inquiry, " Ready,
aye ready." He would have made that reply
although at the time we were net ready te
send troops. The people were behind us in
that stand, and they are behind us now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have the
right to answer a statement referring to myself.
This is net the first time my honourable
friend has related that story, but perhaps he
has never chosen a more inopportune time
than now.
What the honourable gentleman refers te
is this. At the close of the last war a treaty
was made with Turkey, a treaty negotiated
with that country by representatives of Great
Britain, the Allies and Canada. In the signing of that treaty Canada acted as a separate
nation, or, to put it better, as an individual
nation. Ratification was moved in the Canadian Commons by the present Prime Minister.
A time came later when, because of Turkish
aggression, Great Britain considered the question of holding Turkey to the terms of lier
treaty. I presume the British Government
nourished the idea that we, as parties to that
treaty, would have some interest in it. I
personally assumed that since the Dominion
signed the treaty as a separate nation, an
individual nation, we probably had some
remote interest in the integrity of that treaty.
The British Government indicated to us the
line they thought of taking and asked if we
cared te be represented in any way in any
action that might be taken. That, and that
alone, was the inquiry. I ask honourable
members on both sides of the House: Was
there anything improper in that inquiry? On
the contrary, was it net an inquiry which
Canada was entitled te have made to it?
Or should the British Government have
assumed that our signature represented only
a concession te our vanity, that our interest
in the treaty ended when we had signed it,
and that whether its terms were carried out
or it was torn te tatters by other parties was
no concern of ours?
At any rate, the Canadian Governmuent
repulsed the inquiry. In doing se it acted
directly in line with the course of conduct of
which I have complained this afternoon. That
was just another illustration of the course
this Govemment invariably had pursued in
order to cater to that school of opinion which
is opposed te co-operation in any way with
Great Britain in matters of defence. After
our reply to the British Government's inquiry
was known, I made a statement to this
effect: that when Britain appealed to us in
regard te a treaty te which we were a party
-a treaty we had signed quite independently

SENATE

of her-we should at once have shown interest
in that treaty and stood ready to examine
with her our course of action. Never did I
say we should have been ready to fight at
once merely because Great Britain thought of
fighting. Not at all. That is only a misrepresentation which has been made down
through the years, and never more frequently
than by the honourable leader of the Government in this House.
But my right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend said he would have replied,
"Ready, aye ready."
Certainly,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
but I did not say " Ready, aye ready, to
fight merely if called upon."
Hon. Mr. EULER:
mean, then?

What did the statement

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: It meant
that we should have replied we were ready,
aye ready, for an examination, in a sympathetic attitude, of our duty.
Hon. Mr. EULER:
preted it that way.

Nobody

else

inter-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Everybody
who heard it interpreted it that way, but
nobody interpreted it that way after misrepresentations became current throughout
Canada. Certainly our reply to the inquiry
should have been sympathetic. We had the
right and duty to sit down and discuss what
we ought to do. And I want to express this
belief: that when this war is over, and when
in the providence of God we emerge victorious,
and we enter into treaties, even a Government
composed of honourable gentlemen opposite
would not say, "We have no further interest
in those treaties, and we should be offended
if the British Government asked us whether
we were ready to co-operate with them to
sec those treaties respected." I think that
when we sign treaties we have at least some
duty towards securing their observance by
all parties. We should have replied to the
British Government at once in a spirit of
common interest, in a spirit of "Ready, aye
ready," as those words had before been used
by Sir Wilfrid Laurier himself on the floor
of the House of Commons. It may have been
our duty to insist on reconsideration of the
treaty, but certainly we were entirely wrong
in telling the British Government that we
had no more interest in the subject at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think Great
Britain recognized that we had led the way
towards peace by our refusal to join in the
Lloyd George proposal.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We are dealing
with a Bill te which we must give proper
consideration, and I insist on making a statement before the motion is put.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask my
honourable friend te forgo his speech, as it
may provoke another speech in reply.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As a private member I insist on my right te make a statement.
Righît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I can promise
there will be no reply.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is altogether te
the good to find this Senate unanimous in
encouraging energetic conduct of the war.
True, we are divided, those opposite thinking
we are not doing enough, those on this side
honestly believing that the very best that is
possible is being done.
Allow me to read from page 45 of the
Senate Hansard of 1934. I desire to give a
short extract to show the position taken by
honourable gentlemen opposite when they
were sitting on this side and when the distinguished general from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
MecRae) rose in his place and made a lengthy
speech. I quote this one paragraph:
We are a small nation-ten and a half
million people-to be taking part in this
European embroglio. We are far away from
the contineut of Europe. With the certainty
of war before us, J want to call the attention
of tbis honourable House and of the country
we have at this time
to the opportunity tat
to withdraw with honour froi the League of
Nations-an opportunity which subsequent
developments nay not afford. I appreciate the
seriousness of the statemeut that J am about
to make to this honourable House, but I am
giving my considered, definite opinion when I
say that I cannot conceive of any developmeunts
wbich would justify this country in sacrificing
the blood of one single Canadian on the future
battle-fields of Europe.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, bear.
Honourable members will notice the applause.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was not
from our side.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That was the doctrine in 1934: net "the blood of one single
Canadian on the future battlefields of
Europe." Yet to-day they are crying te high
Heaven, as the barrister in Toronto is,
because there are no Canadian soldiers on
Vimy Ridge to protect Canada's war memorial. Consistency, thou art a jewel!
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The bonourable gentleman knows that that was an
opinion expressed by an individual member
and had no support whatever from our side.

MAY 29, 1940
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It was received
with applause, according to the record.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable members,
in view of the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from Parkdale, I ask the indulgence of the Ilouse in order that I may reply
to him at once.
Of course I have changed my mind. Six
years ago, on my return from Europe, I was
so impressed with the certainty of war that
I took the only avenue open to me to present
that serious situation to this House, in the
hope that Canada might be withdrawn from a
catastrophe that seemed to me inevitable.
Much has happened in the meantime. Then
most honourable members regarded me as a
pessimist, but who by the wildest stretch
of the imagination could visualize the situation in which the world finds itself to-day?
Conditions have changed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

That is conceded.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: Our very liberties are
at stake, and it is the solemn duty of every
loyal Canadian to do his utmost to help the
Allies win this war.
On referring to Hansard of 1934, honourable
members will see the personal attack which the
right honourable member from Parkdale then
made on me. I was not in the House at the
time.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
honourable yet.

I am not a right

Hon. Mr. McRAE: Pardon me. The lionourable member from Parkdale. To-day he
again refers to my speech of 1934, whicli lie
appears to have carried in his memory from
that day to this. I ask him: Was he or was
I right six years ago in respect of the future?
Yet he has the temerity to-day to raise the
question in the same spirit that animated
him six years ago. Well, I am glad he has
done so. I gave expression to my. honest
conviction at a time when I felt war was a
certainty. I was depressed and discouraged
by the apathy I found in England and in
this country. I never thought we should find
ourselves in the critical situation we are in
to-day. As I have said, our liberties depend
on the outcome of the present struggle, and
I am proud to stand here and say that the
opinion I expressed six years ago has no
bearing on the situation to-day.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: I would remind the
honourable gentleman that I got no support
from either side of the House when I expressed that opinion. I knew I was giving
expression to an unpopular view, but, as I
say, I was so impressed by the seriousness of

the situation that, even at the risk of incurring
the displeasure of the honourable gentleman
from Parkdale, I placed my views before
the House. Apparently time has not tempered his resentment.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

IMMIGRATION

FROM BRITAIN
FRANCE

AND

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, last week the right honourable
leader on the other side questioned me concerning the attitude of the Government on
the immigration of British and French
citizens to Canada. I will read a letter on
the subject which I have received from Mr.
F. C. Blair, Director of the Immigration
Branch. On a certain point be may have
narrowed the inquiry of my right honourable friend, and, if so, I will ask Mr. Blair
to supplement his letter. He writes me as
follows:
Dear Senator Dandurand,
In response to your inquiries about what is
being done for British and French citizens who
desire to find shelter in Canada for the duration
of the war,That perhaps limits the idea expressed by
my right honourable friend.
-I
may say that these are being freely
admitted, the only requirement being that they

are in goo<d health and are either joining relatives or friends wbo can look after them here
or that they have sufficient funds to look after
tbemselves. Our officers in London and Paris
have standing instructions coveriog this movement.
The question may arise whether our practice
in this matter opens the door to persons liable
to becorne publie charges in Canada or allows
a niovement of those engaged in subversive
activities. You will observe that I have mentioned British and French citizens only. These
will travel on passports issued by their own
Goverrnent, and this, with such other protection as our own officers can supply, may be
accepted as a reasonable safeguard against the
creation of difficulties for Canada.
IEIGHEN: Mr. Blair
Right Hon. Mr.
has closely enough apprehended what I had
in mind. But I do not care even for restrictions at the present timne. J should like the
Government to make a positive offer to take
care of such citizens as desire to come, certainly for the duration of the war.
I notice Mr.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Blair says, "Our officers in London and Paris

general official statement might impart information of willingness on the part of Canada to receive British and French citizens.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course it
would be necessary to confer with the two

manhood to emigrate.

would not refuse asylum in Canada during
the war to any French or British child if he

two Governments would not allow people to
come here who might be objectionable on
certain grounds.

o'clock.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I desire to
say a word on the motion. J would not offer
any determîiied objection to our adjourning
until Tuesday, thougli I liatd rather expected
an adjournment until Monday. I would suggest to the leader of the House something
whicli I intended to mention to hini before,
but about which I iad no opportunity of
speaking witli hii after I iad discussed it
wifh one or two membcers on this side. It
seens to me that during the war, in order
that there be no failure' on the part of our
House to help by our presence at least, any
tinie we can, and to accclerate such measures
as iimy le urgent, if might be weil to change
the rules--I think they can be cianged, and
J know the rules in the other House were
changed-by resolution in order to enable His
Honour the Speaker in somie simple way to
call us together during an adjournmient. If
sucl a change in the rules were made, we
should all feel a little happier during adjournment, bccaus there would thci be no danger
of our failing fo he here when we ouglt to
be hîcre. A very simple amendment is all
that would be necessary, and it would apply
only for the duration.
I am very glad
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
MY right honourable friend bas made this suggestion, because I have often been somewhat
nervous as to what mighît happen during an
adjournment of the Senate, and have wondered
whether we could not delegate to His Honour
the Speaker some authority which would overcome the difficulty. I would ask His Honour
the Speaker to confer with the Clerk of the
House and the Law Clerk to see if some
change could be made in our procedure in
accordance with this proposal. He will have
from now until Tuesday next to examine into
the matter, and can then inform the two leaders

answers to some of my honourable friend's
questions. Some of these questions cannot
be answered, on the ground of public interest
and for the reason that the documents concerned come from Great Britain. To-morrow
I shall give answers to such of the questions
as can be answered.
The inquiry stands.
MANUFACTURE OF MILITARY
EQUIPMENT
INQUIRY

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Griesbach:
That he will draw the attention of the Senate
to the manufacture of military equipment in
Canada and will inquire of the Government as
follows:
1. Has the Government of Canada, either on
its own behalf or for the British Government,
let contracts in Canada for the manufacture
in Canada of: (a) machine guns; (b) threeinch mortars;

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am asked to
have this inquiry transformed into a motion
for papers. When this is done the answers
will be given.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: As the honourable
leader will observe, I gave notice that I
would draw the attention of the Senate to
the manufacture of military equipment in
Canada, and to the answers which I expected

te get in due course to my questions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

My honourable

friend may proceed with his discussion now
if he so desires, but it seems to me honourable

members would listen to him with greater
interest if they had before them the documents

which could be produced if we passed an order
for a return.

answers to my inquiry will be given by the
Government. Can the honourable leader give
any indication as to that? The subject is a
very pressing one, and I want to speak about
it without further delay.
Though my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend is, of course, quite familiar
with a number of the questions contained in
the inquiry, I am sure other honourable gentlemen are not, and I would suggest that he
defer discussion until I am able to furnish
the answers.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am quite willing
to do so if the honourable leader of the House
will give me some idea as to when the information will be forthcoming.
I will answer

meantime I would ask that the inquiry stand.

WAR CO-OPERATION
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN rose to move:
That a committee selected by the leaders of
the Senate be constituted for the purpose of
advising how best the memsbers of this House
can help the country in its war effort.
He said: Honourable members, this motion
requires little explanation on my part, but I
should like to say a word or two as to the
motive which prompted me to lay it before
you.
Undoubtedly the Senate contains a considerable number of competent and experienced

ment at the present tine have a very heavy
burden to carry. In view of these facts it
would seem to me worth while tiat a cornmittee selected by the leaders of this House
should canvass the situation and ascertain
whether souse of this burden could not be
shouldered, either within or without Parliament, by senators on both sides. Some members I have met are eager to help in the
work that dominates everything before us
to-day-the work of winning the war-but,
not knowing exactly what to do, they are
diffident about takine the initiative. They
would gladly help if asked to do so. My
proposal, therefore, is that a committee be
selected by the two leaders fer the purpose
of surveying the situation and ascertaining
what the members of this House can do, either
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

individually or as a body, towards helping in
war work, so that in the performance of their
duties they may play a larger part.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, my honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) bas for a
nuiber of weeks been much concerned about
what he and other members of the House
could do to help in the varions activities conducive to the winning of the war. I am quite
sure that a certain number of senators are
already, in their respective provinces, taking
an

active

part

in

the

various

organizations

that have been set up. My ionourable friend,
however, thinks it would be a good idea that
the two leaders should select a small committee to examine into suggestions that might
be made to members to co-operate individually
with varions organizations now functioning or
to be set up. He meets senators who say.
"I should like to do more than I am called
upon to do as a senator in attending the
sittings of this House." Nobody can gainsay
that that is a laudable sentiment, and I have
no objection to the motion of my honourable
friend.
I suppose, as the two leaders are mentioned in the motion, my right honourable
friend is of the same opinion.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I can
see some value that nay come from this
commsittee, although I know that in the conduet of the affairs of a nation constituted as
ours is, any work done outside of Government ranks must be the work of private citizens. No matter what public office one may
hold, whether as a parliamentarian or in any
other capacity, the Government must organize
such work and must lead and be in the forefront of the whole strugele. Nevertheless there
is now a task which, though under Government direction, will have to be very largely
performed by the citizens themselves; and I
fear tie necd for this work will increase. I
am one of those who do not share the confidence expressed by the Minister of Justice
as to the thoroughness of the control being
exercised in respect of subversive elements in
this Dominion, elements which, though now
perhaps believed to be understood, assume
a wholly different character and course of
conduct as danger to the State draws nearer;
and it does seem to me that leadership
towards assisting the Government in this
respect may well be given by members of
this House, by members of the other House,
and bv public-minded citizens generally, and
that our example and possibly our inspiration may be of advantage.
The motion was agreed to.

JUNE 4, 1940

NAVAL SERVICE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received frorn the House
of Commons with Bill 2, an Act to amend the
Naval Service Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, everyone who is familiar with
our procedure knows that under our rules it
is necessary to give two days' notice of motion
for the second reading of a Bill. Should I
do so now, this Bill would have to be put
over until Thursday. As there is very little
on the Order Paper for to-morrow, and there
are, I suppose, eight or ten bills to come, I
was wondering whether, by unanimous consent of the House, we might not put the second
readings down for to-morrow, at which time
we could take up such of the measures as the
Senate was ready to consider. A number of
then are obviously non-contentious; others
may require some explanations. I am in the
hands of the House as to moving that second
reading of these bills be considered to-morrow,
and I should like to have the view of my
right honourable friend opposite.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I am
thoroughly in favour of our abandoning, sa
far as permitted by honourable membersand we all have the sarne right in this respect
-the rigidity of the rules, and of our seeking
ta advance legislation as rapidly as we can
consistently with knowing what we are doing.
I suggest that we go ahead to-night and pass
such bills as we can, reserving for to-morrow
those which we think require twenty-four
hours' notice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I shall
explain the Bill which is before us.
The purpose of this Bill is to make subject
to naval discipline persons who have agreed
ta serve as civilians in a particular ship or
in such ships as may be determined by the
Minister. These are persons who are not
members of the Canadian naval forces and
not eligible for all the benefits, such as
pension and so forth, applicable to such forces.
The Bill is identical in form with one passed
by the Parliament of the United Kingdom
to meet a similar situation arising in the
Royal Navy. It will avoid the emergence
of questions which arose at the end of the
last war with respect to persons employed in
the Canadian naval forces in a similar
capacity.

The Bill itself contains this explanatory
note:
The Naval Service Act, chapter 139 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, makes no
provision by which civilians serving with the
naval forces of Canada can be made subject to
naval discipline.
During the last war the situation was met
by enrolling such persons in the Royal Naval
Canadian Volunteer Reserve "for discipline
only." This procedure was not satisfactory, for
administrative reasons; it was open to certain
legal objections, and it gave rise to many claims
for war service compensation which, though not
legally admissible, were extremely difficult to
reject. In the interests of discipline, and to
remove the administrative and other difficulties
mentioned, it is essential that statutory provision be made in the Naval Service Act in
respect of the civilian employees mentioned,
and this is the purpose of this Bill.
I think these are all the explanations I have
to offer the Senate in justification of the
Bill. I move the second reading.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, so far as the Bill endeavours
to bring within the discipline of the Naval
Service Act volunteers who are serving under
naval officers for temporary purposes, it is
obviously all 'right. But I call attention to
the other side of the shield. Those who come
in may do so for a very temporary objective.
It is right that they should be under discipline,
but is it not pretty dangerous to give them all
the rights of a rating under the Naval Service
Act? I have in mind a corresponding situation in the Militia. There are a great many
veterans of the last war who are no longer
in the permanent force, but would make
excellent instructors. They are very eager
to help in a field where there is a real demand
for services such as they could give. My
information is that the departrment is loath
to take them on if they are not in category A
in respect of health, the reason being that
in the event of death or illness all these men
and their families would have certain very
important pension rights. It is very likely
that men of this character, in any but exceptional cases, would be willing to surrender
such pension rights. One can understand the
attitude of the department in not wishing to
place a heavy obligation upon the country
just for the sake of services which are really
such that pension rights should not arise.
With that in mind, let us transfer our
attention to the present Bill. I understand
that in our Naval Service to-day there are
quite a number of boats of all sorts and descriptions, private yachts, large and small, and
what not. I do not know what all these
auxiliary craft, as described in our returns,
really are, but I have information as to the
kind of boats being acquired, and I am going

SENATE

to presume-I have no reason to do otherwise- that they will serve some useful purpose. There will have to be a supply of
officers and ratings to man these vessels
temporarily. Men will volunteer, and while it
is quite right that thcy should be under discipline, and also on pay, one would think
there should be some restriction in respect of
pension rights that might arise. By careful
reading of the Bill it will be seen that not
only are these men under the discipline provided for in the Naval Service Act, but they
are entitled to all the rights therein provided.
It may be they should get all these rights,
but I am disposed to think they should not.
I should like, if I can, to obtain a full
explanation on that point. It runs in my mind
that perhaps the reason why the men were
dealt with as volunteer naval reserves in the
last war was to avoid that obligation. If
this Bill passes we shall be right under the
whole thing. I can see a very distinct difference between pension rights accruing to a
man who throws his life into a State service,
and
service,
private
into
or
indeed
such rights being given to a man not so
highly trained, and therefore not so careful,
who comes in temporarily. It would seem te
me it might be well to have these rights determined by Government officers after a thorough
review. There is a possibility that I am on
the wrong track, but as I read the Bill it
occurs to me that we may be assuming an
obligation which we shall be talking about and
regretting in years to come.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: I think the right honourable leader on the other side has raised a
point which is not only a good one, but a
very important one. To my own knowledge
many of the vessels put into commission and
under Canadian naval direction are merely
patrol boots. They run all the way from Lake
Superior clean down to Halifax. Many of them
will never be subject to the slightest risk of
any naval warfare or be in any danger beyond
what may arise in the ordinary course of
navigation on our inland waters, and, in some

men on these boats, especially if on patrol
duty, may be amenable to full naval discipline, I believe the Bill should contain a
distinct clause with respect to what the

dependents is now and will be in the distant

to time, are entitled to make claims on the
ground that their disability has arisen directly
or indirectly frem war service.
There is no doubt that a large number of
boats will be employed in Canada, and a
great many men will bo required to operate
them. I have been looking into this question
a little, and have seen a considerable number
of boats coming up from the south-yachts

these are very valuable. I do not know about
that, but I know they carry big crews, and
every man on board them is liable to become
a pensioner, or to ask for bounties or gratuities
at the end of the war. I believe the Bill should
be closely scrutinized and should be amended
te cover the point raised by the right honourable leader on the other side.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I find myself in complete accord with
the views expressed by my right honourable
leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and the
honourable gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy). Thousands of our best young men
throughout Canada are offering their services,
some of them to the Royal Canadian Volunteer Reserve and others for patrol duties, and
so forth, on smaller craft. I do not think I
am misjudging these young mon when I say
that at the time of enlistment they did not
expect, and they do not now expeet, to get
any pensions from the Canadian Government.
Of course, I do feel that those who join the
Royal Canadian Volunteer Reserve and go
across to England-as large numbers are
doing-and there perform arduous and dangerous work, should be entitled to pension.
I noticed the other day an advertisement in
the leading papers of my own city calling for
four thousand men-stokers, carpenters and
so on. I do not believe men of that type are
required to go overseas. As the honourable
gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy)
has so clearly stated, they are no doubt
required for patrol work in Canada.
To the men who remain here and serve in
home waters we give all due credit and
thanks for offering themselves at this time.
Thousands of them are doing patrol work,
which is, no doubt, absolutely necessary, but,
as we all admit, not dangerous. So I think
this Bill ought to be amended to confine
pensions exclusively to those men who join
the Royal Canadian Volunteer Reserve and
go overseas.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators, I find myself in disagreement with
the right honourable leader on this side
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and the two
honourable gentlemen who have preceded me

JUNE 4, 1940
(Hon. Mr. Hardy and Hon. Mr. Ballantyne).
My first observation would be that when you
come to drafting the amendment which these
gentlemen have in mind, you will find it
simply cannot be done unless you establish
two distinct types of services. If you want
to have a coast-guard service, let us say, and
to make it entirely separate and distinct
from your naval service, with different uniforms and so on, you can go ahead and deal
with it as a separate body; but if all the
men are in one service, with promotion running through the whole of it, you are bound
to run into difficulty. If the boiler on a
patrol vessel in the St. Clair river blows up
and the stoker is badly scalded, his injuries
will be just as painful to him and have as
far-reaching consequences on his life and
health as if the accident had happened to him
in the North Sea or elsewhere in Europe.
Should a man serving in home waters fall
and break a leg, be will be just as lame and
suffer just as much pain as if be had been
injured overseas.
If you desire two different services, you can
legislate accordingly. Then you must not ask
the men in this inferior Canadian service to
perform any of the duties of the front-line
service. If you are going to have a scparate
naval service and a separate coast-guard service, you must not ask the coast-guard men
to go to sea or take any risks such as the
naval men take.
On matters such as this you must consult
with and be guided by the officers who have
to handle these men wherever their ships go.
The officers are responsible for the maintenance of discipline, and they may have to be
responsible for leadership of these men in
battle. I gravely doubt whether you can
have two different kinds of sailors in the same
ship, or in the sane waters, or in the same
service. I know you cannot have two different
types of men in the army. While I entirely
sympathize with those who think we should
be constantly on the watch to safeguard the
public treasury against the consequences of
foolish and thoughtless enlistment of men
who are not physically fit, it seems to me
that our adoption of the proposed amendment
would leid to serious difficulties.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, if I may rise once more, I
should like to say that I cannot agree with
my honourable and gallant friend who has
just spoken. Men of the Royal Canadian
Volunteer Reserve who go overseas on minesweepers-and large numbers of these vessels
will be going over--or on submarine chasers,
or other vessels, should certainly be entitled

to pensions; but I cannot see why any pensions should be available to the thousands of
men who will be called upon simply to do
patrol work around the shores of Canada.
In answer to the argument of my honourable
and gallant friend, I would point out that we
are now organizing a volunteer home guard,
and surely if any member of this home guard
were to fall and break his leg, or sustain any
other injury, he would not be entitled to a
pension in the same way as would a man
who joined the Canadian Active Service Corps
and went overseas. The men who volunteer
to serve on patrol boats are willing to do
their bit, and, they certainly do not expect
this country, which is already saddled with a
tremendous debt, to pay them pensions.
Thousands upon thousands of men are volunteering for this work. A man may be serving
to-day as an engineer on a patrol boat, and
next week he may be out of the service.
I thoroughly agree that all men serving in
home waters should come under naval discipline, but I think this House would be
wrong in providing that they should come
under the Pension Act. I have watched many
of these gallant young volunteers in my own
city, and I know they are a very fine type.
They undergo drills, attend lectures and in
every possible way prepare themselves to be
of service. Why are they doing this? Simply
because they want to help defend their country. I am sure that if anyone asked them
whether they thought the Government should
pay them a pension, they would answer in
the negative. Therefore I stand by the
remarks I previously made on this Bill.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: In the Western Provinces there are hundreds of instances where
elderly farmers and their wives are drawing
pensions from this Government at the rate
of $40 a month. Although they could be
supported off their farms, they have turned
the farms over to their sons, and draw pensions from the Government.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
age pensions.

These are old,

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: That is what I am
speaking about. I have personal knowledge
of what is going on. A man owns a farm,
and when *he and his wife become seventy
years of age the farm is transferred to their
son. Now, the parents and the whole family
could be supported off the farm. But the
daughters get employment in cities, the farm
is transferred to a son, and the elderly man
and his wife draw pensions from the Government at the rate of $40 a month. I know

88

SENATE

what I am talking about, as I am aware of
many instances of this kind. There is something wrong about the whole pension business.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
may I interject a brief observation at this
time? I think the point taken by the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) is somewhat justified, but I do not
think it answers the argument raised by
honourable members who spoke before him.
It seems to me there is a happy medium by
which the problem could be solved. There
are in various provinces organizations known
as Workmen's Compensation Boards. Now, I
believe that concerns which operate throughout Canada at large, such as, say, the Canada
Steamship Lines, and their employees, are
subject to and protected by the Workmen's
Compensation Acts. In my opinion some
such scheme could be developed for taking
cane of the men who volunteer for naval
service in Canada and are injured in the discharge of their duties. Perhaps, for that purpose, it might be necessary to enact federal
legislation along the line of the provincial
Workmen's Compensation Acts. That is just
a suggestion I throw out at this time. I
attach considerable importance to the issue
which has been raised in this discussion. It
is because of my professional experience as a
doctor in dealing with cases of industrial
accidents under the provincial Acts that I am
suggesting some federal scheme of compensation for men whose health becomes impaired
or who are permanently disabled while serving their country-a scheme which would not
bind the Covernment as in the case of soldiers
or sailors serving in the army or navy, at home
as well as abroad. Compensation of one kind
or another should be substituted here for
pensions.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think the
difficulty will be to draft a workable amendment even if you have clearly in mind what
you want to do. The honourable gentleman
from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) almost
talked himself to a logical conclusion a
moment ago. He was prepared to allow the
sailor who goes across to Europe and engages
in naval warfare there to become entitled to
a pension if injured, but he did not think the
Canadian sailor engaged in patrol work on
our own coast should come within the same
class. Well, if a ship is patrolling our coast
and meets an enemy cruiser, which proceeds
to hammer the daylights out of her, what is
to be the position of the crew? Are they
to haul down the flag and say: " Hold on!
We are not fighting sailors; we are in a
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

different category from those men overseas "?
That must be considered. The fact that the
men go across to England does not mean
anything, since the enemy may come over
here and bring the whole of that particular
class provided for by this legislation under
the conditions envisaged by the honourable
gentleman from Alma. I am not worrying
much about this matter, as I am perfectly
satisfied that when you try to draft an amendment you will find it will not work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I am not violating the rule, for,
having made the motion, I have the right to
reply.
The discussion has led me to the
conclusion that we might well adopt here a
certain rule of the House of Commons.
There, when a bill has been given second
reading it is referred to Committee of the
Whole in order that it may be discussed in
detail. It is a violation of our rules for a
member to rise two or three times, but I do
not object to it exceptHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I say to
my honourable friend that in the other House
when a bill comes up for second reading it is
fully discussed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, the principle
is discussed, but after the bill is given second
reading it is moved into Committee of the
Whole, where there is free discussion of every
section.

I desire to draw the attention of the Senate
to what the gentleman who had the Bill in
hand in the other House said in explanation
of the measure:
First, I want to make it quite clear that this
applies to persons who are not actually enlisted
in the Navy, but are serving with it.
Pilots,
I suppose, would be one category while they
are serving with the Navy; perhaps fishermen; and other trades serving in connection
w ith or attached to the Navy.
Apparently
during the last war that was not made quite
clear. and trouble arose with regard to discipline.
J have no recollection of that, I do
not remiember any instances of it, but J <lo
renember cases with respect to compensation
in the shape of pensions. I take it that this
Bill will apply to those men who are not
actn ily enlisted in the Navy, that it will give
then rights with respect to pension similar
toi the rights of those who are in the Navy.
Periaps I nay read section 1: I am skipping
words which may be redondant:
"(1)
If any person who, not belonging to
the Naval Service, enters into an engagement
with the Minister to serve His Majesty . . .
and agrees to become subject to this Act upon

entering into the engagement, that person shall,
so long as the engagement remains in force
. . . be subject to this Act, and the provisions
of this Act shall apply in relation to that person
as if, while subject to this Act. he belonged
tLo the Naval Service and were borne on the
books of one of His Majesty's Canadian ships
in commission."

89

JUNE 4, 1940
I take it that this would entitle him to the
pension rights to which members of our naval
forces are entitled. I remember, although I
cannot recall the details, that certain pension
claims were rejected on the ground that men
who served in such capacity in the last war
were not, properly speaking, members of the
forces as laid down in the Pension Act; and
I believe that this Bill is intended to cover
them.
It is clearly a question of granting pensions, as was suggested by the right honourable leader on the other side and by those
who followed him.
I move adjournment of the debate in order
that I may obtain a memorandum bearing
on the rights of these persons to get pensions.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
leader might at the same time ascertain what
is the class of persons who come into the
Navy in this peculiar fashion. A soldier is
either in the Army or out; but here apparently a man may enter into an engagement
to serve in a ship and yet not be a member
of the Navy. I should like to know who
these persons are, how many of them there
are likely to be, and why they are not brought
into the Navy.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: With the indulgence
of the House, I should like to make one or
two remarks on the point of order. The
honourable leader of the House has, I suppose,
been indulged to a greater extent than any
other member, except one, in what I might
terrn violations of the rules. We all listen
to him with the greatest of pleasure, for he
is a man of exceptional ability and remarkably well informed. I should like, with the
greatest humility, to remind you, sir, that
this is one of the most powerful legislative
bodies, if not the most powerful, in the British
Empire, and I would suggest that in order
that it may maintain its high standing you
should enforce our rules rigidly. In disregard
of our procedure my honourable friend from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) has been
indulged more than any other member. What
is the use of these rules unless they are observed? What right has any member to move
second reading of a bill immediately after it
has been read a first time? I am sure, sir,
that you will prove a worthy successor of the
able men who have presided over the discussions of this House, and therefore I appeal
to you to insist on a proper observance of
our procedure. With the greatest deference to
the honourable leader opposite, I must say
that, with the exception of my honourable
friend from Parkdale, he is perhaps the most
frequent transgressor.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would my honourable friend some time point out one or two
of my violations of the rules?

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: With the greatest
of pleasure. I have seen the honourable gentleman rise and heard him make lengthy
speeches, brilliantHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
point out that my honourable friend is not in
order.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The honourable gentleman has talked about everything except the
question before the House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As the motion
to adjourn the debate is debatable, I shall
not commit any offence against the rules in
what I am about to say. I quite agree that
anyone in the theatre of war who suffers
because of an act of war, though he may have
entered the service but temporarily, has certain rights, perhaps the full and complete
rights of one regularly engaged in the Naval
Service; but I never could agree that someone who is on a boat and whose purpose is
not to take part in any war activity at allwho is, for example, on a gentleman's yacht,
which could not attack anything but a fish,
and who happens to dieHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
covered?

Is

that case

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. So
far as I am informed, we have about fifty-four
auxiliary boats, many of them of that kind.
I presurne there is something for thein to do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of my right honourable friend to the
fact that thousands of fishermen frorm Nova
Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec are
serving on boats engaged in watching the
enemy and so protecting Halifax.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They may
be watching, but they could not fight anything.
If they were attacked, there might be statutory grounds for consideration. If a man
dies in actual naval service, his family has
certain rights, but I think that if he dies in
service where he is not engaged to corne
within reach of the enemy, those rights should
not accrue. It is no picayune matter; it may
run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.
It seems to me to be not at all difficult so to
frame an amendment that the country would
certainly be relieved of ordinary pension
rights in cases of this kind. True, if a man
dies outside a ýtheatre of war his family
suffers the same as if he died anywhere else,
or happened to be drowned at sea, but the
loss of his ife does not give bis family any
rights against the country. There is a great
difference between the pension rights of a
man who engages to serve in the Navy for
a long period of years and is subject to coin-

mands of the State to enter into any enterprise, however perilous, and the rights of him
who does not engage for that kind of perilous
service at all. The latter person might, if he
came into a theatre of war by accident, have
certain pension rights, but if he dies in the
ordinary performance of duty it is an imposition on the State that his family should be
entitled to such rights as are specified in this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I think that when the
Bill is before us for second reading an officia]
of the department in which it originated
should be here to give such detailed information as may be required.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are on the

when we are about to take the committee

Hon. Mr. BLACK: He might be present at
the committee stage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the Senate?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the Senate, I would now move the third
reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
leader of the House think it is worth while at
this stage to adopt the amendment suggested
by the Parliamentary Counsel? It is merely
a clerical amendment. He changes " half " to
" half of " to balance the wording. It would
take only a second, and it is better wording.

FIRST READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the

MILITIA PENSION BILL

SECOND READING

FIRST READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
a very simple one. Its purpose is to enable
the administration of service estates to be
effected under regulations made by the
Governor in Council.
Regulations in this
regard have already been made under the
War Measures Act, and as long as that Act
is capable of being invoked such regulations
have the force of law. Of necessity these
regulations may have to be continued in force
and effect for some time after the War
Measures Act is capable of being invoked;
consequently some other statutory authority
is required to enable the Governor in Council
to make such regulations.
This concerns the personal effects of the
soldier who dies in the war area or in hospital,
and who has personal property that must be
taken care of. It does not affect his actual
estate. That falls under our regular law.
I believe this Bill will commend itself to the
Senate. As a matter of fact, under the War
Measures Act, what is herein provided is
already the law.
I move the second reading of the Bill.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 3, an Act to amend the
Militia Pension Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that the
second reading be taken to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I see no
objection to this Bill at all. So far as I am
concerned, it may be proceeded with now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The purpose of
this Bill is to enable officers of the permanent
naval forces to reckon for purposes of pension
one-half of any former time served in the
non-permanent naval forces. Thereby these
naval officers are placed on the same basis
as officers of the permanent military and air
forces with respect to the inclusion of one-half
of the period of previous service in the nonpermanent military and air forces.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN.

JUNE 4, 1940
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Can
the leader of the House tell us just what
provision is now made by Order in Council
under the War Measures Act? The explanation in the Bill makes very plain how this
matter was handled in the last war, but there
is no disclosure at all as to the present plan.
I presume an officer of the department is
made administrator or trustee of all these
service estates, but I think the House should
be told what the plan is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may find it in
the explanatory note.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We might take
the second reading now, and before the third
reading I shall secure the information.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Perhaps I should explain that J was a little
hasty. There is a short reference to this in
the explanatory note. It says an administrator
is appointed. But I am wondering what law
he will follow in the administration. Does
the Order in Council provide how he shall
deal with the estate? Is it the same law for
every soldier, or is it one law for the soldier
who dies in Ontario, and another for the
soldier who dies in Nova Scotia?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take it for
granted that the regulation has been made for
all those who are serving abroad and are
under the direction of their own commander.
If they die there is a personal estate that
must be attended to. I should think it was
not intended to go beyond that. My right
honourable friend says, "But if he dies in
Nova Scotia or Ontario "Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. If a
Nova Scotian dies over there, does the Order
in Council go so far as to say how the
administrator shall take care of the estate and
hand it over to the person entitled to it under
the law of Nova Scotia, or does it say that
the administrator shall hand it over to whoevery might administer the estate in that
province?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think we shall
find that the regulations bear on the contae
between the soldier and his commander or
officer, who has a mandate to receive the
personal estate and hand it over to some person. Who that person may be, I do not know.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall get the
information.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 5, an Act respecting
the Royal Canadian Air Force.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Has my right honourable friend
seen this Bill?
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Yes, I
have studied it. I certainly think the Bill
should go through. It simply puts the Royal
Canadian Air Force on a statutory basis corresponding to that of the military and naval
forces. Until now the Air Force has been
under the Aeronautics Act, which also covers
many other things. The only thing I did
not fully understand as I studied the debate
in the other House was this. It occurred to
me that "the Minister," who is defined as
the Minister of National Defence, should be
defined as the Minister of National Defence
for Air. An explanation was given, but I
could not follow it.
Before we come to the third reading, will
the honourable gentleman opposite get an
explanation that is clear to an ordinary intellect?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know what is
to be the relationship between the Air Minister
and the Minister of Defence, but I cannot
answer my right honourable friend's question.
However, if we may take the second reading
now, I shall try to have an answer on the
third reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 8, an Act respecting the
appointment of auditors for National Railways.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a Bill
that cormes to us every year, because the Act
requires that auditors for the National Railways be appointed annually. Under the
measure, George A. Touche and Company,

accountants, of Toronto and Montappointed as independent auditors
year 1940. I suppose there is no
to this Bill.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, I have
no objection. Of course, the Act does not say
what the honourable leader informs us it
says. The Act says that auditors shall be
appointed by joint resolution of both Houses.
However, we have always, or at least in late
years, proceeded by passing a Bill. Of course
the Bill is effective; there is no doubt about

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of

Commons with Bill 10, an Act to ratify and
confirm a certain agreement respecting the
joint use by Canadian National Railways of
certain tracks and premises of the Vancouver,
Victoria and Eastern Railway and Navigation
Company, at Vancouver, in the Province of
British Columbia.
The Bill was read the first time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
second reading now?

May we take

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I have
read the Bill. It is somewhat technical and
legal, but there is no exception to it.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, perhaps the
explanatory notes accompanying the Bill will
be found sufficient. They are as follows:
Under agreement dated November 6, 1915,
tbe Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway
and Navigation Company granted to the Canadian Northern Pacifie Railway Company the
rigbt to run over the former company's tracks
between New Westminster and Vancouver, and
this agreement became effective in perpetuity
upon ratification by Parliament unîder Cliapter
59 of the Statutes of 1917.
Owing to the construction by the City of
Vancouver of a bridge over the traeks of the
Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway and
Navigation Company at First avenue connecting with Terminal avenue and tise reoval of
the tracks of the Canadian Northern Pacifie
Railway Company froi Terminal avenue in
order to avoid a level crossing, it lias been
found iecessary for the Canadian Northern
Pacifie Railway Company to make an arrangement with the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern
Railway and Navigation Company for a new
entrance to its station in Vancouver, and an

agreement,

lated

Marci 30,

1939,

has been

made between thle two companies and approved

by tise Board of Transport Commissioners for
Canada and by tie Governor in Council pursuant to the provisions of the Railway Act.

JUNE 4, 1940
Under clause 6 of the new agreement it is
provided that the agreement, upon approval
by the Board of Transport Commissioners and
the Governor in Council, shall be effective for
a period of twenty years (21 years is tihe maximum period ýpermitted under the Railway Act),
but that upon ratification by Parliament the
agreement shall be effective in perpetuity.
As the original 1915 agreement between the
said companies covering the line between New
Westminster and Vancouver is in perpetuity,
it is considered necessary that tise direct
approach to the station be also secured in
perpetuity, and the purpose of the Bill is to
make tie new agreement dated March 30, 1939,
effective in perpetuity.
I may add that this has the concurrence
of the City of Vancouver.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objectioi to passage of the motion, but I do
want to call attention to the fact that the
second paragraph of the explanatory notes
is not clear at all. Nor is the cloud in any
degree dispelled by discussion which occurred
in the other House. This terminal company
in Vancouver appears to be a subsidiary of
the Great Northern. Back in 1917 the Canadian National made with it an agreement to
use its tracks, and that agreement was to
become an agreement in perpetuity upon
ratification in Parliament, which ratification
took place. That is quite clear. Then we
come to a later date-I presume a comparatively recent date, although it is not
given. Because a bridge is constructed over
the terminal company's line, there bas to be
a removal of some tracks in order to avoid a
level crossing, and an agreement bas been
found necessary. I do not know what that
means. I can understand that if the terminal
company's line is diverted from its old location and a bridge is used, it may be necessary
to make a new agreement to give a right to
the Canadian National. But these explanatory notes are intended to make it plain
that there had to be a new agreement for
some other reason. Personally, I should like
to know what it is. I do not like just reading
words. I have no doubt that there is a
perfectly valid reason.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will read the
statement of the Minister, which may be
clearer than the notes I have just read.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have read
the Minister's statement, and it is not clearer
at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has the right
honourable gentleman read the statement
made by Hon. Mr. Howe to the other House?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I should
like to hear a statement which makes clear
what change arises in the relationship between

the Canadian National and the terminal railway just because the City of Vancouver builds
a bridge over the terminal company's tracks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I could see that
the right honourable gentleman's point is
answered to-morrow, of course, but perhaps
I may read now the statement made by the
Minister in the other House. It is as follows:
This Bill ratifies an agreement that lias been
made between the Canadian National Railways
and the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway and Navigation Company, for the use of
about fourteen miles of track between the City
of New Westminster and the city of Vancouver.
The Bill provides for the use of this trackage
as an entry for the Canadian National Railways
into their terminal station at Vancouver. The
matter is in evolution. Formerly the Canadian
National Railways had its own track running
By
down one of the streets of Vancouver.
agreement with the city a number of years ago,
the city undertook to remove the tracks, provide
a grade separation, and thereafter to enter into
an agreement for tie use of this particular
trackage as an entrance for the Canadian
National Railways. The grade separation bas
now been completed and the terms of the agreement have been approved by the Board of
Transport Commissioners; but as this is a
permanent arrangement, representing as it does
the only entrance for the Canadian National
Railways into Vancouver when tieir own track
is lifted, it is desired to make this a perpetual
agreement, whicli requires the approval of Parliament. If it were an agreement for twenty
years only, the approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners would be sufficient, but for
a perpetual agreement the approval of Parliament is necessary. This Bill is simply to ratify
teic agreement which bas already received the
approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners and all interested parties.
I really think that statement is much clearer
than the explanatory notes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is absolutely clear in every respect in which the
explanatory notes are clear, but in respect of
the one point where the notes are obscure, it
too is obscure. Certainly if there is a diversion
from an old to a new track, an agreement is
necessary, and it must be in perpetuity.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is not the purpose of this Bill exclusively to grant perpetuity?
That was
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
granted before. What I do not understand
is why there had to be a change because of
construction of a bridge. The Minister does
not touch on that. The second paragraph of
the explanatory notes does touch on it, but
I am just as much in the dark after reading
it as I was before.

Mr. MeRAE:
Honourable senators,
I can throw a little light on this

Vancouver, and with respect to this the railways have an agreement in perpetuity. That
track runs into Falls Creek through a deep
eut, over which there are bridges. I should
take it that the construction of one of these
bridges made it necessary to change the rightof-way a little, and a short section of Great
Northern track is being added to the fourteen-mile section. The railways want that
short section covered by an agreement in petpetuity, just as the fourteen-mile section is.
It seems to me there is nothing difficult at all
about this.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

reading of the 3ill.
He said: The explanatory note reads:

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, this Bill, in essence, is an
enactment in statutory form ofHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

A regulation.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -of a regulation of the Yukon Territorial Council, whereby
that Council back in 1919 put a sort of excise
Hon. Mr. MeRAE.

tax on raw furs exported out of the Yukon.
I am not rising to complain particularly of
the Bill as a Bill. I should be in a very weak
position if I did, because apparently what was
done in 1919 was done by myself, and at the
time I was Minister of the Interior. What I
would call attention to is that this Bill would
give statutory authority to the Yukon Council
to put a tax on the expert of raw furs-no
dotbt as a means of revenue for the Yukon
adninistration. A study of the situation discloses that similar taxes are imposed by our
provinces on furs exported from those provinces, and I presume on certain other of their
productions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think there is
a similar regulation concerning the Northwest
Territories.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presune seo.
This Bill and similar Acts under which these
taxes are collected in the provinces are all a
restraint on trade within the four corners of
our Dominion. I am one of those who feel it
was the intention of the British North America
Act that no such restraints should be imposed.
However, the British North America Act has
been interpreted otherwise and our powers in
respect of trade and commerce have been so
abbreviated that the Dominion is very much
hampered in the exercise of that governmental
autliority which necessarily appertains to a
nation. All over the country, particularly in
one province, attemtts are now ping made
to establish a sort of semi-nationhood within
this nation and get taxes that really restrict
trade among our provinces. Net so long ago
we nearly put through a law which distinctly
encouraged imposition of such taxes in the
province of New Brunswick, but fortunately
it was stopped in time. I do not doubt that
a province now can do much te paralyse
Confoderation by taxing, not the importation
of goods from another province, but the sale
of those goods after importation, and thereby
do all the damage that could be done by a
separate tariff.
This Bill, it is true, only does for the Yukon
what other provinces now are doing for themselves, but I should like to sec the practice
discontinued, se that no province would have
the right to put export taxes on any of its
products going to other provinces.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This kind of
thing is eating into the fabric of our ConIn Ontario one stands amazed

at the ingenuity of officials seeking some way
by which they can tax the energies and enterprise of an Ontario company exercised outside
the borders of Ontario, or of someone outside

of Ontario doing business in Ontario, as
distinguished from someone in Ontario doing
business there. Every step you take you are
simply hamstrung by regulations you have to
live up to, and taxes you have te submit te,
in attempting to exercise your function as a
citizen of the Dominion in its widest application. All over the Dominion people are already
tied hand and foot by regulations and taxes
which perhaps would stand the test of review
by the Privy Council. I presume they would.
I have net read the Sirois report, but I do
hope there is something in it that will enable
us tn get away from these provincial efforts
which would disintegrate Confederation; for,
though that is not in the minds of the
legislators, yet it is the effect of their enactments. We in our province keep struggling
te get something out of the other provinces,
and they establish a big, top-heavy civil
service in order te get back at us. It is a
waste of effort: one thing just balances and
destroys the other. This Bill is much along
the same lines. J do net think we can deny
it te the Yukon Territorial Council, since
our provinces recognize the same principle;
but I do think we should, if we can, take
steps by way of constitutional amendment te
get rid of provincial taxes which are based on
a distinction between the rights of a man
trading in his own province and the rights of
the same man trading in another province.
Hon. L. COTE: Section 2 contains a
vicious principle, for it provides that civil or
criminal liabilities incurred before this enactment shall be excepted. In other words, it
makes this legislation retroactive in order te
preserve the rights of the Crown regarding
civil or criminal liability. I do net know
what induced the Government to bring down
this legislation. The explanatory note states
that a doubt has arisen as te whether the
Yukon Territorial Council had authority in
the first place te pass the original enactment
in 1919. I suppose that doubt must have
arisen in some litigation, but J have net the
facts. It is quite within the bounds of
possibility that someone has resisted a criminal action on the ground that prier legislatien was void, and now we are going te make
its effect retroactive. I do net think any
more vicious principle could be incorporated
in a Bill.
My second objection te clause 2 is this. The
clause goes a long way, as I have just stated,
te protect the rights of the Crown with respect
te the liability of a subject, but it does net
protect the litigant who now has a case in
court. I do net know whether it is really the
intention of the promoter of the Bill te
achieve those results. Though I have been

9

a member of this Chamber for seven years,
I have never yet seen retroactive legislation
go to such a wicked extent as this does.
The question
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
was raised in another place and the Minister
said:
We have no record in the department of any
litigation under the Act. It is possible that
there is some litigation under a game ordinance
of the Yukon Territory. However, in order to
make certain beyond any question of doubt, I
wish to present an amendment which my colleague the Minister of Finance will propose.
Then clause 2 was introduced as a substitute.
Perhaps my honourable friend has the Bill
in its first reading form. Clause 2 now reads:
The provisions of section one of this Act
shall be deemed to have come into operation
on the nineteenth day of May, 1919, but so as
not to defeat, disturb, invalidate, or affect any
penalty, forfeiture or liability, civil or criminal,
incurred before the time of its enactment or any
proceedings for enforcing the same had, done,
completed or pending at the time of such
enactment.
So if my honourable friend's objection is based
on the Bill as first printed, it is met by the
amendment made in committee in the other
House.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Would the amendment
which the honourable gentleman has just read
preserve the rights of a litigant?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
in the affirmative.

I would answer

Hon. Mr. COTE: It preserves liabilities
and penalties. But does it preserve the right
of a good defence?
I think the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
amendment was made for that purpose.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Bill as
drawn simply provided for power to levy the
tax and declared that that power should be
held to have existed since the 19th of
May, 1919. Certain members raised the point
that they knew about litigation already entered
into, and pending, whereby somebody charged
with an offence resisted and said the Act
of the Yukon Council in imposing the tax
was illegal and he was net liable to the penalty
which the Act provided. It was argued: "Very
well, make your Act retroactive, but do not
allow it to affect pending litigation. If a
man's defence is good without this Act, do
net destroy that defence by the Act." The
discussion proceeded, and the Minister said
he did not know of any pending litigation.
The next day the Minister of Finance offered
an amendment to cover the point. I have
read it, and interpret it just as the honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Cote) does. It seems te make it very clear

96

SENATiE

that the fellow cannot escape. I am not saying
that is really the meaning, because I have a
great respect for the law of the Minister of
Finance; but J should like the question referred
to the Department of Justice. I think the
amendment lias the opposite effect from that
desired, and that, clearly, is the interpretation
of the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
East.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I shall ask
that the Bill be given second reading now,
and that third reading be put down for
to-morrow. But I would read again the
amended clause as it comes from the
Commons:
The provisions of section one of this Act
shiall be deened to hlave coie into operation1 on

It seems to me quite complete.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is complete
enough, but I do net know whether it has the
effect intended or the opposite effect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend says he would like to bave the
opinion of the Minister of Justice?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, the

SECOND READING

Hon. DUNCAN MeL. MARSHALL moved
the second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple measure, and somewhat unimportant, except that it brings a little revenue
into the treasury and probably will do away
with a good deal of work on the part of the

JUNE 4, 1940
Experimental Farm employees. For a number
of years people throughout the country have
been invited to send in seeds and have them
tested for germination. This is something
which is very easily donc at home, but some
find it casier to mail the seed in and have the
department make the test and mail the seed
back. There is no charge to cover the cost
of this public service, and this Bill proposes
a nominal fee to reimburse the department.
The fee is not fixed, but it will be very small.
The majority of farmers to-day know much
better than they did thirty or forty years ago
how to test seeds for germination, and they
do this quite successfully.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: After
reading the Bill and the discussion on it,
I was left with some questions unanswered.
It is truc that under the Seeds Act anyone
may send in seeds for testing. The test may
have two purposes, not just one: it may be
for purity and also for germination. I am
quite certain that in many instances the test is
for germination only, and in others for purity
only. Under this measure a charge can be
made on both; under the old Act no charge
could be made on either.
The purity tests are to establish standards
for retail sale, and so on; and I gather it is
not intended to make charges for this kind
of test. But of that I am nut certain. The
object, I think, is to make charges in respect
of germination tests, the reason being that
these can very easily be made by the farmer
himself. If he does not know how to do this,
be can write in and find out, and do it himself
in the future. I understand that you have
only to put the seeds between two blotters
and put thein in the sun, and if germination
is there the seeds will germinate.
The idea of the Bill is to get rid of this
onus on the department, but the revenue
provisions can be applied to both tests, and
I do not know whether that is the intention
or not.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I may say to my
right honourable friend that it is. As a matter
of fact, the test for purity results in the
marking of the bags. For instance, if you
have a lot of clover seed for sale you can
have a man from the Experimental Farm
come and make tests. If the seed is up to
standard, he will mark the sacks and they
will go out for sale as standard. So far no
charge has been made for that service, but
it is considered reasonable that a charge
should be made to a man engaged in the
grading and selling of seeds. If he is in

97

business commerciallyi he ought to pay something for the tests made and the certificates
granted, because the certificates enable him
te get a higher price for his seed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The reason is just
this. The Government starts services to the
public and continues them until they become
large enough for someone to notice the expenditure on them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
the Minister made clear the intention to
charge in respect of purity tests, because he
based his whole argument on the fact that
the farmers themselves can make the germination tests. The merchant cannot make the
purity tests, but they have to be made in
order that a standard may be established for
sale purposes.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The Bill provides
for a charge.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes, but
the Minister did net say he intended to apply
it in that way. He defended the Bill on
another principle altogether. Also, he was
asked repeatedly, "What is the cost of the
Seed Branch?" and "Do you intend to cover
the cost of the operation by these charges?"
but, so far as I have read, I do net think he
answered. Twice he said he could not give
the information.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: It would be a difficult figure to reach.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is it the
intention to have the charges cover the cost of
the Seed Branch?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I understood the
Minister to say the charge would be nominal.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But he intends to get a revenue from it, and I think
he is right.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I think the charge
should cover the cost of the service, which
helps a man to produce a superior article. If
he gets a service from the Government he
ought to pay for it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would consent to the second reading, but if the honourable gentleman finds he is net right, I should
be glad if he would advise us on the third
reading.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It seems to me this
would take away from many farmers in the
West the right to send in seed grain in the
spring to find out the percentage of germination of the seed, and whether it is pure enough
to sow. The free service which we have
received in that respect in the past has been
for the purpose of developing production of
better wheat and better grain of all kinds. If
this service is taken away from us and we
have to pay for inspection of every sample
we send in, you will find, I think, that very
few samples will be sent in, because the full
cost of that service would be more than most
farmers could afford to pay.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: For a germination
test only one sample need be sent in, a sample
that is an average of the lot, and the cost
of doing this will probably be small. But to
have a germination test made is simple. One
way of going about it is to have the children
on the farce sow seeds in a match box, for
instance, or in a rag doll. Most farm children
know of numerous methods of getting seeds
to sprout, and usually like to help out in this
kind of work.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

when it comes up to-morrow? From a reading
of section 2 I should think that the money
is net for war purposes. It is said here to be:
for paying or redeeing the whole or any portion of loans or obligations of Canada, and also
for purchasing from time to time uînmatured
securities of Canada to be withdrawn fromi
circulation or resold, and for public works and
geiieral purposes.
I should think that if the money were required
for war purposes, that would be specified; so I
presume it is for other than war purposes. The
sum seems immense at this time.
As my right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend knows, every two or three
years Parliament authorizes the Government
to issue loans, and the amount is always in
hundreds of millions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is this for war
purposes?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For refunding
and meeting maturities. There is a possibility
that there may be purchasing of British
securities, by way of furnishing credit to
Great Britain during the war. I am not sure
about this, though, but I shall find out.
Ordered that second reading of the Bill be
placed on the Order Paper for to-morrow.
FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received frem the House of
Commons with Bill 25, an Act to amend
The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act,
1934.
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?

JUNE 4, 1940
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When this Act
was amended in the 1938 session the Bill was
explained by the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). I do
not remember now what the object of that
amendment was. The purpose of the present
amendment is to restore operation of the Act
My right honourable friend

(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) had the interests
of the Western Provinces chiefly in mind
when the Act was passed. The Act is no
longer operative in the Eastern Provinces,
but it was kept in force in Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and now the desire is to resurrect
it for the benefit of farmers in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: We do not want
it in our province.

-Bill?
I shall give it
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to my honourable friend to-morrow.

Bill is of great importance to my province,
and I should like a fuller explanation than the
honourable leader has given.
I can give one
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
explanation right away. The Legislature of
Manitoba is unanimously in favour of having
the Act restored to effect in Manitoba.
When this
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Bill comes up to-morrow I shall suggest that
it stand over till next week. The honourable
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has taken a very close interest in
previous efforts to extend operation of this
Act. I do not know anyone who is more
familiar with the actual working out of the
law than he is, and I am sure he would want
to be present before second reading is given
to the Bill. He cannot be here, though,
until Monday next. I need not add that two
honourable senators from Prince Edward
Island would also very much like to be here
when second reading is under discussion, and
I do not see them in their seats now.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

CANADA GRAIN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. D. EULER moved the second reading of Bill 7, an Act to amend the Canada
Grain Act.
He said: Honourable members, in moving
the second reading of this Bill, I feel that
probably it is unnecessary for me to go into
any extended explanation, in view of the fact
that there is no variation of principle and that
it is obvious the amendments are justified.
At the last session of Parliament there was
a rather full revision of the Canada Grain Act.
During the year's operation the Grain Board
found there were certain errors and inaccuracies
in the revised legislation, and these amendments are intended to correct them. For
example, in clause 1 mention is made of dual
nurmbering of two subsections. These are renumbered.
Section 2 deals with overages as discovered
by the Grain Board, and substitutes "hereinafter" for "hereinbefore". The disposition of
the overages is provided for in later subsections,
and this amendment corrects an obvious error.
Section 3 deals with the improvement of a
certain class of oats by reducing the maximum
of foreign materials which may be included.
The amendments are introduced
recommendation of the Grain Board.

The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SENATE
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. EULER moved the third reading

of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, these amendments, except
the last, are purely clerical in every respect.
Was there any objection at all to this amendment in respect of No. Extra 3 Canada Western Oats? Of course, no one can remember
just what the composition was under the old
law. How far that is altered by this amendment is of some importance.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I can give the information to my right honourable friend. The purpose, of course, is to improve the quality of
that particular class. For example, under the
old arrangement, in Extra 3 Canada Western
Oats there was allowed for seeds a maximum
of about one per cent foreign material; under
this amendment the seeds have to be "practically free". The quality will in that respect
be improved. For wild oats, where the limit
of foreign material was four per cent, it now
becomes two per cent. For other grains it
was four per cent and it now becomes two
per cent. The total is not to exceed three
per cent, whereas heretofore it was six per
cent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
strange use of the word "about".

It is a very

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

the years I have had the honour of a seat in
this Chamber I have felt that we have not
followed the parliamentary practice as observed in the Imperial Parliament. I would
ask you, sir, to insist on a more rigid observance of the rules.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. DUNCAN MARSHALL moved the
second reading of Bill 13, an Act to amend
the Dairy Industry Act.
He said: Honourable members, this is merely
a small change in the Act for dealers' purposes. The Act enables dealers to eut up
Cheddar cheese, but not package cheese. They
find that package cheese in one-pound and
two-pound boxes is rather expensive, because
the package for one pound costs almost as
much as that for five pounds. There is a
considerable demand for five-pound package
loaves eut up and sold in smaller quantities,
and the dealers have asked for this change.
As a matter of fact they are now cutting
cheese in violation of the law. The amendment also provides that farmiers' cheese may
be of different weight. There is not a great
deal of it sold, but in the cities cottage cheese
is sold by dealers who also distribute milk.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. EULER: No. Before it was
"about one"; now it is "practically free".
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is where
it was formerly one per cent; but now for
wild oats the maximum limit of foreign material is "about two per cent", and for other
grains "about two per cent". That is strange
language for a statute.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is the same as it was
before. J am not very familiar with the grain
business, but J presume it is practically impossible to get the percentage absolutely
accurate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The change is
considerable. Was there any objection?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I cannot say as to that.
The amendments were recommended by the
Grain Board.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I w-ould suggest to
you again, sir, that these Bills should not be
rushed through first, second and third readings
in one night. The rules should be observed.
I have no objection to the Bill, but during

would move the second reading to-day. Unless
this is done, the Bill will have to stand until

now submitted to me a motion, which has
been approved by my right honourable friend.
With leave of the Senate I will move this
motion now, seconded by my right honourable
friend.
That for the duration of the present session
of Parliament, should an emergency arise during
any adjournment of the Senate which would
warrant that the Senate meet prior to the time
set forth in the motion for such adjournment,
the Honourable the Speaker be authorized to
notify honourable senators at their addresses
as registered with the Clerk of the Senate to
meet at a time earlier than that set out in the
motion for such adjournment.
After a consultation between my right honourable friend and myself, it was deemed opportune to add these words:
and non-receipt by any one or more honourable
senators of such call shall not have any effect
upon the sufficiency and validity thereof.
If this motion is agreed to, I would point
out to honourable members that it is
important during this session-and the motion
applies only to the present session-to inform
the Clerk of the House where they can be
reached either by telephone or telegraph
during an adjournment. This applies to all
honourable members, including those whose
homes are in Ottawa.

CALLING OF SENATORS DURING
ADJOURNMENT-MOTION

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, while listening to reading of the
motion I was struck by a thought which
should have occurred to me before. The first
part of the motion is worded this way:
That for the duration of the present session
of Parliament, should an emergency arise during
any adjournment of the Senate which would
warrant that the Senate meet prior to the
time set forth in the motion for such adjournment, . . .
In the event that honourable members were
called back at any time during an adjournment, it would be open to someone, under
that wording, to question whether there was
an emergency which warranted curtailment
of the adjournment. Some honourable senator
might say, " There is no such emergency."
I would suggest inserting after the word
" would," in the fourth line, the words " in the
opinion of the Speaker."

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: As honourable members will recaIl, it was suggested last
week by the right honourable leader on the
other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) that
some procedure should be instituted whereby,
in the event of an emergency occurring while
the Senate was adjourned, His Honour the
Speaker could call a sitting on short notice.
I suggested then that the Clerk of the Senate
and the Law Clerk should study the matter
and report on what could be done. They have

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will insert

The inquiry stands.
TRAINING
AIR
COMMONWEALTH
SCHEME-CANADA'S PART IN THE
WAR SITUATION
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable memhers, there is a matter which. before the
Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I should

JUNE 5, 1940
like to mention to the honourable leader of
the House, in the hope that he will take it
As we are all aware,
into consideration.
the Commonwealth Air Training Plan has
been represented to the country and to Parliament as one of the chief pieces of work which
this country intends to do in the war. Undoubtedly it is a most important undertaking.
In the earlier days of the session the honourable leader of the House, on one occasion at
least, in referring to that plan, incorporated
in his remarks a very interesting and informative statement made over the signature of
I am sure
the Deputy Minister for Air.
honourable members of the House were glad
to see that in our records, and were pleased
to be able to consult it.
Now it is reported that the Deputy Minister for Air has made another important
statement with reference to that matter. It
would seem that in the very great emergency
which has occurred some matters in connection with that air training plan will have to
be postponed or modified. Unfortunately the
Deputy Minister for Air did not have the
opportunity of making this very important
statement before this House or before the
House of Commons; nor did the Minister for
Air make any such statement; and we all
know that our honourable friend the leader
of the House was not put into possession of
the facts as stated by the Deputy Minister.
The report is that the Deputy Minister made
his statement at a luncheon meeting of a
club or clubs in the city of Ottawa. I am
not making any criticism of that, although,
personally I have very definite opinions as
to why such statements should be made before
Parliament.
However, that is not the point I am referring
to the honourable leader of the Government.
What I should like to suggest isthat either
this address be incorporated in our records as
an appendix to our debates, or that the
Deputy Minister for Air be brought to the
Senate and given an opportunity-not while
the Senate is sitting, but while it is adjourned
during pleasure-to make a statement before
us, the statement to be taken down by our
reporters and incorporated in our records. My
reason for this request is that in the arguments which have taken place between my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and the right honourable leader on
this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) respecting certain phases of this Commonwealth Air
Training Scheme during this session, there
has been considerable difference of opinion in
regard to the facts; though, after perusing
these debates I have concluded that these
arguments have done much to clarify the

situation. We do not know what may happen,
and at some time in the future it may become
necessary to refer to this statement by the
Deputy Minister. In that event, all that
anyone could get would be a newspaper report.
My honourable friend knows very well that
however correct newspaper reports in general
may be, they cannot be taken as officially
correct. What I should like to sec in our
records is a report of the Deputy Minister's
statement that can be treated any time hereafter as an official report.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
This statement by the Deputy Minister for Air was
drawn to my attention yesterday by my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach), who wanted to ask if it embodied
the policy of the Government. I intend to
inquire into this matter and to place the
Government's exact policy before the House,
and in the event that it does not agree with
the Deputy Minister's statement I shal draw
the attention of the Senate to that fact.
Perhaps my honourable friend will find
something referring to our air training situation in the statement I am about to read.
It is a statement on the international situation made to the other House yesterday by
the Prime Minister. I should have read it
here yesterday, because, as I believe, a statement being made in the other House by the
Prime Minister should be given in the Senate
at the same time, but I confess I received it
too late to present it yesterday. This is the
Prime Minister's statement:
During recent weeks, the world has witnessed
lightning war in all its fury and frightfulness.
It is difficult to believe it was only twenty-five
days ago that Holland and Belgium were
invaded.
We vividly recall the immediate
heroic resistance of those two nations to the
terrific onslaught of the Germans. We know
how magnificently Britain and France responded
to their appeal for aid. We have seen the
German forces employing the full might of
concentrated warfare. and. with incredible losses
to their own man-power and equipment, crush
Holland and Belgium and invade a portion of
France.
The unexpected rapidity with which Nazi
Germany wrought her work of destruction was
due to the most carefully prepared plans for
invasion, to sudden action at an hour of her
own choosing, and to the volume and power
of her armaments. It was due as well to
inability te co-ordinate in advance adequate
plans of defence with the neutral countries,
because of the over-scrupulous and excessive
care with which they sought to safeguard their
neutrality.
We would perhaps do well to keep in mind
that in addition to all this the quick success
of the invasion was due less to the unforeseen
suddenness of the attack itself than to wholly
unexpected incidents in meeting the situation.

JUNE 5, 1940
. .
"Our urgent need for all operational aircraft was made known to the Canadian Government. We learn that the Canadian authorities
have turned around the ship containing these
aircraft, and I wish te express the thanks of
the United Kingdom Government for this very
helpful action. May we assume the Canadian
Government will be prepared also to forego for
the time being the delivery" . . .
-- of a certain number of aircraft.
"Such decisions would be gratefully appreciated."
I may say to the House that the Government
ordered the ship containing the aircraft to be
turned back witbout waiting for a request
from the British Government, and the communication which I have just read is one
expressing the warm appreciatiýon of the British
Government of that voluntary action on our
part.
I come now te the special assistance which
the Royal Canadian Navy has been able to
give and is giving at the moment, not off the
coasts of Canada, but in British waters. As
a result of co-operation with the Royal Navy
a rearrangement of forces has been put into
effect wbereby certain Canadian destroyers are
now serving with the Royal Navy in United
Kingdom waters. Their place bas been taken
by certain units of the Royal Navy assigned
to service protecting our Atlantic seaboard.
This rearrangement will, it is believed, have
the advantage of making certain operations
more effective. The House will readily understand the reasons why no further particulars
can be disclosed at the present time.
I should like to read to the House the
message which I sent to the senior officer
commanding the Canadian destroyers shortly
after they had left our shores:
"In this hour when the skill, the strength,
and the will-power of the combined Allied forces
are so greatly needed te cope with the diabolical
warfare of a wholly unscrupulous and brutal
foe, Canada will be proud indeed when she
learns that, as the enemy pursues his endeavours
to invade the British Isles, destroyers of the
Royal Canadian Navy have crossed the Atlantic
to be in immediate association with the Royal
Navy in the United Kingdom waters.
" I send to you and to the men under your
command the proud assurance that the Government has every confidence that, in your resolute
hands, the honour of the Royal Canadian Navy,
and the traditions which it has inherited, and
which it bas created, are safe and sure. This
confidence will be shared with equal pride by ail
of Canada once the Canadian people become
aware of the presence of Canadian destroyers
in British waters.
"You will be supported in your noble mission
by the eontinued and utmost co-operation of all
branches of the defeuce forces of Canada and
by the single purpose of the Canadian people
in this war. Whenever duty may cail you,
our thoughts and prayers will be with you all.
W. L. Mackenzie King."
In conclusion, may I say that what I have
to-day set forth does not represent the extent
of commitments which, during the present emergency, Canada bas sought to meet in compliance
with special requests from the British Government.

With respect to all three defence ser-

vices there are other commitments concerning
which it is not yet possible to make announcement, but which have been, or are, in process
of being carried out.

105

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I take occasion, arising from

the remarks of the honourable senator from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner), to register my
protest against Government proposals and
announcements of Government policy or
change of policy being made by Deputy Ministers outside of either House. The function
of a Deputy Minister everybody understands:
whether the Deputy is either temporarily or
permanently in his position, lie is a civil
servant and an executive officer of the Ministry.
The proper custodian to receive first announcements of Government policy is the Parliament
of Canada, and the man te make such
announcements in this Parliament is the
appropriate Minister or the Prime Minister.
That someone selected from the ranks of
business should be made the promulgator of
Government policy to the public is to me an
evidence of contempt of Parlianent, and in
this case, I fear I must say, studied contempt.
That the address was an announcement of
Government policy nobody can possibly dispute. It was accepted as such by the Government in Parliament very shortly after. I
presurne the announcement, in the manner in
which it is made, has this advantage, that
it reaches the publie without criticism; there
are no holes bored in it before it gets to
the public. I have never known of a similar
instance before.
I am offering no criticism of the announctment save as to the way in which and the
medium through which it was made. The
policy declared amounts in very great degree
to an abandonment of the air training scheme.
I am not criticizing the abandonment. That
is not the reason why I rise. Emergencies
demand action. It means that much that
we were to do has to be done overseas; that
the training *must be completed there. These
features, of course, were not emphasized in
the announcement and could not be brought
out by criticism at the moment or by further
discussion. I am glad to see the men go
overseas after we have done the best we eau
for them here in the circumstances, and they
will, let us hope and pray, render some service in this dire time in the catastrophe which
is already great, and which the might of two
nations is secking now to prevent from becoming greater. But I hope we have heard
the last of so-called "conscripted" deputies
becoming propagandists for the Administration. I hope we have seen the last of the
subordination of Parliament to Rotary clubs.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am in full
accord with the statement of the honourable
leader of the House that important announce-

106

SENATE

ments, particularly at a time when the world
trembles, should be made simultaneously in
both Houses. We are just as interested in
them as others anywhere can be, and we ought
to be acquainted with the facts, so that if we
have anything to say or to do about them we
shall then have at least equal opportunities
with others of saying or doing it. It would
have been much better had the statement
read yesterday in the Commons been read
here at the same time.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend objecting?

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: The statement
just read by the honourable leader of the
House covers the subject-matter of the newspaper article which I handed to him some
days ago, and which he put into his pocket.
So long as he keeps it there I shall never be
able to proceed.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
instructors.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman had left the Chamber before I was
able to hand it back to him. I have it in my
room now.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We shall not
need it now, after all that bas been said by
the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) and the right honourable leader
on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
Whbat surprises me, however, is the lack of
discussion in Canada as to the real meaning
of the statement. The first part of it informed
us that pilots whom we had trained in
Canada, and who were to be instructors under
the Empire Air Training Scheme, have been
sent to England to man fighter planes. That
is a most outstanding fact. It immediately
raises a question as to where instructors are
to be obtained for the training of the men
who are to be turned out in thousands within
the next few months. Nobody seems to have
mentioned that at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But those having
responsibility are thinking about it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I see no comment
or discussion about it at all. The scheme was
to gather from all over the country a number
of selected young men within certain age
limits and with certain qualifications and to
give them training in training schools throughout Canada; then, after se many weeks, they
were to be assembled at other points and put
through various courses. Finally, on a certain day net very long ago, they had completed their training and were ready to proceed with the instruction of thousands of
other young men who were on the point of
being taken into the service. But we find
to-day all those instructors have been shipped
to England.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Is my honour-

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am net objecting to that, for I am not in a position to
express an opinion as to where the greater
emergency lies. I am only pointing out that
at one fell swoop you more or less put an
end to the establishment of your Empire
training scheme. I should now like to be
told how the scheme is to proceed without
instructors.
There will be

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Where are we to
get them?
Hon. Mr. KING: Never mind.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Ah!
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It
of our business.

is none

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend should say, "I hope so."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I hope so. Now
I come to the planes. It will be remembered
that under the Empire Air Training Scheme
the contribution of Great Britain was to be
in kind. It was assumed by most of us who
read the agreement that "in kind" meant
planes of various types.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Aircraft.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, of various
types.
According to the statement of the
Prime Minister and that of the Deputy Minister for Air, we are confronted with the
notification from Great Britain that the British
authorities cannot send us any more training
planes.
Meanwhile we have already sent
them all our bombing and fighting planes fit
for front-line service.
The statement is
discreetly silent as to the number sent, and
I do not know whether it was large or small.
I suspect the number was comparatively small.
In these two factors, namely, the disappearance of the instructors and the failure to
receive training planes, one sees-I will net
say an end, but at all events a slowing up of
the Commonwealth Training Scheme.
I
wonder whether the Government bas up its
sleeve something that it will produce some
day as a conjurer draws a rabbit out of his
hat. Will it provide a large number of
competent instructors and of training machines, so that the promise made of what
this scheme would develop into will ultimately
eventuate?
The honourable leader of the
House bas suggested that something of the
sort may happen. I hope it will, though I

JUNE 5, 1940

am not so sure that the record of the Government justifies my being very sanguine, but if
I receive any encouragement at all I shall
continue to hope as long as I possibly can.
Those are the two aspects of the matter:
disappearance of instructors and disappearance
of training planes. We have young men
coming to join, we have aerodromes and
barracks being completed, but this essential
function of training and the wherewithal to
train have suddenly disappeared. I should like
the Government to find some way of reassuring
us on these two points.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I recall the
brilliant record of my honourable and gallant
friend on the battle-fields of Flanders. I
should prefer to have had from such a distinguished soldier this robust statement to the
Germans who are listening to us: "Canada
will have the instructors, and the planes as
well."
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I hope my honourable
friend the leader of the House is impressed
with the desirability of having this matter
cleared up, and that he will arrange to have
the Deputy Minister attend, so that members
of the Senate may see and hear him and ask
any questions they may think advisable. We
are entitled to the information. I do not
want to sit here to be just a " yes " man,
nor do I think any other member of the
Senate desires to be inactive. We want to do
something. But how can we do anything if
you will not tell us anything?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend will appreciate that although the
privileges of Parliament are important, the
work of winning the war is of supreme
importance, and that what he now discusses
will have nothing to do with winning the war.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: This war will not be
won by the waving of your hand. It will be
won by hard fighting and sacrifice.
I understood that my honourable friend
would to-day answer the inquiry I have on the
Order Paper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am expecting
to receive a statement from the Department
of National Defence. The reply to my
honourable friend's question is being revised
because it covers, I think, two departments.
I may receive the answer this afternoon.

DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE
BILL-ROYAL CANADIAN AIR
FORCE BILL
THIRD READINGS POSTPONED

On the orders for the third readings of Bill 4,
an Act to amend the Department of National
Defence Act, and Bill 5, an Act respecting
the Royal Canadian Air Force:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The third readings of five bills were deferred until to-day,
so that I might give some information which
was sought in respect to these measures.
Hansard of the Senate did not reach me or
other members until after noon to-day. As
the desired information has not yet been
received, I will move that these orders be
discharged and placed on the Order Paper
for to-morrow. At that time I shall have
the answers direct from the departments.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Just discharge the
first four orders, but leave in Order No. 5.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
honourable leader's statement applies, not to
all, but just to a few. It does apply to the
first order.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It applies also
to the second order, "An Act respecting the
Royal Canadian Air Force."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We might
take each one in turn.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: How does the
honourable gentleman intend to handle this
Bill? Will he refer it to Committee of the
Whole or just push it through without a
committee?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What Bill is
that?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Bill No. 5.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The questions
and objections raised by honourable senators
will be answered, so far as the department can
answer them, by a memorandum which I shall
receive, and which, I think, may satisfy honourable senators and clarify the situation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think we
might take up each order separately, and
perhaps we could proceed with some of the
bills to-day. The first order can be set down
for to-morrow if the honourable gentleman is
not ready to go on to-day; and so can the
second.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I would
move that the first and second orders be
discharged, and be placed on the Orders of
the Day for to-morrow.
The Orders were discharged.

On the Order for the third reading of Bill 11,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not remember whether there were any objections to
this Bill or not.

Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Côté). He thought,

saving clause respecting pending litigation
acceomplishes the opposite of what is intended.

SEEDS

3ILL

THIRD READING

Hon. DUNCAN MaL. MARSHALL moved
the third reading of Bill 19, an Act to amend
the Seeds Act, 1937.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thought
the honourable senator was going to state the
cost of this branch and tell us how much he
expects will be raised under the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: This Bill came up
a little unexpectedly last night, and I was
not fully informed about it at that time.
Since 1909 I have known more about provincial departments of agriculture and their
administration than I have about the federal
department. The fact is, as I found upon
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

inquiry this morning, that since 1913 certain
charges have been made. At that time Hon.
Mr. Burrell, the then Minister of Agriculture,
instituted a charge for the testing of seed
for germination and purity, and a little later
for the inspection and certification of seed,
which could be sold in sealed bags. The first
three germination tests were made without
charge, but after those there was a charge of
50 cents per test. It appears that it had
become the practice of some people to have
every bin in the barn tested, with the result
that the limitation was imposed.
The purpose of this Bill is to fix a charge
of 50 cents for any test that is made, either
for purity or for germination, and to continue
the charge that has been in vogue for the
scaling of grain and the issuing of certificates.
This, I believe, amounts to half a cent a
bushel for cereals, and to one cent a bushel
for small seeds, such as grass or clover.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A test for
what?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: That is a complete
test. The seed is certified both for germination and purity, and is then sealed by an
official of the department, and it must be
sold in the sealed bag. In this way the
purveyor is able to get a better price for the
seed.
Last year about $37,000 was collected from
these tests for germination and purity. The
cost of the laboratories amounted to about
$127,000. It will be seen, therefore, that there
is still a large deficiency. The idea now is to
levy a tax of 50 cents for every sample
tested, and to legalize, so to speak, the charges
that have been in effect. It appears that
there was no legislation passed authorizing
these charges which have been collected since
1913, and the officials of the department seem
to think there ought to be something in the
law to cover this point. It may seem a bit
late to do this, but if the Bill becomes law
the charge will be strictly legal. Really the
only change in the charge is that there will
now be a fifty-cent fee for each of the first
three tests. If a man wants three tests
made he will pay 50 cents for each of them
instead of getting them free, and for the
extra ones he will continue to pay the same
amount as formerly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am very
grateful for the information the honourable
gentleman has given us. I think ho should
net apologize for lack of knowledge, because
he knew as much about the matter as the
Minister of the department.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

JUNE 5, 1940
BEAUHARNOIS LIGHT, HEAT AND
POWER COMPANY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. D. EULER moved the second
reading of Bill 9, an Act respecting the
Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
the second reading of this Bill I am assuming
that honourable members are well acquainted
with its contents, since the Bill is a short one
and the principle involved is very easily understood. Briefly, the Bill provides for extending
authority to the Beauharnois Company for the
taking of 30,000 cubic second feet of water from
the St. Lawrence in addition to the 53,000
already authorized, in -order to enlarge its
power capacity and generation of power. This
makes provision, I believe, for a total of about
750,000 horse-power, and will absorb about
one-third of the total flow of the river. The
application for additional power was made,
I think, about a year and a half ago, but it
was not acted upon at that time, there being
no particular urgency indicated. Of late,
however, according to the statement of the
Minister of Munitions, there is an urgency,
because there is not sufficient .power in the
district, the reserve is very smalll, and more
power is needed for the purpose of conducting
war industries. In addition, it is understood
that the Ontario Hydro Power Commission
also desires more power. It is thought that
the Beauharnois Company is in a better position than any other organization to produce
this power quickly, and that it can be produced at Beauharnois more quickly than in
any other locality.
The Bill was rather fully discussed in the
House of Commons the other day. Probably
honourable members have read fthe discussion,
which was very informative. The chief objection, which came from some of the Western
members, I believe, was to the effect that
there should be no further alienation of this
great natural resource, but that it should be
maintained more or less as a public-ownership
enterprise for the benefit of the whole people
of Canada. Frankly, I am rather in sympathy with that thought. I have always felt,
and I have stated repeatedly, that governments should retain the ownership or at least
maintain control of great natural resources
like water-powers, which lend themselves
rather readily to monopoly, and the use of
which is important for the prosperity of the
people at large.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is that why
the honourable gentleman resigned from the
Government?

109

Hon. Mr. EULER: Usually my right
honourable friend's remarks are quite appropriate to what is under discussion, but I fail
to see any connection whatever between his
last remark and what I am discussing at the
moment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is the honourable gentleman supporting the Bill?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I may say, by the way,
that I sec a tremendous change in my right
honourable friend since the happy days when
we sat together in another place. If lie will
bear his soul in patience, which lie finds it
very difficult to do these days, lie will find
out that I am supporting the Bill. I have
moved second reading. I am usually consistent in what I say, and my right honourable
friend will sec the consistency in my remarks
if lie will just wait a moment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps.
Hon. Mr. EULER: As I said before I was
interrupted, I am in accord with the principle
of public ownership in its limited form. But
that principle is in my view overridden by
another one which is involved in this Bill.
As is well known, the ownership of waterpowers in Canadian streams, whether navigable or not, rests in the provinces concerned.
This Beauharnois development is entirely
within the province of Quebec. If, as is the
case, the province of Quebec in its wisdom
sees fit to give certain powers to a private
corporation, it is the province's right to do
so, and this Parliament should not interfere.
The present Bill would not bc before us at all
but for provisions of the Navigable Waters'
Protection Act. I am not a lawyer, but I think
that Act makes it the duty of the Federal
Parliament, in any case where water is diverted
from a navigable stream, to sec that navigation
is not prejudiced or interfered with.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII:
Navigation proceeds now through the canal which has been
eut by the company.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: No.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

Not yet.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
A canal, six
hundred feet wide and twenty-seven feet deep,
has been eut through there and is to be used
for navigation purposes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The canal that was
built by the Beauharnois Company is not
being used for navigation purposes, but in time
if may bc se used, as part of the St. Lawrence
waterways development scheme. If that comes
about-and I do not know whether it will or
not-the Dominion will have been saved a
good deal of money, because the work now

SENATE
being done on construction of the canal is at
the company's expense, and the only outlays
which would thon have to be made by the
Dominion would be for construction of the
necessary locks.
My honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) has, I think, forgotten the Soulanges
canal.
Hon. Mr. EULER: We are assured by
engineers of the Departmcnt of Transport, I
believe, that navigation will not be interfered
with. If, as I understand, our only duty is to
protect navigation, then it is iy view, and
I think the view of the Government also, that
we should net be justified in placing any
obstacle in the way of exorcise by the province of Quebec of its legal powers.
I understand the Law Clerk of the Senate
is proposing certain amendments to the Bill.
I do not quite understand their significance,
but I take it they could probably be considered and diseussed more readily in committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I amn net rising to oppose the Bill.
I did net have mcl success when I rose in
the middle of the speech by the honourable
sponsor (Hon. Mr. Euler).
Tiat is the usual
Hon. Mr. EULER:
result of an interruption.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: My honourable friend and I sat opposite cach other for
many years in another place, and I think he
will accept a promise which I now make to
hiim in all sincerity and with the intention
that it shall never be broken. In so doing
I have in mind a few instances which have
occurred in the present session. I will make
it a point always to give mey honourable friend
a less interrupted hearing than he gives me.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I interrupt? I
think it will be quite impossible for my right
honourable friend to carry that out, because
I give him a similar promise. That puts us
on an equality.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But I am in
the position of having already lived up to
the course of conduct which I promise to
pursue in the future. The honourable member
is net in suchi a position.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My right honourable
friend broke the rule to-day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If be wishes
to verify my statement, let him read Hansard
for last Wednesday. And I think that after
I listened to him to-day with so much
patience, he might exhibit a little more
himself while I am on my feet.
Hon. Mr. EULER.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Would the right honourable gentleman permit me to violate the rule
just once more? Does ho really think that
the reference he made to my resignation from
the Government was in good form?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think that
as the honourable member gets on in years
he should not be quite so sensitive. I am not
a humorist, but sometimes I attempt a little
humour.
Hon. Mr. EULER: We will forget it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sorry
he sees such a deterioration in me since the
time of our former contests. I did not think
I satisfied him in those daysHon. Mr. EULER: I said I saw a change.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -so to-day
he must be very disappointed in me.
In
This measure is an important one.
dealing with it I am not at all trammelled
by any predilections for government ownership. If I were, I should consider what the
honourable sponsor (Hon. Mr. Euler) has said
as a complote answer. In so far as the
Parliament of Canada is eoncerned there is
no question of government ownership to be
considcred. The only government which can
develop the scheme initially is the trustee,
and that is net the Government of Canada.
From the Dominion standpoint, though, there
arc certain pliases on which I amx dcsirous of
being elear before finally consenting to the
measure, if indecd I am able finally to
consent to it. I am not content to take a
certificate of someone in the Departient of
Transport, in respect of navigation rights, as
all-sufficient for parliamentary purposes. On
the subject of navigation itself-and it has
nany phases-I am advised by persons who
have a wide practical conneetion with this
subject that they take exception to the
measure because of its effect on navigation.
Such persons can be heard in the committee,
and there we shîall be able to see whether or
net their objections are valid.
I think the committee should also satisfy
itself fully as to the amount of power which
can be ultimately developed here, navigation
being properly safeguarded. As use of the
water proceeds and diversion from the Beauharnois canal instead of the Soulanges
becomes greater and greater, the interests of
navigation necessarily will shift with the water
and will sooner or later be in the new canal.
There is no doubt that control of this water
for power purposes will affect the levelsnet the average level, of course, because all
the xater goes down, but the levels from
time to time. It is important to see how this

JUNE 5, 1940
will affect the harbour of Montreal, and to
be quite certain on that point.
As to the amount of power that will be got,
the larger it is the more happy I shall be.
The Bill is put forward as a war measure,
I notice. It is not a war measure at all.
This power will be necessary for Canada in
war or peace.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:

Certainly.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would
have become necessary had there been no war.
I hope we shall be able to provide the
source of power in Canada within our own
boundaries-to have wholly Canadian powerbecause so long as we depend upon and use
only our own power we shall not compromise
ourselves with another country. I cannot
understand why we should look forward to
any great development of power before we
sec an end to our own resources which can
be developed at reasonable cost.
I should like also some information on
another subject, which is akin to, or rather
interconnected with, this one. I refer to
diversion of water at Chicago. I should like
to know whether the authorities at Chicago
have been and are now living up to the
United States Supreme Court's decree with
respect to that diversion. This may not appear
to be immediately pertinent to the measure
now before us, but it is quite pertinent to the
whole subject of power development, and
particularly so to that sphere of development
which centres in Niagara and depends upon
diversion into the Great Lakes of certain
Canadian waters which are not now flowing
into that system.
The Bill should go to committee. I fully
support second reading, subject to the reservation that if in committee there are facts
developed which indicate necessity for amendments, I shall support them, and if the Bill
appears in its essence dangerous I shall oppose
it. This second condition I do not expect.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend desires some technical information so that he may be assured navigation
will not be prejudicially affected by the
measure, and he has suggested reference to a
committee. I wonder if we could not attain
the end he desires by discussion in Committee
of the Whole.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no; that
would not do. Evidence has to be heard, and
that could not be done in Committee of the
Whole.

111

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had intended
to add a statement explaining the work which
has been carried on to protect the navigation
of the country; but under these conditions I
will move that the Bill be referred to the
Select Standing Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours.
The motion was agreed to.
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 12, an Act to amend
the Northwest Territories Act.
He said: I would ask honourable senators
to follow me in my reading of the explanatory
notes to the Bill:
No provision is made in the Northwest Territories Act for civil court procedure for that
portion of the Territories lying east of the 80th
meridian. The amendment proposed will extend
to superior courts of Ontario jurisdiction in
civil matters within that area.
The Act contains no express provision conferring surrogate powers on the provincial
courts, and some surrogate court judges have
douibted their authority to deal with wills and
estates in the Northwest Territories. The proposed subsection is to remove such doubt.
Section 35 of the Act reads:
"35. The superior courts of the provinces
of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta
and British Columbia, respectively, shall have
and exercise in civil matters the like jurisdiction
and powers with respect to persons and property
in that portion of the Territories which lies
west of the 80th meridian of west longitude,
and with respect to actions, suits and proceedings affecting them, as they have with respect
to persons and property within the territorial
limits of their ordinary jurisdiction, and te
actions, suits and proceedings affecting them."
1908. c. 49, s. 2.
I desire also to read this memorandum:
For some reason, now rather obscure-unless
it was that necessity was not present-no
provision w-as made for civil court procedure
for that portion of the Territories lying east
of the 80tlh meridian. The superior courts of
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan. Alberta and
British Columbia have jurisdiction in the Territories west of that line. The Bill will extend
to the superior courts of Ontario, jurisdiction
throughout the Northwest Territories. Ottawa
is the seat of territorial government, and the
Publie Administrator for the Keewatin and
Franklin districts is located here.
The Act contains no express provision conferring surrogate powers on the provincial

courts, and some seurrogate court judges have
doubted their authority to deal with wills and
estates in the Northwest Territories.
This
subsection will remove such doubt. The territorial jurisdiction of the surrogate courts will
be similar to the jurisdiction to be conferred
on superior courts under subsection 1.
Section 72 of the Northwest Territories Act
states that "the Commissioner may cause such

of the provinces, in the sense that his permanent home is there, and is only temporarily
absent therefrom in the Territories when found
to be insane. In the case of such a person, I
think the constitutional responsibility, as
between the Dominion and the province concerned, for his care and maintenance if lie be
returned to the province by the Territorial
authorities is that of the province. Contrariwise I think that the Dominion, as represented
by the Territorial authorities, is responsible
for the care and maintenance only of such
persons, found to be insane, as are domiciled
in the same sense within the Territories.
Question 3. Whether, in the circumstances
of the Louis Paul case, your department was
justified in taking the position that this man
was a charge of the Province of Alberta and
not of the Northwest Territories?
Answer: On the facts stated in this case, I
am unable to determine whether Paul was
domiciled in the province of Alberta or in the
Northwest Territories at the time lie was
adjudged to be insane in the Territories; and
I should, therefore, require further information
upon this point in order to be in a position to
form an opinion upon the question of responsibility involved.
Yours truly,
W. Stuart Edwards,
Deputy Minister of Justice.
I. H. Rowatt, Esq.,
Deputy Minister,
Department of the Interior,
Ottawa.
It will be seen that, by subsection 1 of
new section 35, jurisdiction of provincial
courts in civil matters is extended throughout
the Territories to the superior courts of
Ontario, and that by subsection 2 provincial
courts with surrogate powers are given full
authority in relation to granting or revoking
probate of wills and letters of administration.
With these explanations I move second
reading of the Bill.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: I should have
to look at a map before I could be sure where
the 80th meridian runs, but it appears to me
that -this Bill would give the courts of Ontario
jurisdiction over the town of Aklavik and the
whole Mackenzie river basin, an area wholly
tributary to the city of Edmonton. It would
mean that litigants and their witnesses would
have to attend Ontario courts, and that
Ontario counsel would be retained in cases
originating in that district. It is obvious that
counsel practising in Edmonton-where good
counsel grow-ought to have the benefit of
such law work. I should like to know whether
this Bill would put Aklavik and the Mackenzie river basin under the jurisdiction of the
courts of Ontario. If so, I should very strongly
oppose its enactment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may find an
answer for my honourable friend in the statement made by Mr. Crerar, the Minister of
Mines and Resources, when the Bill was in

113

Committee of the Whole in the other House.
What he then said may be a verification of
the memorandum which I have already placed
on Hansard. He said:
At the present time the superior courts of
the provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia have jurisdiction, west of the 80th meridian, over civil
matters arising in the Territories north of
their respective boundaries.
I direct attention to those words: "in the
Territories north of their respective boundaries."
I am not in a position to inform the House
wby that jurisdiction was not extended or
applied east of the 80th meridian.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: At that point it
must be remembered that the meridians and
the compass points are on straight lines, but
the rivers run at variance to those straight
lines.
Aklavik is at the mouth of the
Mackenzie river, on the Arctic sea. The
water system runs from south to north. It
begins at Fort McMurray and all the watershed is tributary to Edmonton. While the
fact that the Territories north of the
boundaries of the four provinces mentioned
are to be under the respective provincial
jurisdictions may seem ai right to a man
working at a desk here in Ottawa, yet it does
not make sense to anyone on the ground.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We shall have
to study a map and see what lies on each
side of the Soth meridian. The Minister continued:
That meridian-the 80th-I might point out,
runs north through Hudson Bay, about twothirds of the distance from the west coast of
the bay.
The Minister was asked:
Is it approximately an extension of the
Manitoba-Ontario boundary?
He replied:
No, it is somewhat east of that. In paragraph 2 it is proposed to give the courts surrogate powers to deal with estates in the territories adjacent to their respective provinces.
Again, the same principle.
Doubts have arisen in the minds of some of
the surrogate court judges as to whether they
have the power now to deal with these matters.
This is particularly so in the Western Provinces.
By way of illustration, may I point out that
in the Northwest Territories north of the
province
of Alberta
considerable
mining
activities have developed, particularly along the
north shore of Great Slave lake. At that point
there is now a considerable population. Two
small mines are operating, and in the natural
course of events people will die and leave
property. Their wills will have to be probated
or administrators will have to be appointed.
This particular section

of the

Bill is being

enacted to make clear beyond doubt that these
powers exist.

SENATE

Curiously enough, in the Northwest Territories Act as it stands at present, power is
given to the Governor in Council to arrange
withe Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba for
care of insane persons, or persons who might
become insane in the Territories adjacent to
Section 2 gives power to the

arrangements with the governments of all the
provinces.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I would ask the
honourable gentleman to let the Bill stand
over until next week, se that in the meantime I may get into touch with the persons
who have communicated with me and ascertain
whether there is anything in their complaint.
They may have misread the Bill and be
mistaken as to its effect.

and the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta
and British Columbia had not yet been
extended northward. This and the fact that
a part of the Northwest Territories was contiguous to northwestern Ontario were probably the reasons why, west of the 80th
meridian, jurisdiction in civil matters in this
territory was given to Ontario.
But now that the four Western provinces
have been extended north ·to the 60th parallel
of latitude, Ontario is no longer contiguous
to the Northwest Territories at any point,
and all of the territory we have been speaking
of, except the islands I have referred to and
part of BafFin Land, are north of those Western
provinces.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that the Bill be given second reading and
referred to a committee, if that will suit my
honourable friend.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You mean east,
not north.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, so long as I
can find out whether ýmy correspondents know
what they are talking about. They say the
Bill would put Aklavik under the jurisdiction
of the courts of Ontario. If it does, it will, I
think, work a grave injustice te the people
there and cause a lot of unnecessary trouble
and expense.
Will my bonHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend inove adjournment of the
debate?
Honourable
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE:
senators, I was on my feet when the honourable member from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) rose, and while he covered part
of what I intended to say, there are one or
two matters I should like to mention.
To understand this Bill one must make a
study of the geography involved. Before the
Bill came to us I did net know just where
the 80th meridian was, nor did I know that
the courts of Ontario had any jurisdiction in
civil matters in the Northwest Territories.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Just up to the
80th line.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I have looked at
the map, and I find that the 80h meridian
runs north just a short distance west of the
city of Toronto, near the end of Lake Ontario,
passes through the east side of James Bay,
very close to the east side of Hudson Bay,
and on north. The only territories east of
that line with which we are concerned are
an island or two at the west end of the
Hudson Strait, and a small piece of Baffin
Land.
When the Northwest Territories Act was

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
meridian?

East of the 80th

The
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No; west.
80th meridian runs north from Ontario. The
territory is west of that.
If this measure passes, Aklavik certainly
comes within it, and so do all the mining
centres to the north of Lake Athabaska, Great
Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake, all of which
are parts of the Northwest Territories and
are now being settled. So you see the objection the lawyers in Western Canada have to
a Bill of this nature.
When the Western Provinces were extended
the Act should in my opinion have been
amended in such a manner that the jurisdiction of Ontario would be taken away from it
and given to the Western Provinces. It does
not stand to reason that an action arising in
Aklavik should be tried in the city of Toronto,
or that counsel in that city or in Ottawa should
be engaged to conduct that action. Neither
does it stand to reason that witnesses should
be brought all the way from Aklavik
to
Ontario. The work should be done by the
courts and solicitors of Western Canada. You
can see from what I have said why I am
opposed to the Bill. In my opinion the Ontario
courts have no jurisdiction out there; and if
they have any it should be taken away. If
Ontario wants jurisdiction in the islands and
that part of Baffle Land east of the 80th
meridian, it should have it, but west of that
line the jurisdiction should be given to the
Wcstern Provinces.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Edmonton that this Bill should not be read
a second time, but that it should be further
considered; and I would suggest that in the
neantime all honourable senators take a look

JUNE 5, 1940

at the map to see for themselves the location
of the territories involved. They will then
discover how ridiculous it would he for a

Bill of this kind to pass through Parliament.
I think the Bill should go te a committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I expressed such
an inclination a moment ago. The question
in my mind is whether we should adopt the
principle of a Bill to which my honourable
friend is opposed in toto. I suppose we might
give the Bill second reading without binding
the Senate to the principle, and then send it
to committee. I wonder what committee it
should be sent te.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: After the Bill
is read the second time, we will send it to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. This will give my honourable
friends from the West time to secure the
information they desire.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
LOAN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 22, an Act to authorize
the raising, by way of loan, of certain sums
of money for the Public Service.
He said: Honourable senators, at the suggestion of my right honourable friend I have
asked Mr. Lowe, of the Department of
Finance, and Mr. Johnson, the solicitor for
that department, te come te the floor.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We had better
take the second reading of the Bill and go
into committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 1-short title:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I should like
to read a memorandum which explains the
application of this Bill. It says:
This Bill authorizes the Governor in Couneil

to borrow a sum not exceeding $750,000,000 by
the issue and sale or pledge of securities of
Canada.
95832-8j

115

The purposes for which the money so borrowed may be used are set out in the Bill, and
are as follows:
(i) to pay or redeen the whole or any portion
of any loans or obligations of Canada;
(ii) to purchase unmatured securities of
Canada;
(iii) for public works; and
(iv) for general purposes.
The main purpose for which it is intended
to use moneys borrowed under this Bill is to
pay off securities of Canada which mature or
are callable within the next year or two.
The following table shows the loans which
are maturing or are callable prior to the end
of 1941:
Maturing in 1940 .. .. .. .. $ 108,293,470 85
Maturing in 1941.. .. .. ..
656,663,000 00

230,000,000 00

$1,088,883,137 51
(*) Treasury bills are renewable under the
Appropriation Acts, but if this amount was
funded into long-term bonds necessary authority
would have to be provided.

The moneys borrowed under the authority to
be given by this Act can also be used for public
works and general purposes of the Government
of Canada. It is to be noted, however, that
the proceeds of the sale of securities issued
under this authority have to be paid into the
Consolidated Revenue Fund, and that they eau
only be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue
Fund under some parliamentary authority. This
means that moneys borrowed under this Act can
be used for publie works and general purposes
only if moneys for this purpose have been voted
or authorized by Parliament. Previous Loan Acts
-for example, the Loan Act, 1939, the Loan
Act, 1936, the Loan Act, 1935, the Loan Act,
1933, the Loan Act, 1931, etc.-all provided that
the moneys borrowed could be used for publie
works and general purposes. There is thus no
change in principle in the Act with regard to
this matter.
The amount authorized to be raised under this
Act is $750,000,000. The Loan Act, 1931, and
the subsequent Loan Acts passed in the years
1933, 1935, 1936 and 1938, have all authorized
the borrowing of the said amount.
If there is any special question which my
right honourable friend would like me to
answer, I am at his disposal.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Apparently
the loan may all be used for refunding. Refundings aggregate $800,000,000 odd, issued
entirely through treasury bills, and, as the
authorization here is for only $750,000,000, the
proceeds will not be sufficient to take care of
refundings that will be available. However,
I cannot think the Bill would be worded this
way unless the department had in mind applying certain of the proceeds elsewhere. I should

INQUIRY

Hon. L. COTE moved the second reading
of Bill D, an Act respecting the Ottawa
Electric Company and the Ottawa Gas
Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
private Bill. The two companies named in it
seek legislation authorizing them to sell their
assets to the Ottawa Light, Heat and Power
Company. The Ottawa Gas Company, which
supplies and distributes gas in the city of
Ottawa, was incorporated by legislation of
the old Province of Canada, which legislation
bas been amended since by this Parliament.
The Ottawa Electric Company, which was
incorporated by this Parliament, supplies
electricity in the city of Ottawa. The Ottawa
Light, Heat and Power Company is the parent
company of these two concerns; or, in other
words, they are its subsidiaries. This Bill,
if passed, would not operate a merger, but
would simply authorize the subsidiary companies to sell their assets to the parent
company.

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the
Government:
1. In a Canadian division of the Canadian
Active Service Force what is the establishment
of: (a) Vickers machine guns; (b) Bren automaties; (c) 3-inch trench mortars; (d) smaller
trench mortars; (e) anti-tank rifles?
2. In a Canadian division of the Canadian
Active Service Force what is the establishment
of: (a) Bren gun carriers; (b) lorries; (c)
platoon lorries: (d) field kitchens; (e) tractors
or dragons; (f) other mechanized vehicles?
3. In a Canadian division of the Canadian
Active Service Force what is the establishment
of 25-pounder howitzers?
4. In a Canadian division of the Canadian
Active Service Force what are the numbers and
calibres of other guns in the division, excluding
anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns?
5. In a Canadian division of the Canadian
Active Service Force what are the numbers and
calibres of: (a) anti-aireraft guns; (b) antitank guns?
6. Of all the equipment, arms, vehicles and
the like referred to in the foregoing questions
and the answers thereto, what equipment, arms,
vehicles and the like are being manufactured
in Canada?
7. From what sources of manufacture and
production, respectively, is the First Canadian
Division of the Canadian Active Service Force
supplied with each class of the arms, equipment
and vehicles and the like above referred to?
8. From what sources of manufacture and
production, respectively, is each class of the
arms, equipment and vehicles and the like
referred to above now available or becoming
available for the Second Canadian Division of

9. Is it a fact that the rifles with which the
First Canadian Division was armed when it
left Canada have been withdrawn from the
division and that the division lias been supplied
from British sources with iew or re-barrelled
rifles?
10. Is it a fact that the departure of the
First Canadian Division from England to a
theatre of war lias been delayed by the nonarrival of certain equipment which was to have
been supplied from Canadian sources?
11 Was there delay in the arrival of any
such equipnent in England; what was the equipment; what was the cause of the delay; for
what period of tinte was delivery of such equipment in England overdue?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall answer
several of the honourable gentleman's questions, but I may inform him that certain of
them cannot be answered, because it is
undesirable to publish information which bas
been compiled from security documents issued
by the British Government. These documents
are subject to the following restrictions:
The document is the property of H.B.L
Covernment and is issued for the information
of officers and responsible officials.
The officer or official in possession of the
document will be responsible for its safe
custody and that its contents are not disclosed
to any unauthorized person.
The document will be kept under lock and
key when not in use.
These are the answers to the remaining
questions, which, I think, relate in the main
to Canadian matters:
6. Mechanically propelled vehicles except
tracked vehicles, Bren guns, and 3-inch
mortars.
Note: A plant is being set up in Canada
for production of 25-pr. guns. Orders have
been given for manufacture of carriers.
7. Whecled mechanically propelled vehicles
from Canada; tracked mechanically propelled
United Kingdom; Vickers
vehicles from
machine guns from available stocks in
Canada; Bren light machine guns from the
United Kingdom; mortars from the United
Kingdom; anti-tank rifles from the United
Kingdom; 25-pr. equipment from the United
Kingdom; anti-tank guns from the United
Kingdom.
S. The equipment for the Second Division
will probably be in exactly the same position
as the equipment for the First Canadian
Division.
9. No.
10. No.
11. (a) Some delay; (b) mechanical transport; (c) through manufacturing difficulties;
(d) five to six weeks.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

PROPAGANDA

AGAINST THE ALLIES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. P. E. BLONDIN: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called,
I desire to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that an American newspaper,
the Chicago Tribune, which circulates freely
in Canada, contains vicious and virulent antiAllied propaganda. The Ottawa Journal in
its issue of May 28 last, under the caption,
"One U.S. Newspaper That Might Be Dealt
With," commented editorially on the fact,
and te save time I would quote a couple of
brief paragraphs of the Chicago Tribune's
editorials, which, among others, are cited
by the Journal. The first reads:
The official liars will be as busy as they were
a quarter of a century ago, seeking to sway
American sympathies, but this time we will be
able to listen to both liars and compare their
claims.
This is the other paragraph:
It is true that all over the globe England
hols people in subjection by military occupation, military courts, and bonbings of open
towns. In this she is no better than any other
European power.
I have in my hand several issues of the
Chicago
paper containing editorials
and
cartoons, all equally offensive and malicious.
The Ottawa Journal puts the question,
"What can we do about it?" and proceeds:
One answer is that Canadianî forests and
Canadian water-power are being used te make
the Cliicago Tribune's iew sprint. The Chîicago

Tribune's newsprint (and the newsprint of the
bitterly anti-British Col. McCormick's New
York News) is turned out by a coupany which
operates mills at Thorold, Ontario, and at Baie
Comeau, Quebec. This company is a wholly
owned subsiliary of the Chicago Tribune; in
effect its manufacturing department.
I may add that the Ontario Paper Company,
according te the Journal, has in the past
received very generous treatment from both
the Quebec and Ontario Governments. And
the fact that the company has not been
requîired to submit te the law of proportional
distribution of orders, imposed by Ontario
and Quebec on all other print and paper
manufacturers, is depriving its Canadian
competitors of millions of dollars for the
benefit of the Chicago Tribune. I would not
insist on the provincial aspect of the question,
but for further information on this subject
I would refer those who may be interested te
the memorandum presented te the Government of Quebec by the nine largest paper
manufacturing companies of that province on
the Sth of April last.

JUNE 6, 1940
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not personally followed the campaign of that paper,
but I shall draw the attention of the department which has the control of papers and
publications coming into this country to the
statement made by my honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to see the honourable leader do a little more
than that. This sheet is a nauseating mixture
of ignorance and malignancy from the first
line to the last, and will do more harm
among ignorant people than anything else I
know of published on the continent. But it
is not the only abominable sheet that reaches
us, though one of the worst. Language at least
approaching what I have said could be used
about another publication, the Saturday Evening Post. I do not believe times are such that
ordinary rules can be applied, and I think
we might well inject a little virility into our
policy with respect to this kind of mendacity.

ANSWER TO INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I was asked yesterday by the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) to put on Hansard a statement made
by the Deputy Minister of National Defence
for Air on Monday last to the service clubs
of Ottawa. This was reproduced on June 4 by
the Ottawa Journal. Here is the newspaper
account of Mr. Duncan's statement:
While Canada would proceed with the British
Commonwealth Air Training Plan framework,
the needs of the moment called for every effort
toward the maximum output of air personnel
in the shortest time for service overseas, said
Mr. Duncan.
Detailing measures taken to speed up Canada's
part in the war, ho said:
"A number of young pilots just graduated
from Camp Borden and who, under other circumstances, would have swelled the ranks of
our instructors, are proceeding overseas immediately.

119

"Fighter and bombing planes ready for immediate action in France have already been
despatched to the United Kingdom and others
are awaiting suitable transportation.
"Immediate action is being taken to greatly
increase Canadian aircraft industry not only
to take the place, where possible, of the machines
whieh the United Kingdom was to have sent

for the training plan, but to provide the Mother
Country with an ever-increasing number of
fighter and bomber craft for active service.
"In order to obviate delays, special powers
have been granted to the Department of Transport and to the Department of Munitions and
Supply which will enable them to proceed with
the letting of contracts for the construction of
airdromes, buildings and for the manufacture
and purchase of essential equipment and supplies with a very minimum of delay.
"While maintaining the framework of the
British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and
proceeding with its development so that at the
earliest possible moment it can be geared to
capacity again, every effort is being directed
towards the maximum output of pilots, air
gunners and air observers, in the shortest
possible time for overseas service, and a steady
flow of pilots, and subsequently of air crews
generally, will proceed overseas monthly from
now onwards to join operational squadrons of
the R.A.F.
"Details are being worked ont to call up
immediately some thousands of young men for
service in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and
their training for any emergency will be undertaken at the earliest possible moment."
At the same time the United Kingdom
reluctantly made known that she was suspending,
for the time being and as a precautionary
measure, the supplying of the aircraft which,
according to the plans, she was sending Canada
for training purposes and as the British contribution to the $600,000,000 total cost of the
plan.
Mr. Duncan was followed by Air Marshal
Bishop, who spoke of the situation in somewhat vigorous and optimistic tone.
I desire to say that Mr. Duncan's statement
represents the Government's policy from the
outset, and the statement made by the Prime
Minister confirms the Government's action.
Mr. Duncan bas not been brought up in the
service. He is an Acting Deputy Minister
who is giving his time to the cause, and he
felt that he could tell the public about the
work of his department. In his address he was
speaking only from the administration point
of view. I would not discuss the fine point
as to Mr. Duncan's having given out information before it was given to the House of
Commons. We all remember how nervous
the whole population was on Monday
of last week, because of the way the situaEveryone was
tion had been developing.
doing his bit to raise and maintain the
morale of our people. So I am not inclined
to criticize Mr. Duncan for explaining how
he was carrying out the general policy of
the Government. Yesterday my right honour-

SENATE
able friend said that Government policy should
be announced in Parliament by the Prime
Minister or by the Minister concerned. That
I admit. But in the present instance the
Deputy Minister was simply describing how
the department was carrying on the good
work which was being done. My right honourable friend has said that a statement of
such matters should come direct to Parliament
and not through a Deputy Minister, because
Parliament would then be seized of the facts
and, if any criticism was to be made, the
criticism would reach the public at the same
time as the statement. Ordinarily that would
be a fair position to take, but one must not
forget that we are at war, and when a
Government, through one of its Deputy Ministers, describes what is being donc towards
furthering the cause which we all have at
heart, there can be, I submit, no reasonable
ground for criticism. As a matter of fact,
Mr. Duncan's statement was heard with
applause and read with approval; and the
Prime Minister's announcement in the other
House, which was virtually a repetition of
Mr. Duncan's outline of what the Government is doing, was accepted by the Leader of
the Opposition as very satisfactory.
Generally speaking, I agree with my right
honourable friend's contention that if a declaration of policy is to be made, it should,
especially if Parliament is in session at the
time, be made to Parliament first. But there
is a difference between ordinary circumstances and the extraordinary circuistances of
to-day. To-day everyone is making an effort
to maintain the morale of our people, and
there can be no criticism of the Government
for increasing its war effort. I submit that
Mr. Duncan gave a fair account of what the
Covernment is doing. Indeed, my right
honourable friend said he did not criticize
Mr. Dunean's statement itself. So the only
criticisim is that the statement should have
been given to Parliament first, and in the circumstances that criticism is a kind of tempest
in a teapot.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, J do not know what we are speaking to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am speaking
to the question put to me by the honourable
member from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner).
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yesterday?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In the honourable gentleman's remarks J did not hear
any reference to the question asked yesterday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

The honourable gentleman says that the
temporary deputy was merely telling the
country what was being donc in pursuance of
a previously declared and well-known Government policy. That, as a statement of fact,
I have to take exception to. That is not
what the deputy was doing. No one can
point to any previously stated Government
policy of which the activities announced by
the temporary deputy would be an execution.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
a question of the tempo.

It

was simply

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no, it was
not that at all. If it were, it never would
have got the reception which the honourable
leader of the House describes. It would have
been accepted as a mere matter of course.
It was not a statement of what was being donc
in execution of the previously published
Commonwealth Air Training Scheme. By no
means was it that; it was quite the contrary.
It was a statement of what the Government
intended to do under the exigencies of the
hour, in departure from the previously
announced course-not an unfortunate departure, not a departure to be criticized, but
nevertheless a very real and important
departure which the public were entitled to
know about. To have a Deputy Minister,
who was called in but a few days before,
make such an announcement to two or three
service clubs, with Parliament sitting a few
hundred yards away, was to my mind an
utterly unnecessary affront to both Houses,
and as unjustified in war-time as at any other
time. As a practical statement of what was
being donc and was intended to be donc under
the exigencies, it was more important than
anything
the
Prime Minister
has yet
announced on the floor of Parliament. Every
word I uttered yesterday stands.

Bill 10, an Act to ratify and confirm a certain
agreement respecting the joint use by Canadian National Railways of certain tracks and

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I will put
it on Hansard. The memorandum reads:
Possibly the following explanation will
clarify the point raised by Senator Meighen
with respect to Bill 10 of the House of Commons
Canadian National Railwavs Bill to
-the
ratify and confirm an agreement respecting the
joint use of certain trackage at Vancouver.
By an agreement of the 5th of February,
1913, between the city of Vancouver and the
C.N.P., the city granted to the C.N.P. a large
area for terminal purposes in Vancouver, one
of the conditions of which grant was that if
and when the city undertook construction of a
bridge over the V.V. & E. tracks at First
Avenue connecting with Terminal Avenue, the
C.N.P. would construct a ramp to the bridge,
pave Terminal Avenue and avoid any level
crossmog.
This bridge has now been built, and the
C.N.P. has constructed the ramp and graded
the roadway. When this was being done, the
city required the C.N.P. to remove its tracks
from Terminal Avenue. These tracks form part
of the C.N.P.'s direct access to its passenger
station.
The removal of the tracks from Terminal
Avenue necessitated the C.N.P. making an
arrangement with the V.V. & E. for a new
station entrance; in other words, changing the
lay-out of the western extremity of the New

agreement now reached between the V.V. & E.
and the C.N.P. secures to the C.N.P. the
required new access to the station consequent
upon the diversion of the New WestminsterVancouver joint section to avoid the level
crossing at Terminal Avenue.
The agreement has been approved by the
Board of Transport Commissioners and the
Governor in Couneil, but under the Railway
Act the Board of Transport Commissioners
has no power to approve any such agreement
for any term in excess of twenty-one years.
and the present application to Parliament is
for ratification, in perpetuity, to accord with
the original running rights agreement.

DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL
DEFENCE BILL

121

Bill 4.

An Act to amend the Department
of National Defence Act
The "Service Estates" to which this Bill
pertains are only those parts of the personal
estate of a deceased member of the forces which
consist of balance of pay and allowances and
other emoluments emanating from the Crown
which, at date of death, are due or otherwise
payable, and effects issued by the Crown which
under regulations the member of the forces
would be permitted to retain, and all personal
belongings found on the deceased member, and
in camp quarters or otherwise in the care or
custody of the service authorities, including cash
on hand and personal articles and effects. The
Bill does not extend to any other part of the
deceased member's personal estate.
Pursuant to regulations made by the Governor
in Council under the War Measures Act an
administrator of estates has been appointed by
the Governor in Council to administer these
service estates of the deceased members of the
military, naval, and air forces of Canada on
active service. Under the War Measures Act,
the Governor in Couneil has made regulations
for the administration and distribution of such
service estates.
The regulations provide:(a) That where in the will of a deceased
member of the forces an executor has been
named and such nominee has been appointed
executor by the court of competent jurisdiction,
or where an administrator or an administrator
with will annexed has been appointed by such
court, the administrator of estates may cause
to be delivered over to such administrator or
executor for distribution, the net assets of the
service estate in the administrator's possession.
(b) Where in a will of a deceased member
an executor has been named, but has not been
appointed executor by the court of competent
jurisdiction where no administrator has been
-appointed by such court, the administrator of
estates may cause to be distributed the net
assets of the service estate in accordance with
the law applicable in each case to the distribution of personal estates.
(c) In the case of a member of the forces
who dies intestate, his records contain sufficient
information to enable the administrator to determine the deceased member's domicile and the
administrator distributes the estate in accordance with the laws applicable in such place
of domicile.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is what
I want.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

EDITION
REVIsED

SENATE
With respect to the question raised by the
Right Honourable Senator Meighen, subsection
2 of section 4A of the Act amending the Department of National Defence Act, whiclh has been
recently passed, provides as follows:"(2) During the tenure of office of any
Minister of National Defence for Air he shall,
in -respect of any matter relating exclusively to
the air service, exercise all the powers of the
Minister of National Defence and in respect
of any matter affecting both the air service and
any otier service, such powers shall be exercisable by the Minister of National Defence acting
in consultation with the Minister of National
Defence for Air."
As the Royal Canadian Air Force Act relates
exclusively to the air service, the powers exercisable by the Minister of National Defence under
the Bill relating to the Royal Canadian Air
Force are, while there is a Minister of Nation-al
Defence for Air, exercisable by the latter.
Under the Act amending the Department of
National Defence Act, the Minister cf National
Defence for Air so appointed holds office until
the expiration of a period not exceeding two
months after the issue of the second of the two
proclamations specified in section 2 of the War
Measures Act.
My right tonourable friend had taken
notice of that situation, that the appointment
of a Minister for Air was only for the duratien of the war. The statement continues:
Upon such Minister ceasing to hold office,
the powers otherwise vested in tim would
revert to the Minister of National Defence,
so that if "The Minister of National Defence
for Air" was substituted for "The Minister of
National Defence" in the Royal Canadian Air
Force Bill and such Bill became law, it would,
u1pon thiere ceasing to be a Minister of National

Defence for Air, be ccessary to make a consequential aniendmnent to the Royal Canadian
Air Force Act.
The explanation given by the Minister of
National Defence for Air appearing on page
364 of House of Commons Debates (Unrevised), May 29, 1940, was based on the foregoing.

I think the statement covers the point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It does. It
is very clear. Usually the Minister of National
Defence is very clear, but le was neot on that
occasion.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

read the third tine, and passed.
YUKON BILL
THIRD READING

POSTPONED

On the Order for the third reading of Bill 11,
an Act te amend the Yukon Act:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND : Honourable
senators, the third reading of this Bill was set
down for to-day in the expectation that I
should obtain the opinion of the Departme nt of
Justice as to the interpretation to be given to
an amendment made in the Ilouse of Comnmens. As the opinion of the Department of
Hoen. Mr. DANDURAND.

Justice tas net vet been secured, I would move
that this order be discharged and bc placed
on the Orders of the Day for Tuesday next.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Speaking for myself-I do net know about the
honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Côté)-I have a memorandum from the
Law Clerk of the Senate, upon whom we
should rely, rather than on the Department
of Justice. Our Law Clerk states that he is
thoroughly satisfied that the wording of the
Bill expresses the exact purpose intended. I
defer to him. I am only sorry that somehow
or other I am not able to follow tis reasoning; but I am net asking that the Bill be
deferred any longer.
Hon. L. COTE: I too liad a conversation
with the Law Clerk, for whose opinion I also
have the greatest respect, and I was not able
to follow his reasoning either.
I tlcrefore
told to the position I took the other day.
Furthermore, in an endeavour to convince
myself that the Law Clerk was right, I looked
at the French version--we all know the difficulty of translation-and I may say that in
the French version one finds an entirely
different section.
But even if I could follow the reasoning
of the Law Clerk and accept his interpretation, there is something else, which has been
entirely overlooked.
If this section means
that all civil liabilities are saved, notwithstanding the enactment of this measure, it would
follow that any citizen could ste the Crownand that is about the only benefit a citizen
would have under the measure-for the refund
of a tax which had been unlawfully collected
if the old ordinance of the Yukon was void.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend uses the expression "unlawfully." There
is simply a doubt which has been raised in
a judgment of a court.
Hon. Mr. COTE: We are net saying it is
lawful or unlawful, but I assume it may be
unlawful, or there would be no amendment
at all. I at just pointing out this feature
to show that the question is not as simple as
mighît appear. If I had mîsy way I would
refer both the French and the English versions
of the Bill to the Standing Committce on
Banking and Cotmmerce, who could quite
easily draft a clause te replace one that reasonably good lawyers cannot understand. We
are all agreed as to what we want to achieve,
and while I am net proposing a clause, I
would

suggest

this,

using

the

words

of

section 2:
Ti provisions of section 1 of this Act shall
be deecied to have come into operation on the
lineteenth day of May. 1919, but net so as to

123

JUNE 6. 1940
render any person either civilly or criminally
liable on account of anything done, omitted
or existing on or before the date of the enact-

rment.

I can understand such a clause as that, and
it would cover the situation quite nicely. If
the leader of the Government is moving the
third readingHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had moved
that the third reading of the Bill be deferred
until Tuesday next, in order that I might
obtain the opinion of the Department of
Justice in the meantime.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Under these circumstances
would it not be well to let the Bill go to
committee, and to have an officer of the
Department of Justice present to give his
opinion? It would simplify matters.
I have been
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
informed over the telephone-I may be correted if I am wrong-that that clause was
drafted by the Department of Justice. In
that case my honourable friend would find
the Law Clerk and the representative of the
Department of Justice defending the clause
in the committee.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Then it could be explained to members of this House who do net
possess sufficient legal acumen to understand
that language.
What I was about to say was this. If the
leader of the Government will move the
third reading, I will move that both versions
of the Bill be referred to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. I give my honourable friend my word that we cannot pass the
French version as it is, because it is not a
proper translation of the English version.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend now falls back on the question of the
If the Department of Justice
translation.
really drafted that clause and it is accepted
by our Law Clerk, I suggest that the honourable gentleman should accept it. Surely our
translators, with those of the Commons, can
arrange between now and Tuesday to satisfy
my honourable friend; so I persist in moving
that this Order be discharged and be placed
on the Order Paper for Tuesday next. In
the meantime, I think, my honourable friend
will be satisfied as to the interpretation of
the clause and the translation.
Hon. Mr. COTE: And I reserve my right
to make further representations.

The Order was discharged.

NAVAL

SERVICE

BILL

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill 2, an Act to amend
the Naval Service Act.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, we have had considerable discussion
over the Bill which is now before us for
second reading. iI have obtained from the
law expert of the Department of Defence the
following explanation:
The persons to whom this Bill relates are
not members of the Royal Canadian Navy (Le.,
Permanent Naval Forces), the Royal Canadian
Naval Reserve, or the Royal Canadian Naval
Volunteer Reserve, nor would they, by the
terms of their engagement with the Minister,
as mentioned in the Bill, become members of
any of said Naval Forces.
It will be noted that upon their entering
into an engagement of the character mentioned
in the Bill, they will be subject to the Naval
Service Act, just as if they were members of
the Naval Service; but the Bill does not
provide that such persons, by entering into such
engagement, become members of the Naval
Service or of the Naval Forces mentioned above.
Further, the Bill does not apply to persons
entering into such engagement the provisions
of any other statute; nor does the Naval
Service Act in itself apply to the Naval Service
the provisions of any other statute except the
Naval Discipline Act of the United Kingdom
and Acts of the United Kingdom in amendment
thereof.
Moreover, Order in Council P.C. 1971 of 21st
May, 1940, which makes the provisions of the
Pension Act (with certain modifications) applicable to members of the Armed Forces of
Canada serving on active service in the present
war, limits such application "to those members
of the Naval, Military and Air Forces of
Canada, who, while serving on active service,
suffer disability or death."
As, for the reasons mentioned above, the
persons to whom the Bill pertains are not
members of the Naval Forces, and therefore
could not be "on active service," the provisions
of said Order in Council would not apply to
them, and, in consequence, they would not come
within the scope of the Pension Act, and no
eligibility for pension would arise.
Not being members of the Naval Forces, they
would not be eligible for the pay, allowances
and other emoluments prescribed for such
members.
The sole effect of the Bill in question is to
mate these persons who enter into an engagement with the Minister of National Defence
subject in certain cireumstances to Naval
discipline, without at the same time bestowing
upon them all the rights, privileges and benefits
which would otherwise accrue to them if they
were members of any of the three classes of
Naval Forces mentioned in the Naval Service
Act.
I do net know whether my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), his neighbour the honourable senator from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne), and my honourable friend

124

SENATE

from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) have been able
to follow this statement closely enough to
accept the interpretation which is given by
the department. If they have, I will move
the second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I do
not feel like resisting the interpretation of the
department. I only hope it is correct. I
know that if it is correct it will satisfy the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy),
as it does myself and the honourable senator
to my left (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), because it
means that the persons referred to in the Bill
will not be entitled to the benefits mentioned.
But the wording of the Bill still disturbs
me a little. It says that this person, who will
not be a member of the Naval Serviceshall, so long as the engagement remains in
force, and notwithstanding that for the time
being he may not be serving in any ship, be
subject to this Act,That is the Naval Service Act, which is being
amended. As far as those words are concerned, I feel the memorandum would fully
apply and be correct. But the clause goes
further, and says:
-and
the provisions of this Act shall apply
in relation to that person as if, while subject
to this Act, he belonged to the Naval Service.
So, even though he does not belong to the
Naval Service, and is not made to belong to
it by this amendment, the provisions of the
Naval Service Act unquestionably will apply
to him just as if he did belong. I followed
the reading of the departmental memorandum
as carefully as I could, but I am not clear
yet-perhaps I shall be when I read the
memorandum-as to whether the Naval
Service Act itself, within its own boundaries,
gives pension rights. If it does, these persons
covered by the measure will be entitled to
pension, but if it does not in itself or by
reference to another Act or in any other way
give such rights, they will not be entitled
to pension. I am pretty confident that I
shall be satisfied when I read the memorandum.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps second
reading could be given and the Bill set down
for third readingRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That will be
all right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
-with
this
understanding, that the memorandum I have
read will go on Hansard, and that between
now and Tuesday next the Bill will be studied
by our Law Clerk in the light of the departmental interpretation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to get his opinion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The memorandum comes from Colonel Orde, JudgeAdvocate-General in the department, who
stands high in the legal community. If our
Law Clerk finds himself in agreement with
the memorandum, he will say so. But if he
has any doubt about it, he can confer with
Colonel Orde.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All right.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CANADA EVIDENCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 6, an Act to amend the Canada
Evidence Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very short Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is all right,
I think.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If honourable
members have read it, I will not make any
explanation.
Hon. A. J. LEGER: Honourable senators,
may I ask the honourable leader of the House
whether the intention is to send this Bill to
Committee of the Whole? I understand the
amendment and the explanatory note, but I
am not sure that the wording of the amendment is very apt. It reads:
Wiere proof is offered by affidavit pursuant
to the provisions of this section it shall not
be nccessary to prove the official character of
the person making the affidavitSo far, it is clear.
-if that information is set out in the body
of the affclavit.
May I ask: what information? Does it
mean information as to the official character
of the person making the affidavit? I cannot
see that it means anything else. The explanatory note makes clear what is intended, and
it seems to me the amendment would bu
plainer if it followed the language used in
some provincial statutes. I would suggest that
the words "if that information is set out"
be struck out, and the words " otherwise than
by swearing to same " be substituted. That
would make the amendment read:
Where proof is offered by affidavit pursuant
to the provisions of this section it shall not
lenecessary to prove the

official

character of

the person making the affidavit otherwise than
by swearing to same in the body of the affidavit.

JUNE 6, 1940
The amendment as now worded is not clear.
A judge, looking at this wording, might reasonably ask: what is to be contained in "that
information" if it is set out? If the amendment were revised as I am suggesting, there
would be no ambiguity about it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is the honourable gentleman putting a question to me?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I am not putting any
question. I am simply throwing out a suggestion that the amendment as at present
worded is not clear, because it does not show
just what is meant by "that information".
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would inform
my honourable friend that the Bill emanates
from the Department of Justice and, in its
form, is accepted by our Law Clerk. Here
is what the Minister of Justice said when
explaining the Bill in another place:
This is a very simple BillHon. Mr. LEGER: I am not objecting
to the principle of the Bill. I think the
purpose which the departnent wished to
achieve is very commendable, but that it is
not achieved by the amendment. That is my
point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member's point would be met if the words
"that information" were changed ta "such
official character". Then the wording would
be:
if such officiai character is set out in the body
of the affidavit.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:

Yes, that would cover

it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
it seems ta me the point is something like
this. An affidavit comes, let us say, from the
Deputy Minister of Defence, and it begins,
"I, So-and-so, Deputy Minister of Defence,
hereby swear-." Well, he does not swear that
ne is Deputy Minister of Defence; what he
swears ta is what follows the statement that
he is Deputy Minister of Defence. The point
made, as I see it, is that in the body of
the affidavit he should alsa swear that he is
Deputy Minister of Defence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
position ta agree or dissent.

I am nat in a

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yau see, the affidavit
would cite that lie is the deputy minister,
but the deputy minister does nat swear that
be holds that position.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He may nat
swear ta it, but in the affidavit he states his
officiai position.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why nat swear ta it?

125

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose if that
point were to be covered exactly, it would be
necessary ta alter thousands of documents.
I should like to read what was said by the
Minister of Justice in explaining -the reason
for this amendment:
This is a very simple Bill. It is to make
clearer the disposition of an amendment which
was made in 1938 by chapter 4 of the statutes
of that year.
Section 2 of that chapter
provides:
Where by any statute of Canada or regulation
thereunder provision is made for sending by
mail any request for information, notice or
demand by a department or other branch of
the public service, an affidavit of an officer of
the department or other branch of the publie
service sworn before any commissioner or other
person authorized to take affidavits setting out
that he bas charge of the appropriate records,
that lie has a knowledge of the facts in the
particular case, that such a request, notice or
demand was sent by registered letter . . .
Then the certificate of the post office that
such letter bas been registered is prima facie
evidence that the request, notice or demand
has been made.
This amendment has been requested more
particularly by the Statistics Branch, which is
frequently sending out notices or requests for
information. If a prosecution follows because
the parties have not acted as the law requires,
it involves a great deal of expense ta have
officers of the department travel about the
country ta appear as witnesses.
This was
corrected by the statute of 1938. It was found
advisable ta add the present amendment, so
that the official character of the person who
makes the affidavit, let us say the head of the
Statisties Branch, if it is stated in the affidavit
that he is the head of the Statistics Branch,
will bu sufficient as prima facie evidence. The
statute of 1938 would be valueless if it were
necessary to bring that officer to prove in person
that lie was the head of the Statistics Branch.
It is clear that this amendment is merely for
the purpose of completing the amendment of
1938.
As I understand the point that is now made,
it is that, under this amendment, the officiai
signing the affidavit would not be at the same
time swearing as ta his official character.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: What I wish ta convey
is that the amendment should state it will
be sufficient if the officiai swears ta his officiai
capacity in the body of the affidavit. But
this amendment, as I read it, does net say
that; the language does net cover what is
intended ta be met.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will read the
amending clause again:
Where proof is offered by affidavit pursuant
to the provisions of this section it shall not be
necessary to prove the official character of the
person making the affidavit if that information
is set out in the body of the affidavit.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is "the body of
the affidavit"?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Nobody knows.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Nobody cares.

moved the third

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I was busy at another matter whi]e the motion for second reading of this
Bill was under discussion. But I remember
the Bill; it merely provides for an extension
of the subsidy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The purpose of
the amendment is to continue the present rate
to the end of this year in order that the
automatic application of a new rate for 1941
may be based on a typical operating year.
The Trans-Canada Air Lines had a deficit last
year, but it is expected that this year's operation will show a surplus. Last year was not
a typical year, and if the new rate were to be
based upon the 1939 results it would be automatically increased from 60 cents to slightly
It is confidently expected
over 70 cents.
that, based on this year's operating results, the
rate to be automatically applied a year hence
will be considerably below 60 cents.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is to
say, the continuation of the subsidy provided
for by this Bill is really payment for the
transport of mail. From the standpoint of
the Post Office Department, how does the
revenue from air mail measure up to the
payment for that service so far? From the
standpoint of the T.C.A. it may be that that
payment enables them to make a profit. But
how does the Post Office Department come
out on it? The department, I think, gets
on air mail postage about double the regular
postal rates. I am afraid that if the subsidy
were taken into account it would absorb any
increased revenue derived from extra air mail
rates.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. The Post
Office Department benefits by the profit made
out of a rate based upon the cost of the
service for the preceding year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. But
it does not follow that the department would
not be better off if it were without the air
service at aIl. The department would then
handle all mail through the regular service
and have no subsidy to pay.
For my right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend's benefit I will repeat the
Minister's explanation on the Bill as given
in another place.
This is a simple amendment to the TransCanada Air Lines Act. The Act provides that
the rates to be charged for the carriage of mail
will be set automatically in January of each
year, based upon the experience of the previous

127

year. At the start, a rate of 60 cents a mile
for the carriage of mail was adopted, with the
proviso that until January, 1940, the Government would bear any deficit arising out of
the operation of the line. The belief in whieh
the Bill was framed was that by January, 1940,
we would have had one full year of experience
with the Trans-Canada Air Lines, and that we
would have struck an operating rate in 1939
whieh could have been .applied to 1940. It
turned out that 1939 was not a typidal operating
year; for, instead of getting a full year of
operation, we commenced to carry revenue mail
only on March 1, and passengers on April 1.
We also did not open in that year the full
service that we had originally intended. The
Maritimes extension was opened only this year,
and we have yet to open the extension from
Toronto to Western Ontario. Therefore 1939
is not a typical year. If we followed the Act
strictly, the rate for carrying mail would
automatically increase froin 60 cents to slightly
over 70 cents, whereas we know very well from
operating results that a proper rate for this
year would be less than 60 cents. We feel
certain that the automatic application of the
rate a year from now will bring the rate per
mile down considerably below that figure. The
amendment proposed will make it possible to
continue the 60 cent rate for 1940, and defer
the automatic application of a new rate until
January, 1941. That is its only purpose.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I still think
I am right, though I did not get the full purport of the statement when first read, for the
reason I have already stated. The Minister
says, in effect: "We set out to pay a certain
rate which, we think, represents a fair payment for the transport of this mail, and,
knowing we could not tell what would be a
fair payment, having regard to cost, we
decided to fix the rate by the operating
results of 1939. In the meantime we pay 70
cents."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Sixty cents.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Very good.
They were to fix the rate by the operating
results for 1939. Now they say: "Owing to
incompleteness of the service and so forth,
in 1939, we cannot judge what would be a fair
rate based on that year's operations, and we
shall wait for the results of this year." The
country as a whole is interested in this matter.
The subsidy of 60 cents may prove enough to
enable the T.C.A. to make money or avoid
a loss, but the extra air mail revenue received
by the Post Office Department may be far
below what is required to pay this 60-cent
rate. The memorandum does not cover that
point at all; it deals with it only from the
standpoint of the T.C.A. I am not saying
on my own responsibility that 60 cents is
insufficient to enable the Post Office Department to maintain as good a position as if it
did not use the lines at all. I am asking:
is 60 cents enough to enable the Post Office

128

SENATE

Department to occupy as favourable a position
as to earnings as if it never turned a letter
over to the T.C.A.?
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable members,
may I be permitted a word? I happened to
be Acting Postmaster General at the time the
60-cent cen t ract was signed. Perhaps I am
not betraying any confidence when I say that
the rate of 60 cents is higher, possibly, than
the rate for a similar service which was carried
on by planes which may not have been as
efficient as those of the T. C. A. I think I
may conjecture, more from experience than
definite information, that with the business
developed the Post Office is not making any
money on the basis of 60 cents. As a matter
of fact, apart from the service given to the
public, I think it is true that the Post Office
Department would be better off if it were
not having its mail carried at the 60-cent rate.
The present Bill is merely intended to
continue the existing arrangement for another
year. If it were not renewed at the 60-cent
rate, under the arrangement provided for,
the Post Office Department might have to pay
70 cents, and thus lose still more money.
The proposal is to continue the present
arrangement for another year, by the end of
which time, I hope, expectations will be
realized.
In the end, it does not make a great deal
of difference, for both services are public
services, and in any case the money comes
from the public; but I have a suspicion that
the Transport Department got the better of
the Post Office Department in the bargain.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not have
the slightest information about it, but I was
pretty much of the same opinion as the
honourable member who bas just taken bis
seat. I never could get it into my head that
a six-cent stamp on a letter to be carried
by air from Toronto to Vancouver would
mean as much in profits to the Post Office
Department as a three-cent stamp on a letter
carried over the railway.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But would the
public to-day dispense with the air service?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no. If
you give the public something for nothing,
they are going to yell very loudly when you
take it away. As a man of somewhat meagre
business experience, I may say that the
statement of the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Euler) appeals to me; but to say the
service pays the country is simply absurd.
You may make the T. C.A. pay, but it pays
at the expense of the Post Office Department.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Minister
who bas created the airways affirms that, the
present year being taken as typical, the rate
will be much lower than 60 cents. So it
would clearly appear that the service is being
rendered at a lower rate, and yet is paying
its way.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Sure! That
just means that the man at the head of the
Transport Department knows how to handle
these things better than the fellow he is
dealing with. He says: "I will give you only
such a figure as makes a profit for the T. C. A.
If it means a loss to you, it is too bad."
That goes out to the country as a good
advertisement for the T. C. A., but in reality
the T. C. A. is avoiding a deficit only because
it has loaded that deficit onto the Post Office.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At a lower rate
than the present one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may be
true.
Hon. FELIX QUINN: Before the Bill is
given tbird reading, I should like to take this
opportunity of drawing to the attention of
the Government the failure of the TransCanada Air Lines to extend their service into
the province of Nova Scotia. We have been
pleading with the Government and the Minister to do this for some time. These TransCanada Air Lines have been in operation for
a long time, and they have not yet entered
the province of Nova Scotia.
This system of transport is called TransCanada Air Lines, but its eastern terminal is in
17ew Brunswick. I might point out that in
this time of war, when the port of Halifax is
of such tremendous importance-probably the
most important city in Canada from the
standpoint of war activity-it is very necessary that consideration be given to this situation with a view to having the services
extended into Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall refer the
remarks of my honourable friend to the Minister in charge. In the meantime I might
present to the Senate a statement which I
have concerning the Eastern Provinces. In
the other House Mr. Black, of Cumberland,
put a question to the Minister. He said:
It had been expected that the eastern or
Atlantic terminus of the Trans-Canada Airlines
would be at Halifax. I understand, however,
that

any

lias bee
postponed until the air field at
Halifax lias been perfected. Meantime a feeder
line is operating between Halifax and Monmton.
When is it expected that the Trans-Canada
Air Lioes will use Halifax as an eastern
terminus?

JUNE 6, 1940
That was the question. To this Mr. Howe
answered:
As no doubt my honourable friend is aware,
at the moment Nova Scotia is a restricted
zone for civil flying. With the exception of

mail planes, no flying of civil aircraft is per-

mitted in that province. The restriction applies
to the use of the Dartmouth airport. It had
been fully intended that that airport, whici
is adequate for all types of planes and for
instrument landings, would be used by the
Trans-Canada Service. The field -is not available at the moment, for obvious reasons. A
large number of military planes are stationed

at that point, and it is not considered wise to
permit the ordinary traveller to gain admittance
to the field. Therefore the Service is using the
old municipal airport, which is not capable of
development to any higher standard than it has
now attained. We believe the type of aircraft
flying to that point is the best that could make
use of that airport, and we see no possibility

of using more adequate facilities until military
needs are less pressing than they
present time.

are at the

The discussion continues:
Mr. Black (Cumberland): That is, the feeder
line plane does not operate out of Dartmouth;
it operates out of Halifax city?
Mr. Howe:

That is correct.

Mr. Black (Cumberland):
But it is the
expectation of the Minister that the eastern
terminus of the Trans-Canada Airlines will
eventually be at Halifax.
Mr. Howe: We expect to fly Trans-Canada
Air Lines into Halifax at some time. Unfortunately, if 1 were to go farther than that I
might indicate that we might have three or
four termini down there. I am sure I would
be asked similar questions in respect of Saint
John and Charlottetownand so forth.
This indicates that the department is fully
aware of the situation, and will 'try as soon as
possible, I suppose, to give satisfaction to that
important part of the Dominion.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 27, an Act to amend the
Department of National Revenue Act.
He said: Honourable senators, there are
certain sections of the Department of National
Revenue Act to which it is sought to put an
end. I shall read those sections whose repeal
will relieve the Minister of National Revenue
of certain powers of patronage which lie desires
to turn over to the Civil Service Commission,
and which, as a matter of fact, lie has not
exercised since lie has been in the department.
The subsections to be repealed read as
follows:

(4)

129
The Minister may, after such examination

as he may prescribe, select and nominate suit-

able persons for appointment by the Civil Service Commission, to positions appertaining to
any of the following classes of officers,(a) Customs appraisers of all classes whether
serving at the various ports and places of entry
or as Dominion appraisers;
(b) All officers in the Customs-Excise Preventive Service;
(c) All officers assigned to duty as investigators of values and claims for drawback.
If such appointment is not made by the
Commission within fifteen days from the date
of notice to it of such selection and nomination,
the Governor in Council may on the recommendation of the Minister appoint during pleasure
any such officer. The officers so appointed by
the Commission or by the Governor in Council,
as the case may be, shall be paid such salaries
or remuneration in accordance with civil service
regulations as may be determined by the Commission or the Governor in Council respectively,
and the Minister may appoint the tiues and
manner in which the same shall be paid.
Provided, however, that the Minister may,
after such examination as he may prescribe,
select and appoint during pleasure and may
remove or suspend all masters, officers and
seamen, and every other person engaged or
employed on cruisers or other vessels used in
the Preventive Service, and all officers and
persons so appointed shall he paid such salaries
or remuneration at such times and in such
manner as the Minister may determine.
Provided, further, that in the appointment of
officers under the provisions of this subsection,
other qualifications being equal, preference shall
be given to persons who have been on active
service overseas on the military forces, or
being resident or domiciled in Canada at the
outbreak of the war, served in His Majesty's
forces, or who have served on the high seas
in a seagoing ship of war in the naval forces
of His Majesty during the war, who have left
such service with an honourable record or who
have been honourably discharged.
(6) The Civil Service Commission may on
the recommendation of the Minister at any
time when deemed by the Minister desirable
for the betterment of the service, transfer any
Collector or Surveyor of Customs and Excise
or any Appraiser of Customs from one position
to another.
If such transfer is not authorized or approved
by the Commission within fifteen days from the
date of the Minister's recommendation, the
Governor in Council may on the recommendatien of the Minister authorize such transfer.
(7) The provisions of subsections four and
six of this section shall have effect notwithstanding the provisions of the Civil Service Act
or any other law.
The object of the amendment is to provide
that in future all such appointments shal be
made by the Civil Service Commission, as
was the case prior to the enactment of these
sections in 1928.
The object of section 2 of the Bill is to
place the status of persons now in the service, who were appointed under the Department of National Revenue Act, beyond any
possibility of doubt.

of the Bill is clearly set forth in the explanatory notes. The company are asking for an
amendment to one of the clauses in their

capital stock by one million shares of a par
value of $3 each, and to exchange these for
the existing one million shares of no par

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I desire to communicate to this

our deepest sympathy to you and to your colleagues in the Government of Canada in the
great loss you have sustained and we ask that
our heartfelt sympathy he conveyed to Mrs.
Rogers and her family in their great loss. By
a single-minded purpose, his tact and his understanding, Mr. Rogers had endeared himself to

RELATIONS WITH GREENLAND
APPOINTMENT OF CONSUL AND VICE-CONSUL
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
I have a
statement concerning Greenland which was
read to the House of Commons this afternoon.
It is as follows:
Members of the House are aware that the
seizure of Denmark by the Germans created
a problem for Canada as the nearest neighbour
of the Danish possession of Greenland. The
situation was given immediate attention.
The local authorities in Greenland are continuing to administer its affairs. The Germancontrolded Government in Copenhagen is exercising no authority.
In view of the fact that the people of Greenland normally obtain most of their supplies from
Denmark, and intercourse has now been suspended, the Canadian Government considered it
should assist in maintaining the eeonomie life
of the island. The steamship Nascopie which
is regularly used in the Canadian Eastern
Arctic Patrol, was dispatched on a special
voyage with supplies to Greenland. It arrived
last week and wil] shortly bring back a return
cargo.

SENATE

132

The Government felt it desirable that it
should be continuously informed of the situation and in a position to discuss with the
local authorities any questions that might arise.
Steps have, therefore, been taken to appoint a
Mr.
Consul and Vice-Consul to Greenland.
Kenneth P. Kirkwood, until recently First
Secretary at the Canadian Legation at The
Hague, has been appointed Consul to Greenland, and has already taken up his post there.
Mr. Kirkwood, who was born at Brampton, is
a graduate of the University of Toronto. After
serving in the last war, first in the infantry
and later in the air force. and working in the
Far East, he entered the External Affairs
service in 1928. He was stationed at Washington and Tokyo before being appointed to
The Hague. Mr. A. E. Porsild, who was born
in Greenland and is a member of the staff of
the Department of Mines and Resources, has
been appointed Vice-Consul. The United States
has also made consular appointments in Greenland.
I may add that subsequent to Mr. Kirkwood's appointment steps were taken to have
Mr. E. D. McGreer, of the Canadian Legation
in Japan, and Mr. Pierre Dupuy, of the Canadian Legation staff in France, given the position and duties of consuls in addition to their
existing work.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

the Prime Minister to the High Commissioner
for Canada in the United Kingdom, respecting an interview between the Government of
Canada and the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association, and the conclusions arrived at,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is virtually a
statement of the representations made and
the results attained at that conference.
Cablegram from the Prime Minister to the
High Commissioner for Canada in the United
Kingdom.
Ottawa, June 8, 1940.
1. On Thursday, June 6, our Government
received a large delegation from the Canadian
Manufacturera' Association to discuss the situation with respect to the manufacture in Canada
of munitions and supplies for the United Kingdom and Allied Governments.
2. The delegation expressed great concern that
Can.adian manufacturing capacity continued te
be used to such a small degree in the supply
of essential war materials for the Allied Governments, despite the willingness of Canadian
nanufacturers te utilize to the full the resources
of their plants for this purpose.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

3. As you know, the Government, both prior
to and since the outbreak of war, have on
many occasions both directly and through yourself, drawn the attention of the United Kingdom Government to the availability of Canadian
industrial resources, and recently in a telegram
to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
I drew Mr. Churchill's personal attention to
Canadian resources in this respect.
4. At my suggestion that they prepare a
memorandum as to what points they felt should
be emphasized in representations to the United
Kingdom Government, the delegation from the
Canadian Manufacturers' Association have sent
me on June 6 the communication which follows.
5. "Dear Mr. King: On behalf of the members of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, I beg to thank you and your colleagues
for receiving their delegation to-day.
We realize fully the burdens which members
of the Cabinet are bearing and the many
demands on their time, and only the vital
importance of war production would have
caused us to seek an interview with you at
this critical time. We are very grateful to
you and your colleagues for the patient hearing
which was given to us and also for the extremely
interesting and valuable information that we
received.
You were kind enough to offer to cable
immediately to the Hon. Vincent Massey, High
Commissioner for Canada in the United Kingdom, to ask him to take up with the British
Government the matters we discussed with you.
You suggested that we prepare some notes which
might be of sone assistance in the drafting of
your cable and we are glad to take advantage
of the opportunity which you have kindly given
us, and beg to set forth the following suggestions:
'At

of Canada expressed themselves very strongly

operation to the Canadian, British and French
Governments in this terrible emergency. They
expressed surprise and disappointment that,
following the visit of their Mission to England
last summer and the presentation of Canadian
industrial capacity, which was so well received
in England, and the prompt appointment of a
British Mission to Canada, Canadian industry
is being used so little up to date.
'To-day, a representative group of leading
Canadian manufacturers met the Prime Minister
and eleven other members of the Cabinet in
Ottawa and had a very helpful conference.
'Will you kindly discuss with the British
Government the following points which were
made by the representatives of the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association to-day?
I. Canadian manufacturers made war supplies
to the value of $1,200,000,000 for the Imperial
Munitions Board during the last war. This fact
proves the capacity of Canadian industry.
Canadian industrial expansion snce then has

133

JUNE 11, 1940
2. Canadian industry again extends every
possible co-operation to the British, French
.and Canadian Governments.
3. There is available in Canada a great
amount of industrial capacity, especially in
the engineering, machinery and metal working
trades with highly skilled technical staffs. Over
a year ago, a survey of one hundred plants
showed that these had available 3,000,000 square
feet of floor space. Very little of this is in
use now.
4. There is a great deal of machinery, equipment and tools used in peace-time manufacturing that can e adapted quickly to war manufacturing, with good results in a general
mobilization of industrial resources.
5. The time for placing small experimental
orders is past. The British and French Governments should advise immediately what they
want in large quantities, and give Canadian
manufacturers an opportunity to learn what
is expected of them. On receipt of this information Canadian manufacturers will make their
plans accordingly so as to use their plants to
the best advantage.'
Permit me to assure you that the members
of the delegation who met you to-day keenly
appreciate your kind offer to cable Mr. Massey
asking him to take up our suggestions with the
British Government.
Thanking you on their behalf, I remain
Yours faithfully,
Harold Crabtree,
President,
Canadian Manufacturers' Association."
6. The Government continues to be of the
,opinion that Canadian plants might be utilized
to a far greater extent as a source of supply
for the Allied Governments, relatively free
from the danger of hostile action, and you
are accordingly directed to bring this matter
once more to the attention of the appropriate
authorities in the United Kingdom, setting out
in particular the representations of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association as quoted in
paragraph five of this telegram.
I shall be
obliged if in so doing you will inform the
Government of the United Kingdom and the
heads of the departments concerned that our
Government concurs in the views expressed by
the Association, and repeat the assurance of
our willingness and readiness to do everything
possible to assist in the development of increased production in this country to meet
essentiel war needs.

would have this effect, following, as it does,
upon the provision for retroactivity, proceedings completed being allowed to rest as they
are while proceedings pending are declared not
to be affected by the provision in question.
The views of our Law Clerk are contained
in the following memorandum:
This Bill, insignificant in itself (and one
which, if I had to decide upon the matter I
would say was unnecessary) has undergone
severe attack in the Senate on grounds which,
if they were justifiable, would, despite the Bi.il's
insignificance, justify the attack. That attack
was made upon the assumption that, although
the Bill proposes to give to the Crown an advantage by way of retroactive liegislation, it
does not equivalently protect the subject.
The reason that I did not recommend any
amendment was that I tho.ught, as I continue
to think, that the words of section 2-"but so
as not to . . . affect any . . . liability, civil
or criminal, incurred before its (the amending
legislation's) ena.ctment" were sufficient to proteet the subject as against the Crown.
Now, however, since so many senators (some
only of whom have spoken in the Senate) have
corne to me admitting my construction of
another's draftsmanship to be right, but urging
that language so difficult to construe should be
clarified, lest magistrates and judges be found
to be as honestly confusable as senators, I
have corne to think that it might be well to
accede, and this memorandum is to suggest
that, as Senator Coté asked on Thursday last,
the Bill be sent to one of the standing select
committees for an expression of its views and
amendment to conform, if .amendment be desired.
Then he gives a statement of the reasons
why, in his opinion, the legislation may be
unnecessary.
Now that our Law Clerk and the Department of Justice have expressed their opinion
that the clause will effect its desired purpose
and protect the interests of the subject, I
wonder whether it would be worth while to
send the Bill to committee. I am in the hands
of the Senate as to that.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I had read the report of
our Parliamentary Counsel and knew he was
of opinion that the saving clause, as read in
the other House by the Minister of Finance,
had the effect which that Minister claimed
for it, and that this was accepted by the member for the Yukon as the right effect.
I
had not seen the opinion of the Deputy Minister of Justice. It will be noted by the
House-at least I noted it-that our Parliamentary Counsel, in giving his opinion, followed the practice of some very wise judges
and stated no reasons. After listening to the
extensive historical account by the Deputy
Minister of Justice, I see that ha followed
the same excellent example. Both these gentlemen are better crities of legal effect than
I am, and in my own mind I do not doubt

they are right, but inasmuch as it is just
humanly possible that the Act may come for
interpretation before magistrates no more
perspicacious than the honourable senator
from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté) and
myself, I think the advice of our Parliamentary
Counsel might be followed and the Bill sent
to committee. There less than ten minutes
would be required to put it into language
that the ordinary, very ordinary, mind can
comprehend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

NAVAL SERVICE BILL
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On the Order for the third reading of Bill 2,
an Act to amend the Naval Service Act:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I have a fairly long memorandum
from our Parliamentary Counsel and from
Colonel Orde, Judge-Advocate-General.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have read
the memorandum.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Our Parliamentary Counsel says:
Herewith is my opinion re Bill 2. I agree
with the Judge-Advocate-General that the Bill
does not authorize payment of pensions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is quite
a story to that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my right
honourable friend is not satisfied with that
blunt statement, I will impose upon him a
reading
of the
Judge-Advocate-General's
opinion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I can give a
summary of it quickly, if the honourable
gentleman will agree to my doing so.
The situation is this. When this Bill was
under discussion before, some of us felt it
was quite right that temporary employees
doing duty on ships in the Naval Service in
Canada should come under the disciplinary
provisions of the Act, but we feared that heavy
obligations might be entailed by the wording
of the amendment, which made these em-

136

SENATE

ployees subject to ail the provisions of the
Act and therefore, we thought, entitled them
to any pension rights to which regular Naval
Service men are entitled. With respect to
men coming under this Bill, we felt that if
any special rights-which we described, perhaps wrongly, as pension rights-were to be
given in the event of injury or death incurred
by them in action in a theatre of war, well
and good. But the great object was not
service in a theatre of war at all; it was,
rather, the patrol of our own shores, and we
felt that with respect to men on this duty,
liability for such rights should not be incurred.
The matter was referred to the JudgeAdvocate-General, who sent an opinion to the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) to the effect that the Bill
did not give pension rights to these temporary
employees at ail. There his opinion closed. I
accepted it as final, because I had described
the rights to which the men might be entitled
as pension rights, being unaware that there
were cognate rights. Now it turns out that
the reason the men are not entitled to pension
rights is that such rights arise, not under the
Naval Service Act at ail, but under a certain
Order in Council, founded on another Act,
which brings the Naval Service into line with
other services as to pensions. Ail that the
Bill does is give these employees rights to
which regular inembers of the Naval Service
are entitled under the Naval Service Act; so
that no pensions would accrue to these
employees at ail.
But there is something else, and I rather
feel that in his opinion the Judge-AdvocateGeneral should have called attention to it,
because it was clearly something we were
entitled to know. The Naval Service Act
provides for certain definite rights-rights to
which these temporary employees will become
entitled if this Bill passes. These are not
properly described as pension rights, but they
are important. Sections 38 and 39 of the Act
provide:
38. When any officer or seaman is killed on
active service, or dies froin wounids or disease
contracted on active service, drill or training,
or on duty, provision shall be made for bis
widow ant family out of the public funds at
the prescribed rates.
That is not exactly a pension, but it is a very
important right.
39. Every case of permanent disability, arising
from injuries received or illness contracted on
active service, drill or training or on duty,
salIl bo reported on by a medical board and
coipensation awarded, under such regulations
as are made from time to time by the Gov ier
in Council.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

It is obvious that if we were to be advised
that pension rights would not be added by
virtue of this amendment, we should also
have been forewarned that these other very
important rights would be added. It may be
that we are ready to let these others stand.
For myself, I think that even these, if made
applicable to the large number of men who
are to performi duties in our own waters,
would be pretty extensive. I should not be
averse to our making them available to the
fanilies of any of these temporary employees
wlo may be killed on active service or who
may die from wounds, but, under this Bill, if
any man dies or becomes permanently injured
while on service in Canadian waters, compensation will have to be paid. It will net matter
what brings about the man's death-he may
have contracted arthritis, or smallpoxHon. Mr. HARDY: Or d.t.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -is
family
will be entitled to compensation. Or if be is
permanently disabled because of any disease
contracted during his period of service on
patrol duty, he will be entitled to the same
benefits as would a regular Naval Service man
who had enlisted for life or for a long period
of years.
I think honourable members follow me.
I submit that while we ought to be very
careful to give these men everything they are
entitled te, we should not go farther than
that, and, because of the simple fact that they
serve for a short time in Canadian waters,
bestow upon them what would obviously be
a boon. I suggest that the Bill be referred
to a committee-the Railway Committee
would, I presume, be the appropriate oneand that there we consider whether we want
to restrict its effeet in the way I have
suggested, or leave it wide open as it is now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before closing
the debate I should like to put on Hansard
the opinion of our Law Clerk, in order that
it may be studied by the Judge-Advocate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And by the
committee.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes.
Mr.
O'Connor concludes that the legislation does
not provide for any pension rights. I am not
ready now to follow my right honourable
friend's argument, but no doubt be will
re-state it before the committee for the benefit
of Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Orde. We want to
make sure that the door is net thrown wide
open to a class of people not intended to
benefit under the Bill. This is Mr. O'Connor's
opinion:

JUNE 11, 1940
Commons Bill 2 of this session of Parliament
proposes to add to the Naval Service Act, as
subsection one of a new section 28A, the
following:
"28A. (1) If any person, who not belonging
to the Naval Service, enters into an engagement
with the Minister to serve His Majesty(a) in a particular ship, or
(b) in a particular ship or in such ships as
the Minister may from time to time
determine,
and agrees to become subject to this Act upon
entering into the engagement, that person shall,
so long as the engagement remains in force,
and notwithstanding that for the time being
he may not be serving in any ship, be subject
to this Act, and the provisions of this Act shall
apply in relation to that person as if, while
subject to this Act, he belonged to the Naval
Service and were borne on the books of one
of His Majesty's Canadian ships in commission."
An explanatory note printed with the Bill
is in the following terms:
"The Naval Service Act, chapter 139 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, makes no
provision by which civilians serving with the
Naval Forces of Canada can be made subject
to naval discipline.
"During the last war the situation was met
by enrolling such persons in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve 'for discipline
only.' This procedure was not satisfactory for
administrative reasons, it was open to certain
legal objections, and it gave rise to many claims
for war service compensation whiclh, though
not legally admissible, were extremely difficult
to reject. In the interests of discipline, and to
remove the administrative and other difficulties
mentioned, it is essential that statutory provision be made in the Naval Service Act in
respect of the civilian employees mentioned,
and this is the purpose of this BiPl."
In the Commons the Bill was supported by
the Minister concerned as intended to entitle
the persons to whom it relates to be paid
naval pensions as if they were members of
the Naval Forces. These consist of (1) the
Royal Canadian Navy (permanent forces), (2)
the Royal Canadian Naval Reserve and (3) the
Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reseive.
In the Senate objection was raised that,
assuming persons such as those to whom the
Bill relates to be entitled to pensions by reason
of it, the Bill ought to be amended so as to
exclude from its operation in that respect some
of the various classes of persons who, in other
respects, would properly come under it. Thereupon further consideration of the Bill was
deferred and, on resumption of the debate, the
Government Leader in the Senate read there
on June 6 (Senate Debates, p. 131) an explanatory memorandum of the Judge-AdvocateGeneral (Department of Defence). The memorandum propounded that the Bill mentioned
did not entitle the persons to whom it relates
to be paid naval pensions. There being conflict
between the apparent views of the Minister
(Commons Debates, 1940, p. 359) and those of
the Judge-Advocate-General as to the intent of
the terms of the Bill, and disagreement between
the Minister and the objecting senators concerning the policy of the Bill, as it bad been presented in the Commons, I was asked for a considered opinion as to the soundness of the con-

137

clusion of the Judge-Advocate-General. If his
construction of the Bill is right, all expressed
differences as to policy (which is net my affair)
cease to exist, because in that case the Bill is
not the kind of bill that the objecting senators
had taken it to be and it is already the very
Bill that the objecting senators would seem to
have desired.
On the question of construction I concur
with the conclusion of the Judge-AdvocateGeneral, but I am not sure that my reasons
for concurrence are in all respects the same as
his. For example, if he means to say, in the
last paragraph of his memorandum, that the
persons to whom Bill 2 relates can be subjected
to the burdens imposed by the Naval Service
Act, but cannot claim the benefits contemplated
by that Act, I very positivey disagree with
him. I think that in Bill 2 the words "be
subject to this Act" would be held to mean
"come under" this Act.
I think that the
persons volunteering for service to whom the
Bill relates get the advantage of the sweet as
well as the disadvantage of the bitter (if any)
provisions of the Act.
In this connection I cite hereunder sections
38 and 39 of the Naval Service Act as sections
the benefit whereof is, in my opinion, clearly
extended to the persons above mentioned:"38. When any officer or seaman is killed on
active service, or dies from wounds or disease
contracted on active service, drill or training,
or on duty, provision shall be made for his
widow and family out of the public funds at
the prescribed rates.
"39. Every case of permanent disability arising from injuries received or illness contracted
on active service, drill or training or on duty
shall be reported on by a medical board and
compensation awarded under such regulations
as are made from time to time by the Governor
in Council."
The Naval Service Act does not provide for
pensions for anyone. Any pensions payable
to anyone who happens in fact to be subject
to (that is, to "come under") that Act as a
member of the Naval Forces of Canada are
payable pursuant to, and because of, Order in
Council P.C. 1971 of 21st May, 1940, which, to
the extent intended, applies the provisions of
the Pension Act to members of the armed forces
of Canada serving on active service in the
present war. Thus, only an actual member of
the Naval Forces can have the benefit of the
Order in Council covering the matter of pensions.
Bill 2 carefully provides so that the persons
to whom it relates shall not be members of the
Naval Forces of Canada, although entitled to
the benefits and subject to the burdens of the
Naval Service Act. "The provisions of this
Act," it says, "shall apply in relation to that
person as if, while subject to this Act, ha
belonged to the Naval Service." This is far
from enacting that the person is (per the
Order in Council) a- member of, or does (per
Bill 2) behong to, the Naval Service.
To my mind, the words of Bill 2, "tne
provisions of this Act, shaîll apply in relation
to that person as if .

. . he belonged to the

Naval Service" disclose the proper answer to
the problem in hand. That Act provides for
him no pension rights, nor does any other Act.
I should state, perhaps, that the words of
Bill 2-"and were borne on the books of one
of His Majesty's Canadian ships in commis-

SENATE

138

sion" relate back to the earlier words "notwithstanding that for the time being he may
not be serving in any ship." There is a general
Act relating to discipline an board of Canadian
Government vessels (cap. 203, R.S.C. 1927)
which provides, inter alia, for the books mentioned. It contains nothing else material ta
the present issue.
It should be remembered that ai.y right which
any person to wlom Bill 2 relates because of
an engagement with the Minister is, pursuant
to that Bill's termas, a reflected right. By this
I mean that the Bill contemplates that, so far
as it goes it shall operate to ieflect in sucli
persons any right which is vested by the Naval
Service Act in a member of the Naval Service.
That is to say, the Bill reflects in the "person"
mentioned only such rights as are in a member
of the Naval Service by reason of the provisions of the Naval Service Act, for example
rights under section 38 and 39 of that Act,
Because the pension rights
already cited.
2
applied by Order in Couneil P.C. 1971 of 1st
May, 1940, arise otherwise than under the Naval
Service Act they are not reflected in snch
"person". It is for this reason that I attach
such importance to the words "The provisions
Act shall apply . . . as if . . . ha
of tis
belonged to the Naval Service." There is no
other statutory provision than this uipon which
the "person" concerned can rely, but even if
there were the proper construction of Bill 2
would not be affected, unless by express words.
Finally, as to discipline in the Canadian
Navy, sections 41, 45 and 46 of the Naval
Service Act graînt wide disciplinary powers.
For exansple I set out section 41:
"41. The Governor in Council msay from timse
to time direct that the Covernment Vessels
Discipline Act shall or shall not apply to any
ship or vessel in the Naval Service, or to the
officers, seamen or persos engaged for service
thereon."
Section 45 of the Naval Service Act incorporates, as far as applicable and not inconsistent with the Naval Service Act of Canada
the Imperial Naval Discipline Act, 1866, and
amendmnents and the King's Regulations and
Admiralty Instructions.
Section 46 of the Naval Service Act incorporates

the

Imperial

(Dominion Naval Forces)

"Naval

Discipline

Act, 1911," subject

to the sane modifications, adaptations
exceptions set out in section 45.

FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING POSTPONED

On the Order for the second reading of
Bill 25, an Act to amend the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, 1934:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would ask the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
to postpone action on this Order until I have
received certain information from the Premier
of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
this Bill is based mainly on representations
from the Legislature of Manitoba. I suppose
my honourable friend hopes to obtain some
further views from the Premier.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
The Premier
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bas apparently been urging enactment of this
legislation on the ground that it is desired by
the people of Manitoba. How much time does
my honourable friend require?
I
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Until next week.
wrote the Premier on Monday morning and
should have an answer by Saturday or Sunday
next.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I should like to
ask the honourable the junior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) if he bas not
received a letter from the Premier of Manitoba. If ha bas, then what further information
does he hope to get? While I am on my
feet I should like to ask what is the honourable
gentleman's present attitude. He bas been a
champion on both sides of this question for
years.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I could net hear the
I hope it did not
remark very clearly.
intimate that I had been on both sides, like
my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I would remind
the honourable gentleman that I did not
take both sides. I was inveigled into casting
my vote as I did by the pertinacity and
adroitness of our two leaders. The honourable the junior member from Winnipeg
informed me yesterday that we should get
together to-day and talk this matter over;
but he did not show up. Now he speaks of a
letter ha expects. Honourable senators have
already received from the Premier of Manitoba a letter enclosing a copy of the resolution
passed by the provincial Legislature, which

JUNE 11, 1940
sets out exactly what is wanted. I do not see
what further information my honourable
friend requires.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I happened to be sitting
in the past members' gallery of the Manitoba
Legislature when this matter was being discussed. I received the letter to which my
honourable friend refers, and I have written
the Premier for certain further information,
which I cannot get from any other source.
If honourable members desire, I will state
what that information is.
Hon. Mr MacARTHUR:

Sure.

Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not yet
moved second reading of this Bill, and consequently there is nothing before the Chair.
I am always disposed to defer consideration
of any measure in order that further information may be obtained to ensure its being
discussed more intelligently. To what sitting
does my honourable friend ask that this
Order be adjourned?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
next week.

To the first sitting of

OTTAWA

AGREEMENT BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 29, an Act to authorize an agreement between His Majesty the King and the
Corporation of the City of Ottawa.
He said:
Honourable senators, this Bill
provides for the annual renewal of the agreement between the Crown and the City of
Ottawa under which the city receives a grant
of $100,000. This is the explanatory note:
The operation of the agreement with the City
of Ottawa of 30th March, 1920, was extended
for one year by chapter 59 of the statutes of
1924. The agreement itself is set out in full
as a sehedule to chapter 15 of the statutes of
1920.

In chapter 21 of the statutes of 1925, the
period of the agreement was extended for five
years to July lst, 1930, and the Minister was
empowered to agree on behalf of His Majesty
to pay to the Corporation annually the sum of
$100,000.00 during the said period of five years
from July 1st, 1925, instead of the annual sum

of $75,000 as provided for in the said agreement. By chapter 43 of the statutes of 1931,
the period of the agreement was extended for
one year to July lst, 1931, and it has since that
date been extended annually by Acts of Parliament to July lst, 1939.
The present object is to extend the agreement for one year.
As honourable members are aware, the
annual grant is made as compensation for services rendered by the city to the Government
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable members, I
am rising, not to oppose the Bill, but to repeat
the comment which I made two or three
years ago.
Since 1925 the grant has remained stationary
at $100,000. It is made as compensation for
services rendered to the Government and for
the large amount of tax-exempt federal property within the city. As I have said, since
1925 the grant has not been increased, but the
rate of taxation and the quantum of services
rendered by the city have increased, and the
amount of property held by the Crown within
the city has very greatly increased. In view
of these facts, I desire to express again my
hope of a year ago that the grant be also
increased.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is the city asking for it?
Hon. Mr. COTE: The city has been agitating for it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend knows that the Government makes
other grants, such as those for the embellishment of the city,Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -larger than this
grant of $100,000 under the agreement which
has been in operation for the past twenty
years.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I am already in possession
of that information. I may say that notwithstanding the grant for parks and embellishments, this statutory grant remains quite
inadequate and is a mere pittance in relation
to the quantum of services rendered by the
city of Ottawa to the Government.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

PROPAGANDA AGAINST THE ALLIES
On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day
are called, I would remind the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
that last week attention was directed by the
honourable gentleman froin Laurentides (Hon.
Mr. Blondin) to the distribution through Canada of the Chicago Tribune, and I emphasized
the importance of examining into the wisdom
of that distribution and at the same time called
attention to the circulation in our country
of the Saturday Evening Post. The honourable leader promised to bring the matter te
the attention of the Government, and I rise
now to ask what the Government's decision
is. I have received a great many complaints
and submissions of articles which these papers
persistently publish, every one of which goes
to the impairment and damaging of war
sentiment in Canada. The holding to account
of more or less insignificant individuals who
infringe our regulations is good policy, which
I support, but I cannot understand why, though
doing that, ve should at the same time permit
the wholesale poisoning by foreign journals of
all that sentiment and will-power which must
be behind this struggle if we are to be anywhere at all in it. At least one of these
papers held Great Britain up to opprobrium
for net stopping Hitler back in 1938, and
once that nation undertakes that colossal job
there is nothing too vile that paper can say,
nothing too mendacious it can utter, in trying to prevent success of the job. I have seen
letters from the editor of this paper in defence

JUNE 12, 1940
of his stand, pleading in the puniest of language
the fairness of his attitude. These letters, I
presume, represent the best he can sayHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am sorry, I
did not quite catch what my right honourable
friend said.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The letters
from this editor which I have seen-I am
referring to the editor of the Saturday Evening
Post-are an insult to the intelligence of any
normal man.
If we are in earnest about this struggle-and
we have to be now-why shouId we permit
continuance of that licence? It would have
a good effect elsewhere, as well as in Canada,
to put on a ban, which would express the
eontempt of every Canadian for the line of
conduct pursued by these papers, and especially for that colour of mendacity which permeates their almost every issue.
If my memory is correct, the Philadelphia
paper was forbidden circulation here in the
last war. Its conduct then was of a piece with
its conduct to-day, which must be reprehensible not only to right-thinking people of
the country to the south, who, I am sure, are
in a vast majority there, but still more
especially to those responsible for the course
of that great nation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I share in my right honourable
friend's
strong condemnation
of certain
journals which are circulated in the United
States and among a number of clients in
Canada. The com'mittee charged with the
examination of such papers has been acquainted
with the statements made in this Chamber
the other day. I would draw attention, however, to a situation of high political order
that has lately developed and may explain
the attitude which the Government would be
obliged to take in this matter. In order to
direct the minds of honourable senators to
what my words imply, I would point out
that the highest authority in the United States,
Mr. Roosevelt, has by implication condemned
all this propaganda aimed against the men,
British and French, who are defending the
principles of democracy and the very life, I
think, of North America, and perhaps of
South America as well.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Above the
scurrilous articles that appear in the papers
there stands the conscience of the United
States-I migbt say the universal conscience
of the United States, for expression has been
given to it from the Atlantic to the Pacifia.

141

Perhaps in considering what action might be
taken, we should keep in mind the United
States President's exposition of that country's
policy and doctrine. I shall communicate to
my right honourable friend and all other
Privy Council members who sit around him
any decision that the Government may take
from a high political point of view.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I value what
my honourable friend has said, and rise only
to mention a further point. I have information on which the Government could perhaps
act to advantage, aside from other considerations. It is that the Saturday Evening Post
circulates here on a postal rate of two cents
a pound, that the rate is based on some
authorization by the Postmaster General, and
that it is at variance with our Postal Treaty
of 1907 with the United States. A quotation
from the Act and from the treaty, which
came to my attention, would indicate that the
rate should be precisely double what it is,
and that the Postmaster General was acting
beyond his power in making the reduction,
for be is empowered to take such action on-ly
with respect to publications in certain classes,
in which a periodical of this kind certainly
could not be included. I should like the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to
call attention of his Cabinet colleagues to the
probable effect that rectification of this rate
might have. It might be just as effective as
any other action. When I think of the awful
stench and rubbish going abroad in this
country at two cents a pound, it is hard for
me to restrain my emotions. If by mere
enforcement of the law the necessity of any
other complication could be avoided, it would
be some relief to know that monetary considerations may prevent any continuation of
the present damage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is hoped that
the high lesson in morality given by the
President of the United States may have its
influence upon journalists of that country.
Honourable members will appreciate that
some consideration must be given to the views
of the United States, which may be made
effective by such a stand as that taken by
Mr. Roosevelt.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I quite agree
with that, and I saw the significance of my
honourable friend's remark. However, let him
not hope that a lesson in morality will make
any appeal to these journalists. They live
in a different world.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend's suggestion concerning the
charge for carrying a certain publication
through our mails may furnish a solution to
the problem we face.
,CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION BILL
SECOND READING

Honourable senators will observe that the
schedule annexed to the Bill contains the
Order in Council of August 11, 1939. Members
of the Civil Service who desired to take
advantage of the Order in Council were
required to sign an agreement. This procedure
will no longer be necessary, by reason of
subsection 2 of the Bill, which reads as
follows:

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the

te give statutory effect to the Order in Council
except as limited by subsection 2.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, J understand the Bill, but
my honourable friend's explanation does net
lead me back to the original legislation and
the modification which apparently the Order
in Council effected. Just what that modification is I do not know. I do net think Civil
Service Bills should go throughi this House
without having first been referred to one of
our standing committees. I know Ministers
are crowded, and those below them do net
suffer any disadvantage from a Bill of this
kind. I should like te have this proposal
exarnined very carefully in committee.

accordingly recommends that Schedule M hereto

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
inated.
An Hon. SENATOR:

That is elim-

It is revoked.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Within the past
hour and a half I have discussed this Bill
with the Minister who prepared it and handled
it in another place. I was given his positive
assurance, as I understood him, that all temporary civil servants, on being given permanent status and coming under the pension regulations, will first have to comply with the
revised contributions and, second, there will
be absolute elimination of free service. What
is the elimination of "free service"? Prior to
August last a man who had been in the service
for, say, sixteen years would, on being made
permanent, get credit, without charge, for
eight of those years; or if he paid all arrears
of contributions to the pension fund he would
be credited with the whole period of his
previous service. In other words, he could
get credit free for half his period of service
as a supernumerary or non-permanent employee. In future nothing of that kind is to
be permitted.
I am not disagreeing with the principle of
the Bill, but I do want to draw the attention
of honourable members to what I think are
certain injustices. For the last three or four
sessions we have, to my own knowledge, had
a committee working upon a plan to place on
a permanent basis certain old-time employees
in the protective and other services of the
Senate, some of them with records of eighteen
and twentyAn Hon. SENATOR:

Thirty years.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -and thirty years
of continuous employment.
Unfortunately,
we are sometimes told things that are not se,
but I am advised that before the 11th of
August last some of our friends over in

another place, holding positions similar to
those of the non-permanent members of our
protective staff and other Senate employees
of many years' standing, were made permanent, and thus became eligible for all the superannuation benefits to which I have referred.
Now we are confronted with the Privy Council
Order of August 11 last, which prohibits the
conferring of certain of those benefits on
non-permanent employees with long service
records, and we are by this Bill asked to confirm that prohibition. If such is the case, it
looks to me somewhat like playing favourites,
to the advantage of some persons, mostly in
another place, who are closer to the foot of
the Throne-I mean closer te the place where
special treatment can be obtained. I ask, is
that playing fair with some of our long-term
temporaries, a few only, but with records of
from twenty to thirty years in the service of
the Senate?
Another point I desire te refer to is paragraph (d) of the second proviso in the Order
in Council, requiring contributors to furnish
a certificate of health before coming under
the Superannuation Act. I do not think I
should be divulging any secret if I were to
suggest the possibility that there are around
here one or two old-timers, hard working,
conscientious employees of twenty years'
standing, who could not now get by that
requirement, and who have been hoping to
be allowed te make their contributions to the
pension fund and thereby obtain protection
for their old age. I am not saying it is net
right te require all these exactions; I am
asking whether, under existing conditions, it
is right te draw the line as it has been drawn;
and if I may be permitted te do se, I should
certainly like to support the suggestion of
the right honourable gentleman opposite that
we should have a chance to consider this matter
in a committee where we could have before
us someone who would be able te give us the
actual facts. It is my view that what is now
proposed should have come into effect long
ago, instead of being put into effect now in
such a way as to discriminate against a few
very capable and honest employees around the
Senate. I think we should endeavour to ascertain the real facts. I am by no means
certain that I know them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, my right honourable friend opposite
would like to have a statement indicating the
conditions that prevailed before this Order
in Council was passed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: After listening to the honourable senator from Parkdale,
I think I should like more than that.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I had been
aware that my right honourable friend wanted
the history of this matter, I would have
brought it to him.
The right honourable
gentleman knows that this Bill is the outcome
of the work of the House of Commons conmittee which investigated this whole matter.
In order that my right honourable friend may
secure the information he desires, I shall ask
the Minister to come to the meeting of our
committee-I suppose it will be the Committee
on Banking and Commerce, because this is a
question which concerns finance-and to bring
from his department someone who can explain
the situation prior to the introduction of this
Bill, inasmuch as the grievance of my honourable friend from Parkdale is based on wthat
occurred before the Order in Council was
passed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Who is the
Minister concerned?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Mr. Ilsley.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All right.

the

Hon. A. D. MeRAE: Honourable senators,
as a member of the Committee on Internal
Economy and Contingent Accounts, I want
to support the statements of the honourable
senator from Parkdale. For the last three
or four years that committee has been trying
to iron out some of the difficulties in respect
of the staff of the Senate, and I think it can
hardly be said that neglect on our part is the
reason why certain of our employees are in
a different position from employees in other
places. When the Bill goes to committee it
might be desirable to have members of the
Civil Service Commission appear to explain
the situation to us. I think we all agree that
Senate employees should receive the same
treatment as other employees.
Hon. E. S. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
I should like to support what has been said by
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) and the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock). The leader
of the Government has suggested that this
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce. If that suggestion
is complied with, the members of the Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts ought to be in attendance, and the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

files of the Internal Economy Committee and
all other information available should be
produced.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, the subject-matter of a Bill of this kind
is by no means simple; it is always very wide
in its scope, and as a rule affects a great many
in the service. As I understand it, the House
of Commons dealt with this subject at great
length last session, but the provisions of the
Bill are more or less technical and difficult,
and one scarcely knows what the implications
in any direction may be. It is desirable,
therefore, that the Bill should go before a
committee, and that the committee should,
if possible, have time to hear complaints from
not only our own narrow sphere, but a much
larger field. For example, in our Civil Service
there are hundreds of people w'ho have been
classed as temporaries. How many there are
now I do net know; there may be as many
as two or three thousand. Is it suggested
that regardless of the length of service or of
any other condition all these people are to be
swept in?
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should doubt it.
At any rate, it ought to be recognized by
honourable members of this Chamber that
this is a very complicated and difficult problem, and that, before we can deal with it
intelligently, the actual facts must be known.
We can learn the facts only by having before
us and receiving evidence from all parties to
any dispute that may come up for discussion.
I should think considerable time would be
required to complete the work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would draw
the attention of the honourable gentleman
to the fact that in 1939 a committee of the
House of Commons, after sitting for weeks,
brought in recommendations which apparently
were unanimously approved by that House.
One or two of those recommendations were
covered by Orders in Council, and the Order
in Council referred to in the Bill simply carries out the will of the House of Commons.
In committee we shall have before us, in
justification of the action of the Governor
in Council, the resolution of the House of
Commons. Also, we may hear representations,
though I doubt that we should be justified
in opening the door to all the representations
that might come in concerning hundreds of
individual cases. We are now discussing a
general measure that is based not only upon
an Order in Council, but also a report of
the House of Commons. At all events the
committee, when seized with the Bill, may
do as it pleases about it.

145

JUNE 12, 1940
I now move the second reading of the Bill.
If the motion carries, I shall then move that
the Bill be sent to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

I now move
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that the Bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable members,
we have in this House a Standing Committee
on Civil Service Administration. Would it
not be proper procedure to refer the Bill to
that committee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The same
thought was running in my mind, and I was
looking to see if I could find the report on
the appointment of such a committee. I am
sure the honourable gentleman is right.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The reference is to
be found at page 34 of the Minutes of Proceedings of the Senate. The members of the
committee are as follows: Honourable Senators
Copp,
Griesbach,
L'Espérance,
Marcotte,
McRae, Prévost, Quinn, Robinson and Wilson.
Then I will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
nodify my motion, and will ask to have the
Bill referred to the Standing Committee on
Civil Service Administration.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Honourable senators,
many members of this Chamber who are
interested in this question are not members
of that committee. Personally, I should like
to see the Bill go to the Committee on Banking and Commerce, which has a large membership.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I quite agree with the
honourable senator from Manitou (Hon. Mr.
Sharpe). Our Internal Economy Committee
is a small one, and most of its membership
will be represented on the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. I think that by referring the Bill to that larger committee we shall
get a much better decision.
I see that my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend from Vancouver is a member of both committees; so he can have no
grievance.

One thing I should like to say is this. In
my opinion, we should give more attention
to these various committees which, in our
wisdom, we have seen fit to appoint.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We should remember also that all members of the Senate
may attend all committee meetings and may
participate in the discussion, though only
members of the committee may vote.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: They will not all be
notified of the sittings of the committee.
A notice is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
always posted at the entrance to the Senate.
Does my right honourable friend still persist?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to sec the Bill referred, to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, which I know; but
I do not think it is fair that we should
appoint a Civil Service Committee and then
ignore it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I will say
the Civil Service Committee.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Will the leader have
us alil notified when the committee is to
meet?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. I think
my honourable friend might rely on his
neighbour to his left (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance),
who is chairman of that comm'ittee; but I
shall be happy to notify my honourable
friend.
The amended motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand was agreed to.

of the liberties of mankind. Steadfast in the
noblest of causes, united in purpose, we are
heartened by the inspiration of your example.
We pray that Divine Providence may continue to guide and guard Your Majesty in the
discharge of your higli responsibilities and tiat
you may be vouchsafed continued strength and
many years in the maintenance of tihe glories
of your ancient Throne.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: lonourable members, it is appropriate that on
this day, auspicious in any event, and under
different circumstances a day of joy, we all
join in an expression of our fervent devotion
to His Majesty the King. What is in the
mind of everyone here is this. Come what
may, weal or woe, the devotion we feel now
we shall always feel, and for what it symbolizes
we shall always fight. This we know of His
Majesty and Her Majesty the Queen: whate'er
befall, they will beiave as become the heroism of their line and the nobility of their
race.
Hon. SENATORS:

THE KING'S BIRTHDAY
ADDRESS TO HIS MAJESTY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, last year it was our privilege to have
Their Majesties present among us. They
were acclaimed throughout Canada, and were
surrounded with our affection. To-day I have
the honour to move the following resolution,
seconded by my right honourable friend:
That on this the occasion of the official observance in Canada of the birtiday of His Majesty
the King, a humble address be sent to Is

To tie King's Most Excellent Majesty:

We, the Members of the Senate of Canada,
in Parliament assemsbled, desire respectfilly
to extend our loyal and affectionate greetings

official observance in Canada of Your Majesty's

Hon. Mr. HOWARD moved the third

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I notice this
concern is entitled, as is usual, by the ultimate
word "Company," but in the case of Bill B
that word is omitted. I wonder what the
Probably
significance of the omission is.
the word "Limited" is net necessary to the
title of an insurance company, but surely the
word "Cornpany" is. Bill B is an Act to
incorporate Pool Insurance. It is a company,
and it seems to me the word should appear
in the title.

JUNE 13, 1940
Hon. Mr. HAIG: With ail deference to my
right honourable leader, 1 submit it is flot
necessary. Section 1 of the Bill dealing with
incorporation says:
-the coxnpany are hereby incorporated under
the name of "Pool Insurance ", hereinafter
called "the Company".
1 know of many companies incorporated
witbout the word "Company" appearing in
the title.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI-GIEN: Yes, where
the word "Limitcd" is used. I do not know
how the public will be safeguarded, as it is
entitled to bc, unless you have "Company"
or "Limited" in the title.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Originally the company
was incorporated in Manitoba under the name
of "Pool Insurance". The purpose of this
federal incorporation is to comply with a
request of the Board of Grain Commissioners
that the company be under the inspection of
the Superintendent of Insurance for Canada.
We have used the same title as appears in
the Manitoba incorporation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is, I
suppose, too late to do anytbing now, but
the title should include the word "Company".
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 take it for
grantcd týhat -the title is 'that of the provincial
company.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIýGHEN: It is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Without the
word "Company"?

is wrong.

SECOND READING

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN moved the second
reading of Bill L, an Act respecting The
Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power
Company.
H1e said: If the motion is agreed to, I
s9haîl move that the Bill be sent to the appropriate committee in order that honourable
members may have whatever further information they may dccm nccessary.
This is a simple Bill. The Montreal Light,
Heat and Power Company in 1916 practically
took over the Cedar Rapids Company, and it
now owns aI but 141 of the 98,000 shares.

The Cedar Rapids Company had a bond issue
of $30,000,000 maturing in 1953, but redeemable upýon paymcnt of a 10 per cent premium.

Last spring, conditions being favourable for
cheap moncy, the Montreal Liglit. Heat and
Power Company made a bond issue of
S30c000,000, at 31 per cent instcad of 5 per
ce-nt, securcd on the property of the Cedar
Rapids Company. The insurance company
which bought the ncw issue asked the Montreal Light, Heat and Power Company, as mortgagees, to take over the property of the Cedar

Rapids Company, but wben the necessary steps
werc taken for this purpose it was found that
under its charter, 9trange as it may seem, the
Cedar Rapids Company bad no riglit to seli
the whole of its property. The purpose of the
Bill is to confer ýon the Cedar Rapids Company this power, sucli as practicaily every
company bas.
I may say that the 141 shares belonging
to the public are protected by an agreement

made when the Montreal Light, Heat and
Power Company took over the Cedar Rapids
Company, under which the Montreal Ligbt,

Heat and Power Company agrees to pay on
ahl the shareýs of the Cedar Rapids Company
a dividend of $3 a 8hare, which is virtually
the rate of dividend now paid to its own
ýh archolders.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

ADJOURNMENT

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I move that when the Senate adjourns
this evening it stand adjourned until Tuesday
evening next at 8 o'clock.
In doing so I would draw the attention
of mv colleagues to the resolution we passed
last week, authorizing His Honour the Speaker,
should there arise an emergency which in
bis opinion would warrant such action, to call
the senators together prior to the day stated
in the motion for adjournment. An emergency arose on Monday last, but honourable
senators who were out of town could not be
notified in time to permit of their attendance.
That was their misfortune. I am reminding
honourable members of the resolution so that
those who leave the city over the week-end
may notify the Clerk where they may be
reached by telegram.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before the motion is put I want to raise a
question of some importance to honourable
members who, like myself, live outside the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: During these four-day
adjournments which take place every week it
is impossible for us to get home. Now that
provision has been made whereby, in an
emergency, the Senate may be called to meet
without delay, I think the honourable leader
of the House and the rigbt honourable leader
of the Opposition should give serious consideration to the possibility of a ten-day
adjournment, to enable all members to get
home. It is most unfair that those who live
in distant provinces should have to remain
here for four or five days every week with
nothing to do. Speaking for myself, I am
quite prepared to sit five days in the week,
but I do not like to remain here doing
nothing. By leaving here to-night I could
be home on Saturday, but I should have to
turn around and start back almost immediately in order to be here again on Tuesday.
It would be a great convenience to members
from distant parts to have a ten-day adjournment every second or every third week,
instead of a four-day adjournment every
week. There is a considerable number of
inembers, coming from a distance, who do not
care to leave the city; so tbere is no danger
of lack of a quorum. Last week, during the
special emergency session, very few front
benchers were present, and we in the back
benches carried on the struggle and made a
very important decision.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: What about the
British Columbia members? It would take
them five days to go home and five days to
return. They would want the same privilege
you would have.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Vancouver is just fortyeight hours from Winnipeg.
The British
Columbia members could leave here on
Thursday night and be home on Monday
morning, and by leaving home on Friday
night they could be here again on Tuesday
morning. A ten-day adjournment would give
them five days at home.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I need net
emphasize the fact that the members from the
large provinces of Ontario and Quebec enjoy
a privilege which they would like very much
to share with their colleagues from the other
provinces. The question has always been in
my mind as to what we could do to help
members from the remoter provinces, but the
situation this session has been such that I
have net felt we should adjourn for any
extended period. It is true that the right
honourable leader on the other side has
recently made a suggestion which might
permit of a more extended adjournment once
in a while. But at this moment I maintain
we should meet on Tuesday next. I know
my honourable friend the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) will be with us,
as 1e is expecting a telegran from the Prime
Minister of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, as
a member from one of the Atlantic provinces,
I agree to a large extent with what has been
said by the honourable the junior member
from Winnipeg, and in other sessions I think
I have expressed myself much as lie has donc
to-day. His suggestion, however, does not
seem to me to go far enough. This is the
thirteenth day of June, the middle of the year.
Instead of adjourning now for ten days, or
even four days, I think something should be
done to speed up the business in both Houses
so that members could get home and look
after matters there. The great business of
Parliament to-day is, of course, our conduet
of the war; and I suggest to the leader of the
Government and the leader of the Opposition
that three hundred or more of the most
prominent men in Canada-I say this in all
modesty-should net be tied up here. They
should be at home looking after the business
of the country; for if we are going to carry
on the war we must also carry on the business
of the country. In doing this, honourable
members could render much more effective
assistance to the Goverment than we can by

JUNE 13, 1940
twiddling our fingers and sucking our thumbs
for three or four days during adjournment
and then coming back and finding very little
to do. I suggest to the leader of the Government that he consult his colleagues. I feel
quite sure that ninety-five per cent of the
members of the House of Commons and of
the Senate are prepared to do everything they
can to pass whatever legislation is necessary
for the conduct of the war and the business of
the country, and to bring the business of
Parliament to an early conclusion. Then
they may go home and attend to the business
of the country there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am quite sure
the voice of my honourable friend will reach
the other House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, June
18, at 8 p.m.

MESSAGE FROM HIS MAJESTY
THE KING
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, I have the honour to present a
message received from His Maiesty the King,
as folilows:
Buckingham Palace,
London, 14th June, 1940.

Honourable Members of the Senate of Canada:
I am gre.atly touched by the terms of the

resolution adopted yesterday by the members
of the flouses of Parliament of Canada on the
occasion of the officiai celebration of my birthday. Twelve months ago I left Canada convinced from my own personal experience that
nowhere in the world were Justice and Freedom mûre truly appreciated, and neither in
peace nor in war would the people of Canada
ever suffer themselves to be deprived of their
institutions grounded on those ideals. The dire
events of the year that has passed have confirmed that conviction a hundred-fold. Canada
from the first clearly understood the true import
of this terrible struggle, and the immense issues
that hang upon its outcome. She hesitated
not at 'all, and the resolution with which she
has thrown herself heart and soul into the conflict has been, I can assure you, an immeasurable strength to me and te all in the old world.

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER
inquired of the
Government:
1. From what sources were (a) depth charges,
(b) projectiles for the service of the Canadian
Navy obtained 'at the time of outbreak of war?
2. Are such depth charges and projectiles now

being manufactured in Canada?

3. What quantities has the Government con-

tracted for, (a) to be made in Canada, (b) to
be made elsewhere? When were such contracts
made or orders given?
4. What are the quantities respectively delivered under each of such contracta or orders?
5. How many of the ships of the Canadian
Navy are supplied with anti-aircraft guns?
What is the type of gun supplied?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I have the foI-

lowing answer for the honourable gentleman:

It is not considered in the public interest
to publish information of the nature requested

in the above questions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why wait se

be made elsewbere? When were such contracts
made or orders given?
4. What are the quantities delivered, (a)
made in Canada. (b) made elsewhere?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer te
the first two questions is that the sources of
supply are Canada, the United Kingdom and
the United States. The answer to the third
and fourth questions is that the Government
has contracted for bombs from April 1, 1939,
and has received reasonably
satisfactory
deliveries. A statement of quantities would
net be in the public interest.

SENATE
3. What are the respective quantities of high
explosive shells and shrapnel shells?
4. What are the dates respectively of contracts and orders under which such shell bodies,
parts and explosives are being manufactured?
Government is requested to identify contracts
in the books recording the activities of Defence
Purchasing Board and War Supply Board.
5. What is the quantity now completed and
delivered of each calibre and type of shell
by eacl of the contractors?
I have an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer which I shall communicate to the
honourable gentleman. I am afraid that it
is not absolutely satisfactory, because it
assumes that the question bears on manufacture for Great Britain. I am not quite sure
that this is in accordance with the idea of my
honourable friend; so I shall confer with him
and find out if the answer is satisfactory.
The inquiry stands.
ROSS RIFLES
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the Government:
1. Are the Ross rifles available for use by
volunteer defence organizations?
2. If the answer is yes, to what officer of the
Goveroinent should application be made for use
of these rifles?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have received
the following information from Colonel
DesRosiers, Acting Deputy Minister. Ross
rifles are not available for issue to other
than authorized military organizations. In
this connection attention is directed to the
statement of the Acting Minister of National
Defence, which appears on page 803 of the
House of Commons Hansard of the 13th of
June, in regard to arms and ammunition for
volunteer civil guards. This answers both
questions.
I think the department, if it wishes to rely
on a statement made by the Minister in
another place, should include it verbatim in
the answer.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CO-OPERATIVE MARKETING BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 24, an Act te amend the
Agricultural Products Co-operative Marketing
Act, 1939.

He said: With the consent of honourable
members, I would now move the second
reading of this Bill, which is similar to the
one we had the other day with respect to the
co-operative marketing of wheat. If second
reading is given, I would then move that the
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce. Clause 1 will go
out, as did the corresponding clause of the
other Bill. I suppose the same person drafted
the two Bills.
There are just one or two words I should
like to say with regard to this Bill. I am
not going to make a speech about it. It has
been a very useful piece of legislation during
the past year in the marketing of commodities
produced by farmers in Prince Edward Island,
Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. It has
been particularly useful in the marketing of
alfalfa seed, the production of which has been
rather peculiar. For a little while some places
produced it much better than others; then
they ceased to produce it at al]. For instance,
the county of Peel at one time was the centre
of production of alfalfa seed. To-day very
little, if any, is grown in that county, and the
best alfalfa seed in the province of Ontario
is produced up around Rainy River and Fort
Francis, where, twenty-five years ago, any
farmser would have told you it would be
The same sort of
impossible to grow it.
thing has occurred in Saskatchewan; over
two million bushels of alfalfa seed have been
produced this year in the White Fox country.
That district ten or fifteen years ago would
have been considered of no value for this
purpose. It now produces the best and the
highest priced seed grown in the Dominion.
Part of what is produced there is sold in the
United States, and the co-operative marketing
organization has been most effective in getting
a good market at a fair price.
Other commodities also have been affected.
In Prince Edward Island, naturally, it was
fox furs; in the province of Ontario, onions;
I
and in province of Manitoba, honey.
believe there is some honey marketed in
Saskatchewan also.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:

What Bill is it?

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Bill 24, an Act to
amend the Agricultural Products Co-operative
Marketing Act, 1939.

Hon. DUNCAN MoL. MARSHALL moved

Bill on the Order Paper.

The Bill was read the first ime.

Hon..Mr.

CANTLEY.

JUNE 18, 1940
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I move the second
reading of the Bill, and would suggest that
after second reading it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: It is
true, as the honourable senator says, that
clause 1 of the Bill would go out, in accordance with our practice. Before the Bill is
considered in committee. I should like the
honourable senator in charge of it to try to
find out why clause 2 remains. All clause 2
does is to repeal paragraph b of section 2 of
the Act, and then, having repealed it, to reenact it in exactly the same language.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I have marked
alongside this clause the word "same," with
a view to having it struck out because, word
for word, it is pa-rt of the Act as it now
exists.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THE WAR SITUATION
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I am quite sure that honourable
members of this Chamber expect information
from the represenitative of the Government
on the present situation in Europe and the
actions which the Government has decided to
take and has taken in regard to the situation
as it has developed and is now before us.
With the leave of the Senate I shall read the
statement which the Prime Minister of
Canada made in the House of Commons this
afternoon. It seems to me that the Senate is
entitled to have a first-hand statement from
the Minister for External Affairs, who is in
daily contact with London and Paris. This is
what he said:
At this moment the German and Italian
dictators are together considering the request
of France for a definition of the terms of an
honourable peace. Whatever is the outcome
of the conference and the consideration of the
inquiries of Marshal Pétain, it appears that
effective French resistance on land will soon
come to an end. Conditions are obscure. The
eventual disposition of the French fleet and
air force is at present unknown. The unprecedented offer of Great Britain to form a national
union with France, with all the implications
of common citizenship in representation, in
defence, and in common economie control, bas
apparently met with a divided reception. The
suggestion that Britain and France become the
Canada of Europe must strike the imagination
of this country. Whether or not it proves
a peaceful solution for the present distress of
France, it may yet contain the future hope of
a peaceful Europe. To-day Mr. Churchill, with
bis usual thoroughness and blunt sincerity,
reviewed the state of the war. Whatever may

151

be the present fate of France, Britain will fight
on. That decision is not only Britain's clecision,
it is also the decision of Canada.
No word of criticism will be found upon the
lips or in the heart of any man who surveys
with understanding the situation in which
With ber original

defences broken, the Maginot line outflanked,
ber industrial areas and ber factories in the
hands of the enemy, ber troops without adequate
food and munitions of war, the streets of her
proud capital overrun by the legions of the
invader, effective resistance by soldiers whose
endurance and fortitude have added new glories

We who know the spirit of France know
also that, if ber soldiers have surrendered to
the inevitable, no soldiers in the world could
have continued any longer to face the overwhelming odds against which she had battled
with such courage. France will arise with a
new strength and a new glory from the bloodstained soil on which, three times during the
last seventy years, she lias fought so gallantly.
Ber sufferngs have been our sufferings. The
hallowed French earth where our dead are
buried and our proud memorial stands is a
part of Canada. In a very real sense she is

chivalry, her language and her ancient faith
are an imperishable part of the Canadian
heritage. If she signifies these intimate and
beloved things to a large portion of our people,
to the world of free men she bas always personified the eternal truths of democracy and all
that belongs to the enfranchisement of the
human spirit. A new dawn will follow the
shadows of the night. The legions of freedom
will yet march again through the Arc de
Triomphe to the strains of La Marseillaise.
It is for us at this time to consider the
new situation in which we find ourselves. I
have tried from time to time to forecast the
new phases of the war which were obvions,
perhaps, to any student of the march of events.
To-day it is still necessary, indeed it is more
imperative than ever, to examine the situation
in its true perspective and to assess anew what
may be necessary on Canada's part to meet
the new demands.
The plain facts are that the defeat of France
bas brought the war much nearer home to
Canada. The British Isles are threatened with
invasion, not as a remote possibility. but as an
impending actuality. It is now wholly apparent
that additional measures both for the purpose
of assistance of Britain and for the defence of
Canada are an essential.
The policy which the Government announced
at the outset of the war of assisting Britain by
relieving ber of the duty of protecting certain
areas in this hemisphere bas been greatly
extended in recent weeks. I nointed out in
this House on September 8 last that " by
contributing as far as we are able to the
defence of Newfoundland and the other British
and French territories in this hemisphere, we
shall not only be defending Canada but we
shall also be assisting Great Britain and France
by enabling them to concentrate their own
energies more in that part of the world in
which their own immediate security is at
stake."
Immediate measures were taken at that time
to assist in the naval defence of Newfoundland.
In the light of recent events, additional responsibility has been assumed for the military

JUNE 18, 1940
Finally, I wish to announce that for some
time past I have been giving careful consideration to means whereby there might be included
in the Government additional Ministers to
assist in the direction of Canada's war effort.
and whose presence in the Ministry might serve
to give still further assurance of the power of
the Government adequately te meet the
increased responsibilities with whieh it is faced.
Honourable members will realize that there
are many considerations of which account bas
te be taken in any matter which concerns the
personnel of a Cabinet.
I might mention that not the least important
of these considerations is what is required of a
Minister of the Crown in the way of a manysided experience in the conduet and management of public affairs. An equally important
consideration is whether the talents of leading
executives and business men may not be used
te greater advantage in high administrative
posts, and in an advisory capacity with relation
to particular services, than in the Ministry and
in Parliament.
As the House is aware, my colleague, the
Minister of Finance, expects te bring down the
Budget before the close of the present week,
and thereafter will assume his new responsibilities as Minister of National Defence. At
the time thaL this transfer of portfolios is made,
I expect to be in a position to announce the
governmental changes and additions at present
contemplated.
I might follow up this statement by the
Prime Minister with a statement by the Minister of National Defence for Air, who gives
an elaborate report on what has already been
done. I will read this memorandum to the end,
if my voice does not break down.
I should like ;to make a statement te the
House as te the position with regard te enlistments and recruiting in Canada.
Canada has now approximately 110,000 men
actually under arms and in uniform. These are
divided broadly as follows:
Outside of Canada, including
Great Britain:
Army.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
26,087
Canada:
Army.. ................
64,656
N.avy.. ................
7,256
Air.. ..................
15,594
Total..................

113,593

The late Minister of National Defence has
indicated in various announcements that further
recruiting has been authorized on a large scale
te provide for the raising of men for the 3rd
,and 4th divisions and other units of the
C.A.S.F., amounting in all to about 30,000 men.
Recruits are now being enlisted at the rate
of approximately 800 per day. The whole situation with regard te recruiting these troops has
been reviewed over the week-end and instructions issued te intensify activity.
I am -able to say on the auithority of the
Department of Supply that we can at the present
moment provide clothing. personal equipment
and rifles for 1,200 men per day. As a matter
of fact, yesterday 1.463 men were enlisted and
looked after.
In addition te the 30,000 men the raising of
whom w-as authorized by the la-te Mr. Rogers,
a survey of the field in the light of the war
situation, recently developed and still develop-

153

ing, clcarly indicates the need of a call for
further C.A.S.F. recruiting te replace troops
taken and te be taken for special duties in
Canada and elsewhere, and for forestry and railway troops, as well as corps troops for reinforcements. Whilst it is impossible te forecast
what these requirements will be, authorization
was given over the week-end te provide equipment for 40,000 men in addition te the 30,000
men now coming in.
It will be remembered that the Veterans
Home Guard has been formed as a corps of
the non-permanent active militia, and numbers
of that guard can be readily increased as circumstances may justify. The Veterans Home
Guard Reserve is also, it will be remembered,
part of the non-permanent active militia, and
in fact the non-permanent active militia units
are made responsible for its discipline and
training.
Meanwhile authority bas been given for all
the infantry non-permanent active militia units
which have net been mobilized to carry on
their training in the local headquarters and
te recruit te their respective establishments,
subject only te the limitation of training
facilities. Similar steps are being taken with
respect to certain non-permanent active militia
units other than infantry.
Training accommodation and instructional
staff will obviously be limited in some cases,
but the districts are being instructed te assist
in improvising training accommodation and
augmenting instruction staff, as fa.r as that may
be found possible.
From the beginning of the war our militia
units have been recognized and dealt with as
being the hackbone of Canada's defence organization. and, as is known. the units of the first,
second, third and fourth divisions are all being
mobilized, based on existing non-permanent
active militia units. The Government intends
te follow that policy and has been gratified
by the response -and by the support which
bas been given by the officers and other ranks
of these militia units.
As has -already been stated by the Prime
Minister. the Government is taking full authority
te mobilize the man-power of Canada for the
defence of Canada. Every able-bodied man in
Canada will in due course be given an opportunity of training in the use of arms, so as te
come te the defence of the homeland if necessary.
This training, after due consideration is given
te the requirements of the naval and air forces,
will be entrusted to units of the non-permanent
active militia, which will be recruited volunta.rily or filled under the terms of the new
legislation, according as the facilities for training and accommodation permit.
The length of the period of training will be
determined by regulation. Whether this will
be a continuous period of tlre months or a
lesser time depends (a) on the advice of the
technical officers of the department. and (b) on
the requirements of industrial and productive
man-power as shown by a survey te be immediately undertaken.
The Government has received many suggestions with regard te further training of
civilians. It feels that enlistment in and
co-operation with the non-permanent active
militia units across this country will make for
simplicity and effective administration and
avoid the duplication and confusion of varions
units under varions independent bodies with
varying degrees of efficiency due te lack of
uniformity in regulations and discipline.

sity of all, I would say it is fighting planes.
This does not mean that other things are not
seriously needed, but the teachings of the war
surely thunder home to us this truth, that the
great defect to this hour bas been an inferiority
in the number of fighting planes. True, in
another sphere of mechanism a march was
stolen by Germany-not at all indicative of
any superiority on the part of the Germansin the production of a gigantic instrument of
attack and in the magnitude of that production. It seems reasonably clear, however,
that in the aeroplane, and in the swiftness
with which aeroplane production is multiplied
in the immediate future, lies the outcome of
this struggle.
I know, and the Government know, we have
not made a success of. our equipment production to date. I like the latter part of the
second memorandum. There the Minister of
National Defence for Air has, in my judgment,
exposed the position with sincerity and truth.
He puts it this way, that our sources of supply
of certain equipment have failed us. Our
great error was that we depended on any
source of supply but ourselves. One speaks
of course subject to shadings and qualifications, but, by and large, there is where we
failed, and our failure goes back, as I said
before, not weeks and months, but still
further.
One thing bas hampered us up to now,
if my information is right, and I know it is:
there has been too much circuitousness and
perhaps meticulosity in the deciding of
contracts and the starting of work; and that
policy bas its root in the absence of a single
and ample authority. In the last war we did
not get to the establishment of that single
and ample authority very swiftly. War was
newer to us then than it bas been in the last
year. We had considerable authority, though,
in a well financed committee, when we got
the Imperial Munitions Board, which really
meant the supremacy of one man, in whose
business capacity and integrity the whole
nation, whatever anyone might complain of,
had confidence. That man is dead. But this
Government should before now have selected
a man for a similar position, and agreed with
the Imperial authorities with regard to him,
and given him the same ample authority,
and should not have been under the necessity
of shuffling between a Supply Board here and
a British representative there, and of having
references sent back and forth, with all the
ensuing delays. The Minister of Supply bas
been overwhelmed. I beg the Government to
select the man now. I have no doubt that if
I could myself sit down with the Minister of
Supply we could agree on a man in five
minutes.
95832-11J

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
once.

155
Well, we agreed

Yes, but
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN:
that was for something different, and the man
in question did not have authority at all. I
know he did not. That systein is wrong. You
cannot possibly meet an emergency like this
under that system. It might have been right
for a comfortable war, as some British statesman described it, but this is not a war of that
kind. Agree on that man and give him authority, and get that acceleration which Lloyd
George got in the last war, and which Beaverbrook is undoubtedly getting in this. Your
national registration, your women's committees, your voluntary offerings from this person
and that, here, there and everywhere, who
want to do something, and the setting up of
a ministry to sec what can be donc-all such
things do not matter the turn of a hair, as
compared with the overwhelming demand for
planes. Get your man with abundant power
at the top of that organization, and get him
to-morrow. I know of nothing I would not
do to help the Government get that donc.
Other
That is an imperative requirement.
things in other times and other circumstances
might look big and imperious; they are small
compared with that requirement.
I said I liked the latter part of the memorandum of the Minister of Defence for Air. There
were some features of the other part I did
not quite comprehend. I think these things
could be made simpler. Our total military,
naval and air personnel was put at about one
hundred and thirteen thousand. Of these
there were twenty-six thousand in the division
and reinforcements overseas.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cillary troops.

There are an-

I know a
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
division consists of only fifteen thousand,
and the ancillary troops number about four
thousand. In addition there were sixty-four
thousand described as being in Canada, apart,
of course, from the naval or the air personnel.
We know four divisions have been authorized. One is over there and is now, I believe,
well trained and certainly equipped. The
other three authorized would total only about
sixty thousand. But the Minister's words, if
I caught the memorandum correctly, were
that they were now under arms. If I know
the meaning of those words, they mean not
only fully equipped in point of attire and
accoutrement of the person, but fully equipped
also with weapons and instruments of war.
If the words "under arms" mean anything in
ordinary parlance that is what they mean.
If I am wrong as to military parlance, let me
be corrected. Those three divisions are not

156

SENATE

under arms in that sense. As a matter of
truth, many of the units in them are not
recruited. I will not mention the figures, but
the leader of the House knows that they are
short-did I say thousands?-they are short
tens of thousands. The' reason is, I do net
doubt, although I cannot vouch for it, that
the equipment does not exist. You can probably recruit faster than you can equip and
train. I do not know, but J am quite confident you can. The fact that there is authorization for these three units, one of which, I
understand and hope, is soon to go, is no
justification for giving the impression that all
these men are under arms. They are not.
Australia, I believe, puts her figure at two
hundred and fifty thousand men. But they
are not under arms either.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my right
honourable friend say the Second DivisionRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think the Second Division is fully under arms;
Sami confident it is not; and still less are the
Third and Fourth Divisions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
organized.

They are being

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But they are
not under arms, and unless you include those
authorizations, how do you get sixty-four
thousand? So much for that.
What restrains the Government, I know, is
the impossibility of getting equipment with
sufficient swiftness. We did not start in time,
and we did not start the right way. The toils
in which we find ourselves to-day are mainly
due to the fact that we did not start in time.
Perhaps it is worth recalling to the attention
of the House that an announcement was made
that the Second Division was for overseas,
and soon to b dispatched.
I would drive home this truth. We have
enlisted voluntarily and sent over from twenty
thousand to twenty-six thousand men. We
must support those men. We have no moral
right to enlist men and send them overseas
imless we are prepared to do our utmost,
sparing no effort, suffering no restraint, to see
that the cause in which they have imperilled
their lives is won.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Government's duty.

That

is the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is what
I want to applaud them for, if they will only
go on and go right through. Where those
men are is our best defence. Yes, the war
will be infinitely nearer to us if another nation
falls. There is our great defence, and I beg
of the Government to let nothing whatsoever
Right Hon. Mr,

\EIGHEN.

hinder them in their resolve to support those
men and win the cause to which those men
are committed.
As respects certain immediate steps which
take the ferm of bills, I am behind them a
thousand per cent. They are coming none too
soon-not soon enough. Perhaps I shall have
some comment to make on them, but it will
be with the object of making the Government
feel still freer to throw away all restraint, all
past committals, and throw themselves into
this crisis, the worst the world has ever known,
with all the power of their personalities and
all the might of the nation.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have nothing
te add to the statements which I have placed
before the members of the Senate. J think
that in no uncertain tone the Covernment has
dedicated the whole of Canada's strength to
the defence of Canada and of Great Britain.
We are all in accord as to that. I think that
any one of us who spent an hour or two with
the Minister of Munitions and Supply, the
Hon. Mr. Howe, would find that the Minister
had no superior in grasping a question, examining a problem, considering a tender, coming
quickly to a conclusion, and placing an order.
I do not think there is in Canada to-day a
man who is better equipped than he te do
such work.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Statements have
been made by him to which I would draw
my right honourable friend's attention. Two
statements made in the House of Commons
in the last five or six days will, I think.
completely satisfy my right honourable friend
as to the judgment of the Hon. Mr. Howe
and the rapidity with which he acts. Millions'
worth of contracts are signed in a day. An
order comes for things which can be procured
only in the United States, and the niatter is
closed by telephone within an hour or two.
I doubt that anyone who has followed closely
what Mr. Howe has done during recent months,
who has read what he has said, would think
for a moment that he could be replaced at
the head of his department. J do not think
my right honourable friend suggested such a
thing either.
J wiant to indicate to the Senate that we
hiave strong and good men at the head of
the most important departments.
Looking
on from the outside, we can criticize generally,
but we must pay our tribute of praise
when we look at the facts and follow from
day to day the work these men are doing.
I think we owe a debt of gratitude to these

JUNE 18, 1940
men who are devoting themselves eighteen
hours a day to doing what they believe to
be their patriotic duty. I know that at six
o'clock in the evening some of them have
not been able to devote even five minutes
to lunch. Their devotion is admirable; their
intelligence is unexcelled, so far as I know,
throughout Canada. They may have made
mistakes, but when we remember that from
day to day they are under pressure and are
obliged to meet the production requirements
and hold the wbip over the manufacturers
or urge themn on with e-very possible incentive,
we sbould recognize that these men deserve
the thanks of the country.
If my right
honourable friend tbinks lie knows of any
superman, he is welcome to give bis name and
I will bring it to the attention of the Government.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNiE: Bonourable
senators, I thorougbly agree with everytbing
the bonourable leader of the flouse bas said
in regard to Hon. Mr. Bowe. Be is a very
able man. He bad a very gigantic task, lie
is performing it well, and the country is fortunate in :baving a man with such qualities
as tbe leader lias just referred to.
1 do, bowever, want to point out to the
lionourable leader tbe fact-and I tbink he is
familiar with it-that there has been a long
delay in placing large orders for war materials.
This is caused, I think, by a Jack of co-operation hptween the British mission here and what
is called tbe War Supply Board. During the
Jast war. as my riglit bonouralile leader (Riglit
Hon. Mr. Meiglien) bas stated, the British
Imperial Munitions Board was under the able
management of the late Sir Joseph Flavelle.
He was surrounded 'by sucb capable men as
the late Sjr Charles Gordon, Frank Jones,
J. W. MeConnell, F. M. Soutbam, and many
others, and on behaif of the British Government be placed orders witli great efficiency.
I understand tbat tbe policy followed by this
Government-tbe bonourable leader can correct me if I am wrong-bas been that al]
contracts on bebaîf of the British representative here *must pass tbrougb the Canadian
War Supply Board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That lias been
done at the requ-est of the Britisli Government.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I fully expected
my bonoprable friend to say that. NeveTtheless, tbe delays bave been long and serious.
I could refecr to tbem at any lengtb, but it
would nlot be advisable to do so; and I
believe that now, under Mr. Howe, things
are in, better shape. While I want to give
fui] credit to tbe Governm-ent for what they
bave done, 1 do not want the impression to

go abroad among the public that there have
not been delays. There bave been, and I
trust they have now been overcome.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honou-rable senators,
I do not desire to continue the debate on
tbis question at any lengtb, but I want to
Join the Iast two speakers in the tributes they
bave paid to Bon. Mr. Howe.
I do not
bel:-eve we quite realize, and it lias not been
brougbt out bere to-day, the tremendous
strain under wbîch Mr. Howe is working. Not
onýly bas lie to do the same work that Sir
Josephi Flavelle and bis board did, bot 'le lias
also to sit in tbe Bouse of Commons. Wben
Lloyd George undertook to stir up tbings in
England be did not sit in the Ho.use of Commons. Be would attend once a week or once
a month, as he saw proper. I believe that
would be tbe proper tbing for Mr. Howe to
do in the present ciýrcumstances. As it is now,
lie spends six bours every day, the best part
of the day, in Parliament. During part of
this ýtime be is answering questions, some of
whicb are very trivial, but alI require bis
attention and sap a great deal of the energy
and strength that lie miglit apply to lis chief
work. 1 believe that the Minister of Munitions and Supply should nlot lie required to
si'. in the other Bouse, and sliould appear there
only from ti-ne to time when lie desired to
make a statement. I admit that I am nlot
acquainted with our great captains of industry,
but I 'have yet to learn of anyone living
in Canada wbo is the superior of Mr. Howe.
lit fact, 1 (ould nlot name one wlio is bis equal.
But I do tbink be is overburdened. and I urge
again that lie be relieved of the necessity
of sitting in the Bouse of Commons while
lie is carrying on bis tremendous war work.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Bonourable members,
I tlioroughly agree witli the statement just
made by the honourable gentleman from
Leeds (Bon. Mr. Hardy). We alI realize that
Mr. Howe is a very able man, a good man
for the job lie is on. But lie is a ýmember of
the Government, and as suci lie lias many
duties outside of the important thing to which
lie sbould be devoting al] lis time. In the
lpresent situation the question of supplies
is in my view the only question, and to
require bim to attend Parliament hour after
bour, and many Council meetings as welýl, and
maybe to look after other things that I know
not of, is aýsking far too mu-eh of liim. Bis
main joli is a tremendous one, and lie should
be free to give lis entire time to it. Be lias
an abundance of work on that job alone.
I am not going to discuss the other matter
that was mentioned, but I sliould like to
express an opinion witli regard to one phase

SENATE

158

of it. I think that in the statement read by
the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) there was an intimation that the
Government contemplates the making of some
changes in the Cabinet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Or additions.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Personally, I should
like to see the Government give attention to
one phase of that matter, and that is proper
representation of labour in the Cabinet. As
has been pointed out by my leader (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen), the Government's main
work at the present time is the getting of
supplies. Who makes those supplies? Labour.
And unless labour is properly represented in
the Government, you will never get the back
of labour into this job. Look at what has
happened in Great Britain. Whben Winston
Churchill formed his new Government be had
no besitation at all in taking in men like
Morrison and Bevin.
There were
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
leaders of the Labour party in Parliament.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
labour men.

Yes, but they are

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg the bonourable gentleman's pardon-they are not
labour men; they are professors and highly
cultured men.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Well, J mean they are
labour men in the sense that they are
thoroughly attached to the labour movement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes.
are at the head of the Labour party.

They

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Exactly, that is what
I mean. They are labour men; they are real
forces in the labour organization of Great
Britain, recognized and accepted by labour
men. What representatives have we in the
Government at the present time to compare
to those two men? They have no difficulty
in appealing to the whole of labour in Great
Britain to work twenty-four hours a day,
three shifts, every day in the week, and so
within recent weeks production in Great
Britain has increased, I am told, somewhere
around one hundred per cent. What I say is
this, that in this situation, and in the interests
of the industrialists themselves, who must
necessarily play a very large part in it, it is
very desirable that labour should have real
representation in our Government. I would
ask that the Government consider that matter,
if changes or additions are to be made in or
to the Cabinet.
Hion. Mr. CALDER.

Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I am sure that we must thank the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) for bringing to this Chamber
to-night the two statements which he has read.
They show to my mind and must show
conclusively to everybody else's mind that
the Government desires that we in this
Chamber should know exactly, to the degree
that it is feasible for us to know, what is
happening in international and national affairs.
J think that we all, in spite of our differencesand perhaps, as a partisan, I have as many
differences as anyone has-must agree that
that is so. We have to admit, of course, that
it is impossible for the Covernment to give
us all the information which we should like
to have. But, after all, we must remember
that the Government is in power-that it was
returned on March 26 by an overwhelming
majority.
And we, whether we like the
Covernment or not, must realize and submit
to what the olectors said on that day. That
being so, honourable members, what is our
duty in this time of crisis, for not only Canada,
but the whole British Empire? We must have
confidence and faith in this Government.
J think every honourable member of this
House, and every honourable citizen in this
country, must agree witb me that those who
are in charge of the affairs of this country
know much better than we do what the state
of affairs is in Canada and throughout the
Empire.
My right honourable friend the leader on
the other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) is
right in saying that we have perhaps made
mistakes and perhaps not gone far enough in
the past. But what is the good of talking
about that now? That is all past and done.
I confess to being the greatest sinner in this
Chamber. Ten years ago and fifteen years
ago my voice was heard on the hustings in
this country, and in another place, saying
that there never would be another war; that
we did not need to spend money for the
defence of Canada or the defence of the
Empire. But, honourable members, two or
three years ago I realized the seriousness of
the situation that had by that time developed,
and I tried to recant when I saw that in spite
of what I had said, in spite of what I had
hoped and in spite of what every Christian
in the world had hoped, there was danger of
war. Thon, on the floor of this Chamber,
I endcavoured to show why this country
should do something to help preserve the
British Empire and Christianity. And now I
think we have reached a stage where my right
honourable friend will extend his hand across
to me and say: "Let us all work together.

JUNE 18, 1940
Let us forget what has happened in the past,
because, although we have all sinned and are
not worthy even to mention what was done in
earlier years, we ought now to unite as
citizens of the British Empire and as good
Canadians and try to do what is in the best
interest of this country."
Let us not stop now to criticize what was
done in the past. Let us not criticize even
the present Government. Of course, honourable members, if I had my way I perhaps
should be the strongest critic of the Governnient in the whole of Canada. But in the
present situation I am willing to join hands
with the honourable senator from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) and go so far as to say that
the Minister of Munitions and Supply, the
Minister of Marine and others are doing a
good job for this country. I am willing to
admit, honourable members, that the Minister
of Munitions and Supply is a hard-worked
man. Be is, perhaps, the hardest-worked man
in the Cabinet. I am willing to admit that
now, and to forget all differences and
criticisms, because for us in this country there
is only one thing to do at this time, and
that is to rally to the banner of Canada, of
Great Britain, and of the Empire.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I was delighted to hear
the leader of the Government say that certain
I was somewhat

specially interested in what he said with
reference to looking after Newfoundland. Well,
I do not know what this country can do for
Newfoundland. I do know that 3,700 fishermen from my native land, Newfoundland,
are to-day in the North Sea, on trawlers and
minesweepers, and not one Canadian is over
there. I am not criticizing, but honourable
members will recall that two years ago I
endeavoured to show that this country should
have a Royal Naval Reserve manned by our
own fishermen. As one who has no axe to
grind, no ulterior motive, let me try to impress
upon the honourable leader of the Senate the
wisdom of doing what I then suggested-of
forming in Canada a naval reserve composed
of our own fishermen. Then, if it becomes
necessary to defend the shorès of this country
we shall have good naval men available as
soon as the ships are ready for them; and if
at any time we get a call to send some sailors
overseas, we shall be able to answer the call.
I know our men are willing to go. I know
that on the Gaspé coast, on the north coast
of the St. Lawrence, and from New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island,
right down to the coast of Maine, every
fisherman is willing and eager to do his duty.

159

I have letters in my desk now from a hundred
men who want to join up and be of some service to the country. Let us therefore, instead
of criticizing any person or the Government,
unite now to meet this serious situation. Let
us all get together, no matter what our political
differences may be, no matter what our leaders'
differences may be, for if we are to preserve
our freedom and our political institutions,
now is the time for every man to do his duty,
irrespective of his religion or his politics. Let
us, I say, all get together to meet this crisis
which within a few months may come even
to our own shores. I believe, with my right
honourable friend, that the first line of defence is not Canada-it is not the Nova Scotia
coast. It is all very well for somebody to
say, as I understand was said in the House of
Commons, that he is willing to have conscription for Canada. I am opposed to conscription and to war, but if we are to protect
Canada, if we are to protect this land which
God gave to us, then I say we may have to
defend ourselves in Greenland or in Iceland
or even down in the south Atlantic.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Let us not talk about
doing anything for this land alone, because,
so far as I know, and so far as other senators
know, our line of defence may extend beyond

the confines of this country.
repeat, let us all get together, Liberals and
Conservatives, Grits and Tories, Protestants
and Catholics, and say: God gave us this
land; we are going to defend it against any
foe who may try to invade it.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I had not intended to take part in this
discussion, but I am tired of hearing of what
happened last March. Many brave men
at this very hour are giving their lives in
defence of all we hold dear, and I believe it
is my duty to call to the attention of the
Government certain things that to me appear
to be of very great importance.
The honourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duff) bas made an eloquent plea
te the Canadian people for unanimous support of measures to win the war, but I notice
he linked with that plea a reference to the
overwhelming and unquestioned mandate of
the Government. I have read articles in the
Press also referring to the "unquestioned mandate" given to the Government last March.
I want to hear no more of that "unquestioned
mandate." The vote in support of the Government was far from unanimous. In my district,
which is in the Prime Minister's riding, he
received less than half the votes. In this as
in other instances the mandate certainly was

SENATE

160

flot "unquestioned". And I asic honourable
senators to consîder with shame how the
campaign w as conducted and the recuit arrived
at.

I would eall attention to an editorial on the
attitude of the Globe and Mail during the
1ýeneral election. An article headed, "Government's Course Unes Not Establish Confidence,"
says:

Hon.

Mr. HORNEH.

I should like to rcsd this article on the
"Icurse" of democracy:
In s speech et St. Louis the other slsy,
Wcndell L. Wiiikie, a Republican candidate for
the presidential nomination, referred to "tic
cnrse of democraey." He did ot mean chat
democraey was a curse. but poiuted to one of
its

major

flaws.

He

said:

"The

curse

of

ciemocrscy to-day in tbe United States as w-cll
as in Europe is that everyone bias been tryîîîg
to please the public. Almost nobod3 ever gets
up, anîl scys wbct be tbioks. Hie is afrcid lic
w-ill thereby lose tise approval of labour or
tbe approval of the nmpioyed or tlîe appi oral
of somne otlier powerful faction. And this fear
bias altogetlîer pcrverted the processes of
dcmocraey and sspped our strength."
I believe it is our duty to criticize where
we believo criticism is nccessary.
I w-ould
cli the attention of the Government to a
state of affairs which surciy could and shouid
be renîedied. I have pcrsonclly met many
young men who have voiunteered for active
service. Somie have been accepted, but told
thcy xvould not be reqwired to report for a
week or two. These young men, having paid
their transportation expences to the point of

of themsel'vec while cwaiting the eaul to duty.
In this confection I baive uncler my hand a

One of my criticisms of the Goveroment
is that in spite of the seriousnes of the world

situation it bas, in the province of Saskatchew'an, attcîxdcd to tbe political end of the game.
There bas been a superabundane of provincial

JUNE 18, 1940
officials to see that Liberal party politicians
are placed wherever there is an opportunity
for patronage. On the day of nomination
the full provincial Cabinet was on hand, and
it was announeed that Prince Albert was to
have a full No. 1 air training camp. I charge
the Government has neglected to take care
of our young men who offer to serve in the
fighting forces of the country. While the
Government has neglected to feed and shelter
those volunteers, it has attended to politics.
I am not afraid to criticize the Government
for its neglect of duty.
One man I should like to see taken into
the Government is the Hon. Major Herridge.
He is one of the few who at the outset fully
realized what the Government would have to
do, and it is doing to-day just what he said
would have to be done. I am talking for the
benefit, not of any party, but of Canada as a
whole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is my honourable friend a follower of Mr. Herridge?
Hon. Mr. HORNER:
An Hon. SENATOR:

Not necessarily.
He bas no followers.

Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Is that the best suggestion my honourable friend has to offer for
the moment?
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable members, I do
not think honourable gentlemen on the other
side of the House should get too impatient
with us. I for one stand in the position of
many citizens in this country: those who are
not in the confidence of the Government and
neither know what is going on nor understand
many things that have not been explained.
Last September I voted with other members
in favour of Canada taking part in the war.
We ail realized then that we had three lines
of defence: first, the Rhine; second, Great
Britain; third, the St. Lawrence.
I well
remember the eloquent words of the right
honourable [leader on this side (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) when he appealed to the spirit
of sacrifice of the Canadian people and to the
honourable sentiments which would flow from
our dual inheritance of French and English
ideals and culture, and said, "If we do not
fight on the banks of the Rhine now, we shall
later have to fight on the banks of the St.
Lawrence and the Mississippi."
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Those words were light
itself; and in the altered conditions of recent
days they are even truer now than they were
then. One of our three lines of defence is
gone. As a Canadian and a subject of a
sovereign country which freely declared itself
at war with Germany to save the altars of

161

Christianity and the principles of democracy, I
find, after nine months of war, no pride in the
fact that on our first line of defence, that line
of noble hearts and of steel, which extended
from Abbeville on the Somme right down to
the Italian boundary, there was not a Canadian
soldier, a Canadian tank, a Canadian aeroplane nor a Canadian gun. The thing which
has not been explained to me or to the people
of Canada is why, nine months after our
declaration of war, such a state of affairs
should exist.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall give the
answer, if my honourable friend will allow
me.
Hon. Mr. COTE:
speaking.

When I

am

through

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would tell my
honourable friend to consult the War Office
in London.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh!
Hon. Mr. COTE: If that is the answer, I
would say it is not a very brave answer for a
record which strikes a great many of us as
one of ineptitude.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is a reckless
statement my honourable friend is making.
Hon. Mr. COTE: A record of ineptitude.
However, let us forget the past.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:

We never will.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Even if we forget the past
nine 'months, ail I have to say, in great
humility, as a very unimportant member of
this House whose advice may not count for
much, is this: We have let down our first line
of defence; for Heaven's sake do not let
down the second.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I sinply make
this remark to my honourable friend. The
plans which govern the disposal of the
British troops, including the Canadians, are
made at the War Office in England. Under
those plans Canada must proceed, and never
for a moment has she hesitated to proceed
to answer any call. Canada's First Division
was overseas, ready to go wherever specified
by the plans laid down. It started to go to
Norway, and it was brought back to Aidershot. It started for the coast at Calais and
Dunkirk, and it was brought back. Last week
the War Office was ready to start sending
the Canadian troops with other British troops
to France, and they crossed over; but the War
Office brought them back, because of events of
which we ail know. It is ahl very well to say
that Canada had no men on the first line of

SENATE

162

It would have had some on the
'defence.
first line of defence if the War Office had
deemed it advisable. I could tell honourable
gentlemen how many British divisions were
on the Continent, but I will not do so. I
could tell how many divisions were being
trained in England, including our own men,
and why they were not on the other side of
the channel, but I wildl not do so. Neither
will I allow the escutcheon of Canada to be
blemished by my honourable friend in this
Chamber who says that Canada was derelict
in its duty in not being represented on its
first line of defence.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I am sorry the leader of the House
speaks as he does.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is not my right
honourable friend sorry also that the honourable gentleman from Ottawa should speak as
he did?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not like
introducing the subject, but I must protest
against the continual loading of something on
the War Office of Great Britain.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My first
reason is that the War Office cannot defend
itself; it cannot even demur in the slightest
degree to a statement made by this Government. Therefore, such statements as we have
heard are not fair. Secondly, I should like the
leader of the Government te recall an explanation given to me which is not in accord with
what he has said to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my right
honourable friend repeat his remark?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot go
further than that. The honourable gentleman
knows the circumstances.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I should like

saying the decision was wrong, but,
to me, it was not a decision of the

should be directed elsewhere.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I might
remind the honourable gentleman to this
extent. I do not want him to find fault
with me, because lie has compelled me. Does
he say it was the War Office which decided
that the Canadian forces should not go to
Calais?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was.
our commander had crossed over.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the authorization and approval of the War Office, he
and his staff went to examine the situation,
and when he came back and reported to the
War Office the Canadian Division was retained
in England.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: In view of what
the right honourable gentleman says, that it
is impossible for the British Government or
the War Office to defend themselves, I can
sec his point. Of course it is impossible,
because this war cannot be carried on if you
and I and the public generally are to know
all the details. 'Iìhe same thing applies, I
submit, in all modesty, to the present Administration. A number of times I have felt
that I should like to have more information,
and I am sure the public from the Atlantic
to the Pacifie have felt the same way; but I
realize that if we were given all the information we should like to have, some people in
Canada or the United States or Europe would
grasp that information and use it against us.

make a point of the fact that the British
Government did not agree, or that the Canadian Government did not do what the British
Government wantedRight Hon.
that?

Mr. MEIGHEN:

Who said

Hon. Mr. DUFF: The right honourable
gentleman said a moment ago that he felt
the British Government had not agreed to
a certain recommendation regarding what we
should do respecting sending troops overseas.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, no.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, no.
What I said was this. First, that it was unfair

JUNE 18, 1940
to attribute to the British Government any
failure of our troops to be in the front line.
That Government obviously cannot defend
itself and cannot throw off any reflection that
might be cast upon it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Quite right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But I said
that the decision not to transport our division
to a certain place was reported to me as
being the decision of our own commander.
The leader of the House says the recommendation was made to the War Office.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

His report.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: His report.
Under those circumstances, the report being
that of our own commander, I ask the House
if it is fair to say the War Office is responsible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I simply referred
to the statement which has reached us, I think,
officially. If it has come officially I will
submit it to the Senate. I think the whole
history of General McNaughton's crossing
over the channel to see what was taking place
is told in his report to the War Office; and
the conclusion arrived at by the War Office
was that the Canadian troops should not be
sent over. In fact, no other troops were sent
over.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
objecting to the report or the decision.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I ask to whom
General McNaughton reported? Was it to
the War Office?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: That settles it, then.
FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 25, an Act to amend
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a Bill
with which the Senate is very well acquainted.
I absolve any honourable member of the
Senate from listening to the statement, because
we have had numerous debates on this question in the last four years and honourable
gentlemen know the subject by heart.
Here is the statement of the Minister of
Finance, Hon. Mr. Ralston.
When he
presented the Bill he said:
The object of the Bill is to provide that the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act shall be
in force in Manitoba as it is in Alberta and
Saskatchewan.
It will be remembered that
this matter has been the subject of legislation
'it two previous sessions. In 1938, by amend-

163

ment of the Senate, provision was made whereby
the Act was terminated, as far as its effect in
Manitoba was concerned, as of June 30, 1939.
Then in 1939 legislation was introduced similar
to that which I am proposing now, to provide
for reopening the Act in Manitoba.
That legislation was not accepted by the
Senate.
Since that time further representations have
been received. The situation up to June 30,
1939, was as follows: From the time the Act
came into force until June 30, 1939, when it
expired as to future applications, 11,369 farmers
in Manitoba had interviewed official receivers
regarding their debts, and 4,714 had submitted
proposals, of which 867 were awaiting final
settlement on June 30, 1939. Since that time
the board in Manitoba has been sitting, dealing
with those cases which were outstanoung as oi
June 30, 1939.
No more applications could be received after
that.
Representations are made that of those who
failed to submit proposals, a large number were
from districts where adverse crop conditions
had prevailed for a period of years, and therefore farmers had become so hopelessly involved
that a proposal was not practicable at the time.
Another suggested reason why proposals were
not made before the expiration of the Act is
tnt farmers who had not availed themselves
of the benefit of it-or a number of them, at
least-were those whose creditors, realizing that
there was not any hope of collection, did not
exert pressure, and therefore there was no
incentive to ask for the benefit of the Act's
provisions. The point is made now that one
fairly good crop bas changed this situation. It
is said that the farmers are faced with legal
proceedings by foreclosure, seizure and dispossession, and that every effort ouglit to be
made to retain the farmers on tbe land as
efficient producers.
That was the declared object of the legislation at the time of its introduction in the
Senate by my right honourable friend opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), which introduction has since caused him deep chagrin indeed.
The Minister continued:
Honourable members will recall that according to its preamble the Act was enacted originally, not as a bankruptcy Act for farmers
but rather as a measure for the purpose o!
inducing farmers to remain on the land.
In April of this year the Legislature of
Manitoba adopted a resolution, which is in
the following terms:
Whereas large numbers of land mortgages
and purchase contracts have been made in
Manitoba under which debtor fa.rmers undertook to make certain definite money payments
out of their future income;
And whereas world markets, weather and
other conditions in recent years have made the
carrying out of a great many of such contracts
in strict accordance with their terms even by
the most honest and industrious farmers difficult
and in some cases impossible;
And whereas in consequence of their default
arising through no fault of their own, numerous Manitoba farmers were faced with the
possible loss of their holdings by foreclosure,
and for this reason it was considered necessary

SENATE

164

ind in the public interest that legisiation
should be passed to protect them from such
to reclosure;
And whereas under the provisions of the
British North America Act, since the subjects
of bankruptcy and interest both come within
the legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament, the Legislature of Manitoba could not
authorize the reduction of debt;
And whereas since as aforesaid the Provincial
Legislature could not reduce but could merely
postpone debts, it passed The Debt Adjustment Act, 1932, and amendments thereto, which
authorized the postponement of the creditors'
remedies without reducing their elaims;
And whereas by re-ason of the inadequacy
of any provincial legislation to accomplish debt
adjustment by 'actually reducing debts, the
Dominion Parliament in 1934 passed The
Faresers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934,
under which, as long as it remained in force.
a large amount of debt adjustment was accoe
plished in the Province of Manitoba;
And whereas notwithstanding the demonstrated value of The Farmers' Creditors
Arrangeeiits Act, 1934, as applicable in the
Province of Manitoba andi notwithst.anding that
The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934,
was continued in effect in the Provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan, the said Act was
as a result of action of the Senate of Canada
(accepted by the House of Comnnons as a
compromise in a measure affecting otier provinces), repealed as affecting Manitoba in the
1938 session, suci repeal to become effective in
JTune, 1939;
And whereas in the 1939 session of the House
of Commons. following a request by this Legislature, a measusre making effective The Farniers'
Creditors Arrangement Act in Manitoba was
passed. whici measure was at that session
defeated by the Senate;
Aid whereas the Governmeut and Legislature
of Manitoba. iaving been of the opinion for
so>me considerable timwe prior to 1938 that the
condition of mortgage and land contract debt in
Manitoba was a long-term condition rather
than a tcnporary or an emergent one and that
to deal witi it required judicial machinery of
something more than a temporary character:
The Legislature of Manitoba passed in the
year 1939 the King's Bencs Amendment Act.
1939, establishing a Land Court, the essential
features of whichs were as follows:
1. Such Land Court will be establislhed as a
division of the present Court of King's Bencs
in the Province of Manitoba presided over by
a judge especially appointed for the purpose.
2. Sucb Land Court will in the first instance
be empowered

to postpone

the fulfillment

of

obligatUons pending an investigation as to
whether they can be fulfilled.
3. And if it be found that the obligations
are impassible of performance, the Land Court
wili have power to reduce and write off part
of the indebtedness.
And whereas since the said The Kings Bench
Amendiment Act, 1939. required for its effective
operation enabling legislation to be passed by
the Dominion Government, application was made
by the Premier of Manitoba to the Right
Honourable the Prime Minister of Canada in
February. 1939, for the passage of enabling
Dominion legislation and for the appointment
of a jutdge to preside over the said Land
Court;
And wlsereas the Parliament of Canada, as
a means of meeting the land debt situation in
Western Canada, in the year 1939 passed the
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Central Mortgage Bank Act, which, however,
by reason of the outbreak of war, bas not beei
made operative;
And whereas by reason of the facts that The
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, is
now repealed in Manitoba, effective as from
June, 1939, and that the Central Mortgage
Bank Act has not been made operative therein,
and that enabling legislation bas not been passed
to bring into effective operation the said Land
Court, the citizens of the Province of Manitoba,
for the adjustment of land . debts now lack
adequate facilities such as exist in the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan by reason
of the fact that The Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act is still in effect in those
proviees;

Now therefore be it resolved thiat the Legislature of Manitoba

unaninously

requests the

passage by the Parliament of Canada of adequate enabling legislation to make The King's
Benci Ameindment Art, 1939, effective in the
Province of Manitoba; or if the Dominion
Parliament

lue

not

prepared

to

pass

such

enabling legislation, tiat in order to remove the

prescnt cuondition of injustice froin wbich the
Manitoba citizens suffer as compared witb
those of Alberta and Saskatchewan in the
matter of debt adjustment legislation, the
Dominion
Parliament
should re-enact
The
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act as applicable to the Province of Manitoba at the earliest
possible time; and tiat copies of this resolution
shoull be sent to the Right Honourable the
Prime Minister of Canada and the members of
tie House of Counons and of the Senate.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the House will know, without my saying so, that I am opposed to this
Bill. I am continually taunted with having
introduced in this Chamber the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. I have not lacked
frankness in dealing with the history of the
Act. Time and again I have freely and fully
stated that in my judgment its introduction
was an error, a mistake, the pursuit of a false
legislative god.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was certainly
a mistake to extend it to the East.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why the fact
that I have changed my mind with reference
to this Act should be a matter for elation,
I dIo not know. When the time comes that
I have to defend and stand by everything I
have ever done, though I feel it is wrong,
then I shall not be fit to sit in any legislature.
I do not know any measure that so illustrates
the weakness of democratic institutions as this
one does. Here is the Legislature of Manitoba
passing a resolution-all members agreeing to
it-which asks Parliament to restore the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act in that
province. For what purpose? In order that
the Act may be restored and extended indefinitely on behalf of farmers having debts
antecedent to the first of June, 1935, who had
four years within which to apply under the
Art for a measure of bankruptcy in their

JUNE 18, 1940
behalf, but who did not make application,
even afiter being warned by latter, a year in
advance, that their opportunity to do so was
to be withdrawn.
The honourable leader of the House tells us
that this Bill is not bankruptcy legislation;
that its object is to keep men on the land.
Of course that is its object. Nobody's object
in legislating is to make people bankrupt; the
object is to do something with or for people.
What the honourable leader says would be
paralleled by a statement that a doctor is
called in, not to treat a patient, but so that
the patient may not die.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We treat
cases under this Act as bankruptcy cases.
That is the whole basis of the legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg my right
honourable friend's pardon. I did not give
that as my own statement. That was a statement by the Minister of Finance. I take
it for granted, and I think I am right in so
doing, that when the original Bill was introduced in the other House and later brought
here by my right honourable friend, the main
object was to keep men on the land.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course
that was the object, but that does not say
it is not bankruptcy legislation. It is undoubtedly bankruptcy legislation, nothing
else. If that were not so, the Privy Council
would never have upheld it; it was upon that
ground that they upheld it. And the object
of this bankruptcy legislation is to keep
farmers on the land.
I have stated the purpose of this Bill in a
nutshell-to restore operation of the Act indefinitely, with respect to debts incurred before
the first of June, 1935, to farmers who for
five years failed to make application for an
adjustment of their debts, even though given
a warning by letter a year before the Act
was made ineffective in their province. The
Minister says it is desired to have the Act
brought into effect again in Manitoba because
the Legislature voted unanimously in favour
of that. I say that vote illustrates just the
vulnerable thing about democracy. If one
party in the Legislature wants this measure,
the other party has to agree. In Manitoba
there are far more debtors than creditors who
would be affected by this measure: the
creditors are mostly outside. Therefore, far
more votes are. to be obtained by supporting
than by opposing the resolution asking for
such a measure. Honourable members will
see why the Legislature's resolution illustrates
a feature of democracy which to-day does not
stand quite as favourably before the world as

165

it once did-that very feature which perhaps
accounts for the failure of democracy to compare to advantage in very great struggles.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Will the right
honourable gentleman pardon me? Will he
speak a little louder, please?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sorry
if I am not speaking so as to be heard.
I feel strongly enough about the legislation to
speak very loudly. I have never at any time
had one letter in favour of this legislation
from any citizen not wanting something for
himself. The blight of legislation of this
character is to-day rotting the very morale of
Western Canada.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not this
Bill only, but others and threats of morethreats of provincial measures ta be enacted
if this Bill does not pass. In Alberta the
party that would promote the most legislation
releasing debts of the most people would be
elected. The debts were local; the creditors
were outside-not altogether, of course, but
in very great degree. Read the resolution of
the Board of Trade of Winnipeg, which has
been sent me through the mail-I do not
know one man whose name appears on itand you find you cannot borrow a dollar on
farm property in Manitoba. Why? Because
of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Outside of Government
moans.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
whole foundation of credit is gone. And why
should it not go? Who in his senses would
lend money in the face of legislation of this
kind, with Governments on the rampage to
sponsor such legislation for the sake of votes?
Is anybody lending money in Alberta to-day?
A man should have his head examined who
would lend a nickel. Is anybody, except the
Government, lending money in Manitoba?
And the Government is not making loans as a
business investment anywhere at any time.
Such is the effect of legislation of this sort.
Are we to continue this thing indefinitely?
Are we to make ourselves the recurring parents
of this infamy? For it is nothing else. Legislation of this character, provincial as well as
federal, has helped to destroy what is most
vital to any community. Do not imagine
there is no way of settling debts exeept by a
compulsory scheme under a Bill such as this.
This does not settle one debt for ten or even
twenty settled in the ordinary way-the way
debts have always been settled, by the
creditor and the debtor getting together. No
one is in a better position than the creditor

SENATE
to estimate whether it is worth while keeping
a man on his farm. The creditor bas been
in touch with that man and is interested in
his farming. Repayments depend upon the
intelligence and industry with which the farm
is operated. The creditor will not lose a good
farmer if he can do better by making a
reduction in his debt and so keep him on the
farm. I can tell you of scores of farmers who
have never used the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act at all. I have been tied up
with land ever since I went out west, and I
have net had a single farm mortgage on which
there bas not been a compromise; but it never
was necessary to come under the Act. The
resolution of the Manitoba Legislature is
purely political. The object on both sides
is to deserve votes. Each side vies with the
other to gain votes. And this Senate is asked
to endorse such conduct.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I desire te say a few words about this Bill
because I have always felt very strongly
against the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act. The right honourable leader on the
other 'side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) expresses himself as repentant for wbat he did
seme years ago. And well he may be. I think
that he and the sponsor of that legislation in
another place had at least a strong impression
that the Bill would appeal rather to our
higher instincts, and that the integrity of the
great mass of farmers in Canada would play
its part in the administration of the Act.
But the legislation seems to have fallen down
in every way it possibly could.
The right honourable leader bas dealt with
certain points so clearly that very little remains
to be said. One can give instances of travesties of justice and fairness in the operation
of the Act. Not only have certain farmers
needlessly taken advantage of the legislation,
but officers appointed to administer it have
gone from one end of a province to the other
actually drumming up business. Where is
this movement going to stop? As the right
honoutrable gentleman bas said, this amending
Bill is not limited in its duration, and I have
no doubt that, under the great stress and
strain to which we in Canada shall be subject
for a good many years to come, once this Bill
is passed, other provinces will ask for similar
legislation; perhaps Prince Edward Island,
certainly Ontario.
I am absolutely opposed to the Bill and
intend to vote against the motion for second
reading. I have every respect for what the
Minister of Finance said, that bankruptcy of
the farmer is not being dealt with in this
Bill, but the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act bas brought many bona fide creditors very
R ght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

close to bankruptcy. We see them all over
the country, men who knew very little about
investments except in farm property, and in
many cases they have lost anywhere from 20
to 50 per cent of their life savings. What I
object to most of all is that the well-to-do
farmer will take advantage of such legislation
and go back on his farm without sacrificing
one acre of land or one head of stock.
I hope the Senate will deal with this Bill as
it has dealt with similar measures in the
past.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable
members, I do not think that when the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act was
introduced in 1934 by my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) it implied
political motives any more than does the
resolution recently passed unanimously by
the Legislature of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. KING: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: To-day we find
and Alberta enjoying the
Saskatchewan
privileges of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. The debt situation in Manitoba
and
is parallel te that in Saskatchewan
Alberta. Surely the members of the Legislature of Manitoba are closer te the people
of the province and better acquainted with
their problems than the members of this
Chamber can be. The Federation of Farmers'
Associations in the province has passed resolutiens asking that Manitoba be put back
where it was in 1938. The Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act was enacted in 1934 because
prices of farm commodities had gone down
to a very low level, and farmers found themselves burdened with debt and unable to sel
their products advantageously in order to
meet their obligations. What do we find
to-day? Farm products are again at a low
Because of the economie situation
level.
which has developed since the outbreak of
war our markets are gone, and to-day we in
Western Canada have to face still lower levels
for what we produce.
I know that the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act has shortcomings, and that men for
whom it was not intended have taken advantage of its provisions; but any legislation is
open to abuse. On the whole, the Act bas
served a very useful purpose in keeping many
farmers on the land who would otherwise
have had to abandon their farms.
I might say to my right honourable friend
that the mortgage companies are net so much
opposed to the enactment of this Bill as he
sems to think they are. It should not be
overlooked that this amending Bill might
prevent more drastic legislation being passed

JUNE 18, 1940
by the province.
I think this honourable
House should take cognizance of the fact that
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act is
absolutely necessary in Manitoba. Its privileges should never have been withdrawn from
the province.
I am confident that other
honourable senators who come from Manitoba
will agree with me that conditions there
warrant this legislation. We are not trying
to force it on any other province. All we
are asking is that Manitoba shall enjoy the
same privileges as it did prior to 1938, privileges which Alberta and Saskatchewan still
enjoy, and which are badly needed in
Manitoba.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, I am opposed to this Bill and intend
to vote against the motion for second reading.
I think I perhaps have had more experience
of the operation of the Farmers' Creditors
rrangement Act than any other member in
this House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I have had, I was
going to say, hundreds of cases before the
board of review in Saskatchewan; at any rate,
I have had a great many. I have on different
occasions acted for both debtor and creditor.
In Saskatchewan, as honourable 'members
know, we have some nineteen judicial districts,
with an official receiver in most of them, and
in some districts two or more official receivers
and two boards of review. These boards of
review go about the country all the time
accompanied by a retinue of stenographers and
other officers, aill at great expense to the
province. It is my opinion that before this
Bill comes up for third reading the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) should
furnish information as to costs of administration of the Act in Saskatchewan. I think we
shall find they are well nigh prohibitive. The
Act has been in force in the province for five
years or more.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Six years.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I hope that something will be done to put an end to its
operation, for I am confident that the
majority of our people do not want it at all.
What does the Act do? In a few words,
it results in taking away from the unsecured
creditor-the doctor, the local merchant, the
implement man, or some other person who
has no security-almost the whole amount of
the debt. It does not affect the mortgage
companies very much, because in most cases
the mortgage, with the accumulated interest,
taxes and insurance, has not reached the full
value of the land. But if a person has lent

167

a farmer $500 and has taken a second
mortgage, his debt will be eut down to about
$100, and he may not get even that.
In our province this Act has more or less
resulted in a racket. For example, a man
who contemplates coming under the Act and
making an application will allow his farm to
run down and become overgrown with weeds;
he will allow the buildings to get into
disrepair, and will not paint them or do
anything about the place. Then in a year or
two ho will make an application under the Act.
When the valuator comes around to make
an inspection the land of course bas a reduced
value. although the adioining land may be
producing 35 or 40 bushels of wheat to the acre.
If a vendor offers to take the land back and
cancel the debt, his offer is not considered,
because the board of review bas no authority
to deal with it: all the board can do is to consider the case and deal with it in accordance
with the valuations made by the Soldier
Settlement Board inspectors.
Let me give an instance of which I have
personal knowledge.
A year ago a certain
farmer made application under this Act to
have two purchase contracts reduced. This
man had other land, which was in good
shape, but, instead of paying for the land
which he had bought on these two contracts,
he purchased seventy or eighty or one hundred
head of stock, bought Diesel tractors and
combination harvesters, and accumulated some
of the best machinery around that part of the
country, all of which he paid for. In spite
of the fact that evidence was given of his
other holdings. these two contracts were
reduced by some $2,000-and, ho and behold!
the next day lie drove out of the local garage
in a fine new car, fully paid for. He did not
dare go out on the street with it until his
application was heard. That is probably an
extreme case, but there are others like it.
Another case, on which I appeared personally just before coming down here, was that
of a man who sold a quarter-section of land.
It is one of the finest areas in our whole
district, and is situated a mile and a half
from a good town. The soil is a heavy
gumbo, capable of growing from twenty to
twenty-five bushels to the acre every year;
the water does not run off it; in fact, the
land is almost perfect. The valuation fixed
for this by the inspectors was something like
$2,500, and the contract was reduced to about
that figure by the board, despite the fact that I
was able to show that I had several offers of
$25 an acre, or $4,000, and one offer, with a
smaller cash payment, of $30 an acre, or
$4,800.

the rural population of each and comparing the
expenditures in each, I find that the administration of this Act cost 900 per cent more in
Prince Edward Island than New Brunswick,.
and 3,600 per cent more than in Nova Scotia.
These facts were before the- office in Ottawa,
but the officials here approved of that kind
of thing.
Hon. Mr. COPP: It was bad enough in
New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Well, you were 900
per cent better than we were. That is the
kind of thing this legislation is capable of
performing. Surely if debt adjustments are
needed in the Western Provinces or in any
pa.rt of Canada, we can get legislation of some
reasonable character for giving redress to those
who are entitled to it. In this instance everything that is improper seems to be done, at
least in the province that I come from. An
honourable member who spoke a little while
ago gave some instances to show how the Act
has worked. I know of one case in Prince
Edward Island where a farmer applied for
redress under this Act, and one of his creditors
came to the board of review and offered not
.only to pay all his obligations, but to give
him a substantial sum of money in addition,
yet the board eut his debts by about sixty
per cent. The board of review is something
shocking-or, at all events, that board of
review was.
I can give another illustration. The official
receivers were paid, I think, $30 for every
case they brought, regardless of what happened to it. They went around canvassing,
telling their friends and any man they could
find who had any debts whatever: "Allow me
to make an application for you. It will cost
you nothing. and it will be $30 in my pocket,
no matter how the case goes." Well, they
would be given permission to make application. Hundreds of cases were brought in that
way. And besides, cases were brought in which
were outside the scope of the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. The board of
review sat from time to time, trying to determine their jurisdiction with respect to those
cases, and could not corne to a decision. They
would hear a case again and again, and every
such hearing cost the Government of Canada
about $100.
Right Hon. M.r. MEIGHEN: That is why
they could not come to a decision.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

I know why. It was

too profitable for them. The judge became

his place, and he wiped the whole thing off
the slate in a day or two. He said, with
resoect to a certain case. that an application

169

should never have been made under the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act; that
the proper tribunal to deal with the case, if
it should have been heard at all, was the
Exchequer Court. Things like that were going
on. To say there is need for legislation which
makes such proceedings possible in any part
of Canada, is shocking. We are told that this
Bill should be passed in order that Manitoba
may not be denied privileges that Saskatchewan and Alberta have. They are not
privileges. Manitoba has not the right to
get infamous help such as this Act gives. This
Act should be not merely repealed, it should
be cremated. It is a disgrace, an outrage,
and should be wiped off the Statute Book of
Canada.
I might mention another thing. My leader
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was trapped into
doing a thing here that shows how legislation of this kind will demoralize people connected with it. The office in Ottawa used to
make a report every year on the working of
the Act. A report was submitted to my leader
with regard to business conditions in Prince
Edward Island; a report prepared, not by
Mr. Gordon, the Adninistrator of the Act,
but by some organization. It was infamously,
viciously, and idiotically untrue, but the
honourable leader read it and it went on the
records of this country. I deem it to be my
duty to point out the enormity of the thing.
The honourable leader knows, I think, who
trapped him into doing that.
The document
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
was signed.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The document was
signed by the official. An official who would
do that is not fit to be a civil servant in
Canada. The official who signed the report
did not prepare it. I know he did not, because
he was not familiar with the conditions. If
he did prepare it, he is even worse than I think
he is. It was prepared by the junto and
given to him. These are the men who were
getting thousands of dollars a year for the
kind of work they were doing under this Act.
And now we are asked to continue and to
extend the Act. I am going to vote against it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I

SECOND READING

CANADIAN

Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE, with the leave
of the Senate, moved the second reading of
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman state briefly its purpose?
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: The explanatory note to the Bill is as follows:
Since 1895 the Quebec Railway, Light &
Power Company has operated a tramway system
in the city of Quebec and a line of railway
extending some thirty miles from Quebec to
Cap Tourmente, on the north shore of the St.
Lawrence River, and passing through Montmorency Falls and Ste. Anne de Beaupré. This
line of railway is known as the Montmorency
division of the company, and it connects with
the Canadian National Railways and the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company. The Canadian
National Railways run their trains to Murray
Bay over this division.
It is desired to incorporate a new company
to acquire and operate the Montmorency
division of the Quebec Railway, Light & Power
Company, as a separate undertaking, inasmuch
as the tramway division provides transportation
services of a different character for the city
and district of Quebec.
The terms and conditions of any acquisition
by Quebec and Montmorency Railway Company
will be subject to the approval of the Board
of Transport Commissioners and the Governor
in Council in the manner provided by the
Railway Act.
I may say that this Bill passed the Senate
in 1936, but failed to pass the House of
Comnons because of delay occasioned by the
fact that the city of Quebec wanted a clause
added to give more protection to the city.
Such a clause has now been inserted in the
Bill, which will be considered in committee
to-morrow. I am assured that the city of
Quebec bas no objection to the Bill as it is.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE:

I move that

the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
to my honourable friend that, since there was
previo'usly some opposition to the Bill, the
city of Quebec should be notified that it is
coming up to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: I am informed
that there is no objection to the Bill. The
City Solicitor has seen the Bill and says it is
all right.
The motion was agreed to.

ACTIVE SERVICE

FORCE EQUIPMENT
INQUIRY

AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. CHARLES E. TANNER rose in
accordance with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the inquiry and answers thereto tabled by
the Goverument on June 6 instant, in reference
to equipment of the Canadian Active Service
Force, and will inquire if further information
may be expected.
He said: Honourable members, I should
like to make a 'few brief comments with
regard to certain inquiries which I made,
and the replies given by the Department of
National Defence, presumably by gentlemen
who are high up in the command of military
matters in this country. I find it difficult
to regard their replies in a serious way. There
appears to be a disposition on the part of
these gentlemen to make a secret of things
that are not secret at all, and to becloud
matters that are known the world over. Why
they do that, I am at a loss to understand.
One of my great delights is to read the
periodicals and the Press of England, where
the public are taken into the confidence of
the Government and are fully informed of
what is being done, what is being made, what
mishaps or disasters have occurred, and what
is of advantage to the people. I will admit
there may be some secret matters, but not
everything pertaining to a war is secret. The
Prime Minister of Great Britain makes no
secret of colossal disasters, of losses of material
and of men. On the contrary, he goes before
the House of Commons and speaks right out
about these things. Why does he do that?
Because ho wants to stimulate the people to
greater effort. And if the people of this
country are to be stimulated to greater effort
they must be taken into the confidence of
the Government and of the men who are in
command of our defence forces.
What happened in England when the
Germans produced their magnetic mines?
English scientists went to work and produced
a mechanism for rendering the mines ineffective. Well, that was not kept a secret.
I do net know about other honourable
members, but I saw pictures of the thing
in the London illustrated papers. There were
photographs of it as it was being placed on
ships, and detailed descriptions were given.
Had such an invention been developed in our
country, I presume our defence officials would
treat it as a most profound secret, and
nobody would hear about it. Whenever a
new aircraft is developed in England the
people are told of it. Not a great while ago
there were, in the same periodicals I aan

SENATE
referring to, pictures and full descriptions of
a plane called the Defiance. And in papers
like the London Illustrated News and the
London Sphere I have read a detailed description of every tank produced in England,
including particulars of every item entering
into the construction of the tank. But here
we should not be told a thing about such
matters, and if we inquired from our friends
down at military headquarters they would
say. as they have been saying, that it was not
in the public interest to give out the information.
I an just as desirous as the honourable
leader of this House is that our people should
put their whole effort and energy back of the
Covernment. We are ail delighted to know
that there is to be more serious. determined
and vigorous prosecution of this war. That
is as it should be, beeause the fact is, though
a great many of our people do not seem to
realize it, that Canada is a principal party
in this war, not a subsidiary. We are told
that Canada is a nation, and we are proud
of that. Last September we assembled here
and declared war on Germany, and not many
days ago we declared war on Italy. We took
these steps on the same footing as England
did, as an independent and free people. What
else is there for us to do but make war to
the very best of our resources in manpower and in imaterials? I should hope that
not a Canadian would ever think of saying
that we will retire from this war. We must
go on. And if our national war effort is to
be supported by ail the people, then the people
must have an unshakable confidence in those
who are at the head of the Government. Such
confidence cannot be built up if our leaders
refuse ta give information about matters that
should not be regarded as secret-,military
matters that are known about in Germany,
in England, in the neighbouring country to
the south, and ail over the world.
I am particulariy interested in some questions I asked a while ago, replies to which
were given on the 6th of this month. I would
remind honourable members that when the
First Canadian Division went overseas we
were told, times without number, that they
were fully equipped. That statement was
given out over the radio, in the press and on
the platform. My questions were not asked
because of some personal curiosity. I have
been amazed at the number of people who
have communicated with me because they
are interested in these questions. They are
people who have sons, husbands or brothers
overseas, and they want to know whether
their kindred were properly equipped before
going overseas. And I take the liberty of
declaring that they have a right to know.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

Sa I put a number of questions on the Order
Paper. The first five were elementary. They
simply asked what the equipment of a Canadian division is. The word "establishment"
was used in the inquiry. because that is the
military word to express what I was trying to
get information about, namely, how many
guns of one kind and another-Bren automatics, trench mortars, smaller trench mortars,
anti-tank guns, lorries, Bren gun carriers,
platoon lorries, field kitchens, tractors, and
so on-go into the making of a Canadian
division.
But the men down at Defence headquarters
say they cannot give an answer to that question, because the information is contained in
a book printed in London, which has a padlock on it, and they dare not open it except
to show the contents to some person in
auîthority. Weil, I made some inquiry, and I
have no doubt there is a book, and I quite
appreciate that it contains some matters which
should not be diselosed to the enemy. But
in the list of questions I submitted, not one
secret weapon was mentioned. Many of the
weapons were used in the last war, and to-day
the Germans are using them, as are the
British and the French.
They are the
ordiýnary weapons of modern times, and there
is no secrecy at all about them. The Germans
know how many the British have; the British
know how many the Germans have, and how
many the French have. I would not suggest
for one minute that our Defence officials are
not fully acquainted with ahl these details.
No doubt they could come here and, without
looking at the book at ail, give information
on ail the items that I made inquiry about.
I know military men, men who never saw the
book, but who served in the last war, and I
asked them about the equipment of a Canadian division. They said they could tell me
the whole of the particulars in half an hour.
The other day, in one of the Ottawa papers,
I saw the full details of a German division.
If it were a matter for amusement, one would
have to smile at the refusal of officials to
answer the inquiry. Weeks ago I read in
English periodicals everything about the kinds
and numbers of weapons used in modern
armies. One of these publications, issued not
long ago, is in my Ottawa apartment now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then why did
my honourable friend seek information that
he already had?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I wanted it to be
given officially. My point is that these gentlemen down in Defence headquarters are
trying to make a secret out of something
which is not secret. I wanted to get the facts

JUNE 19, 1940
from them, so that there would be no question
as to accuracy.
I am not criticizing the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand).
I am directing attention to
gentlemen down at headquarters, who contend
that matters that are known about all over
the world should be treated as profound
secrets, and who announce that Canadian
soldiers are fully equipped when sent over
to England, whereas that is not so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
question.

That is

the

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I fail to understand
why they persist in telling the people of this
country that the First Division went over to
England ,fully equipped. Why did they not
come out plump and plain and say, "No, the
division is not fully equipped, but when it
gets to England we will see to it that it is
fully equipped." - I shall not dwell further
on the point. There is the simple truth.
My honourable friend will observe that in
the English Press and periodicals information
of this kind is published, whereas here we can
get no information at all.
And so with
respect ,to the answers to my questions brought
down yesterday.
I see in English papers
pictures showing the manufacture of depth
charges and the other munitions referred to
in my inquiry. The whole thing is disclosed
to the British people, and that is why they
are displaying such confidence in their Government.
This is my sixth question:
Of all the equipment, arms, vehicles and
the like referred to in the foregoing questions
and the answers thereto, what equipment, arms,
vehicles and the like are being manufactured
in Canada?
That is a pertinent question, and I did get an
answer to it. The answer discloses that the
only items of equipment manufactured in
Canada for the First Division were:
Meehanically propelled vehicles except tracked
vehicles, Bren guns, and 3-inch mortars.
Those are the only three items of equipment
for the First Division that were being manufactured in Canada.
To that answer is
appended this note:
A plant is being set up in Canada for production of 25-pr. guns. Orders have been given
for manufacture of carriers.
There is the proof conclusive that the First
Division was not fully equipped when it
sailed for England.
I am not attacking anyone; I am simply
pointing out the facts. I think the public
have a right to know the truth, that at the
time these answers were prepared, out of the

score of necessary equipment those were the
only few that were being made in this country.
Now the next question:
From what sources of manufacture and
proauction, respectively, is the First Canadian
Division of the Canadian Active Service Force
supplied with each class of the arms, equipment
and vehicles and the like above referred to?
This is the answer:
Wheeled mechanically propelled vehicles from
Lanada; tracked mechanically propelled vehicles
from United Kingdom; Vickers machine guns
from available stocks in Canada; Bren light
machine guns from the United Kingdom; mortars from the United Kingdom; anti-tank rifles
from the United Kingdom; 25-pr. equipment
from the United Kingdom; anti-tank guns from
the United Kingdom.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
date of the answer?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: June 6. That was the
situation then. Without making what could
be regarded as an attack on anybody, I am
bound to say I do not think that is very
creditable to Canada-a country that could
and should bave been making every one of
these things. We as a nation are not in this
war merely as a helper; we have been in it
since September as a principal, as a nation
that bas declared war against Germany. That
being the case, we should in the meantime
have been making war to the utmost of our
resources. That is the view I take, and when
I find that up to June 6 we have been doing
so little te provide essential war equipment,
I feel that this is net creditable to Canada.
Let me refer again to the Bren gun. I can
get no information with respect to the first
five questions of my inquiry. Why is it we
get se much publicity about the Bren gun
when we cannot be told about the other
articles of warfare? Every day or so it is
announced that Bren guns are in production
and that the company making them is six
months ahead of production. If it is net right
to give out information with regard to other
weapons, why should the Bren gun be
advertised so much? That question bas been
revolving in my mind for some time. I cannot
reconcile this difference. If there must be
secrecy about other implements of war, why
sbould there net also be secrecy about the
Bren gun? That is one more reason why I
have come to the conclusion that this refusal
on the part of military headquarters te tell
us about things that are so well known is all
camouflage in an attempt to bide their delays.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member says there is publicity about
Bren gun production. Can be tell us whether
there is any Bren gun production in Canada
yet?

SENATE

174

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not know, but I
notice that for over two weeks a question has
been on the Order Paper as to how many
Bren guns have been produced. As yet no
answer is forthcoming.
I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that the Bren gun has been in production for
some time.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: J do not know.
What

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
meant by " in production "?

is

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That it is being
turned out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the honourable gentleman tell us, within any figure
he cares to name, how many Bren guns have
been turned out in Canada, delivered
complete?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will not ask
my right honourable friend to put his question
on the Order Paper, since I have a sufficiently
good memory for me to answer it to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then I do
not need to put my question on lie Order
Paper. It is on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: The stateinent given
out to the Press the other day by the Minister
of Transport was to the effeet tit

Bren gun

pioduction was six months ahead of the stipulated time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: It might be, for it
is two years since the contract was made. The
company ought to be away ahead of schedule.
But the point that struck me was this: why
are we not told how many guns have been
produced and delivered to our miilitary authoritics? That is tlie point which intere-sts the
public. "Six months ahead of production"
does not mîean anything at all to the general
public. It iight mean only a dozen guns; it
might not mean cven so miany. There is the
trouble, the reluctance to give the people
specific information.

Now I corne to question 8 of my inquiry:
From what sources of manuifacture ani pioduction respectively is each class of the arms,
eqiipmenit and vehicles and the iike referred

to above now available or becoming available
for the Second Canadian Division of the Canadian Active Service Force?

We know that the First Division did not take
over a single Bien gun. It did take some
old Vickers guns, which, though verv good,
are nothing to be compared with the Bren.
All the Bren guns were supplied to the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

division by the British authorities. Now I ask
this question: Are we going to furnish our
Second Division with equipment manufactured in Canada? This is the answer:
The equipment for the Second Division will
probably be in exactly the same position as the
equipment for the First Canadian Division.
I have said that in my opinion the answers
to my inquiries with respect to the equipment supplied to the First Division were
far from creditable to this country. But this
answer with respect to equipment for the
Second Division is unquestionabiy discreditable to Canada. To think that when we send
over another division we shall be in no better
condition to equip it than we were to equip
thc First Division when it went overseas!
That is the statement of the military authorities
of this country.
The lionourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentleman would have to establish that the
First Division was not sufficiently equipped
to cross the ocean.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Was the First Division sufficiently equipped to go into battle?
An Hon. SENATOR:

No.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: No. It did not have
a macline-gun made in Canada, nor a tank.

equipped for the training it was to undergo in

Hear, liear.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: Not at all. It was not
sufficiently equipped to go to war. As part
of the British Empire we ought to equip our
men to figlt, and not send them over to
depend for arms on the clarity of Great
Britain.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND:
friend sbould know that equipment was being
manufactured in England, but not in Canada, and it could not have been manufactured
here at the time.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It ouîglt to have been.
Yes, persons
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
are very wise while sitting in their offices or
in this Chamber.
Surely, honourable
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
members, this proud nation should have been
able to equip its soldiers. We have been told
so often that we are a proud nation. We
declared war on a barbarian power. Having
had to depend wholly on Great Britain for the
equipment supplied te our First Division,
surely when our next division embarked this

equipment necessary to enable our men to
meet the enerny at the battie-front. But this
answer says: "No, we do nlot expect to do
Sa; we mnust depend on Eng]and to equip our
next division."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Engiand.

We buy frorn

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
How enu Engiand
equip our troops? Surely it is our duty to
prepare the necessary equipment not oniy
for our own men, but for England's as weii.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:

We are doing

so in certain lines now.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
Weii, that is rny
protest.
Tanks were mentioned a few moments ago.
I notice how the tanks are being advertised.
There seems to be no hesitation at ail about
telling us that we are going to make three
hundred tanks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
engines.

But withaut the

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Sure. That is the
trouble.
My honourable friand thinks the
Canadian army xviii nex'er need tanks. If we
are going to hattie against the Huns we must
have tanks. They are the implements that
won tihe fig-ht against the French. Surely we
are rot going ta send Canedian soldiers, ta
meet tlie enuruy somie tirre in the future,
without providing thèm with tanks to meet
tanks. I do not know what rny honourable
friend thinks, but what I think is this, and it
can be teken for what it is worth. This war
will not ha finished until the British soldiers,
the soldiers from Canada, from Australia,
New Zeeland and South Africa are fuliy
equipped with every implernent of war to
fight, GermanySome Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: -and march into
Cermany, devasteting the country as they go.
until they corne to Berlin and lay down the
law ta those herbariahas and make a real
peace.
Some Hon.. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. J. A. McDONALD: Honoura;ble senators, I have but a very brief statement ta
make.
Few men have lied the opportunity I have
had ta meet the manufacturers and the labouring men of Canada. I -have just travelled
from Halifaex to Vancouver, and have been
in the closest association with aur manrufacturers, and I want ta say that they are ernong
the rnost patriotie and loyal citizens we have

175

in this country. Thousands of them are willing ta work without a dollar of profit, and
ta many of thern their employees are as their
families. Among the labour men of Can-ada,
who are the best on this continent, there are
two philosophies. the International and the
National. Bath are powerfui, and they are
%vell represented by clear-headed men who, I
think. should be called into consultation with
the Government of Canada.
I notice in the deliberations of the Senate
and of the House of Cammons that there is
in some quarters too much preaching of blue
ruin; too much of the idea that we are going
into this war because we are afraid, because
there is a terrible tragedy impending and the
ciouds are very, very dark. I do not think
the British Commonwealth of Nations is fightmng for any such reason at ail. When I read
Churchill's speech every drap of blood in me
jumped. No man could read that wonderful
address, without realizing the justice of aur
claims and experiencing a feeling of certainty
as ta the end.
1 arn not entering ino any criticism. The
Governrnent have made a certain move in
connection with conscription-God bless themn
for hit
But there is something else. I amn a
Canadian. but I arn also a citizen of the
British Commonwealth. I have at home a
piece of parchir-ent for which I would die.
1 arn nat worthy of it. It says that I arn an
adviser and I aîn, though in a very weak
way. ta be sure-to King George of England.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, heer.

Han. J. A. McDONALD: We should praise
England, Scotlend and Ireland, and be proud
we are British. In saying this I arn not
reflecting on anybody, for in every province

I have found the people loyal and wiliing ta
do their part. I cannot see why there sho.uld
be any of this talk of bine ruin. We 'have the
best banking systein and the finest financiel
institutions in the world. They will carry us
through. I cannot understand the permeatian
of the idea that a terrible tragedy is impending. I arn proud of my British ancestry and
I love British institutions. As I say, I arn a
Canadien. But what of the England of Nelson,
the Scotland of Montrose, or the Ireland of
Wýellingtoýn? Some people speak disparagingly
about Ireland, but I would remind you that
at Louvain, the Irish, with anything týhey couid
get their banda on, drove the enemy back
three tirnes, and with proper support would
have driven them into Germany.
ILet us
dispel the idea that we are fighting because
we have ta. We are fighting for British principles. My heart goes out ta every bit of
ground and every stretch of water over which

THE

M/AR

REPORT

SITUATION
0F DEBATE

On tise Orders of tise Day:
Riglît Hon. ARTHUR MEIQIIEN: Honisemtbors, in reading osîr Hansard
ouraisr
of v,ýfr-steay I tind, at page 174, something

JUNE 19, 1940
I do not dispute 'having said., but which I
should not have said had I understood what
preceded.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: How is it that the
rest of us have not got a copy of Hansard?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have just
got the sheets that are sent for revision.
I quote as follows, from page 174:
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen: Honourable mem-

bers, I am sorry the leader of the flouse speaks
as he does.
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: Is not my right honourable friend sorry also that the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa East should speak as
he did?
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen: Yes, I am. I do
not like introducing the subject, but I must
protest against -the continual loading of something on the War Office of Great Britain.
The only words to which I wish to call
attention are "Yes, I am." I certainly never
intended to say anything of the kind as
regards the statement by the honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté). I do
not do-ubt that I did say it, because the
honourable senator from Ottawa East came
to me shortly afterwards and asked me if
I was rebuking him, which I denied.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Well, you should have
said it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Consequently,
I do not deny that the Hansard report is
correct. But the reason I answered my honourable friend's question in that way was that I
misunderstood what lie asked me. I thought
he asked me if I did not regret that the
War Office had to interfere with the dispatch
of our men to France. Sometimes one does
not get the exact meaning of what is said.
I know the honourable leader must have said
exactly what appears in Hansard. Therefore,
I want to make it perfectly clear that, far
from rebuking the honourable senator from
Ottawa East, I concurred fully in what he
said. Indeed, nothing has ever been said in
the other House or in this House, in my hearing, with which I more ýheartily agree. So
for the revised Hansard I have struck out
those words to which I referred, because they
have an application I never intended.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That means my
right honourable feriend concurs in the remarks
made by the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté)Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -in criticizing
the fact that no Canadian soldier, Canadian
tank, Canadian aeroplane nor Canadian gun
took part in the battle in France. I offered

to give my honourable friend the answer, and
he asked that I wait until he had finished
speaking. I also suggested that he consult
the War Office in London. His response was:
If that is the answer, I would say it is not
a very brave answer to a record which strikes
a great many of us as one of ineptitude.
To that I replied:
It is a reckless statement my honourable
friend is making.
Then I answered the honourable gentleman
and showed that the Canadian Government
had not been remiss in their duty, and that
the War Office were responsible for the fact
that none of our troops were in France. My
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) then said he was sorry that I spoke
as I did. I asked him if he was not sorry
also that the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa East spoke as he did. To this my
right honourable friend replied:
Yes, I am. I do not like introducing the
subject, but I must protest against the continual loading of something on the War Office
of Great Britain.
Of course, the latter part of that answer
showed what was uppermost in my right
honourable friend's mind. Now he adds that
he agrees with the statement of the honourable senator from Ottawa East. The kernel
of that statement was an implication that the
Canadian Government were remiss in their
duty, because there was no Canadian representation on the Rhine. Surely my right
honourable friend does not share in such a
view.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I share fully
in what was said by the honourable senator
from Ottawa East. He never intended to
imply that at the moment the dispatch of a
Canadian contingent was under consideration
a wrong step was taken in not dispatching it.
That was not in his mind, nor was it in mine.

The point he made was this, that the conflict
began and ended in France without our having
taken steps which would have enabled us to
be represented in that struggle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
senator from Ottawa East said we had three
lines of defence-the Rhine, Great Britain and
Canada-and that the first line had gone
before we had any soldiers there to defend it.
I answered that our troops were in England
in the latter part of December, or early in
January, and that responsibility for their not
being sent to France lay on the shoulders of
the High Command or the War Office. I now
repeat that statement.
Our troops, not
completely trained, had been sent ta England,
where they were to finish their training.

SENATE

While they were being trained over there, six
British divisions were also undergoing training
along the same lines. But neither any one of
those six divisions nor our division was sent
across to France. We could not ask that our
division be sent to France until the War
Office decided, in the light of general plans
and policies, that it should be sent. Of course,
we are an autonomous country and had a
word to say, but the plans under which our
troops would have been dispatched across the
Channel remained, quite naturally, under the
direction of the High Command. That being
so, I refuse to accept the statement that the
Canadian Government are responsible for our
First Division being absent from the Rhine
when the hour struck. It should not be said
in this Chamber that the Canadian Government were remiss in their duty because none
of our troops were sent to France.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable senators,-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I say
just one word? The fact that our troops went
over to England in January does not mean
that any Government could have sent them
to the battle-field. They went over without
any equipment to fight with, because there
was lack of production here, and, even if they
had had any equipment, they were untrained
in the use of it. Consequently they had to be
provided with equipment in England and
trained there. The whole policy of failure to
provide equipment and training in time
resulted in the situation which the honourable
member from Ottawa East depicted and which
I deplore-a situation for which this Government, and no other, are responsible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have great
respect for my right honourable friend's
abilities, but I doubt whether anyone could
have made as rapid strides as the Government
did from the third of September to the time
our troops left for England.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Government should have made a start long before.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will tell my
right honourable friend, on the authority of
the Canadian Journal of Commerce, which
speaks for the Federation of Chambers of
Commerce, that the success of the Mackenzie
King Government in the recent election was
due to the fact that at the head of key departments they had placed men in whom the
country had confidence. The statement was
made on every hand that the Government
won the day on the 26th of March because
they had carried on well right from the
outbreak of war. I am saying that, not to
emphasize the result of the election, but
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

simply to point out that when the people
were consulted they felt they could place
confidence in men they knew, rather than in
that was being
a shadow government
suggested.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this,-

And I may say

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend is pretty sensitive on this subject.
I want to say
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this, that I do not like the state of mind of
my right honourable friend and his friends
around him. Instead of offering constructive
suggestions, they simply criticize and disparage the Government's work. They never
express a word of satisfaction for the strides
that have been made. All kinds of questions
are asked as a basis for criticism.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

And rumour.

I say it is unHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
worthy of the Upper Chamber of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

May I appeal to
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)?
We all want to help in winning this war; so
I suggest that a cable be sent to the British
Government requesting that the services of
General Gort be dispensed with, and that
three or four members from the other side of
this House be drafted.
Honourable
MacARTHUR:
C.
Hon.
senators, I shall not detain you for more
than a minute.
Hon. Mr. COPP:

Take an hour.

An Hon. SENATOR:

Two hours.

The right honHon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
ourable leader on the other side (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) said be wanted to have certain
words deleted. That is a question for the
House. I submit that yesterday the honourable senator from Saskatchewan North (Hon.
Mr. Horner) and the honourable senator from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté) most unnecessarily interjected a very controversial subject.
I deprecate and regret, particularly in these
serious times, the acrimonious debate which
followed. The right honourable leader opposite
could do nothing less than disapprove the remarks which precipitated that bitter discussion.
For the life of me I cannot understand the attitude of' the honourable senator from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Coté). Is be pitting his judgment against General McNaighton's and that
of the War Office in London? Actually, be

JUNE 19, 1940
is doing so. What is to be gained now by
saying there was not a Canadian soldier on the
Rhine?
Hon. Mr. COTE: That is a fact.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Of course it is a
fact. Does the honourable gentleman think
there was no reason for that fact? Does he
think his intelligence greater or his judgment
sounder than that of the able men in charge
of military affairs overseas? Why did Canadian soldiers not take part in the fighting. in
Norway? They were started on the way, but
those in authority considered it wiser to bring
them back to England. Does the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa East rate his judgment
against that of the High Command? If so,
why did be not take charge of those operations?
Hon. Mr. COTE: Why did we not manufacture tanks?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The honourable
gentleman complains there was not a single
Canadian soldier on the Rhine. Where do
we get with that talk? There was good
reason for our soldiers not being at the front.
I have something further to say. Why do
we hear so much about the Bren gun? Why
is the matter brought up so often and made so
much of? My honourable friend knows why.
He knows that Maclean's and Colonel Drew
and the horde of lesser critics have told us
that the Inglis company had nothing but a
shell of a factory and would not for a long
time be in a position to turn out Bren guns.
But those critics are now confounded, for the
company is on mass production and ahead
of schedule, with its men working seven days
a week. Does the honourable gentleman want
them to work eight? The right honourable
leader opposite asks, "How many Bren guns
have been finished?" Whether any have been
finished I do not know, but if they are not
finished there is good reason for the delay.
There will be plenty of Bren guns finished
in a comparatively short time, and we shall
be ahead of the game. If there is failure to
make adequate deliveries, the company's
executives should not be in charge of production. The right honourable leader of the
Opposition is very astute and puts very
awkward questions. How many guns are being
produced I do not know, but I do know we
have men in charge working from eighteen
to twenty hours a day, and you cannot better
them. The honourable gentleman from Saskatchewan North has suggested Herridge as one
who would "step up" things. He might; I
do not know. However, Herridge would be
unknown but for the fact that be is a brother95832-12j

179

in-law of a former Prime Minister of Canada.
If that is the best suggestion the honourable
gentleman can make, he had better devote
his attention to matters on which he is better
informed.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I do not know what question is before
the House, but I feel I should say a word
or two. We all know the situation that confronts Canada. The other day Winston
Churchill said, and I think very wisely, that
if we spend all our energy in considering the
past we shall lose the future.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would suggest to
every honourable member that we refrain
from unnecessary criticism, particularly with
regard to the past. We all know mistakes
have been made. We know that any other
Government would have made a thousand
mistakes. All Governments whose countries
are at war have made appalling mistakes.
We should not be where we are to-day if
human nature had not failed, and failed woefully. We have to expect these things in the
conduct of this titanic struggle, notwithstanding that those in authority may exercise their
very best judgment. After all, man is but
mortal, and every mortal is prone to make
mistakes and do all sorts of things that
should not be done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Errare humanum
est.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Exactly. I plead with
every member that from now on to the end
of this session he endeavour. to avoid discussion such as we have had on two or three
occasions during the last few days.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Let us look to the
future. Let us all join together and do what
we eau in order to help the Government, those
in authority, those who must act for us and
for the people of Canada. Let us as a body
willingly do everything we can in order to
attain that end. Let us forget the past and
look entirely to the future.
There is one word I would say to the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and I know he will not be offended. He
welcomes only what he regards as constructive
criticism; and any criticism offered should be
constructive and helpful. He bas been in the
thick of all that has been done to carry on
national affairs up to the present time, and
he feels that the Government have done weP;
that is, he feels they have done their best.
He does not like to be criticized himself, nor

SENATE
to hear criticism of his fellow Ministers. That
attitude is only human. He resents such
criticism, and shows his resentment, and then
somebody on this side immediately tries to
hit back. That is our trouble. Let us keep
a tight rein on our feelings and not show
resentment at all. I suppose I should not
attempt to give advice to this honourable body,
but I am sure everyone who is listening to
me is quite certain that I am correct in
suggesting what in the present situation our
conduet should be.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable members, I
think that in all fairness I should be allowed
-although we are all out of order-to add a
few words. I do not think I deserve any
abuse or opprobrium for what I said yesterday. We have a Government who stated to
us that they would carry on as a party Government, and that the existence of an Opposition
was essential for the purpose of criticizing
them and holding them in check. That principle was stressed during the last electionand I would remind honourable members
that last night I did not mention the last
election. It was stressed by the present Prime
Minister that what he described as Union
Government was impossible in this country and
would result in chaos and class war. In
accordance with that doctrine we have an
Opposition, and I cannot understand why
the speech I made last night should raise
such antagonism and resentment. Yesterday
I was not talking polities: I did not refer to
the elections of last Mareh. An honourable
member from the opposite side did mention
the elections and the "unquestioned mandate"
obtained from the people by telling them that
the maximum was being done to defeat the
enemy. I repeat, I did not mention the elections. but I rose in mny seat to give expression
to sentiments that were at the bottom of my
ieart. I expressed myself very clearly. I did
not discuss whether or not, when the battle
in France was lost, it was advisable to send
our troops across the Channel to be sacrificed,
and no words I used yesterday can carry
any implication to that effect. But, uninformed as I am, as is any member who is
not a Liberal and therefore is not persona
grata with the Government, and having no
source of information except the statements
addressed to us from time to time, I did express
the feeling that. Canada having as a free
nation declared war on Germany and voluntarily engaged in the titanie conflict, and
-having been at war for nine months, some
Canadian tanks, Canadian aeroplanes, or
Canadian guns, and sorne Canadian soldiers
should have been on the first line of defence.
That is all I said.
ton. Mr. CALDER.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

lon. Mr. COTE: Surely that is a matter
which needs explanation. Maybe honourable
senators opposite imagine we are thinking of
politics all the time. We are not.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no!
Hon. Mr. COTE: They must realize the
anguish of Canadians who ask themselves the
question, "Why is it so?"
Surely nobody
last October prevented us frorn manufacturing tanks or aeroplanes or other war equipment.
An Hon. SENATOR:

That is the question.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Possibly there is an
answer. If tiere is, I shall be happy indeed.
But after listening to the explanations offered
and the abuse heaped on me from the opposite side of the House, I say that every word
I said yesterday stands and I have nothing
to withdraw.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: There was nothing

the Joad of government for years, should
occasionally show a littie sympathy for the
men who are now carrying the Joad.

Why should they complain if the Government
withhold information which it would be prejudicial to divulge? If the honourable gentleman wants information, let him go to the
authorities. He gets cverything that we on

FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
dehate on the motion for the second reading
of Bill 25, an Act to amend the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934,
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
this is flot the first time a Bill dealing with
this subject bas come before this House. The
first Bill was introduced into the Senate in
the session of 1934-Some Hon. SENATORS: Louder.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -and was passed into
law. It atTected aIl mortgages and a.greements
made in Canada prior to the lst of June, 1935.
In 1938 the legislation was amended s0 as to
provide that in certain provinces the law
should expire on the 31st of December of
that year, and in British Columbia and Manitoba on the 3Oth of June, 1939.
I shail not take up very much time in discussing this matter, because it has been very
ably deait with by previous speakers. We
now have a request by the Government of
the day to pass a Bill reinstating the province
of Manitoba under the Act. It bas been admitted, I think, that legisîstion of a public
nature whîch applies to only one province is
not good legislation. If legisiation such as
we have before us were proper with respect to
Manitoba, it would be just as proper with
respect to every other province in Canada.
But the principle of the Bill is wrong.
The question every honourable senator is
asking himself is why this Bill makes provision
with respect to Manitoba. A number of
honourable senators have askcd me why
this legislation is requested by that province.
That is a fair question, and I shahl try to
answer it. A peculiar thing happened. In
Manitoba, during the session of 1937, the
Conservative Opposition accused the Liberals
of having allowed the Act to be cancelled, so
far as that province was concerned. The
Liberal Government denied this, and blamed
the Senate. The argument bas continued
ever since. In the session of 1939 the Manitoba Government brought in an amendment
to the King~s Bench Act, whereby power was
given for the adjustment of mortga-ges; but
it was no good withou-t the consent of the
Dominion, and the Dominion would not give
its consent. Then last session this Parliament
passed the Central Mortgage Bank Act, whicb
enabled the Government to put up part of
the losses on mortgages. That Act is etili
on the Statute Book. To-day Manitoba would
rather have the Central Mortgage Bankc Act

SENATE

182

than the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act,
and the only reason the present Bill is before
us is that the Government of the day have
refused to put the Central Mortgage Bank
Act into force.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Mr.

Why?

I cannot answer.
MEIGHEN:

the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am one of the two
members on this side of the House who voted
in opposition to that Act; therefore I am
quite candid in saying that if it were in force
the present legislation would not be asked for.
What happened in Manitoba? In that
province we have a Debt Adjustment Act, or
Mortgage Postponement Act, which has been
in force since 1931.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
pones.

That Act onily post-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It says that no ýproceedings can be taken without the consent of the
Debt Adjustment Board. What happens before that board? I have appeared before it
more than once. Suppose I a.m acting for a
mortgagee. I ask to be allowed to take proceedings. If the mortgagor says, "My farm
is mortgaged for $5,000, but it is worth only
$4,000," the board says, "Is that true?" If I
say I do not think the farm is worth more
than $4.000. the board then says, "We will
not aillow you to take any proceedings," and
there I am. The farmer is in possession of
the land, getting the crops, and I am able to
get nothing. So I go outside and make a
deal with that fellow. The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act applies only to debts
incurred before 1935.
In June of 1938, when Manitoba was removed from the effect of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. Mr. Bracken directed
the Chairman of the Debt Adjustment Board
to write to every farmer who lad ever
applied to them and tell him the Dominion
Act would go out of force in one year, unless
it was extended. I wrote to Premier Bracken
and asked him the following questions:
1. How many applications were made to the
board between the lst of June, 1938, and the
30th of June, 1939?
unany people were notified by the
2. Ho
Debt Adjustment Board at Winnipeg, under
the chairmanship of Mr. Rutherford, tiat the
Act would go out of force on the 30th of lune,
1939?
3. How many of these people applied for
adjustment under the Act after the notice?

I have received two letters from Manitoba
about this Bil. One is from Mr. Bracken
and one is from the Winnipeg Board of Trade.
Mr. Bracken says, "Pass it." The Board of
Trade says, "Do not pass it." I have lived
in Manitoba nearly all my life, and except
for the Bracken Government and the Conservative Opposition, I have not had one word
asking me to support this BiH. Not another
soul has requesrd il. Yet in the Legislature
I am blamed for the repeal of the Act as
It is said, "This man

Haig did it.'
Hon. A. L. BEAU11EN: I understand the
Federation of Farmsers' Associations wrote.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. but they did not
write to me; neither did thcv witec to
the honourable member from Manitou (lion.
Mr. Sharpe). He did not even get a letter
from John Bracken.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Oh, yes, I did.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I beg your pardon.
Now, honourable gentlemen, the title "The
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act" is a
misnomer. Wien the legislation was passed,
it should have been called "An Act for the
benefit of First Mortgagees." bccause they
are the only ones it benefits. When I am
acting for a first mortgagee and get a notice
of application under this legislation I smile.
I say to him: 'You are a lucky dog. You
are going to have the mortgage on the farm,
anoi all the other debts are going to be
wiped out-the doctor's bil, the merchant's

bill. the grocer's bill"An
hill?

Hon.

SENATOR:

And

the

lawyer's

JUNE 19, 1940
.Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, and the lawyer's bill,
too. "The second mortgage will be wiped
out, and the only liability against the land
willl be the first mortgage. That is your
security. You are a lucky dog."
Now, what about the farmer? The records
of the Land Titles Office show that within
the last six months more farm, land has been
sold than was sold in the previous ten years.
1 can speak with somne knowledge. In my own
office I have seen sales go through at $30
an acre for land that was bought a yea-r ago
at $15.
Is the Act needed in Manitoba? I dlaim
it would work to the disadvantage of the
people of that province. It would destroy
the farmer's credit. The honourable gentleman from Marquette (Hon. Mr. Mullins) was
quitie right in saying that financial institutions
will not lend money to Western farmers
to-day. The Act as it stands now applies to
debts contracted before 1935, and people who
-have money to lend are afraid to lend it to
farmers, becau&.e next year the date limait may
be extended to 1940. Suppose there was a
dernand for such an extension, what answer
could we give? Could we refuse? Not at all.
And if the Act is a good thing with respect
to debts incurred as late as 1940, why would
it not be good for debts that may be incurred
in the future. in 1941 or 1942 or any later
year? Besides, why should the Act not be
in force in Ontario and in Quebec? Why is
Manitoba -h-lected?
If we restore this Act in our province it will
ruin our farmers, because it will fool them
into thinking they are being helped, when as
a matter of fact they will not be helped at
ahl. As a practising lawyer in Manitoba I
say to you quite candidly that the Act wil
not assist. one debtor out of every thousand
in that province. My right honýourable friend
the leader on this sida (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) referred to the fact that ail parties
in the Legislatua'e voted in favour of the
resolution asking passage of this Bill. Conservative, Lihpral and C.C.F. members alike
voted for it. The explanation is simple. If
the Government are going to try to fool the
voters, the Opposition will try to fool them
too. That is ail it amounts to.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Was the legislation
introduced with the objeet of fooling the
people in 1934?
Hon. Mr. H.AIG: I will coma to, that.
Whan the legislation was introduced in 1934
it was feit that farmars would not stay on
the land unless soma measure of the kind
was passad to help them. That was a wrong
view, I think, and, to be quita candid, I
thought so at the time too. But in 1938 I

182

was ona of those who askad that the Act
ha continued in force in Saskatchewan and
Albecrta. Why did I do that? My reason,
which will be found in the record, wa.s that
there had 'bean such bad crops in those
provinces thatmrany farmers were discouraged
and did not have tha heart to carry on under
thair haavy burdens. But that was not true
of Manitoba. In 1937 our province had a good
crop, except in the southwest corner, and a
good price was got for it.
I know that soma peopla in Manitoba will
say it is good politics to pass this Bill. I
do not beliava it is. As I have already said,
it will not be of any help to our farmers,
but it will hurt them when they want credit.
I think legislation of this kind is a bad thing
for the country in ganeral, bacause our people
should stand on their own feet. And, as I
have alraady remarked, I cannot racali being
asked by a singla farmer to, have tha Act
î'estorad in Manitoba. My honourabla friand
fromn Parkdala (Hon. Mr. Murdock) said the
other. day that I made some speeches in the
last campaign. Wall, I neyer was asked any
question about this Act, and so far as I know
it neyer was mentionad on any platform.
Certainly the Press never raported any reference to it. Thara is no demand in the province for this Bill. The measure would not
have been heard of but for a little row in the
Manitoba Lagislature. I say quite candidly
that the Conservative maembars of that Legislatura are principally to blame for the measure.
The welfare of the farmers and townspeople
of Manitoba is of more importance to me
than any slight political advantage that might
accrue to the provincial Conservative party
through passage of the Bill. I say that in
the best intarasts of Manitoba and of Canada
as a whole the Act should not ba restored to
affect in that province. I would ask honourable members to vote against the Bill.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
parhaps I, as a Westarner, should make some
observation on the remarks of tha honourabla
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig), lest the mistakan idea, arise that there
is a great land boom in the West. I think
it is safe to assure honourabla senators that
sales at $30 or more an acre are for land
within fifty miles of a city, and the purchasers
are whita-collarad farmers lika myseif.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: They keep pratty close
to the city.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Thay buy tha land
for a hobby.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McRAE: As to the Bill itself,
I am disposed to look at it in a broad way.
A couple of years ago, when an amendment
to the Act was before us, I favoured the
withdrawal of the Act from operation in
Manitoba and its continuance in Saskatchewan
and Alberta. That was largely because I
understood little use had been made of the
Act in Manitoba. Now we have a unanimous
resolution from the Manitoba Legislature
asking for restoration of the privileges that
are available in the other two Prairie Provinces. Here I want to say that I have not
the slightest interest in Manitoba politics, but
I am interested in the farmers of that province
and of the West in general. Of course, none
of us likes the principle of this legislation,
but in these days, when we are conscripting
life and property, objections which we formerly made to such measures as this really
mean little or nothing. Taking a long-range
view of the situation in our Western country,
I feel that if I had a mortgage on Western
farm property and the interest was not being
paid, I should not lose much time in getting
a readjustment on a basis of present values,
and encouraging the farmer to stay on the
Iand.
As I see the after-the-war period,
I believe that a proper readjustment of
indebtedness at this time would result in less
loss to a mortgagee than he would suffer
without such readjustment.
We heard from one of our honourable
members to-day that Canadian manufacturers
are eager to produce war munitions and
supplies, crying to get into production. Well,
I want to remind the House that work of
that kind is donc on a profit basis. We all
know it was found impossible to get manufacturers to produce war supplies at a profit
of five per cent. I ask the honourable junior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
every other honourable member this question:
How would farmers look on the situation
to-day if they could make five per cent
profit on their efforts?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I believe the farmers
are the only citizens of our country who,
in addition to paying their share for the war
through increased costs for almost everything
they buy, are obliged to make a further
heavy contribution by selling their produce
at less than cost. Our three Prairie Provinces
have one main crop, wheat, and when I look
ahead and contemplate the situation our
farmers out there will be in after this war is
over, whether we win or lose, I shudder at the
consequences.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN.

For these reasons I am reversing the stand
which I took the last time an amendment to
this Act was before us, and I intend to vote
for the Bill.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS:
Honourable
senators, I do not feel I have a great deal of
licence to speak on this Bill, as it affects a
province other than my own. However, when
amendments to the Act were before the Senate
two years ago I was given the duty of introducing them, and I still feel a certain responsibility in connection with the discussion that
took place at that time. I listened with
interest to my honourable friend-I was going
to say "my learned friend," because one almost
falls into a legal controversy on this matterfrom Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig),
particularly when he made certain statements,
which might be called admissions, as to what at
times motivates a parliamentary opposition.
I think that perhaps one of the main issues
before us at present is the attitude that is
being taken in the Senate with regard to
another parliamentary body.
We heard it
stated here last night and again to-day that
it was unfair to make any criticism of the
British War Office in connection with responsibility for war policy, because they were not
here to answer for themselves.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Will the
honourable gentleman excuse me? The point
was, not that they were not here to answer, but
that they could not answer, no matter where
they were.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Of course, that would
bring me to another point. The Government
of this country also cannot answer with regard
to certain war efforts.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
answer, all right.

They can

Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
Not always. There
are times when it is not in the public interest
that they should answer. My right honourable friend knows that quite well.
My right honourable friend bas not merely
made allegations against the entire Legislature of Manitoba, but bas indicted it in no
uncertain ternis. It scems to me that this
democracy, to which the right honourable
gentleman bas frequently referred, has features
which might well be considered. It is enough
to make one wonder about the condition
democracy is in, when the leader of a great
party in this House indicts a Legislature as
to its motives, notwithstanding that there is
no representative of the Legislature present
to answer to the indictment. I would make
a suggestion. In view of what bas occurred,
I think that representatives of the Manitoba

185

JUNE 19, 1940
Legisiature, or the provincial Government,
should be heard by members of this House,
and it seems to me that the logical way to bring
that about is to allow the Bill to go through
second reading, have it sent to the committee
to which the previous amendment to this Act
was referred, and invite the Prime Minister
of Manitoba to appear and tell us whether the
request for the Bill is a political matter.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourable
members, I have not a right to speak again,
but I think I should, as I have just received
a telegram from Mr. Bracken, the Prime
Minister of Manitoba. Before reading the
telegramn 1 want to say that, even had I not
received it, I should have had no objection
to the Bill being given second reading, on the
understanding that, though I am definitely
opposed to the measure, I think there should
he a reference to committee in order that we
may hear those who want ta be heard. I have
neyer opposed the sending of any bill to a
committee for such a purpose.
I might add that Mr. Bracken does flot
contend hie cannot make an answer to anything that bas been said. I have neyer known
him to remain quiet when hie wanted to speak,
and I can say the same of the leader of the
Opposition. Mr. Bracken's telegram reads as
follows:

course that the dehate on second reading in

prospect of this motion being defeated, may I
respectfily urge that the Bill should at least
be sent to committee, and that before final
vote is taken members of the Manitoba board
of review should be called hefore the committee
to give evidence as -to whether in their judgment from practical experience there is a good
reason for the Act again being made effective
in Manitoha. I -arn sending a similar telegram
to the Government leader, the Honourable Mr.

Dandurand.

John Bracken,
Premier of Manitoba.
I know the chairman of the board of review,
and have the bighest possible regard for him.
Though I think I know. as much about this
subject as even that very highly regarded
man, I certainly will not be a party to
denying him or the board of review or Mr.
Bracken., if ýhe cares to came, a chance to be
heard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose, if
this Bill is to go ta a committee, it would be

the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURANID: Then I think
we should also natify the Winnipeg Board of
Trade, which bas sent me a long resolution
in protest against the Bill. It is but fair that
that important body be given an opportunity
to appear before our standing committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I should like to read to the House
this statement which the Prime Minister
imparted to the Commons at 6 o'clock this
evenmg:
I am happy to be in a position to inform the
House that the Governor General designate,
the Right Honourable the Earl of Athlone, and
Her Royal Highness the Princess Alice, Countess
of Athlone, have arrived in Halifax this
afternoon.
The Earl and Countess of Athlone were
accompanied, from England, by the Secretary
to the Governor General, Sir Shuldham Redfern,
the Honourable Ariel Baird, Lady-in-Waiting
to Her Royal Highness, and Captain T. R. C.
Goff, A.D.C.

Upon arrival in Halifax, this afternoon, the
Earl of Atliione and the Princess Alice weie
met by the Under-Secretary of State, and by
members of the staff of Government House.
His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova
Scotia, the Premier of the Province, and
representatives of the Defence Services and of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were also
present.
The Earl of Athlone and Her Royal Highness
and their party are proceeding by special train
to Ottawa. It is expected they will arrive on
Friday morning at 11.30 o'clock, daylight
saving time.
Upon the arrivai of the special train at the
station in Ottawa, the Governor General
designate and Her Royal Highness will be met
by His Excellency the Administrator and members of the Government. The Ministers of
foreign powers accredited to Canada, the
Commonwealth representatives, the Mayor of
Ottawa and the members and associate members
of the Defence Council will also be present.
In view of the gravity of the international
situation, it bas been thought appropriate that
the cereinonial features in more normal times
associated with the installation of Governors
General should be reduced to a minimum.
Accordingly, arrangements have been made for
the installation and swearing-in of the Earl
of Athlone to take place immediately following
arrival in the Capital. The official party will
proceed direct from the railway station to the
Senate Chamber, where the ceremony will take
place at twelve o'elock noon.
Honourable members and others who are to
be invited to the ceremony of installation will
shortly receive printed copies of an official
programme which has been prepared for the
occasion.

PROSECUTION OF THE WAR-REGULATION OF LABOUR CONDITIONSNAVAL DEFENCE
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members, before the Orders of the Day are
called I should like ta place on Hansard
this minute of a meeting of the Privy Council,
approved by His Excellency the Administrator
on June 19, 1940:
The Committee of the Privy Council have
had before them a report, dated June 15, 1940,
from the Minister of Labour, representing as
follows:
The Government has received from representative bodies of industry and of labour
expressions of their desire to co-operate with
the Government in the present crisis to the end
that the industrial capacity of Canada requisite
to the successful prosecution of the war may
be utilized to the fullest possible extent.
The establishment and maintenance of good
relations between firms engaged in the execution
of war contracts and the production of necessary
materials therefor and their workpeople is of
the utmost importance at this time, and the
same is true indeed of the operations of distributive agencies and of services required to
meet the needs of the civil population. In wartime the safety of the nation must be the first
consideration of all patriotic citizens and no
element in the community can be permitted
to benefit from wartime necessities. The best
interests of industry and labour are inseparable
and since organized society alone makes possible
industrial production to the mutual benefit of
95882-13J

187

those engaged therein, the needs of the community at large, especially under war conditions,
mîust be regarded as paramount.
The development of Canada's war effort bas
not been hampered to date by the occurrence
of any serious labour troubles, and means have
happily been found, through negotiation, conciliation and enquiry, of dealing effectively with
any disputes as to wage rates and working
hours which have arisen. While the causes
of industrial unrest have not thus far arisen
from the war, they might well be accentuated
by it. It is clear that any differences that
might arise would extend beyond wage scales
or hours of labour and include the right of
association in labour bodies and the right of
organized workpeople to enter into collective
agreements through whicl they may be expected
to exercise a more organie influence on the
processes of industrial life; all of them aspirations which, under wise direction, will make for
the removal of prejudice and for fuller cooperation between employers and employed.
Statutory provisions have been made since the
outbreak of hostilities to obviate the making
of undue profits on war work, and the operation
of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board is
designed to safeguard the interests of the
consuming public ageinst undue enhancement of
the prices of the necessaries of life.
The policy is re-affirmed which was previously announced by the Prime Minister of
Canada, that the full weight of the Government's power will be exerted to prevent the
exploitation of wartime needs by any form of
profiteering.

It would conduce to the removal of misunderstandings and to the extension of common
interests and national purpose were a declaratiori to be made by the Government at this time
of certain principles for the regulation of labour
conditions during the war,' the acceptance of
which by employers and workpeople would make
for the avoidance of industrial strife and the
utmost acceleration possible in the production
which is so essential in present circumstances.
The Committee, on the recommendation of the
Minister of Labour, advise, with respect to the
foregoing, that the following principles for the
avoidance of labour unrest during the war be
approved:
1. That every effort should be made to speed
production by war industries;
2. That fair and reasonable standards of
wages and working conditions should be recognized and that where any temporary adjustments
in remuneration are made, due to war conditions, they might well be in the form of
bonus payments;
3. That hours of work should not be unduly
extended, but that where increased output is
desired it should be secured as far as practicable
by the adoption of additional shifts throughout
the week, experience during the last war having
shown that an undue lengthening of working
hours results in excessive fatigue and in a
diminution of output;
4. That established safeguards and regulations
for the protection of the health and safety of
the workers should not be relaxed, but that
every precaution should be taken to ensure
safe and healthful conditions of work;
5. That there should be no interruption in
productive or distributive operations on account
of strikes or lockouts. Where any difference
arises which cannot be settled by negotiation
between the parties, assistance in effecting a

SENATE
settlement should be sought from the Government conciliation services, and failing settlement
of the difference in this marner, it should be

dealt with in accordance with the provisions
of the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act,
wlich lias been extended under the War
Measures Act to apply specifically to all war
work.
6. That employees should be free to organize

I shall give to Hansard a copy of this
Order in Council, which I lay on the Table,

employers or their agents. In this connection,
attention is directed to section 11 of the provisions of Chapter 30, 3 George VI, an Act
to Amend the Criminal Code, under whiclh it
is declared to be an offence, subject to prescribed penalties, for any employer or his agent
wrongfully and without lawful authority to
refuse to employ, or to dismiss from employment, any person because of his membership
in a lawful trade union, or to use intimidation
to prevent a workman from belonging to a
trade union, or to conspire with other employers
to do either of such acts.
7. That employees, through the officers of
their trade union or through other representatives chosen by them, should be free to negotiate
with employers or the representatives of employers' associations concerning rates of pay,
hours of labour and other working conditions,
with a view to the conclusion of a collective
agreement;
8. That every collective agreement should
provide machinery for the settlement of disputes arising out of the agreement, and for
its renewal or revision, and that both parties
shouli scrupulously observe the terms and conditions of any agreement inîto which they have

Hon. Mr. D.\NDURAND: It lias been donc
because of representations that have come
from employers and fronm employees, in an
effort to avert difficulties that may be looming
up. There is in soie quarters an agitation
which may terminate in strikes; so the
Government has felt that it should strengthen
the arm of the Labour Department by laying

9. That workers, in the exercise of their right
to organize, should use neithier ceoercion nor
intimidation of any kind to influence any person
to join their organization;
10. That any suspension which may be made
of labour conditions established by law, agreement or usage, requisite to the speeding of
wartime production, should be brought about
by mutual agreement and should be understood
as applying only for the period of emergency.
The foregoing declaration by the Government
of principles for the regulation of labour conditions during the war is necessarily subject
to the provisions of any enactment by the
Parliament of Canada or made under its
authority for the purpose of meeting any special
emergency whereby the national safety of

Canada bas become endangered.
The Coinmittee furthter advise that the attention of employers in meeting their requirements

as to labour supply be drann to the available
facilities of the local offices of the Employment
Service of Canada in all of the provinces,

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have reason
for saying a word now. In what I heard

however, by an Order in Council setting out

Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then, maybe,
I can be of a little help by saying what is in
my mind on the subject. I think that the
appreciation of war's imperious demands on
the part of labour bas been on the whole
gratifying. There have been indications of
friction, and there bas been friction, at
different points. I suppose that is inevitable.
But, having in mind the war, and nothing but
the war, it is important that we should give
no encouragement to movements merely
initiating tendencies which ultimately result
in an increase in the cost of living and general
inflation, for that does no good to labour or
to anyone. A mnovement for an increase in
salaries outside of labour will have the same
effect. Anything the Government can do to
control tbe tendency will be beneficial.
Capital cannot make money

in this crisis.

It is not going to be allowed to do so. I doubt
if capital can remain intact. We do not know.

189

JUNE 20, 1940
Certainly its demands and aspirations have
to be subordinated to the necessities of war.
Just the other day, in a circular, I think it
was, I saw an indication of a desire on the
part of the Labour Department, I think, for
various scales of overtime pay, and the like.
Such a desire can lead only one way. It can
lead only to higher costs and inflation, and,
therefore, te the continual embarrassment of
Government in financing the war. It can do
no good to anybody. I call attention to that
because I am obsessed with the idea that the
impending crisis must, of necessity, monopolize
our attention.
While I am on my feet, if the House will
consent, I should like te read an article which
bas impressed me greatly, just in order that
it may be on the record of this House, and
therefore more widely available te our people.
This article, which appears in to-day's Globe
and Mail, is one of a regular series by Mr.

Walter Lippmann, a very eminent and very
able American writer attached te The New
York Times. I shall not read it because of its
application to our neighbours. He wrote it

for that reason, no doubt. But such objective
is none of our business; their decision is their
own. I shall read it because of its application

to Canada, and because, if it sinks into the
minds of the people of this country, it will
assist this Government, or any government,
in meeting the unheard of demands that are
now upon us. This is the article:
On these things there is for all practical
purposes unanimous agreement: First, that the
United States will resist with force the entrance
of the Axis powers into the territories of the
Western Hemisphere. In the Senate there was
no dissent on this far-reaching commitment;
in the House virtually none. Second, that in
order to make good this commitment. the United
States will need, in case of a total victory by
the Axis, a navy nearly twice the size of the
There is no opposition in
existing navy.
Congress to authorizing euch a navy. Third,
that in case of a total victory by the Axis,
ordinary commercial dealings between the
European Continent and the Americas will be
impossible in that on the European side trade
will be conducted by dictatorial governments
exercising a monopoly of exports and imports,
and that against such a monopely individual
American traders will be helpless. A few
Congressmen may have failed to grasp this
point, but the American people, with their long
experience of the danger of monopoly, will
grasp it quickly enough.
There is, furthermore, agreement which,
though not unanimous, is very substantial, that
the need to defend this hemisphere, the need to
double the fleet, and the need to organize trade
against the dictation of a European monopoly
arise only because the Allied control of the seas
between Europe and America is threatened
with destruction. But for that no one would
feel called upon to reaffirm the Monroe
Doctrine. No one would feel called upon to
construct another navy.
No one would be
appropriating billions for armaments, imposing

huge taxes or getting ready for universal
service. No one would be considering the
abandonment of the principle of private dealings in foreign trade and the substitution of
what, if the plan is to be effective, will be in
esence the complete Government regulation of
foreign trade.
Because all these difficult and distasteful
measures are forced upon us by the danger of
a victory by the Axis, a very substantial part
of the peeple are convinced that the support of
the Allied resistance is a vital interest of the
United States.
I repeat, I am reading this because of its practical application to Canada.
,Seeing all these things, there is nevertheless
division of opinion and confusion of counsel
as to what measures the United States should
now take. The Congress is ready to authorize
another navy. It is not willing to face the fact
that this second navy cannot be constructed in
less than four years. Yet Hitler has conquered
the Continent of Europe in five weeks. The
Congress is not willing to face the fact that
if Hitler conquers Great Britain this summer,
he may capture the British and French navies.
Combined with bis own navy, with the Italian
navy, and with the immense navy now under
construction in British shipyards, he will not
only possess at once, at moet within a few
months, overwhelming naval superiority, but he
will be able to outbuild the United ,States in
a race of armaments. The second American
navy, which now exists only on paper, would
already be outmatched even if it existed. And
before this second navy can be built, the naval
power of Hitler's Europe will have an even
greater margin of superiority than it may
possess before the summer is over.
Unwilling to face candidly this very real
danger of the immediate future, Congress and
a section of the public are for a policy of
inaction now on the ground that the United
States is too weak to defend its vital interests.
The reasoning is curions. All are agreed that
we must make odrselves strong enough to
protect our vital intereets in the future even
though a totalitarian Europe allied with Japan
bas a crushing naval superiority in the world.
But to-day, when the Allied sea power still
stands, to-day when the United States still is
the second greatest naval power in the world,
we are told that this nation is too weak to move
quickly and decisively to safeguard its vital
interests. But if it is to late to move to
support the British resistance and to make as
sure as we can that,'if the British are defeated
in Europe, the fleet will not fall into Hitler's
hands, then it will be much more too late to
maintain our naval defenses if the British fleet,
now turned against Hitler, is turned against us.
*

*

It is irresponsible and misleading to divert
the attention of the American people from this,
the most vital matter in their history, by
political outcries about " going to war." The
question is not whether we shall "go to war."
The question is whether we shall act now so
that this hemisphere can in fact be defended.
And whatever action is necessary should be
considered not in the light of legal doctrines
and political slogans, but in the light of whether
it promises to result in our maintaining a truly
adequate naval defense in this hemisphere.
If we take measures now to make as certain as
we can that the Allied fleets do not fall to
Hitler, and that they are not turned against

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
REFERRED BACK TO COMMITT1EE

On the Order:
Consideration of the amendment made by
the Standing Committee on Banking and Comnmerce to Bill 12, an Act to amend the NMorth-

west Territories Act.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, this Bill dea.ls with the question of court
jurisdiction in the Northwest Territories, that
part of Canada north of the established
provinces. A large part of the Territories is
n.orth of the provinces of Manitoba, Sazkatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, but
the eastern part is uorth of Ontario and
Quebec. The present Northweet Territories
Act provides that jurisdiction in civil matters
in the Territories west of the 8Oth meridian
of west longitude shall lie in the courts of
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and
British Columbia. The Bill will give Ontario
courts, in addition, exclusive jurisdiction in
civil matters in the portion east of the goth
meridian.
Another object of the Bill is to make clear
that the provincial courts have surrogate

191

powers in the Territories. This will remove a
doubt that has existed in the minds of some
judges.
I arn not a member of the Banking and
Commerce Committee, but the chairman and
the committee as a whole furnished me with
every facility for .presenting my ideas before it.
Representatives of the Department of Mines
and Natural Resources urged acceptance of the
Bill in its present form, except for one amendment that was made in committee, and they
stated that they hoped to prepare within the
next four or five years a general amendment
to al] legislation concerning the Nor.thwest
Territories.
Fundamentally, jurisdiction as te, law for
any part of these Territories should rest in
the -province lying south of that part. That
is to say, for the part of -the Territories north
of Manitoba, the jurisdiction shauld be in
Manitoba courts; for the part north of
Saskatchewan, it should be in Saskatchewan
courts; for the part north of Alberta, it
should be in Alberta courts; for the part north
of British Columbia, it should be in British
Columbia courts; for the part north of
Ontario, it should be in Ontario courts, and
for the ýpart north of Quebec, it should be in
Quebec courts. But it may be some years
before the change is brought about. A large
part of the -fur-trading business in the Territories, at least ninety per cent of it, is done
by the Hudson's Bay Company, with headquarters in Manitoba. The mining busineas,
just developing, is, I should say, largely done
by companies with headquarters in Ontario.
My suggestion is that this. Bill be referred
back ta the committee for amendment. The
committee should be instructed that in surrogate matters the courts of every province
should be given jurisdiction. At the present
time, if a person in the Northwest Territories
dies intestate there i.s provision for an official
of the Department of Mines and Natural
Resources to take out letters of administration.
It seems ta me that in the circumstances this is
reasonable. But as ta civil matters I suggest
that west of the 8Oth meridian, which is the
boundary between Manitoba and Ontario, legal
action should be taken in one of the Western
Provinces; east of that meridian, in one of the
Eastern Provinces. That is the substance of
my proposed amendment.
I know it is not the practice ta refer a Bill
back to a committee for reconsideration; and I
amn not taking this course because I do flot
happen to be a member of the committee
which has dealt with this Bill. I think it is
fundamentally rigbt that civil actions in that
great territory which mainly is north of the
four Western Provinces should be dealt with in

SENATE
those provinces. Of the population of the
Northwest Territories, about 2,500, not including Eskimos, the majority live north of those
four provinces. The fur trade is practically all
controlled by persons or companies in those
provinces. It is argued that Ontario should
have jurisdiction in civil matters because many
of the mining companies operating in the
Northwest Territories have their head offices
in Toronto. There is some ground for that
argument, but I believe that when amending
an Act we should take what is the reasonable
course, and in my opinion the reasonabie
course in this case is along the lines I am
urging. No part of the Northwest Territories
is north of Ontario; the great bulk of it is
either north of the four Western Provinces or
north of the province of Quebec. Under the
Bill as drafted, the only province which would
benefit is Ontario.
In my judgment this
province has no claim to the business in that
part of Canada, except on the ground that
its investors are interested in mining enterprises there. But if persons in Ontario invest
money in the Alberta oil fields, that does not
give the courts of their province any jurisdiction in Alberta. The Great Powers tried to
apply a similar principle to China, but failed
miserably.
I move, seconded by Hon. Mr. Aseltine,
the following motion:
That the report of the Committee on Banking
and Commerce on Bill 12. an Act to amend
the Northwest Territories Act, be referred back
te the committee with instructions to amend
the Bill te provide that in reference to surrogate
powers all the provinces of Canada have jurisdiction in the said Territories and that as to
civil matters all east of the 89th meridian of
west longitude shall be under the jurisdiction
of the Superior Courts of the provinces of
Ontario, Quebec, Nova Seotia, New Brunswick
and Prince Edward Island and that all wvest of
the 89th meridian of west longitude shall be
under the Superior Courts of the provinces of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British
Columbia, and that the Bill be amended in
committee accordingly.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would that not be an
arbitrary order to give to a committee? The
committee would have no discretion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The House is
above the committee.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes, but is it proper
for the House to act in that way?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
way it is always done in the Commons.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: But is it right?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Commons is right.

The House of

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Is it always right?
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Usually we
deal with amendments on motion for third
reading.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The course I have taken
is that followed at Westminster, and it is
prescribed by the rules of the Senate and
the House of Commons. I may add that this
is always the procedure followed in the Legislature of Manitoba. I am not trying to be
arbitrary. I have purposely drafted my motion
in general terms.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
intend to speak at length. I shall support the
amendment, but it appears to me to be in
error where it states the Bill should be
amended so that the "provinces" shall have
jurisdiction. It should read "courts of the
provinces." The provinces cannot have any
jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would ask that my
motion be amended accordingly.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
not being a lawyer, I rise with a certain degree
of hesitancy to enter into a discussion of a
legal matter. The proposed change was pretty
fully discussed in the committee, and I think
a substantial majority of its members decided
in favour of the report. I quite agree with
the honourable the junior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) that any litigation arising
in the Northwest Territories should, if possible,
be assigned to the provinces directly south.
Departmental officials explained that at the
present time this was practically impossible,
but four or five years hence it would be
feasible.
My honourable friend makes a distinction
between probate business and other civil
matters that might arise. There may be
a basis of reason for the distinction, but the
officials of the department expressed the view
that such a division would introduce unnecessary complications, and that it would be
better to wait until certain developments
had taken place, when arrangements could
be made to give to the courts of each province
jurisdiction in the territory which lies directly
north of it.
I do not altogether agree with my honourable friend when he intimates that the litigation which arises in the Northwest Territories
affects only the people in the Western Provinces, and that therefore all such cases should
be tried in the courts of those provinces.
It was stated before the committee that, for
instance, some wealthy individual or corporation in Ontario-I am not taking any sectional
stand in this matter-could prejudice a poor
man living in a Western province by forcing

JUNE 20, 1940
him ta fight bis case before the courts in
To~ronto. But it was also disclosed by the
Deputy Minister of Mines that, as a matter
of fact, cases had arisen where the plaintiff
was a poor man residing in the city of Toronto.
lit would be just as great an injustice ta
force him to appear in court at Calgary,
Edmonton or even Vancouver as te bring a
poor litigant living in the Territories down
ta Toronto. At any rate it was thought right
-and it seems to me reasonable-that the
courts of ail the provinces rnight as well be
given equal jurisdiction in the Territorie.
This would appear ta be ail the more reasonable in view of the fact, as I understand, that
the Act now contains a provision whereby a
judge may order that a case be tried at a
point convenient ta one of the litigants. This
provision, in my opinion, disposes of the
objection that a poor man rnigbt be forced
ta have bis case tried at. a place far distant
from bis home.
I feel, honourable senators, that the report
of the committee as presented should be
adopted.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Haig was agreed

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I have nlot voted,

from Royal (Hon. Mr. Jones).

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable

that we shail have to wait a littie longer
before the Bill reaches us. I arn wondering
whether we should adjourn during pîcasure.

If Parliament is not sitting, the Order in

JUNE 20, 1940
spirit of honourable senators, as expressed by
the right honourable leader on the other side,
if I am able to move first, and then second,
and perhaps third reading of the Bill to-night.
Most of us have followed the discussions which
have taken place in the other House, and
even if we have not read the Commons
Hansard we have, through the morning and
evening Press, been informed daily of the progress of the Bill.
In order that honourable members may have
an idea of what is intended to be done under
this legislation, I shall now read again .the
Prime Minister's statement to which I have
already referred, and which indicates for what
purposes this Bill is before Parliament.
Immediate measures were taken at that time
to assist in the naval defence of Newfoundland.
In the light of recent events, additional responsibility has been assumed for the nilitary
defence of strategie areas there.

I am pleased

to be able to announce that Canadian armed
forces are now on duty in Newfoundland.
What I shall relate as to the activities of the
Government of Canada will indicate what can
be done, even outside of the sending of troops
to Great Britain. I may say that most of
the things that have been done have been
donc at the request of the British authorities.
The House has already been informed of the
contribution whieh Canada is making in the
West Indies by replacing British troops with
Canadian troops, on garrison duty, and thus
relieving British forces for other duties.
The Government agreed some weeks ago to a
request of the United Kingdom Government
that Canadian troops should assist in the
defence of Iceland. The first contingent of a
Canadian expeditionary force have already
landed in Iceland. Further units have been
detailed and will follow shortly. I need hardly
point out the strategie importance, not only
to the security of the north Atlantic sea lanes,
but to the defence of this continent, of maintaining control of Iceland.
It will be observed that Canadian troops have
been and are still being sent to the West
Indies and to Iceland to leplace British contingents which are returning for the defence
of Great Britain.
The increased seriousness of the military
situation abroad and the marked expansion of
all three branches of our armed services in
Canada have served to arouse widespread
interest and concern throughout the country
regarding the raising and training of recruits.
. . Additional measures are proposed in connection with the recruitment of Canada's armed
forces. . . . So far as man-power is concerned,
it will relate solely and exclusively to the
defence of Canada on our own soil, and in
our own territorial waters. It will enable the
Government to make the most efficient use of
our man-power for the varied needs of modern
machine warfare. It is of the utmost importance to realize that success in war to-day
depends upon the use of men for the kind of
work tor which they are best fitted. The armed
forces are only a part of the essential equipment

of war. The skilled worker in the factory, the
transport worker and the farmer, to mention
only a few, are as essential to the effective
prosecution of war as the soldier, the sailor and
the airman.
Mobilization of our resources will not, however, be confined to requiring the services of
men and women. The Government will have
power under the provisions of the Bill equally
to call property and wealth, material resources
and industry to the defence of Canada.
The Bill is intended to remove any doubt
as to the power of the Government and the will
of Parliament that the whole material resources
of the country should be available whenever
they are required to meet the needs of the war.
The operation of the measure will be confined to the period of the war.
Recruitment for service overseas will be
maintained on a voluntary basis. No difficulty
has been experienced and no difficulty is anticipated in raising by the volunteer system all
the men required for service outside Canada. . . .
A complete inventory of Canada's manpower
and other resources, properly classified, affords
a necessary basis for some of the further
essential measures of home security and defence,
which I have announced. A national registration of Canada's manpower will accordingly be
instituted at once.

.

.

.

This will have the

following immediate advantages:
The national registration will constitute an
additional precaution against "fifth column"
activities such as sabotage and espionage, whicb
conceivably might become more menacing as
external threats grow more serions. In this
way it will add to our internal security.
National registration will also provide the
Government with an inventory of the mechanical
and industrial skill of our population. Such
an inventory will prove valuable in affording
additional information on the extent of our
resources of skilled labour which can be drawn
upon to meet the needs of essential wartime
industries. It will also show the directions in
which intensive industrial and technical training is most urgently needed to provide an
adequate supply of labour to meet the growing
demands of our war industries and other essential services.
I should like here to express the warm appreciation of the Government of the valuable work
already accomplished through the voluntary
registration of women, undertaken as a spontaneous contribution to the development of
Canadian efficiency in wartime. The fullest use
will be made of the results of the register now
being completed.
It is the intention of the Government also to
establish without delay a new department of
government to be known as the Department of
National War Services, to be presided over by
a Minister of the Crown.
I find in looking over the statement of the
Acting Minister of Defence, which followed
the remarks of the Prime Minister, that
recruits are now being enlisted at the rate of
approximately 800 a day, and yesterday, I
think, I saw the figure had gone beyond 1,200.
The whole situation with regard to recruiting
these troops has been reviewed over the weekend, and instructions have been issued for
the purpose of intensifying activity.
I now await the first reading of the Bill.

SENATE

196
FIRST READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, a message has been received from
the House of Commons with Bill 43, an Act
to confer certain powers upon the Governor
in Council for the mobilization of national
resources in the present war.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the Senate, I move the second reading of
the Bill, seconded by the Right Hon. Mr.
Graham.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, this measure is one of the
most mornentous and at the same time one of
the most extraordinary ever presented to
Parliament. It bears a euphonious and inoffensive title-which I doubt not was
chosen-"The
skilfully
and
cautiously
National Resources Mobilization Act, 1940."
As all of us know, this is a measure for the
conscription of men, money and material for
the war.
The Bill brings to me many memories, and
I know the memories it summons back are
indeed poignant to members of the present
Administration, particularly to those who
have long been associated with our public
life.
I take definite and positive exception
to the form and character of the Bill which
this Government now presents, and for
which it seeks the approval of Parliament. I
am not in accord with the scope of the
measure. But I do not intend to oppose it.
I am going to support it. With its principle
I am in the fullest accord; with its object I
am in complete agreement, and I do not propose even to move to amend it to a fori in
which I most earnestly think it should be.
The House may be surprised that I do not
ask that the Bill be put into such more ample
form and be made to contain such provisions
as I say, with all the force that is in me, it
ought to be in and ought to contain. Under
ordinary conditions it would be easy, and certainly justifiable, to move that the Bill be
not now read a second time, but that it be
amended in such a way as to lay down principles upon which this tremendous enterprise
shall be operated-to provide that Parliament
shall decide on what conditions, with what
safeguards and by what machinery of administration the liberty of the subject is to be so
relentlessly invaded as it is by this measure.
That duty is the proper, the predestined funetion of Parliament.
I do not move an amendment, for this
reason. Assuming that it would be passed in
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

this House-and I have no cause to think
it would not be, for it would be a proper and
right step to take-we have to consider where
We should have a

very
in a

properly
measure
important feature, but a measure which I
know from what bas occurred lately in the
other Chamber would not be accepted by
Government and the Government's
the
majority in that Chamber. Consequently,
nothing but delay and perhaps an unnecessary
measure of friction would result. I am therefore going to content myself with lodging my
distinct and most vigorous protest against the
form of this legislation, and with giving my
reasons therefor.
First, though, I ask honourable members to
consider the primary object of this Bill, its
scope, and its consistency. The Bill provides
that the persons of all Canadians shall be
placed without reservation at the disposal of
the Government of the day for such duties as
that Government may assign to them. Though
much has just been read about allocating
men to this function and to that, any allocation apart from allocation to our armed forces,
in the air, on water and on land, amounts to
little or nothing. Once assignment to the
armed forces has been effected, further allocation follows of itself. Give industry work to
do-planes, tanks, munitions to produce; refuse
to take into the army men who cannot be
spared from specific industries, and those not
taken will find their places in those specific
industries. Similarly women will find their
places when work is there to be donc. Though
we talk a lot about putting this man here
and that man there, and the real object of
the measure is somewhat confused thereby,
the one purpose that amounts to anything is
to sec that we do not fail in our military
duty, the imperious demand of this hour.
The Bill provides that men can be conscripted for service in our armed forces throughout the Dominion, but it adds that no one
upon whose shoulders the Government places
its hand can, after be is required to join,
be sent out of Canada or beyond the
three-mile limit. I am a thousand per cent
in agreement with the idea that we should
use common sense in the gathering of oui
armed forces. To leave this major duty of a
citizen to pure caprice in the day of the
nation's peril is the veriest folly and nonsense.
The Bill in this essential principle is right.
But the Government, in limiting its application to the defence of Canada, provides that
conscripted men stay in Canada. If they fight
by sea and pursue an enemy, they stop at the
three-mile limit. They then come back, and
volunteers must be found to take up the chase.

JUNE 20, 1940
Now, I ask. what other defence is there but
defence of Canada?
Some Hon. SENATORS: ilear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Have we up
to now been defending some other people
and flot ourselves? Is this country content
that its sons be compelled to engage in any
defence so long as we know it is not a defence
of maximum value to the Dominion? Do we
go through the hollow mockery of saying that
we have been unselfish idealists in sending
our soldiers ta the help of Britain and of lier
Allies in France? Why flot be honest and
say we sent themn there because there we
defended Canada best, because that was our
first line, and ought to have been our safest
line? Are flot the men whom we now send
to England going there in the defence of
Canada? There is no one in this Chamber
who does not know that at this hour, and at
every hour up to now, the way best to secure
the defence of Canada is and bas been to
strengtben the Allied line.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And there
is no one who knows it better than do the
members of the Governmaent; there is no one
who knows it better than does the Prime
Minister. The Prime Minister told us only a
few days ago that we should not wait until the
eLlemly reached here, but we should go out
and defeat him. He said:
The way to nieet an aeroplane or sulimarine
attack is flot to wait until the enemy reaches
your shores, but to go ont andi meet him and
try to prevent him from ever reaching your
shores.
Every common-sense person agrees. That is
what we have been doing. And I wonder if
there is anybody who says that service where
it can be of greatesi. effect is of less importance
to our country than is service where it can
be of least effeet.
But the restraints the Government feel themselves under bring the.m within the narrow,
inconsistent terms of this Bill. That narrowness and that inconsistency resuit fram an
attempt ta fit the policy of the present into
the contortions of the tragic past.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Everyone
in this House 'knows the truth of that statement just as he knows bis name. The honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand,) read a few moments ago a speech
which came originally from the lips of the
Prime Minister, and in which it was said
there had been no difficulty whatever in
obtaining plenty of volunteers for service
overseas. I do not dispute the correctness

197

of that assertion.

But the numbers required
were meagre, and the reason for their heing
Ineagre we ail know. We came into thus
confiet utterly unprepared, althougli we had
abundant notice. We were leisurely and slow
in getting equiprnent and b.ecoming pre.pared.
So we could not absorb the men. That is the
mo-st generous interpretation to put upon our
conduct up to now. That we have had enough
men ta answer the caîl for overseas service
is, I suppose, correct, within the narrow limita
of that caîl.
I do not, however, follow the logic of the
contention that compulsion is not necessary to
get men to fight outside the country, but
that we m*ust apply compulsion ta get them
ta fight inside the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
far more services than that.

And ta cover

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The intent
cannot be confused in that way. The object
of tbe Bîill is to implement tbe necessitien
of the army, navy and air force. You will
neyer need ta compel men to work for wageu.
You cannot do so if you try. After you have
got your *military, your air and your naval
requirements attendced to, the allocation of
those lef t to other spheres wiil foilow automatically. So the position the Government
find themselves in is illogical, and this makes
it necessary for tb.em to propose to us the
most preposterous of reasoning. Who would
suggest that the sons of Canada are more
ready to fight in Europe than they are ta
flght in this country? But that is what the
Government are com.pelled to say. We are
told there are plenty of men wbo are volunteering to figlit overseas-that no compulsion
is necessary to get tbem for averseas service.
How then can it be suggested to sensible
people that if the sons of Canada are tharoughly ready to go overseas to figlit for this
nation, they are not also ready without compulsion to figlit witbin our own damain?
The Government 'know that this hour je oa
dark that black clouds are hoverîng over the
hilis of this nation, and they know they cannat
depend long on hazard or caprice of any kind.
That is why they are before us with this
measure. But implicit in the m'easure is the
iliogical character of the whole policy; and
through it can be seen clearly. as through a
glass, the tragic record of the past.
Weli, here it is. I will not stand in the
way of any steps, however vigorous, being
taken by the Government. Not only will
1 not stand in the way, but I will help the
Government in every manner witbin my
power. And 1 have belped them. I do not

JUNE 20, 1940
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It has been.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It has been?
This Bill follows it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill carried
in the other House by, I think, a vote of
156 to 2.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It will be
carried here-unanimously. But that does
not change the character of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it affirms the
principle of the authority of Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am going
to vote for the Bill, but that does not affect
the nature of the measure. The Government
should submit to Parliament. for Parliament's
review and decision, all these vital principles
and the whole scheme of operation. Cannot
the Government prepare such a measure?
They should be able to do so in half a day.
They would not have one-tenth of the work
we had to perform when the ground had to be
pioneered twenty-thrëe years ago. We now
have the precedents of the British laws of
twenty-four years ago and of to-day. We have
the precedent of our own law of 1917. No doubt
it could be improved upon. A measure thus
framed should be submitted to Parliament.
Parliament should review it and decide
whether the safeguards thus proposed are fair
and right, whether the principles of application are right, whether the classification is
right, what classification should be called first,
what second, third, fourth, fifth and tenth. This
is the business of Parliament, and this business
we are forbidden to enter into. The Government demand that we vote them authority to
do these things in their own majestic way. I
protested about this yesterday to a member
of the Government-a member well known
to the leader of this House. " Oh," he said,
" we will do all that, and we will tell you
about it afterwards." That Minister frankly
told the truth. Such is the purpose of the
Administration, the purpose printed right here.
Orders in Council are to do what Parliament
alone should do.
We have sat now for some weeks and
have tried to do our best with the measures
before us. What kind of measures have we
had? Just petty peanut legislation-amendments to the Yukon Act, amendments to the
Northwest Territories Act, recurrence of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, something about agricultural products-just legislative chicken-feed, as everyone in this House
knows. But when there is something of
consequence to which we could address ourselves, something than which there has never
been anything of more consequence in Canada

199

for a quarter of a century, the Government
say: " We have not time to prepare it. We
want you to give us a blanket authority, and
we will pass the real legislation by Order in
Council." I tell them it is just as easy to
prepare for Parliament as to prepare for the
Governor in Council. It does not take a
moment longer to draft and submit legislation
than it does to draft it and pass it by the
Governor in Council.
Why, then, is Parliament affronted? Why,
then, are this Government asking for something in relation to the liberty of the subject
such as has never been asked for in any
Parliament of Britain, in any Parliament of
this Dominion, or in any Parliament of any
other British Dominion? I protest against
the denial of parliamentary rights embedded
in this legislation, and I warn the country
against the application of this law, inasmuch
as the whole application of it and the
principles governing such application are torn
from the hands of the people's representatives
and gathered under the wing of a party
Administration.
Now I have made my protest. To the extent
this Bill goes, notwithstanding its abhorrent
features, I will support it. There is no use
in moving amendments; they would only cause
delay. I would rather have this Bill than
nothing. But from the indictment I lay
against the Administration I venture to say
there is no escape in the minds of honourable
members, and I am certain there will be no
escape in the minds of the people of Canada.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable senators, is on the second reading
of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have looked
around to sec if any other members desire
to speak. If not, I will close the debate in a
few words.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Is it the intention of the
Administration to call men to the colours in
the near future, to enlist them under this
proposed legislation?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is a distinguished member of the Bar.
He has read this Bill and therefore knows the
powers vested in the Government, and I
cannot understand why he should put such a
question.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It is because I have some
legal understanding that I can read the Bill.
It vests the Government with authority to
conscript men. My question is: Is it the
intention of the Government to use that
authority soon?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Soon?

the necessary authority.

the

Hon. Mr. COTE: Is it the intention of the
Government to act when the Bill is passed?

When does
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
Government intend to act?
An Hon. SENATOR:

In the next war!

My honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend apparently has not read clause 2:
Subject to the provisions of section three
hereof, the Governor in Counîcil may do and
authorize such acts and things, and make from
time to time such orders and regulations,
requiring persons to place themselves, their
services and their property at the disposal of
Ris Majesty in the right of Canada, as may be
deemed necessary or expedient for securing the
public safety, the defence of Canada, the maintenance of public order, or the efficient prosecution of the war, or for maintaining supplies
or services essential to the life of the
community.
He desires to know in what manner and at
what time these powers will be exercised.
They will be exercised as the Government finds
it convenient and imperative to exercise them,
and it will do so as it would have done withont the passing of a Bill-for the protection of
Canada. I would draw attention to the fact
that under our militia law men can be called
to the colours for the defence of Canada. I
remember the Borden Government hesitated
to utilize this authority to organize military
expeditions for service abroad, and I believe
that it obtained specific powers for that purpose in order to make sure it was not violating
the Militia Act. We have always had embodied in our law authority for the Government to raise men for the defence of Canada.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) says, " But where does that
defence of Canada begin, and where does it
end?" We know very well we are fighting
the battle of the commonwealth of nations,
including nations who are not active. I am
surprised to hear speeches as to Canada's duty
in this war without hearing that Canada is
leading in every movement that goes to help
Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Is that intended to be a
reply to my question? My question does not
relate to the exercise of all these powers,
but is simply this: In view of the special and
great emergency, the existence of which we in
Canada recognize, is it the intention of the
Administration to conscript men for the
defence of Canada? And, if so, when will it
be done?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is for the
Governor in Council to pronounce and fix that
date. He has not acted on a Bill not yet
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is somewhat
of an insuit to the Government of the day to
ask it if it intends to utilize the powers it is
seeking from Parliament.
Hon. Mr. COTE: May I interrupt to say
that I had no intention of offering any insult.
I did not ask whether it intended ever to
use this Bill. If such were my question, it
would be insulting. My question was: " How
soon does the Government intend to call the
soldiers to the colours?"
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend should explain what he means by
"How soon."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it a question
of a few hours or a few days?
Hon. Mr. COTE: Yes. Is it a matter of
days or weeks or months? That is what
I mean.
The GovernHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
nient will act according to the best interest of
Canada and the defence of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Then I take it that the
Government has not yet decided what are the
best interests of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend cannot put that question to me. The
Government of Canada bas approved of this
Bill, and in the statement of the Prime
Minister, which preceded the Bill and is a
preamble to it, honourable gentlemen will
find the intentions of the Government.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All we are
asking is a question as to time. Does the
Government intend to exercise the power to
conscript as soon as the Bill is passed? Or
does it not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Government
will act as soon as it feels that it is important
to do so.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Government says it is very important now; that
there is an emergency, a special emergency.
Does the Government say it will act as soon
as the Bill is passed?

JUNE 20, 1940
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Government is charged with the responsibility of
defendixig the country, and it has adopted this
legisiation in order to do so. My answer is
that it will do so in due time.
Sonie Han. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Surely, when we
consider the circumstances under which, we are
called upon to pass this Bill, and the urgent
request of the Prime Mmnister for speed in
the other House, the Government should be
prepared to make a statement, afficially and
openly, as to its intentions in reference

We are asked to-night to put through the

it is urgent.

the question?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. The Government
shou]d flot have any hesitation in answering.
Why should there be any quibbling?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
presume I have the right to ask a question
of the honourable 'leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand). Orders in Council passed
under this BiH are to be tabled forthwith if
Parliament is sitting, and any passed while
Parliament is prorogued are to be tabled at
the next session. How are we to know the
terms of any of these Orders in Council
issued during parliamentary recesses? Suppose Parliament prorogues on the first of
August and the following day an Order in
Council calls ai1 men between the ages of
twenty-one and twenty-four to the colours,
how wiH the men concerned find out about
that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Order in
Council would be published in the Canada
Gazette. Any such Order which concerns the
people at large will be given wide publicity,
so that everyone concerned will have notice
of it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: All the Orders in Council
will be immediately published in the Canada
Gazette?
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: An amendment
was made to the Bill in the other House.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have not got the amendment.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: It has not reached
here yet.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Then, I cannot consider
the Bill yet. I want to know what the
amendment is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section 5 of
the Bill was amended in the other House to
read as follows:
Every order or regulation passed under the
authority of this Act shall be tabled in Parliament forthwith if Parliament is in session, and
a copy thereof sent to every member of the
House of Commons and of the Senate, and if
Parliament is not in session, then every such
order or regulation shall be forthwith published

worthless.

Mr.

MEIGHEN:

Utterly

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I want to ask another
question, and I shall be satisfied if the
honourable leader answers with a "Yes" or
"No."
We have been told that there is
urgent need for this measure. In the calling
up of men, will the Military Service Act
classifications be followed?
Has any consideration been given to that?

203

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This will be
carried on by regulations embodied in Orders
in Council.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am afraid my honourablè friend does not appreciate my question.
Has any consideration been given -to what
classes will be set out in the regulations?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot answer
without having further information. Of course,
classes within certain ages will be called up
as necessity arises. I suppose the first class
will cover men of twenty-one years of age.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is it the intention of the
Government to set out in the regulations the
various classifications? As I remember the
Act of 1917, class No. 1 included men from
twenty up to twenty-seven years of age, unmarried; class 2, men from twenty-seven to
thirty-three, unmarried; class 3, men from
twenty to twenty-seven, married, without
children, and so on.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no doubt
such classes will be defined.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is it the intention of the
Government after the classes are definedHon. Mr. DUFF: I rise to a point of
order. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Haig)
is very punctilious in endeavouring to call
other members to order. I submit his questions are entirely out of order. We are now
on the motion for second reading of this Bill.
If any senator desires to make a speech, he
is free to do so; but no member has the right
to cross-question the leader of the Government. Questions are permissible only when the
Bill is in Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But we do not
intend to go into Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I ask you to rule, Mr.
Speaker, that the honourable the junior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) is out
of order.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On a point
of order I always defer to the honourable
member from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff).
This time he is quite right. Now I put it to
the honourable leader opposite. If he prefers
not to answer questions until we get into committee, I shall be quite satisfied.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Colonel Ralston's speech.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This evidently is
part of that "phoney" translation referred to
in anather place as incorrect.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I gave the
French version.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 would draw
my right honourable friend's attention to the
danger of taking a phrase from a speech and
treating it as related to a declaration which
bears entirely on other matters. I simply read
the part which precedes the citation my right
honourable friend gave.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I translate:
It has been said that the measure will cause
nervousness and may occasion precipitate action
born of lack of reflection by those who possess
eavings of eue sort or the other. In my opinion
those who think se do net take into acceunt the
stamina and courage of Canadians, and in order
ta appease al] such nervousnessHe goes on to say:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The bonourable gentleman has read enaugh, and if the
leader of the Government will give the assurance that the words had na application ta
the powers of this Bill in respect of the

which was preceded by a statement of Han.

to allay any fear an the part of people with
savings in aur institutions, and ta dissuade

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Na, no. The

honourable friend has cîted.
On a prétendu que la mesure causera de la
nervosité et pourra occasionner des actes précipité,s et irréfléchis chez ceux qui possèdent

"It has been said it will create nervousness
and excitement among those who have savings
of one kind or another. To my mind no
accaunt has heen taken of the courage and
constancy of aur Canadians." 1 say that the
phrase which followed, and *which waa read

have just read.

ten or fifteen minute speech of which he has
furnished me a copy, that would be something
different.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I want the
honourable member to give us an assurance,
or else to say he cannot give it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I gave my right
honourable friend an assurance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That it does
not refer toHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, that it
does not refer to the matter in my right
honourable friend's mind.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I accept that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In fact, I heard
that the Minister of Justice simply copied
part of the speech delivered by Mr. Ralston
five minutes before. And the remark was
made, "Undoubtedly we said the same thing,
because we had the same idea in mind"which was to allay the fear of people who
might withdraw their savings.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It might be
of use to add to the assurance Mr. Ralston
gave. I feel that he is absolutely right. It
is absolute foolishness for people to be withdrawing funds because of the measure. I
think the assurance as given by the Minister
of Finance will be accepted throughout the
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am very glad
the right honourable gentleman makes that
statement, because I am receiving letters daily
from various parts of the country stating that
people fear that money which they have in
the banks will be taken by the Government.
If they will only wait until to-norrow for the
budget speech they will see how the Government can levy money, and perhaps they will
realize how much people are contributing
towards the cost of the war.
I intended following the remarks made by
my right honourable friend in this Chamber.
I want ta tell him that these powers will be
exercised with necessary prudence and tact,
and that the young men will be called as
the country needs them. And they will answer
the call.
My right honourable friend has mentioned
1917. This is not a time to discuss 1917. I
will discuss that question with the right honourable gentleman at leisure, when we can
deal with the events of 1917 academically
and historically. I draw his attention to the
fact that the people of Canada cannot lose
sight of the fact that the Conscription Act
of 1917 created turmoil in the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That was
because it was opposed. This Act will not
be opposed. That is the difference.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

1940 is not 1917.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is much
worse.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

We went to the

province of Quebec and succeeded in ousting
a Government that showed no inclination to
participate in this war, and only yesterday,
by a vote of 56 to 13, the Legislature of
that province stood up for this measure. So
my right honourable friend will understand
that there is something in a change of method;
that the situation of 1940 is attributable to
two men and that credit must be given to
them for bringing about unity in this country
at this moment. Their names are Mackenzie
King and Ernest Lapointe.
With these few broken remarks-for I have
not been able to follow the objections my
right honourable friend presented-and in the
hope of having this Bill sanctioned by the
new Governor General, who is to be sworn
in at noon to-morrow, I move the second
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the Senate, I move the third reading of the
Bill.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Earl of Athlone, will come to the Senate
Chanber at noon to-morrow to be sworn in

that as many senators as can do so will be
present at the ceremony. It is the Government's hope that afterwards His Excellency
will be pleased to give Royal Assent to the

Bill we have just passed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I suggest to the honourable leader that after tomorrow's formalities are over he permit us

to return to our business?

All that Parlia-

ment is for is denied to Parliament. Why
keep us here to deal with trilles light as air,
simply to make monkeys of the members of

JUNE 20, 1940
this House? The Government do all that
is of any consequence and ask us to fuss over
little things, no bigger than pebbles.
Hon. Mr. KING: We are at war.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend is hardly justified in speaking
as he has done. He knows that the War
Measures Act is in force. For a number of
years he proceeded under the War Measures
ActRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We had that
Act in 1917, but the Government of that day
did not ignore Parliament. When Parliament
was sitting they brought everything before it.
Witness the Act I have here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend allow me to correct him?
The War Measures Act was passed in 1914,
not in 1917.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But we had
it in 1917. Under it, the then Government
need not have passed the Military Service
Act, but they brought that measure before
Parliament. They submitted every detail to
Parliament when it was in session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Some day we
may cross swords over what the Government
did in 1917, but I do not think this is the
proper moment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There never
will be one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am quite sure
that we shall sit long enough in this Chamber
during the present session, perhaps too long,
but for most of the bills that are to come
before us we must await action by the other
House, composed of 245 members. I believe
we have already passed measures that were
worthy of the Senate's closest study, and I am
sure my right honourable friend will find
much meat in a number of others that we
shall receive from time to time.

have asked the Government for a statement
of facts on some matter of real importance,

member asking a question is promised consideration in the hripe that later on hie may
forget ail about his inquiry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I xnay relieve
my right honourable friend of ,the necessity
of repeating ail the questions, by telling him
that I have the promise of the head of the
Transport Department, Hon. Mr. Howe, that
hoe will tell nie the number of Bren guins at
preserit hoing distributed, and the rate at
xvhieh they are being turned out. I expected
to reeeive that information last Thursday.
I did flot see my colleague in Council to-day,
but I shall try to have the information
to-foirrOW.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: AIl that I
have asked for is the number deliverod complote to the Government to date. From this

Haig) we constantly receive inaterial skilfuhly

strange that we are unable to get it here in
the course of one or two weeks.
Another niatter, which I asked about on
two occasions, was the Government's policy
with roapert to refugeos or children or
others who, with the approval of their respective governrnonts, soughit to corne to Canada
from Great Britain-or, as I put it in the
first instance, fromn Great Britain and France
-to make a home here during the war. I
cannot get an answer on that subject, or at
least none has been given te me yet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a statement on my table, but I did net think there
was anv cause te bring it to the Sonate.
However, I shalh do se.

JUNE 24, 1940
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, I asked
the question in the Senate in order that the
information might be given to the House.
My third question was with respect to
American publications, two particularly, one
a newspaper and the other a periodical. On
this subject also -I inquired twice, but on the
second occasion I was advised there was some
consideration affecting the desire of the
United States Government. I would be the
last to embarrass the Government if there was
anything of that nature. But there cannot
be any embarrassment in telling us what
our Government desire donc; nor can I think
that the United States Government would ask
the Canadian Government to tolerate the
circulation in Canada of certain literature
merely because it originated in the United
States, whereas, if it originated here, it would
be banned at once.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, there is no
such idea. I very likely did not express
myself as clearly as I should have done the
last time my right honourable friend asked
about this. I think I informed him that there
was a political and psychological aspect to
the question of permitting or prohibiting entry
of these two publications. And I added that
when I -had information I would communicate
it privately to my right honourable friend. I
am in a position to do that now, and shall do
so before the night is over. We shall be
attending a committee meeting after the
Senate rises, and I shall then inform my right
honourable friend what view the Government
take on this matter.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I wonder if the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand> could
tell the House what the circulation of the
Chicago Tribune in Canada is. I have never
seen it on sale on any news-stand, but there
may be some sale for it in the West. I have
been looking over the thing lately, and I
quite agree with what my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) said about
it. There are one or two papers published
right in Ontario that could be added to the
two American publications that have been
mentioned. These Canadian papers, whose
evident purpose is to create pessimism and
despair in the minds of our people, have a
circulation in our country far beyond that
of the Chicago Tribune.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Has the Chicago
Tribune not changed its attitude entirely, so
far as Great Britain and Canada are concerned?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I believe
there has been an improvement in the attitude
of the Chicago Tribune.

209

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: My authority is the
Ottawa Journal. I saw an article in the
Journal commending the Chicago Tribune for
its efforts.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:
Chicago News?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Was that not the
No; the Tribune.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have not
seen that article. I should think it is a little
premature. The improvement could go a long
way.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes, there is room for
improvement.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I do not
know what the Chicago Tribune's circulation
in Canada is, but it is not small, by any
means. Of course, it does not compare with
the circulation of the Saturday Evening Post,
which is very large. If papers of the same
character are published in Ontario, I am grateful to say that they have not yet reached me,
and I have not been in any way contaminated
by them.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I do not say they are
of the same character, but they produce
practically the same results.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The Chicago Tribune
is carried by the news service of both railways
across Canada, and has quite a sale on newsstands in the West.

Prayers and routine proceedings.
WAR CO-OPERATION
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN presented the first
report of the Special Committee on War
Co-operation.
The Special Committee on War Co-operation
beg leave to make their first report, as follows:
1. The War Co-operation Committee was
appointed by resolution of the Senate, passed
on June 4, 1940, reading as follows:
"That a committee selected by the leaders of
the Senate be constituted for the purpose of
advising how best the members of this House
can help the country in its war effort."
2. Your committee have held four meetings
and reviewed together various lines upon which
it was thought members of the Senate might be
able to contribute to what are now vital and
pressing war objectives.
3. It is the unanimous view of your committee
that the efforts of honourable members of this
bouse should be directed toward bringing about
in Canada a much more general, and, if possible,
universal, appreciation of the peril Canada, as
Canada, is in; of the indescribable catastrophe
defeat would bring to each and all of the people
of our country, and of the immediate, imperative
need that every citizen, young or old, become
animated and possessed by a sense of duty and
of sacrifice to the end that we may ensure the
preservation of our institutions and of our
nation.
4. It was recognized on the part of al members of the committee that such conviction is
now held by the vast majority of Canadians,
but that there are some of our population in
all the provinces still more or less indifferent;
others (small in numbers) more or less dangerous, and very many without any adequate comprehension of the stark realities of this hour.
5. At our various meetings, earnest consideration was given to means of remedying the
situation described, and the agencies which
might be availed of for this purpose by honourable members of this House individually, and,
as well, in some organized form. These agencies
clearly are:
(a) The press-daily, wcekly and periodical;
(b) The radio;
(c) The news reel and theatre;
(d) The platform.
THE PRESS

6. It was recognized that tremendous service
bas already been given by the press of Canada,
and the entire committee were confident that
the newspapers of the Dominion, both daily
and weekly, and, as well, periodicals and
magazines would co-operate with every desire
of the committee and with the efforts of honourable senators to make still more impressive and
complote the service already rendered.

JUNE 25, 1940
7. In this connection evidence at some length
was given by Messrs. Lash and Melançon, the
two heads of the Government Bureau of Public
Information. It was impressed upon these men
that what, in the judgment of the committee,
was required in the way of news service was
chiefly the presentation of such facts and the
driving home of such simple, understandable
arguments as would make everyone realize the
seriousness of the present danger to our country
and all its inhabitants, and the immediate
necessity for each man and woman so ordering
bis or her work and daily contacts and conversations as to aid the nation to the utmost
in its efforts.
The witnesses expressed the
utmost confidence from past experience that
any suitable and readable material provided
the press by honourable senators would b.
gladly welcomed.
RADIO
8. Mr. Gladstone Murray, General Manager
of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, was
heard by your committee. The same views as
to the immediate steps necessary to reach the
overwhelming objective now to be kept in mind
were pressed on Mr. Murray. In these representations Mr. Murray immediately and wholeheartedly acquiesced. He expressed the entire
willingness of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to place its facilities at the disposal
of such speakers as might be carefully chosen
for Dominion broadcasts and for local broadcasts, and earnestly welcomed the suggestion
that your committee should assist in naming
impressive speakers and gaining their consent
to co-operate in a Canadian-wide appeal through
the radio for a universal call to duty. Mr.
Murray was convinced that a very well organized information campaign through the radio
would have excellent effect.
9. Your committee have arranged to co-operate
to the fullest to help in this programme, and
ask honourable members of the Senate to make
themselves available where and when called
upon for the purpose thereof. It is your conmittee's confident belief that independent broadcasting stations will also loyally assist to
this end.
NEWS REEL

10. Mr. Grierson, of the Government Motion
Picture Bureau, appeared before your committee
and told of the efforts of bis organization to
assist in attaining the objectives your committee have in mind by means of news reel
presentations. The members of the committee
were much imressed by Mr. Grierson's account
of the Bureau s activities and by the character
of the work being done. Suggestions were made
to him and were welcomed by him as to other
efforts that might be exerted.
THE PLATFORM

11. Under this heading it was the belief of
your committee that members of 'the Senate
might be most generally useful. The avenues
of approach to the public vary in the different
provinces. It was represented to your committee that in most of the provinces service
clubs are generally available, but that, unfortunately, in the two summer months, July and
August, such service clubs are usually dormant.
It was hoped, however, under the very extraordinary circumstances of this year, their officers
might be glad, as a public service, to make these
clubs .atailable as mediums of reaching the,
public. This applies to Canadian Clubs and
95832-14J

211

other like organizations. Your committee feel
that all these can be of help in a campaign of
this kind and that such campaign should include
public meetings, on a wide scale, to be addressed
by as carefully selected a group of speakers as
can possibly be made available. The members
of the committee are making recommendations
to perfect arrangements throughout Canada and
most earnestly we invite prominent and effective
public speakers to belp, and stand ready to help,
in the immediate execution of this task. We
are certain that honourable members of the
Senate will be glad to do their part, where
possible, and to continue such activity at every
available opportunity.
12. We.urge particularly that the public b.
aroused to the great danger facing this country
and discouraging any tendency to trifle with a
great crisis; that disaffected elements everywhere be made to understand that a democracy
in a crisis can act with all the authority that
must appertain to a nation, and on the principle that be who is not with us is against us.
A thoroughly aroused and resolute public will
tolerate no encumbrances in a great emergency
such as this. A vigilant public can contribute
much to make the heavy task of government
efficient, and the cause of the nation triumphant.
13. Your committee
propose, with the
approval of the Senate, to continue to function
for the purpose of ensuring, so far as they can,
the carrying on and intensification of the work
outlined above.
All which is respectfully submitted.
C. P. Beaubien,
Chairman.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, with the consent of the Senate, I move
that this report be taken into consideration
now,
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I should hope that
my honourable friend would give us an
opportunity to read and study the report
before we pass judgment upon it.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: The committee
are very desirous of having the co-operation
of every honourable member. I consider the
matter urgent, but if it would be helpful to
postpone consideration of the report until tomorrow, I shall be glad to defer to the honourable gentleman's suggestion. I therefore move
that the report be taken into consideration
to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to.
(Translation)
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: In connection with the
report presented by the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. C. P. Beaubien), I
should like to know whether copies have been
made available to the members of the Senate.
If not, I would ask that consideration of the
report be deferred.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the
honourable senator be satisfied if the report
were printed in to-day's Hansard?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. SAUVE: To be taken into consideration on Thursday?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Debates
will be distributed to the senators to-morrow
morning.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: If no copies are available
for examination before the sitting, I would
ask that consideration of the report be
deferred.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
senators who wish to do se will be able to read
the report in Hansard, but I think that the
chairman of the committee can supply my
honourable friend with a copy.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I ask that the report
be taken into consideration on Thursday.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN (Text): Honourable senators, as I have already said, I think
it is the opinion of every member of the committee that this report should be considered
and adopted with the least possible delay.
However, I recognize the right of every member to criticize the report. I will sec that my
honourable colleague here (Hon. Mr. Sauvé)
is furnished the French version of the report
within an hour. This will give him ample
opportunity to study the report, but if
to-morrow he feels that he requires further
time to digest its contents, I shall net press
my motion. I hope, however, that we shall
bu able te proceed to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: As it would be out
of order to postpone what has already been
decided, I would suggest that my honourable
friend defer further action until the motion
is before us to-morrow.

NATIONAL REGISTRATION OF WOMEN
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. IVA CAMPBELL FALLIS: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day
are called, may I ask the indulgence of the
louse for a few minutes? It may be that

JUNE 25, 1940
the remarks which 1 have in mind would have
been more appropriately made during the
discussion of Bill 43, but, as the circumstances
in which that Bill came before us necessitated
its hurried passage, the bonourable leader of
the Government in this flouse (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) intirnated to me that I might
reserve my remarks for an occasion sucli as
this. So, with the consent of the House, I
sbould like to avail myscîf of the opportunity
now.
On May 2, 1939, 1 rose in this flouse to tell
honourable members of a project which was
being discussed by a group of Canjadian
women and which had for its objective the
furnishing of a channel through which. Canadian women might register their specifie
training and qualifications, with a view to
determining wbat service they could best
render to their country in times of national
emergency. As that emiergency is now closing
in upon us, and as the Government of the day
bas declared for compulsory registration of
the man and woman power of Canada, I
should like to give a summary of what our
committee bas accomplished, and the use to
which the information obtained is being put
at the present time.
I would preface that summary by expressing
the grateful thanks of the committee to those
honourable senators who from the beginning
gave sympathetic understanding and, later,
moral and financial assistance. 0f these none
was more consistently belpful than that great
Canadian and ardent Imperialist who bas since
passed away, the late flonourable Senator
Lynch-Staunton, of Hamilton.
May I empliasize, what I stated last year,
that we did not proceed to form a new organization. We were merely setting up a committee
composed of outstanding women from existing
national women's organizations, a committee
formed to achieve a definite objective and then
to disband. That objective was to secure information and to tabulate it properly, se that it
might be used by the Government and by ail
erganizations in Canada doing war work.
We covered fairly well Ontario, British
Columbia and the Western Provinces. We did
some work in Quebec and in the Maritime
Provinces, but that work, particularly in Prince
Edward Island, was interrupted by severe
winter weather, and when spring came conditions overseas had become se serious that
we decided to tabulate the information already
received in order to have it ready for use in
case of emergency. The information was ohtained 'by means of a questionnaire containing twenty-eight questions. The answers to
these questions gave us specific information
as to the training and qualifications of the
women who registered. A survey of that

213

information to-day reveals that there are in
this country thousands of Canadian women
in evcry lina of work who stand ready andwhat is perhaps a great deal more importantqualified to take tbeir place in the agricultural, industrial or economic life of Canada
whenever the necessity arises
ln the tabulation of that information we
made use of the most modemn system of cardindexing-the same system, I may add, as
is to-day used extensively in the British War
Dulct

cards were made out, one to be

retained at National Headquarters, the other
to lie returned to the province from
which the registration came. In addition, the
Dominion Government furnished its own cards,
upon which it asked us to list the names of
women who were in certain lines of work.
Our registrations to date are approximately
250,000. We have sent to the Dominion
Government lists of over 100,000 names of
women who are skilled in specific lines; that
is, munition workers, textile and garment
workers, dieticians, nurses, clerical help-in
fact, women trained along almost every line
of activity.
While it would be most unfair to make
comparisons between the results froma the
different provinces, we could not help being
impressed with the registrations which came
to us from British Columbia and Alberta,
especially those of women of British birth
who bad been in the Old Country during the
last war. They registered the training they
had received and the experience they had
gained in the Old Land, and expressed their
readiness to place their training and experience at our disposaI. It was a revelation to
every member of our committee, and I sincerely wish that every honourable senator
and soe of the leaders in the economie life
of this country would read the answers of
those wemen. I am sure they would be just
as much astonished as I was to know of the
positions of trust and responsibility which
those women held in the Old Land during
the last war. Certainly men in high places
in Britain, whether within the Government or
without, did not think women's services
were of no value ini war-timne. Certainly they
did not think that women should simply lie
given some wool and needies and told to sit
down in a corner and keep eut of man's way.
They were given positions in the very innermost part of the Admiralty and on ail forms
of war work, and in ail cases rendered a
grand account of themnselves.
The ta-king off ente carde of ail this information which we acquired through our questionnaire lias been done entirely by voluntary
work, neariy ail done in the city of Toronto.

214

SENATE

Five thousand girls gave three hours a week,
some more, in the transferring of this information. Some hundreds of girls in Kitchener
and Waterloo also gave their services. This
work, if we had had to pay for it at even
minimum rates, would have cost in the
neighbourhood of $30,000.
The services of
the girls were made possible only by the
co-operation of heads of companies. Ninety
per cent of all the employers whom we
approached to ask for such services gave us
most sympathetie co-operation. I am referring
to the heads of big oil companies and of the
large insurance companies of .this country.
I could tell you of one firm in Toronto who
not only gave us 1,200 girls for three or four
hours a week, in their buildings, to help in
this work, but who also spent $1,500 in providing lunches for the girls while they were
on the work. It was that whole system of
voluntary effort which made it possible for
us to accomplish what we did.
Last week, in another place, the Prime
Minister made a statement connected with
registration in this country. That statement
was afterwards read in this Chamber by the
leader of the Government here (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). In it the Prime Minister paid
tribute to the work which liad been done in
our voluntary registration of Canadian women.
While we appreciate fully the fact that the
Government has deemed our work efficient
enough to merit 'that tribute, we appreciate
a great deal more the announcement that
fullest possible use will be made of the
information.
A great deal of curiosity was expressed
when we were doing this work as to how we
were financing it. Well, I can say to you
to-day very candidly that not one dollar was
received from any provincial government or
from the Federal Government. Neither did
we ever make a public appeal for funds. The
members of the committee bore a great deal
of the expense, and the remainder was borne
by outstanding men in this country, who sent
us in voluntary contributions, and by women's
organizations.
Now that the Government has declared in
favour of compulsory registration in this
countrv, I should like, if I may venture to
do so, to make a suggestion to the Government, a suggestion which arises from the
depths of the experience which we have had
in this small voluntary movement. It seems
to me that all governments, in attempting to
reach an objective, usual-ly use the longest
and most expensive road to reach it. In our
voluntary service committee we have demonstrated what can be done by voluntary and
sympathetic co-operation of the people in
war-time, and I would suggest that when the
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS.

Government takes its registration it make use
of committees which are already in existence
and know how to handle this work--that use
be made of the volunteer efforts of this
country. There will soon be released from
labour for two months thousands of teachers
in the Dominion of Canada. Hundreds of
them have already offered to undertake this
work of registration for the Government without any remuneration, and I believe that in
accepting offers of that kind-under responsible
leadership, of course-the Government would
not only save money, or release money which
is urgently needed in other directions, but
would also be helping people to give expression to that urge which is within them .to do
something in this war. Every day we hear
people asking: "Well, what can I do? I should
like to do something." Here is one way, I
think, in which that patriotic urge should be
made use of.
Since the Government declared for compulsory registration, we have been asked, at
least I have been asked, several times, as to
what is the use of our registration now that
the Government is going to take a complete
national registration. Well, may I remind those
who may be asking that question, that it
will be at least weeks, and possibly months,
before any information from that Government registration will be available in a practical form and ready for use. In the meantime our lists are available and are already in
use in many parts of the country. We had
been registering only two weeks when we were
asked to provide lists of skilled munitions
workers who had registered with us. Through
this registration we have placed hundreds and
hundreds of women, not only in munitions
factories, but iaso in textile work, as garment
workers, and in many other branches of
industry.
Perhaps the most important use that is being
made at the moment of the lists which we
have available is in connection with the bringing of refugees to this country. Thirteen
months ago our committee sat down and
discussed just such a situation as is prevailing
in England to-day. We discussed the possibility of a German invasion of Great Britain
and of its becoming necessary to bring British
children to this country.
Our discussion
resulted in the plicing upon the questionnaire
of two or three questions bearing upon that
subject. In the first draft of the questionnaire
ve had a question framed in this way: "Would
you be willing to take British children into
your home in case of an emergency?" We
were requested to broaden that question,
and we did, to read: "Would you be willing
to take children into your home ;n case of

JUNE 25, 1940
an emergency?" This was followed by the
furtber questions: "Wbat age, sex, race and
religion would you prefer? Would you be
willing to bave your hotme inspected and
approved for the purpose?"
in response to those inquiries we received,
and bave available to-day, a list of homes
for 100,000 cbildren. In order that there may
lie no misconception, may I say that our
committee neither requests nor desires to bave
anytbing to do witli the placing of children
in homes. Approval of homes, placing of
children and follow-up supervision are matters
entirely for social service agencies under the
direction of the Government. Our work is
to provide information, and that is wbat we
are doing to-day. In every province in whicb
we bave carried on this registration, the provincial Government lias asked our provincial
committees to give it lists, broken down into
districts, of alI homes available for receiving
children.
.Honourable members will have seen from
local papers, as I have, that in almost every.
town or small village a voluntary committee
bas been set up and, is asking for offers of
free bornes. We are told by the provincial
Ministers of Welfare and others that that
means very little; that if an offer cornes ini
saying Mrs. John Joncs, of such-and-such an
address, will take two cbildren, that does not
rnean a thing to the authorities. They then
bave to find out something about Mrs. Jones
and ber borne, and a good many other things.
But when lists are obtained from our coinrnittee tbey show not only that Mrs. John
Jones is willing to take two chuldren, but
also wbat is bier nationality, what are lier
preferences as to age, sex, race and religion
of the children, wlietber she will take the
children ioto lier home without charge or
only for rernuneration, bow many cliildren
there already are in bier borne, and their ages,
and other necessary information. Ahl these
facts forin a background which enables the
social service agency to make from the
beginning a choice as to where the children
should lie placed.
To-day this Committee for Voluntary
Registration of Canadian Women makes its
files available to ahl organizations in the
country that are doing war work. It presents
to the Federal Government lists of tens of
thousands of loyal and patriotic wornen,
skilled in their own lines of work, who are
eager to lie of service and ready at a moment's
notice to take their place on the farm, at the
seashore, in a factory, in a munitions plant,
in camp or hospital-wberever tliey may lie
needed. Ail they asic is to be called upon
wben the necessity arises.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, lieur.

21à

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I should flot like the admirable and
eloquent staternent of tbe lionourable lady
frorn Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) to bie
passed by without more than the general
applause whicb was expressed at the end of it.
We bave been given very valuable information
about a movernent whose activities were not
known to aIl of us. I quite understand why
the Prime Minister should declare that the
work done by the Committee for Voluntary
Registration of Canadian Women will be used
by the Government in connection with the
national registration that is to be undertaken.
Later on, when 1 corne to discuss the question of admittance to this country of children
from abroad, I may have occasion to revert
to the honourable lady's higbly informative
address. We are grateful te, lier for what she
bas told us this afternoon, and I arn sure I
speak for the Senate as a wbole wben I say
that we wisli to express our appreciation and
thanks to, lier, and to ail the women connected
with the movement to wbich she bas'referred,
for the work to which tbey have so generously
and unsparingly devoted tliemselves. In the
meantime slie may rest assured that we are
mucli interested in bier statement. I congratulate hier and ail bier associates on the
admirable work tliey bave been engaged in
from the very beginning; for at tbe outbreak
of war tbey were the first to offer their
services to the Government. Witbout any
publicity tbey bave carried on their excellent
work from 'the Atlantic to tbe Pacific, and
have secured, province by province, a fund of
information which will be of great value to
the Government wlien tbe time cornes to cal
upon the women of Canada to do tbeir share
in the nation's war effort.
Rigbt Hon. ARTHUJR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I arn in accord with the
appreciation expressed by the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Undoubtedly very useful work bas been done.
I was particularly impressed witb the practîcal
character of the data upon the subject of
reception of overseas children. I suggest to
the Government that in order to avoid
duplication of work, as far as possible, they
miglit well utilize information in respect to
women whicli, as described by the honourable
senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis),
ber registration committee bas gathered. I
arn afraid the registratio.n plan of the Government will take go mucli time to complete
that we shaîl be still registering when nations
are dying. I sliould like to see this very
obvious and mortally necessary thing undertaken irnmediately. I rannot lielp being
worried for fear that, removed as we are from,
the terrible events of the bour, we may go

SENATE
through the long process of registration as if
war were stili to corne.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can reassure
my rigb)t honourable friend on that point.
Registration will bo procceded with, but tbings
essential in this hour of peril xviii ho deait
with independentiy of registration. As to the
advico given to, the Government to economnize
by utilizing existing inexpensive agencies, I
weicome the expression of opinion on the part
of the women of Canada that the practice of
econocay wiil heip save this country.

DELAYED ANSWER-S TO INQUIRIES
BREN GRUN DISTRIBUTION-IMMIGRATION 0F
REFUGEES-ANTI-BRITISH PROPAGANDA

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourabie
senators, niv righit honourabie friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Moighen) reminded me that hie
had put te, the Goveroment three questions
which had not yet been answered.
As to the question concerning the Bren
gun, I have found an answer whîch Hon. Mr.
I{owe, Minister of Transport, gave recentiy
in the House of Commons. Ho stated in
effeet that the company was in production,
working very satisfactoriiy, and much ahead
of schedule. But that did not give a clear-cut
answer to the question. Mr. Howe promised
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

me a detaiiod statement such as wouid satisfy
my right honourabie friend, but hoe was caiied
away on public business and did not return
untii thiis morning, when I found that some
of my colleagues bcd prior rights to bis time.
I hope to have an answer by to-morrow.
Witb respect to the newspapers wbicb my
rigbt honourabie friend thinks shouid be
banned, I may say that the Board of Censors
have given a number of reasons wby any
governimontai action shouid be suspended.
They have been examining these publications
for some time and have found tbem to contain extreme views, otber viewvs ie-,- obnoxi:ous.
and seime rather satisfactory. I thirtk 1 sbaii
ho able to give my rigbt honourahie friend,
in bis capacity as a Privy Councillor, the
reasons-some of whicbi couid nlot ho gîivon to
the pubiic-why the Board of Censors have
corne to that conclusion.
As to the third question, that of the immigration of refugees, tbe position is not so clear
as I tbougbt it was. I find that on Wednesday
of iast weok Hon. Mr. Hanson, in the House
of Commons, put to the Govornment some
questions, in the course of whicb bie quoted
tbis letter addressed to himseif on tbat date:
In repiy to your telephone inquiry of date
about the admission of British people who want
to tinil homes bore during the war, I mnay say
titat evory encouragement that we can offer
is being givon to people of this sort. \Vo have
liad maay inquiries from residents of Canada
who eau offer homes to relatives or, friends from
overseas andi thiese are ail heing adviso? that
relatives or friends may come freoly andi iitout
any deiay or "rod tape", when tbey eau pay
their own passage anti are joining relatives or
friends bore or are coming with sufficient foinds
to look after thcmseives.
Otur Loadon office bas boen advisod te fa ilitate this mnovoment in every way possible. We
(Io not asic for any bonds or other guarantee
from residents of Canada, nior (Io we ivaste
tinte iii unnecessary investigations, as that might
Prevent p)eople gettilig ont whiie sailing is
possible.
Yours very truiy,
F. C. Blair,
Director.
Mr. Hanson added:
Titerefore I would reaiiy confine myseif to
the first question with regard te the generai
semre, and I sitouid like to take titis opportuaity to express my a ppreciatioît of the
position of the immigration officiais andi of tite
Gox ornment in respect to titis ntatter of
iîtdividuai chiidren or persons desiriag to corne
to Canada for the duration of tite war, to
escape wbat may ho bioody siaugîtter ovor there.
But I have some furtber information bore.
Mr. Hanson's inquiry was addressod to the
Prime Minister, and I wiii give this excerpt
frorn Mr. King's repiy:
I wouid say that everytiting I bave said iii
titis House with respect te the reaihiness, wiiiingnoss and anxiety of this Goverament te receive

JUNE 25, 1940
evacuated children from the Old Country is
perfectly true. There has been no hesitation
with respect to our readiness to handle the
matter to the fullest extent possible.
This was supplemented by Hon. Mr. Crerar,
who bas charge of immigration. He said:
Perhaps I may supplement wha-t the Prime
Minister (Mr. Mackenzie King) bas said by
saying that an offer has been made to receive
children between the ages of five and sixteen
years, and in some cases children of less than
five years of age. I may add that we have been
informed that no children will be sent to Canada
except with the permission of the parents or
guardians, and that is the position to-day.
There is perfect freedom of movement for any
others who wish to come; and for the information of the House I may say that there are
either on the way, or shortly will be on the
way, quite a substantial number of boys from
a school, who are coming to Canada to resume
their education. It takes a little time to work
out all the problems associated with these
matters; but when the record is placed before
this country I have not the slightest doubt
that the Canadian people will approve what the
Government has done in the matter.
The Prime Minister made this further statement, which goes somewhat beyond the question in respect to the admission of individual
children or persons desiring to come to Canada
for the duration of the war:
The wishes of the British Government are
those: In the matter of preference they are
anxious that we should take first of all interned
aliens, secondly, that we should take German
prisoners in Britain, and thirdly that we should
then consider the matter of evacuated children.
The reasons they give in this connection are
that the interned aliens in Great Britain may
be in a position to help to direct parachutists
in the event of a bombardment of the British
Isles, which they are expecting hourly. They
aiso feel that the German prisoners they have
there require a great deal by way of protection,
and that the men protecting them should be
available for the protection of the British Isles
themselves. There is great congestion, because
of the numbers of refugees which have been
coming there, and they feel that it would be in
the interest of safety and security in every way
to have alien internees and German prisoners
brought to this country, and placed in different
parts of the country under protective measures

here.

We have realized how the matter would likely
be viewed. We have been conscious of the fact
that regardless of what we did there would be
some exception taken. The course we have had
in view, and which we believe expresses that
of the country generally, is that which has been
expressed by the honourable member who has
just spoken, namely that it would be desirable
that we should at this particularly critical
time seek to our utmost to meet the wishes of
the British Government in this as in other
matters. We have agreed to receive here
interned aliens from the United Kingdom, also
German prisoners from the United Kingdom,
and for some time past we have been making
arrangements to see that they will be properly
concentrated and controlled, when they are
brought to Canada.

that delay is due to the circumstances which I

the

But there has not been any delay. I must
say that there bas been no delay particularly
in regard to this matter of receiving evacuated
children.

I promise my right honourable friend that
I will watch to see if further information on
the subject is given to the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

The state-

ment read by the honourable leader of the
House recites the desires of the British Govern-

ment with respect to priorities in our taking
of internees, German prisoners, and children.
As I interpret the statement, it is that the
Canadian Government feel they should comply
with the British Government's desire. I hope
my interpretation is correct. I will support

the Government to the fullest in a complete
compliance

with

the

British

Government's

request. I do not think there is a person in
Canada who would not want that done, or
would feel right in his heart if any other
course were taken.
With regard to refugees, those persons who

have gone to Britain from countries over which
the Germans have sweptHon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are not
very numerous-hardly two hundred from
Holland and some 2,000 odd from Belgium.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
Government are entirely right in following the
British Government's desire.
As to children from Britain-I am calling
them children, for that is what they will bethe statement was to the effect that the Gov-

ernment are ready and organization is wel'l
advanced to receive them, provided they are
given transportation from overseas. Whether
or not there is difficulty on that item of transportation is something known to the Government.

I can conceive there might be reluct-

ance on the part of authorities over there to
permit the purchase of Canadian exchange to
cover that item. Should this be the case, it
would seem to me well worth while to consider the possibility on our part of such concession in policy as would enabIe the purchase
by Canadians of a corresponding amount of
British exchange, so as to make the two
accounts balance. This could easily be done,
for instance, by widening of the possibilities for
purchase of Canadian securities held in London.

They represent a very large figure. My suggestion is only that the Government might
consider facilitating the purchase of sufficient

Canadian securities held over there to balance

NAVAL SERVICE BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hlon. Mr. COPP, on behaîf of the Right
Hon. Mr. Graham, Chairman of the Standing
Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours, presented the report of the eommittee on Bill 2, an Acf to amend the Naval
Service Acf.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, when this Bill was before the Senate
previously there was considerable discussion
as f0 the interpretaf ion of a particular clause.
The Bill as it came from the Commons seemed
to have but one objecf in vicw-to bring
under the discipline of the Naval authorities
a certain class of persons who would net be
members of the Naval Service. The objection
was taken that one clause of the Bill might
extend pension rights f0 these persons. The
Bill was then sent to committee, and affer
the interprefafion of this clause had been
discussed at a couple cf meetings, the JudgeAdvocate cf the department, Mr. Orde, and
our Law Clerk, agreed upon amendments
which completely met the objections cf those
who thought fhe Bill could be improved.
I fhink we are ail in agreement, and under
the circumsfances I move thaf these amendments be concurred in.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Could the honourable
leader on the other side of the House give
us some more definite idea as to what these
amendments cure?
Hon. Mr. DANDITBAND: These are the
amendments. I think they are fairly understandable.Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I arn not so rnuch
(oncerne(l about the amendments, but when
the Bill was before the House if was intimated
by the right honourable gentleman to my left
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) that there was a
possibility that the Bill as drafted wuuld
provide for certain things which werc nlot
intended at ail. Was that found to be the
case?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The possibilîty
of these persons enjoying some of the
advantages mienfioned by the right bonourable
gentleman bas disappeared by reason of the
amendments which have now becn made.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But the righi
gi\,en in the original Bill.

wcre

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By reference to
the Act itself. Now it is specifically provided
that the two sections in the Act under which
certain rights could be (Iaimed shail not
apply to these men whio will be temporarily
in the service.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Ail 1 should ]ike to
say further is that if if is true thaf the Bill
as it rcached us wvould in after years have
entifled these men ta rigbts to which it was
neyer intendcd they should become entitled,
then somebody-I do nlot know wbo-musf
have done some vcry poor drafting. The Bill
migbt have slipped through bere without
anyone noticing the defect, and that would
have been a pretty serious matter. It is a
good thing that the Bill went to a committee.
A discussion
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
took place here on the mneaning of the Bill
witb respect to rights that would accrue to
any of these men whio might be injured or
killed in the service. Our Law Clerk and the
Jiidge-Advocate-Gener-al agreed that the measure was not faulty, but the right honourable
gentleman opposite (Riglht Hon. Mr. Meighen)
contended that because of the way the Bill
was worded there was a possibility of the
men or their dependants claiming benefifs
under the Act itself. It is made clear now
that no such dlaim will be possible.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I arn entirely
in agreement with the honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) as te the effeet of the
measure as now amended. The amendment
I would say further
is entirely satisfactory.
that I arn sure the Government was flot in
any way a party to the ineaning of the
original Bill; that it neyer intended the Bill
to mean whaf it did mean. But the honourable header's explanation is defective. While
it is truc that the Bill as it came to us did
not give these temporary assistants in the

JUNE 26, 1940
Naval Service any pension rights, any benefits
which could be properly described as rights
under the Pension Act, nevertheless it is a
matter flot merely of doubt and fear, but of
absolute certainty, that it did give them other
rights, which it neyer was intended they should
be given, and which they should flot have,
namely, rights under sections 38 and 39 of
the Naval Service Act. These sections do not
provide for pensions, but they make provision
for the wives and families of men who die
from any disease which 'began whîle they
were in the Naval Service, and for financia]
assistance to the men themselves in case they
become disabled in ans' way while in the
service. Thus the original Bill would have
imposed very 'serinus liabilities upon the
country.
-In the opinions given by our Law Clerk and
by Mr. Orde, Judge-Advocate-General, it was
not stated that the men were flot entitled to
those rights.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
38 and 39.

TJnder sections

Right Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: The opinions
stated definitely that the men were not
entitled to pensions, in which view we of
course ail agreed. But the Law Clerk most
definitely stated that under the Bill as drawn
the men were entitled to corne in under
sections 38 and 39, and Mr. Orde did not
dispute that. Nobody could dispute it. Consequently, it is no mere doubt or fear which
bas been wiped away by this amendment, but
an absolute liability of a very serious kind.
I only want to make honourable members
understand what the committee bas accomplished. As I have said, I know the Government neyer intended that these temporary
men should be entitled to the rights given
them in the original Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I must congratulate my right honourable friend on having
drawn the attention of the Senate to this
matter.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I wish to place on the Order Paper an inquiry
based upon a newspaper report. If that newspaper report is n.ot correct, then my inquiry
will fail by the way. 1 hope the report is not
correct, but I have macle a careful check and
I fear it is only too well f ounded.
1 notice in the Press a report that the Ford
Company of the United States bas refused
to make aerop'lane engines for the British
Government. I understand that the head of
that concern, Henry Ford, is the same gentleman who in 1917 launched the "Peace Ship.'
If bis disposition is stîll as peaceable as in
1917, he could do nothing better towards
helping the cause of peace 'than by supplying
to the British Goverment aeroplane engines
and all other munitions possible.
Recause of that peculiar attitude of this
great industrialist, I should like to inquire
of the Government as follews:
In view of the fact that the Ford Motor
Company of the United States of America has
refused to manufacture plane etigines for the
British Government:

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF BRITISH NORTH
AMERICA ACT-MOTION FOR ADDRESS TO
HIS MAJESTY

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I desire to lay on the Table correspondence which has passed between the
Prime Minister of Canada and the Premiers
of the nine provinces concerning the advisability of the Parliament of Canada asking
for an amendment to the Constitution which
would give it the necessary authority to
legislate with respect to unemployment insurance.
In this connection I desire, with the leave
of the House, as I have not been able to
give notice of my intention, to move -the
following motion:
Whereas the Employment and Social Insurance Act, 1935, a statute of the Parliament of
Canada which, in substance, provided for a
system of compulsory unemployment insurance
throughout Canada, bas been held by the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to be
ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada;
And whereas, if a uniform and effective sys-

tei of compulsory unemployment insurance is
to be adopted throughout Canada, it will be
necessary to amend the British North America
Act, 1867, to enable the Parliament of Canada
to enact the necessary legislation;
A humble Address be presented to His
Majesty the King, in the following words:
To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracions Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament
assembled, humbly approach Your Majesty praying that you may graciously be pleased to cause
a measure to be laid before the Parliament of
the United Kingdom to amend the British North
America Act, 1867, and that such measure be
expressed as follows:
An Act to amend the British North America
Act, 1867, relating to unemployment insurance.
Whereas the Senate and Commons of Canada
in Parliament assembled have submitted an
Address to His Majesty praying that His
Majesty may graciously he pleased to cause a
measure to lie laid before the Parliament of the
United Kingdom for the enactment of the
provisions hereinafter set forth:
Be it therefore enacted by the King's Most
Excellent Majesty by and with the advice and
consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the saine,
as follows:
1. Section ninety-une of the British Nolth
America Act, 1867, is amended by adUng
thereto as class 2A the following:
Uon. Mr. BLACK.

"2A. Unemployment insurance."
and inserting such class in the enueration of
the classes of Subjects set forth in section
ninety-one aforesaid, immediately after class
two.
2. This Act may bo cited as the British North
America Act, 1940, and the British North
America Acts, 1867 to 1930, the British North
America Act, 1907, and this Act may Se cited
together as the British North America Acts,
1867 to 1940.
I have ascertained from my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) that
he is ready to discuss this resolution.
In support of it I need not relate the efforts
that have for a number of years been made
to secure jurisdiction for this Parliament to
legislate in respect of unemployment insurance.
The matter was at divers times approached
from different angles, and in 1935 my right
honourable friend introduced a measure from
the Commons entitled the Employment and
Social Insurance Bill. It was discussed at
length and referred to our Committee on
Banking and Commerce, by whom it was
thoroughly examined. Then it was passed and
became law.
At the time considerable doubt was expressed
by various honourable senators as to the competence of the Parliament of Canada to
legislate on this matter, and fears were voiced
also that such legislation might mean an
invasion of the rights of the provinces. In
1936 the inatter was submitted to the Supreme
Court of Canada, which declared that unemployment insurance was a matter appertaining
to the provinces. This decision was then taken
by the Dominion Government to the Privy
Council, and was upheld by that tribunal,
the court of last resort. Under these circumstances there remained, according to the
Department of Justice, but one alternative,
namely, an amendment to the Constitution.
The Sirois report came to us after a very
close examination of the matter from the
constitutional point of view, and even from
the point of view of the practical application
of the law in the various provinces. Although
there were reasons pro and con, the commissioners were of opinion that such legislation
should be enacted by the Federal Parliament
and should be uniform throughout the provinces, and they suggested an amendment to the
Constitution.
That proposed amendment is what the
present Government is trying to effect by this
resolution, simply asking that two words be
added to article 91 of the British North
America Act, which grants a series of powers
to the federal authorities.
Under these circumstances I move, seconded
by the Right Hon. Mr. Graham, that this
resolution be adopted.

JUNE 26, 1940
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Have the provinces
given their consent?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A question has
just been put to me as to the position of the
provinces. I have laid on the Table correspondence whioh indicates that the provincial
Premiers are agrecable to this resolution and
to the legislation which will follow.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, it would be quite without
value to recapitulate now the steps taken
in respect of unemployment insurance and
similar measures, or to emphasize again the
effect, which, in my judgment at least, was
unfortunate, of the decisions given by the
Privy Council in the matter some years ago.
Subsequently to that time, by resolution of
this House, we requested our Parliamentary
Counsel-a man of great eminence, particularly
in this field of law-to review the whole
history of our Confederation pact, to examine
especially the decisions of the Privy Council
and our own courts bearing thereon, and to
make such suggestions as would bring into
harmony the aspirations of the various provinces on the one hand and of the Dominion
on the other, with a view to having our whole
Iegislative process placed on a sounder and
more understandable basis. That our Parliamentary Counsel discharged this duty with
marked capacity is evident, first, from a reading of bis report, and, secondly, from references
made in various law journals and other
periodicals by most distinguished students of
law, as to the arguments and findings contained in that report. It is not going too far
to say that it received the approval of al
who could be regardcd as capable critics.
The principal feature of the report is this.
At a certain stage of our history, under
pressure from certain provinces, the decisions
in the Privy Council, veering from the sound
line previously pursued, placed the main powers
of the Parliament of Canada, as set out in
the very forefront of section 91, in a category
somewhat different from, and subordinate to,
that of the speciflo powers recited later in the
section.
No one can fail to be impressed with the
conclusiveness of the argument which our
Parliamentary Counsel submitted. He advised
that, rather than start to repair piece by piece
the damage done, we should present one
general Address outlining what the disclosure
of facts contained in bis report showed plainly
to be the intent of the Fathers of Confederation. He pointed out that if we passed a
resolution for this purpose and made clear their
intent, there would be no need at ahl of
amcnding the Act. Technically, of course, the
Act would be amended by the very declara-

tion cf intent advised by the Parliamentary
Counsel, but in bis judgment, as in the
judgment of many others, the only effect of
sucli action as he proposed would be to restore
the original line of decisions and bring about
a return from the veering policy wbicb had
brought us into a state of constitutional chaos,
as exemplified *by the decisions in respect of
unemployment insurance.
Now we are asked by this resolution to
petition the Throne for an amendment to
the British North America Act. We all know
that the passing of such an Address is automatically followed by the amendment of the
Act in question. So, whetber we want to take
this course. some other course, or none at ahI,
the final decision. is our own. I emphasize,
first, that in doing what we are now asked
to do we are declining to accept the advice
of the Law Clerk of this House. We are
declining to follow a line of procedure wbica
be distinctly recomamended, and which, wbatever may be individual opinion in regard to
it, bas certainly much in its favour. Further,
if we pass tbe resolution now moved, we put
ourselves on record as admittîng that, should
we wisb to repair some other features which
we regard as damaging to our case, we must
ask for other amendments to the British
North America Act, and must do so piecemeal,
from time to time, as various emergencies or
'vicissitudes arise.
We are brought back, then, ta consider
wbetber, instead of taking the step now proposed, it would not be better to review carefully the course wbich Mr. O'Connor bas
recommended, and folhow it or some other
less circuitous and more satisfactory way of
overcoming the difficulty.
At this point I shall not argue in favour
of our Parliamentary Counsel's view. The
reason I shall not do so is this. I think we
can get exacthy the result which Mr. O'Connor
had in mind in another way, and I want to
submit that plan ta honourable members of
this House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before my right
bonoulable friend entera upon that part of
bis remarks, I should like ta, have him charify
a statement he made, so that honourable
senators may understand exaetly the proposal
of our Law Clerk. My right honourable
friend said the Law Clerk suggested a general
Address. That Address, which, I suppose,
would be decharatory, would be presented to
the Imperial Parliament.
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Without further investigation of the report, that
is my idea. The Address would recite what,
in the judgment of the Law Clerk-it wouhd
become our judgment-was the original intent,

222

in language in conformity with the earlier
decisions. The result would be that future
decisions as to interpretation of the language
of section 91-the peace, order and good
government section-would follow the lines
of the earlier decisions.

but I do not think anyone will dispute the
point.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Would it require a
general amendment to the Act?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
common law provinces.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it is
described by Mr. O'Connor as a declaratory
amendrment. He asserts that the Act as originally passed needs no amendment. The more
one reads over and studies the British North
America Act and reviews the decisions upon
which it is based, the more one admires the
amplitude of mind and thoroughness of action
which characterized the fathers of our country.
The Act is one of the finest productions of
the hunian mind in the form of statutes to
be found anywhere in the world.
Now, with some humility, for I make no
pretence of having engaged seriously in the
practice of law for a number of years, I
am going to presume to speak on this phase,
because it se frequently comes before Parliament that anyone with any legal training at
all is bound to interest himself in it and
make himself more or less familiar with it.
I call the attention of honourable members
to section 94 of the British North America Act.
I believe it remains, unaltered, in the form
in which it originally passed. I shall read
it, omitting only such words as are inapplicable and wholly irrelevant to the argument
I have in view.
Notwitistatdiug anything in this Act,Those words are, as every lawyer knows, of
great significance.

They are all

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We can read
the section as if all the provinces except
Quebec were included.
I shall deal with
Quebec after I am through with the argument
I wish to present with respect to the other
provinces.
The clear intent of this provision is to
bring about uniformity in respect of some
subject relating to property and civil rights,
which subject otherwise would be under
provincial jurisdiction.
The Privy Council
held that unemployment insurance comes
within the property and civil rights clause
of section 92, and therefore is a matter within
the powers of the provincial legislatures.
Consequently, if we were to seek to utilize
section 94 in the matter of unemployment
insurance, we should be seeking to utilize the
section in respect of laws relative to property
and civil rights in eight provinces. I will
re-read the first part of the section, to bring
it again definitely into the minds of honourable members.
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the
Parliament of Canada may make provision for
the uniformity of all or any of the laws relative
to property and civil riglhts in Ontario, Nova
Scotia, and New Brunswick,You might just as well read that this way:
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the
Parliainent of Canada may make provision for
the uniformity of the law in respect of unemployment insurance in Ontario and the other
provinces, except Quebec, and from and after
the passing of any Act in that behalf-in respect of unemployment insurance-the power of the Parlianent of Canada to
nake laws in relation to any matter comprised
in any such Act shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act, be unrestricted; but any Act
of the Parliament of Canada making provision
for such uniformity shall not have effect in any
province unless and util it is adopted and
enacted as law by the Legislature thereof.
Now, suppose we pass an Act for the purpose of bringing about a uniforrm condition in
respect of the law of unemployment insurance. I have given the matter considerable
thought, and I am unable to think of anything
to which the section can apply if it does not
apply to unemployment insurance.
Some
honourable members may be more resourceful
than I.

over again, as often as a situation of this kind
arises.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I do not want to
interrupt my right honourable friend, but
would his suggestion not necessitate separate
action by ten different legislative bodies?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly it
would. But there would be very little work
to that, and, once the provinces had acted,
there would be no more difficulty. But what
happens under the procedure now proposed?
Mr. Bracken, in Manitoba, says, "We are
agreeable to the amendment." The Premiers
of the other provinces say the same4lthough
a statute may not have to be passed by the
legislatures, all the provincial Governments
have to carry their legislatures with them on
the matter. And in future, whenever it
becomes necessary to enact a measure which
is just as essentially federal as unemployment
insurance, the same course will have to be
taken, followed by the old procedure of
passing in both Houses of Parliament a
resolution addressed to the Imperial Parliament. The whole process of education has to
start over again, province by province. It is
a process that has taken years in respect of
this legislation, and, according to the Government, whose statement I accept, has forced
delay. We shall have the sarne experience
every time something else comes up.
Why not follow the course I have proposed?
Then, after you have your legislation on the
Statute Book, each province can choose its
own line-it bas to-and you can see whether
it will come in. A province might be
recalcitrant, but non-compliance would not
be to its advantage.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Each province might
pass legislation differing in detail. What
would become of uniformity then?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. All the
provinces, except Quebec, would need merely
to pass an Act adopting the Dominion legislation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But not in the case
of Quebec.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not in the
case of Quebec. Quebec itself would pass an
Act, which later the Dominion would execute
at its own expense.
Hon. Mr. EULER: lVight not the other
eight provinces have uniform Acts while
Quebee's legislation was substantially different? That would not make for uniformity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Act
provides for uniformity in all the provinces
except Quebec. It would be absolutely uniform
in those other provinces, because they would
simply adopt our Act; but Quebec would
pass legislation in exactly the same terms.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It might not.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know. But
suppose Quebec makes a change which it
thinks is better. It is only for the Dominion
Government to say whether or not it will
accept that enactment.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But you would not have
uniformity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: The provinces
can come in any day they want to. What I
desire to impress on honourable senators and
the Government is that by taking this course
we keep the problem in our own home; it is
here; we can deal with it in a way just as
simple as the other; and we save excursions
overseas every time we want to deal with it
-excursions which I believe were not intended
to be made. There is here provided a method
which, so far as I know, we have never yet
utilized, and I think an appropriate occasion
has come to utilize it to-day.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Will my right
honourable friend allow me a question? The
course he suggests is very ingenious, and no
doubt will commend itself to nearly all the
provinces. If all except Quebec agree to
legislation passed by the Dominion under
article 94, then we have an understanding
binding on all these eight provinces and the
Dominion?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Those provinces have given us jurisdiction.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: And despoiled
themselves of the jurisdiction; so it is an
agreement valid and lasting for all time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
rather use the word "relieved."

I would

willing to accept the synonym suggested by
my right honourable friend. I always gain

by doing so. But section 94 does not apply
to Quebec. Quebec will still have jurisdiction
to repeal any adoptive legislation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Suppose Quebec
adopts a law passed by this Parliament. The
following year it can withdraw from its
agreement by simply saying, "We always have
the right to repeal any Act we have passed."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: This would appear
to me to be a weakness in the plan suggested.
I should like to know how it could be remedied.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The decision
would always rest with Quebec, the province
being given in that respect, perhaps, an advantage. Quebec might decide that the unemployment insurance law of Canada should not
apply. If it so decided, the 'law would not
apply there. What harm would that do? None.
But I do not think Quebec would be very
happy in the position of contributing to the
cost of unemployment insurance and getting
no benefits.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Quebec did that in
regard to old age pensions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know; but
it did not continue.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The province penalized
itself.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I think Quebec in
its own interest would necessarily continue
under the operation of such legislation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
Yes, I
think so.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I am sorry this debate comes up this
afternoon, because I think those of us who
are in favour of the resolution would wish to
vote for it now.

But the questions which

the right honourable gentleman (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) has raised are of such wide
application and involve such serious legal consequences that I do not think anyone should
attempt to decide them without considerably
more deliberation than is possible at this
time.
With a good deal of what the right honourable gentleman has said about Mr. O'Connor's
report to this House on the British North
America Act I most heartily agree. In fact
I had the pleasure of introducing a motion
expressing our appreciation of the very fine
work he had done, though in some material
particulars I did presume to differ from his
conclusions.

225

Mr. O'Connor's suggestions involve a radical
and fundamental change in the law of our
Constitution, which to-day is embodied in the
British North America Act as interpreted by
decisions of the Privy Council and the Supreme
Court of Canada. Mr. O'Connor has vigorously expressed his disagreement-as has the
right honourable gentleman here to-day-with
the development and trend of those decisions.
I am not prepared to say without the most
serious consideration-and I doubt whether
any other member would be-whether a number of Mr. O'Connor's suggestions should or
should not be adopted. But I would point
out that if his policy were adopted it could
be done only after a conference with every
province. We have before us to-day something that has very seldom obtained in Canada.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: We have an agreement
between the Dominion Government and every
provincial Government in respect of this particular piece of legislation. If Mr. O'Connor's
scheme were introduced it would mean a
fundamental change in regard to the British
North America Act, such as we have not had
since its enactment in 1867. It would mean
turning our back on decisions of the Privy
Council and the Supreme Court of Canada
extending over many years, and would limit
considerably the powers of the provinces as to
property and civil rights. Without the cooperation of the provinces we cannot expect
to bring about that change. It may be simple
in its wording, but in effect it is a new interpretation of our Constitution. We never could
get such co-operation in time to effectuate
legislation in regard to unemployment insurance which we now desire to put on the
Statute Book.
We have next to consider the right honourable gentleman's suggestion that what we are
doing to-day is inconsistent with, or in some
way limits, our power to do at a later date
as Mr. O'Connor has suggested. I am not sure
that I interpret my right honourable friend
correctly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
I said that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I was not sure of my
interpretation, but it seemed to me to be
the drift of his remarks. I do not think
adoption of this resolution would in the
slightest degree affect our full freedom of
action at a later date, should the provinces
in the meantime co-operate in regard to a
general amendment declaring a new policy in
interpretation of the British North America
Act. If the passage of this resolution does

Hon. Mr. HAIG inquired of -the Government:
1. Is Leslie Roberts a salaried man in the
Government service?
2. If so, in what service, and on what salary,
and what is his title?
3. If the answer to No. 1 is in the affirmative,
when did he enter the service, and in what
capacity, and on what salary? He said: Honourable members, before the
honourable gentleman replies to my inquiry,

I may say, in order to give him some information, that I have in my hand a posteard bearing on one side a picture of a convoy, and on
the other side the following text:

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 42, an Act to assist in the
alleviation of Unemployment and Agricultural
Distress.

The Bill was read the first time.
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shal this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, this Bill is but a re-enactment, with
a few modifications, of an Act which has been
on the Statute Book since 1936, and which
has been renewed from year to year. The
preamble to the Bill states the main purpose
of the legislation. It is as follows:
Whereas notwithstanding greatly increased
employment under war conditions it appears
still to be necessary in the national interest to
make provision for some contribution by the
Dominion, where circurmstances so warrant, to
supplement the measures taken by the provinces
towards providing assistance to those in need,
establishing unemployed persons in employment
and training and fitting suitable persons for
productive occupations, thereby lessening provincial and municipal burdens in so far as they
may be consequent upon extraordinary conditions of unemployment heretofore existing
and at the same time developing the economic
capacity of the nation to carry on the war:
Therefore His Maiesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows.
The wording of the preamble in the present
Bill is slightly different from that of the
1939 Act. The wording with respect to the
cardinal purpose, namely, to provide ways
and means for the Dominion to supplement,
by financial assistance, measures taken by the
provinces to relieve individuals who are in
necessitous circumstances by reason of unem,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

employment being brought about by the war
activities of the nation, and for that purpose
certain words and phrases have been added to
the preamble.

Clause 3 of the Acts of 1937, 1938 and 1939
bas been dropped from this year's Bill. It
was included in earlier Acts to permit the
Dominion to initiate relief projects of its own.
It has not been necessary for the Dominion to
use this power. In view of the curtailment of
provincial public works under relief legislation,

there is no need for this clause.

(1) The Governor in Council in cases where
in his opinion the circumstances make it necessary in the national interest, and subject to
such requirements and conditions as he may
consider advisable, may, out of any unappropriated moneys in the Consolidated Revenue
Fund, grant financial assistance to any province by way of loan, advance or guarantee for

payable by the province for its share of s-h
expenditures under any agreement between the
Dominion and the province entered into under
the authority of this Act, or the Unenploymsent

Youth Training Act, 1939.
(2) The Governor in Council muay renew or

terms as the Governor in Counril may determine,
loans, advances or guarantees made, given or
renewed under the authority of the Unemployment Relief and Assistance Act, 1936, the
Unemployment and Agricultural Assistance Act,
1937, the Unemployment and Agricultural
Assistance Act, 1938, the Unemployment and
Agricultural Assistance Act, 1939, or this Act and
may accept such Treasury bills, bonds, debeutures
or other securities as may be approved by the
Governor in Council as security for the payment of any indebtedness due by a province
to the Dominion arising out of expenditures,
advances or loans heretofore or hereafter made
for the alleviation of unemployment conditions
snd of agricultural distress and to assist those
in need.
Clause 4 of the Bill corresponds in general
with clause 5 of the 1939 Act. There are, however, two main differences.

JUNE 26, 1940

229

First: The power which the 1939 Act gave
the Dominion to loan, advance or guarantee,
for the purposes mentioned, was very general,
restricted only by the words "where necessary," in the first line, which words might be
construed as referring to ail cases where the
provinces deemed it necessary. It is considered advisable this year to restrict that
generality and give Council full discretion,
by adding the words contained in the first
four ines of the clause, namely:
-where in hi&-that is, the Governor in Counil's--opinion the circumstances make it necessary
in the national interest, and subject to such
requirements and conditions as he may consider
advisable.
Second: Five bines which appeared at the
end of subsection 1 of clause 5 in the 1939
AC, and also in the 1938 Act, have been left
out of the present Bill. These lines are as
follows:
as well as the amount for which the province
may he obligated by way of boan in connection
with the cost of any undertaking for which
commitments were made under the Unemployment and Agricultural Assistance Act, 1938,
and which may be continued under agreements
entered into under the authority of this Act.

families, of whomn 80 per cent were employable, and 48,000 single persons, of whomn 50
per cent were employable. A recent canvass
of thirty-eight cities and towns showed that
by the firat of June these figures of employable persons on relief had been reduced by
24-3 per cent.

These lines were inserted in the earlier
Acta to provide for an extraordinary condition
which arose out of the construction of the
Greater Winnipeg Sewage Disposai project,
commenced in 1935 and continued for three
and a haîf years. This project was carried
on by the Greater Winnipeg Sanitary District,
comprising the cities of Winnipeg and St.
Boniface and several adjacent municîpalities.
It became necessary for the province to boan
most of these municipalities their share of
the undertaking, and for the province in turn
to borrow fromn the Dominion. The project
having been completed, there is no necessity
for further boans.
I have given these details of the proposed
small variations to the 1939 Act in the hope
that I may be allowed to move second readmng
of the Bill 11w. With leave, 1 would move
that the Bill be now read a second time.

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
debate was adj ourned.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I should like second reading to stand
until to-morrow, as I want to compare the
Bill's phrasing with that of the Act. Also I
should like some information as to how the
Dominion's contributions through relief will
compare with those of other years.

inquiries about Leslie Roberts, and informed
me that he was not a salaried employee of the
Government, could tell me now whether he is
an employee without salary.

PASSPORTS-INSPECTION AT BORDER

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I desire to place before the House
a statement with relation to passports for
Canadians visiting the United States, and the
decision of the Government to continue for the
present the practice of not requiring passports
from United States citizens coming to this
country. The same statement was presented
this afternoon in the other House.
As previously announced, the Governient have
for sonie tinie past been giving careful consideration to the question of horder control.
We recognize the necessity of special vigilance
in vicw of war conditions. W also recognize
the desirability of interfering as little as possible w ith legitimate access to Canada by
visitors from the United States.
The United States authorities have recently
instituted a systen of passport and visa control
on all borders of the United States, to becone
effective on July 1. Under this system it will
be necessary for a Canadian who intends to
visit the United States to obtain a passport
from the Canadian authorities and tien to
secure a visa or permit fron one of the United
States Consuls stationed at different points
in Canada.

We liave taken steps to review and strengthen
the existing system of border control, including
stricter immigration inspection at the border
and special provision in certain areas which
have usually not required attention. 'Tlie protection of vulnerable points is, of course, being

continuîîed and will be increased.
All circuinstances considered, it has been
deened desirable to continue for the prisent
the practice of not requiring passports fron
United States citizens. All that will be necessary is for the visitor to satisfy the Canadian
Immigration authorities that lie is a United
States citizen and that he is coiing to Canada
for a legitimate purpose. There will be no
unnecessary delays or hindrances placed in the
way of tourists, who will continue to receive
the cordial welcome that lias been extended to
them ini the past. American visitors will sec
in Canada a country intensifying its war effort
against Nazi and Fascist aggression and tyranny,
but a country which at the saune time is at
peace and in increasing accord and friendship
with its great democratic neighbour.
If, at the end of the summer season, it should
be found necessary to establish a system of
passport control and to set up the necessary
Canadian consular service in the United States,
ample notice of such intention will be given.
I will read also a certified copy of a
minute of the meeting of the Committee of
the Privy Council, approved on the 22nd of
June:
The Committee of the Privy Couneil have
had before them a report, dated 21st June,

Affairs, stating that the Government of the

critical international situation, has decided to

WAR CO-OPERATION
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consider the
report of the Special Committee on War Cooperation.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
Honourable
senators, as I stated yesterday, I think the
report of the Special Committee on War
Co-operation is clear and explicit. It has
been printed in both languages, and copies
were distributed this morning. In the interim

JUNE 26, 194023
1 presumne honourable members have had
ample time to study and appreciate 'the purpose of the report. There is every reason
why the report should be acted on without
further delay, and therefore I move that it
be concurred in.
(Translation):
lion. ARTHUR SAUVÉ
Honourable senators, 1 regret that the honourable member from Montarville (Hon. C. P.
Beaubien) did flot understand the reason for
my request that consideration of his comrnittee's report be postponed until Thursday.
I had nlot the slightest intention of criticizing
or obstructing; my sole motive was to show
that the Senate. at least. does flot aet hastily
and rashly, without having fully understood
the questions submitted to it. The members
of this House not having received copies of the
report, I suggested that consideration thereof
be postponed until next Thursday.
I congratulate the honourable member from
Montarville on having se, promptly sent me
copies of the English and French versions of
the report, and I wish to express to him my
sincere thanks. I unhesitatingly commend the
publicity proposed by the Special Committee
on War Co-Operation with a view to supplying
to the Canadian people fuît and accurate iniformation regarding our present situation due
to the war which the enemy is seeking to
spread to the entire world. I arn in favour of
such a campaign. provided it be a campaign of
sound education carried on by men noted for
their knowledge, their honesty and their

sin cerity.
The high and cruel price which the principal
democracies are paying for the false leadership
given to, themn should deter our leaders from
making the slightest alteration in the facts
which they communicate to the public in these
tragic days. I trust that those who will be
charged with the publicity suggested by the
committee will be conscientious men who
recognize the great evil, the vile abuse. which
has distorted the national sense in order to
serve the iriterests of cliques and to give a
dangerous domination to fanatîcal partisanship. Let us hope that our radio publicity
will be better than it bas been. Canada, like
the Allies, is now suffering from the effeets of
a brand of publicity which has often been
helpful to the enemy and harmful to, us.
For more than a year before the war the
cinema showed us the formidable strength of
Germany to such an extent that the spectators
wondered in advance how England and France
could possibly resust the enemny and why they
should go to war.
Let us hope that the campaign suggested
by the committee will be undertaken and
carried out with discernment anid with a sound

understanding of the situation. Let us hope
also that this publieity will not involve us in
exaggerated or unnecessary expense. At this
time, the people are set against ail wasteful

expenditure; they want to see every possible
dollar saved. It is with this hope that 1
support the motion of the honourable member
from Montarville.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, my honourable friend who bas just
addressed us in a language familiar to him and
to mysoîf, bas expressed a desire that the
campaign suggested by the report should be
condueted hy having men of standing and
sound judgment address the publie over the

radio. It so happens that I intended to lay
before the Senate a statement whicha I have
received from the Associate Director of Public
Information, Mr. Claude Mélançon, in response
to my request for the names of the speakers
who have participated in the work which we
ahl have at heart, that of getting all the people
behind the movement to win the war. I arn
sure my honourable friend will agree wjth
me that the gentlemen are such as he himself would have selected, and I hope the work
they are to carry on ini co-operation with us
will be of the same high standard. This is a
list of the gentlemen who have broadcast
periodically over the C.B.C. French network:
is Eminence Cardinal Villeneuve, Hon.
A. Godbout, Prime Minister, and Hon. Maurice
Du]plessis, Leader of the Opposition, of Quebec;
Rt. Hon. Ernest Lapointe, Minister of Justice,
and Hon. Onésime Gagnon, Ex-Minister of the
Crown;
Raoul Trépanier, President of the Trades and
Labour Council (International Unions), and
Alfred Charpentier, Treasurer of the Federation
of Catholic Union Workers of Canada (Roman
Catholie Syndicates).

Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: They have ail accepted
an invitation te, address the province of Quebec?
They have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
already spoken over the C.B.C. French network.
Henri C. Bois, President of the Agronomist
Filion,
and
of
Corporation the Qnebec, Union Gerard
of Farmers;
Catholie
Secretary of
Hon. J. E. Michaud, Minister of Fisheries,
and Hon. Senator C. P. Beaubien;
Noel Fauteux, Assistant Editor-in-Chief of
La Presse, Montreal, and Eugene L'Heureux,
Editor-in-Chief of L'Action Catholique, Quebec.
Mr. Mélançon writes me:
A special programme was also orgf.anized laut
Sunday night to enable Right Hon. Ernest
Lapointe and Hon. P. J. A. Cardin t. drs
a special message to the French Canadians on1
the new conscription law for the defence of
Canada.

SENATE
When they could be procured on time, al]
of these speeches have been translated into
F<glish and circulated through the Press across
Caiiada. Of course. the French texts have been
given to the Freneh press.
I am confident that the programmes and
those who participated in them are such as
will meet with my honourable friend's warm
approval.
I may say that on Sunday last, on the eve
of the feast of the patron saint of French
Canadians, the Right Hon. Minister of Justice
and Hon. Mr. Cardin spoke to the province
of Quebec over the radio, and their speeches
were highly praised. The honourable member
knows them very well.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I know what they have
declared in the past, but not what they may
say in the future.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Apparently my
honourable friend did not listen to those
gentlemen last Sunday.
That was on a programme of Tous pour la
Victoire-All for Victory. I have the following communication from Mr. Lash, Director of
the Bureau of Public Information:
The "Carry On, Canad.a!" programme, originated by the Director of Publie Information,
bas seived two purposes. It was used first
as a clearing-house for ideas for organizations
and individuals engaged in or anxious to do
war work. Since the invasion of the Lowlands
its purpose bas been to promote national unity,
raise morale and to inspire confidence in our
ultimate victory.
It bas a tremendously large audience, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
not only in Canada, but in the United States.
From the United States it bas brought a
number of inquiries for information on how
to invest money in Canadian war loans and
war savings certificates, and it bas also brougit
voluntary contributions of money. The latest
was a one thousand dollar United States bearer
bond with two unclipped coupons attached.
I had intended to mention this in answer
to the statement of my honourable friend. I
would draw the attention of honourable
senators to what they can do if they take
advantage of their attendance here during the
session. As my honourable friends will realize,
Quebec has been well served by gentlemen in
all walks of life, religious, civil and political.
Honourable members from the province intend
to get into touch with other persons who may
be ready to carry on the good work done by
His Eminence Cardinal Villeneuve and the
other gentlemen whose names I have mentioned. My view is that honourable members
of the Senate should meet in provincial groups
and see what they can do to further the good
work in their respective provinces. I hope
that net only will they offer their own services,
but they will also persuade other persons of
standing in their community to give radio
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

addresses that will stimulate war work and
inspire confidence in ultimate victory. I would
say that sometimes the shortest address carries
farthest. The address should be crisp, and
should voice in no uncertain tone the views of
the speaker.
If honourable gentlemen would read the
report quietly they would learn what they can
do to further the good cause. I am sure
there are enough honourable members from
each of the provinces to make it possible for
them to confer among themselves and to
accomplish much before the end of the session.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, I rise to express my appreciation of
what my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Sauvé)
bas just said. He approves of the purpose of
the committee, as explained in the report,
provided that those who are called upon to
carry out that purpose are well informed,
competent, honest and sincere.
It is the
intention of the committee, as is clearly
shown by the terms of its report, to secure
the assistance of prominent men, more
particularly of honourable members of this
House, in carrying on this work.
I feel
confident that my honourable friend will be
glad to share in an undertaking which is so
necessary and urgent.
The tyrannical governments of Germany
and Italy have destroyed ail liberty in those
lands, and everyone there is compelled to
click his heels and do what he is told unless
he wishes to sec the inside of an interrment
camp or face a firing squad. Nevertheless,
although those governments do not need the
support of public opinion, they have gone to
an almost fantastic length in their system of
propaganda. What can we rely upon in this
country, where liberty is complete? How can
we have a united body of public opinion unless
the people are thoroughly informed as to the
danger which is now facing them? In my
opinion this danger has come very much
closer to ns since the heroic resistance of
France and the lamentable defeat of that country. The British fleet will now have to form
a chain of steel to protect the British Isles,
and that it will be able as in the past to
protect our shoreisL very doubtful. Consequently we shall have to depend to a much
greater degree upon ourselves. It seems to me,
therefore, that the people must be informed.
To give thorough enlightenment to this country from ocean to ocean, with its population of cleven millions, is a very difficult task,
and everyone must shore in it. That is why
the committee appeals to every member of this
House to join in this work, so as to enable
the people of the country, in a collective way,

JUNE 26, 1940
to put forth the effort which will be required of
them.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators,
I did not know it was the intention of the
honourable gentleman to close the debate,
and, as he rose before I had an opportunity
to do so, I would ask permission to add just
a few remarks to what bas already been said.
I shall not take up much of your time,
because, as was said by Mr. Noel Fauteux the
other day, this is a time not for words, but
for action.
Paragraph 3 of the report says:
It is the unanimous view of your committee
thiat the efforts of honourable members of this
House should be directed towards bringing
about in Canada a much more general, and,
if possible, universal, appreciation of the peril
Canada, as Canada, is in; of the indescribable
catastrophe defeat would bring to each and
all of the people of our country, and of the
immediate, imperative need that every citizen,
young or old, become animated and possessed
by a sense of duty and of sacrifice to the end
that we may ensure the preservation of our
institutions and of our nation.
Honourable members have noticed the
words, " the peril of Canada." By those words
is meant also the peril of England, of the
British Empire, of dernocracy-of civilization
as we know it and want it.
To avoid this peril we must realize its
existence and be willing and ready to prevent
it. Have all Canadians a knowledge of this
danger? I think that for the larger part of
our population we may answer yes to this
question, but some people, happily few in
number, have to be educated to and persuaded
of the existence of this peril. The present
committee will help to find the best methods
for this education and persuasion. Its report
outlines the work already done in that respect.
To be willing and ready to defend Canada
means that we must be prepared. Are we
prepared? There are many who assert that
precious time bas been lost, and that the
state of our defences should be more advanced.
Many others retort that we have done everything that could be dons. Let us forget these
differences of opinion. Our main consideration now should be to do to-day whatever
bas to be done, and not to defer it until tomorrow.
We now realize what it means to be unprepared. But do we know what it means not
to be told the truth about whether or not we
are ready? Look at France to-day. For the
first time in the many centuries of ber history
the France of Charlemagne, of Louis XIV,
of Napoleon, of Clemenceau and Foch, is
on ber knees and in shackles. She bas been
beaten before; she bas known wars lasting
thirty years, and wars of one hundred years;

she has lost territory, been through revolutions, and experienced the dark days of
1870; but never before bas she known the
horrors of slavery, which she is experiencing
now. Why? True, the reason is that she
was not ready, but still truer is it that she
did not know she was not prepared.
Let me illustrate this by a few facts of
During
which I have personal knowledge.
the months of February and March of last
year I was in France. You will remember
how acute the European situation was at
that time. It was so acute that one morning
my good friend Colonel Vanier, our Canadian
Minister, advised me to take the first boat
for home. A few days later, at a dinner given
me by a French banker who had very close
connections with the French Government,
I met, among others, the Prefect of the
Department of Seine and Oise and a French
deputy who this year became Minister of
Finance in the Reynaud Cabinet. Surely, if
anyone had been in possession of the facts,
these men must have been. But you should
have heard their conversation about France's
state of preparedness, their assurance of victory
in the event of war. With the British Empire
as their ally they could and would fight any
European combination.
Now let me read to you a few paragraphs
of a letter written to me just after the
beginning of the war:
Less liard pressed than on other days, I have
been able to spend one morning in my office,
and this has given me the opportunity to write
you a few words less hurried than the previous
ones. I have not had a moment of rest since
the beginning of hostilities. The week-ends
have ceased in every department of the State
Administration, and the hours of attendance
are unlimited. I had urgent work to do where
I am mobilized, but now I have a brief moment
of respite and I am able to contact my friends
agam.
What most characterizes the atmosphere of
France is the absence of hatred and of "cinema"
scenery, which generally go with the beginning
of hostilities. The Press did not elevate its
tone, and among the people we perceive only a
cold, unflinching resolution to go on to the end.
That end is the elimination of a German regime
which compels our yearly mobilization, which
creates sentiments of insecurity in France and
in our colonies; a regime which is such that
we cannot undertake or project anything and
which creates a negation, noisy, aggressive and
brutal, of the ideas, customs, modes of living,
which are dear to us. Since on the other side
of the Vosges this frenzy has steadily increased,
and even the right-thinking Germans-there are
some, but they are strangled-have been
nervous about the aims of Nazi-ism, a war
appeared unavoidable. Under the circumstances,
feeling ready, we had to fall to arms, as every
peaceful means of living with our German
neighbours bad expired.
France has all the trumps in ber hands to
win the war, and France knows how to use the
advantages that Providence gave ber so

our competent generals, who are not looking
for a vain personal glory, our strong financial
structure, our historical traditions, our democratie ideology, reflected in our customs and
institutions-all this is not improvised under a
-ertain regime. The France of all time, France
eternal, bas nothing to fear when she is France.
You have seen, my dear Senator, iow we get
rid of Communism in France when Communism
is attacking our sentiments to the core. The
Italians have made showy Fascism; the Germans paraded their tanks in the streets of
Berlin; the Spaniards have been able to counteract Communism at the price of a murderous

civil war. Here, by one Order in Council of our
Ministers everything was ended; ended better
than in Italy, Germany and Spain. And these
gentlemen of Moscow had forty-three members
and two senators in our Parliament, they controlled hundreds of municipal councils and
owned a very large number of periodicals and
even daily newspapers. All this vas ended in
twenty-four heurs, and it will te forgotten

to-morrow just as though it had never existedand it was ended with one stroke of the pen.
No doubt the Germans will start active
military operations against our front. They
may implore and secure the military help of
Stalin, and we know that this will increase
the strength, already so great, of the German
armies. Italy may one day, contrary to our
hopes, forget that she is the mother country
of Roman Law and the domicile of the Church..
This vould lengthen our front. We know all
this. The fate of arms may fluctuate
i a

war which may be long. We have seen that
also on numerous occasions in the course of
our thousand years of history, but France tas
never perished. Difficulties have only made
lier greater and elevated her to undreamed of
heights, owing to the patriotism of ber sons,
the result of that immense and mysterious
work of fusion which tas taken place in the
oven of Christian
Latinity
through
long
centuries of glory and the enttusiasm of millions

probable allies may come: we are waiting for
them.
Tell your colleagues of the Senate and of the
House of Commons, tell each and all of the
French Canadians, that with us they are defending a very holy cause.
May I now place upon Hansard my reply
to that letter, written early in November? It
is as follows:
Your letter of the 9th of October last reaches
me at Ponteix, where I have been for the last

two weeks. I thank you for the fortitude it
gives me, because faith in the result of the war
permeates it. If I were in Montreal, I would
take the liberty of communicating it to our
people, for it tlirows a strong light on the real
causes of the war.

If all -are not willing to go to the front,
everyone at least is wilýling to help in some
other particular way to ensure a lasting
triumph. Net only are we hoping for this
victory, of which you are so sure, but we

certainty.
We are happy to see the unity which now

reigns over France. As you say, one Order in
Couneil, one stroke of the pen, and the opposition vanishes. The seven heads of the Communist dragon are cut off. The danger and the
fight are reviving patriotism and tempering
energies.
During my short stay in Paris I noticed a
strong determination te make an end of the
matter. This I observed not only from what

yen told me, but through conversations with
people I met at the hotel or in the cafés or
on your boulevards. The chauffeur who drove
me every morning seemed to me the synthesis

On the notice of inquiry by Hon. Mr. Black:
In view of the fact that the Ford Motor
Co. of the U.S.A. have refused to manufacture
plane engines for the British Government:
1. Has the Government of Canada discontinued the purchase of all Ford cars and
equipment?
2. Has the said Government prohibited the
sale of Ford cars in Canada, and if not, does
the Government of Canada propose to take
such action?

will he withdraw it?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The question stands.
It is an inquiry for information.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps I can
satisfy my honourable friend by telling him
that the same question was put in the House
of Commons, where Mr. Howe, Minister of
Munitions and Supply, said:
The facts of the situation are, I tliink, that
the coimnittee recentIy appointed by the

that we should take soime action, but after
considering the matter and inquiring into the
position of the Ford Motor Company of
Canada, I have come to the conclusion that
this matter is something with regard to which
we should be slow to move. I was amazed
that Henry Ford would take such a position
as he has taken, but it seems to me that in
endeavouring to strike at him we should be
in great danger of hitting our own people.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

I have been
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
assured, by people who are in a position to
know, that more than half the stock of the
Ford Motor Company of Canada is owned
by Canadians. Net only that, but in every
town and village of any importance through-

237

JUNE 27, 1940
out this country there are Ford dealers, whose
money is invested in their establishment and
in Ford cars and parts. If we took any action
it would have no particular effect upon Henry
Ford, and would injure many of our own
people. Even if we took no legislative action,
if we by a discussion here created throughout
the country a feeling which caused the people
to think it was in the public interest to boycott Ford products, that would be a great
mistake. Believing that, I have taken the
liberty of making these remarks.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I dissociate myself from the statement of Mr. Ford. I cannot think there is
anyone who regrets it more than I do. But
what has been said by the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and by the honourable
gentleman from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) is the truth. A very large proportion
of the stock of the Ford Motor Company of
Canada is owned by the public, and I think,
although I cannot say definitely, that nearly
all the owners are Canadians. I wish to emphasize also what the honourable senator from
South Bruce says about the Ford dealers in
Canada. They are numbered in the hundreds.
Hon. Mr. COPP:

And their employees.

Hon. Mr. LITTLE:
employees?

Yes, what about their

And the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
number of employees of these dealers is very
large. The ramifications are tremendous. For
all the purposes concerning us, the company
is a Canadian concern, and I can add to the
assurance given by the honourable leader of
the House my own feeling that there are no
better Canadians than those at the head of the
Ford Motor Company of Canada and throughout that company's organization. They will
assist us to the utmost in our war work.
Ion. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I agree almost entirely with what has just
been said by the right honourable leader
on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
and the honourable gentleman from South
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly). However, resentment against Mr. Henry Ford is still in my
heart and, I think, in the hearts of most
Canadians. My remarks of yesterday were
directed more particularly at the head of the
great Ford Motor Company of the United
States, Mr. Ford himself, who poses as a
sincere propagandist for peace, but yet is not
for peace when the British Empire is concerned. I do not desire to create any hardship for Ford dealers and employees in this
country. Far from it. Part of my reason
for taking the stand I did is that, although

Canadians own a large proportion of the
stock of the Ford Motor Company of Canada-I myself am interested in a small waythe controlling stock, the A stock, is held by
Mr. Ford.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, not by
Mr. Ford himself. A small proportion of the
stock-as to just how small it is, my memory
does not serve me-is called B stock, and that,
I understand, is controfled by the Ford Motor
Company of the United States.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: And it is the voting
stock.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is the
voting stock. But the ownership of the company is in the A stock to a far greater degree
than in the B stock, and this A stock is mostly
held by Canadians.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Which stock controls
the company?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Under the
old law, which was in effect when the company
was formed, it was permissible to make a
certain stock the only voting stock, and that
could be a very small issue, if desired. If
my memory is right, that is what was done
in this case. Therefore the control is in the
Ford Motor Company of the United States,
although holders of the big issue, the A stock,
own the company. A change was later made
in the law, and all stock issued since then must
have a vote.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF BRITISH NORTH
AMERICA ACT-ADDRESS TO HIS MAJESTY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Dandurand for an Address to His Majesty
the King, praying for the passage of an Act
to amend the British North America Act, 1867,
relating to unemployment insurance.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I moved adjournment of the debate
because I understood someone eise on this
side of the House wanted to take part in the
debate. I believe the intention now is to
adjourn it until the next sitting.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose my
right honourable friend's remarks will not ba
of a contentious nature.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Anything I
say should never be contentious.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: But always is.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Sometimes
the controversial impetuosity of the honourable leader of the House and others make
it so.
I hoped that the suggestion I made yesterday would be seriously reviewed, but I do not
think the Government yet appreciate the
importance of that suggestion as regards the
future. It may be that we can get through
with the present matter more hastily by the
course which the Government propose, but
if we take that course now it will be a precedent which will control our actions hereafter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my right
honourable friend allow me to say that it
evidently has taken him five years, that is,
from 1935, to develop his own proposal?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was suggested yesterday that the method which I
now propose could have been used back in
1935 if the Government of the day had believed in it. Had there been any doubt in
their minds with respect to the course they
were taking, they would have cast around for
another form of procedure. They felt no
doubt. I know I felt none. On the contrary,
I believed the position .then taken to be a
sound one, and but for the Privy Council's
decisions I should be just as certain of my
ground to-day.
I wish to add this to my remarks of yesterday. As I urged then, it is not a sound
principle to go to the Throne for an amendment when you can get what you are after
under provisions which obviously are designed
for such a purpose. We have not much excuse
for asking the Imperial Parliament to enact a

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, not if I can
help it. For the information of honourable
senators I may say that the resolution containing the draft Bill to be presented to the
Imperial Parliament has been cabled over,
with a statement that it should not be
presented until the Senate of Canada has
given its assent. The Prime Minister would
very much like to be able to send word that
this assent has been given. I should be sorry
indeed if we had to meet here to-morrow and
next week simply to pass this resolution. It
is the only thing standing between us and an
adjournment of the Senate.

will pass the measure. But if we can get a
similar result under section 94, we ought to
do se. I think we can get, net the same,
but a better, result under that section. I shall
give the main reason later. The first reason
is that by invoking section 94 we open the
door to an avenue along which we may deal

House may prefer.

such excursions just as certainly as we are a

Council since 1896, have been declared beyond
our pýower. We as a nation cannot operate
without power to enact such law. We may for
a time, but we are bound to apply to the
hnperial Parliament again. If we open the
door and establish access to this avenue, we
are in just a2 solid a position as we ever can
be. That is ail we have to, do at any time
in order to take care of our own troubles
without asking for the intervention of another
Parliament.
That is what I urged yesterday, and I urge
it again now. The honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) said that
questions of constituational law would arise as
to any Unemployment Insurance Bill we
might pass. I do not doubt it. There always
will be questions of law. You include unemployment insurance in your federal powers,
and the whole matter is open f0 dispute as to
how far you can, go. Unemployment insurance involves a good deal more than just
insurance; there will have f0 be ail sorts of
office and other services. You neyer can close
the door on the possibility of question being
raised on some legal point in relation to any
course you may take, but I do nof believe
any conclusive argument can be advanced
againsf the Dominion availing itself of a
clause so obviously designed for such a case
as this, where we desire uniformify in the
operation of unemployment insuýrance throughouf the Dominion. There cannof be any valid
objection urged on that ground.
I wish now to refer f0 something that I
did not mention when the Employment and
Social Insurance Act of 1935 was before us.
One of rny reasons for feeling so certain that
we were wifhin our powers was that in the
measure then brought down-and withoùf
doubt this resolution will be followed by
a similar measure-we were flot legislating
as respects uncmployment insurance. Now,
thougli, we are asking for power so to legislafe.
Then we were not passing a law to determine the rights of Canadian cifizens and
companies f0 engage in unemployment insurance business.
That is unemploymenf
insurance legislation. Our Insurance Acf is
insurance legislation. Why? Because it
determines in relation f0 insurance the
respective rights, liahilifies and penalties of
mnsured and insurer, or of one company and
another. An Unemployment Insurance Bill
would be a similar measure invading the
field of unemployment insurance and determining the rigbts of insured and insurer, or
of one company in a certain field, as f0 how
far if might occupy that field, and so on; in
short, dealing with rights of our citizens in
relation f0 that subjeef. nhe legisiation we
passed in 1935 was nof that at aIl. We

passed a Bill to enable Canada to, operate
an insurance business. I have neyer had any
doubt in my mind that Canada, as Canada,
could engage in any business. There is no
statutory restriction on that right. We were
not legislating as respects unemployment
insurance; we were going into the business.
Because the business has f0 do with unemploymenf insurance, if does nof follow
we cannot go into it. Is there anything in
the British North America Act to say we
can go into the business of insuring old
people againsf poverty and sickness? There
is not. But we go info that business by
authority of Parliament. Nobody disputes
our right to insure old people. Suppose
under our plan for insuring old people we
said: "We will insure only those persons
hefween the ages of thirty and sixty-five who
pay us 50 cents a week, and on their
attaining the age of sixfy-five we will pay
thcm so much a month for the rest of theïr
lives."
Will anybody argue that that is
insurance legislation and beyond our powers?
Nobody would so argue. We were nof legislating in respect of insurance business at
ail. We were jusf tfling John Smith that
if hie paid so much a week until hie was
sixfy-five years of age, we would then give
him so much a month for the resf of bis
life. Thaf is precisely .what we did do in
t he old unemployment insurance Act, and if
is precisely wbat this Government intends
to do now-f0 go into the business itself
in order f0 provide the people of Canada
wîf h unemployment insurance. We do not
need to legislafe in respect of unemployment insurance at ail, but by this proposed
resolution we are seeking power to do so.
The Privy

240

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Certainly.
We could be employers of all the people of
the Dominion if we so desired. For example,
we could dig canals and establish stores.
We are not invading any constitutional right
of the provinces. I submit it is far better to
go into the unemployment insurance business
by proceeding under section 94. By doing so
we are not changing the British North America
Act in any respect; certainly we are not
changing it in order to obtain power in the
field of unemployment insurance, where in
reality we do not need any at all, where we
have no intention of legislating, and I am
sure the Government have none. By passing
an Unemployment Insurance Bill we are giving
unemployinent insurance service ourselves.
That is all we ever thought of doing. Therefore I think the Government should hesitate
to ask for an amendment of the Constitution
of Canada to bring within the ambit of our
authority a phase of legislation that in reality
we have no intention of utilizing after we
get it. Just pass your law reciting section 94.
Then there will be no hesitation on the part
of provincial legislatures in adopting that
law. I venture to say there will be no hesitation at all on the part of Quebec. Quebec
will then be master in its own house. It will
have to pass a law acceptable to the Dominion,
and the Dominion will under contract
administer that law and pay all the costs of
admsinistration.
As the honourable senator from Vancouver
South said, the provinces cannot delegate to
the Dominion any constitutional jurisdiction
they now have. They cannot even delegate to
the Dominion powers to make orders under

thenselves of any constitutional rights. We
are net suggesting they should. All we are
asking the provinces to do is to make the
Dominion their agent. In this respect I have
never heard the power of the provinces or
the Dominion questioned. Such an arrangement is made now in more fields than one.
Make it in this field and you will have the
whole field, with the powers you already
possess and those you are se eager to obtain.
By this means you can, within your own
Dominion, so adjust federal and provincial

honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris). I am in accord with the
right honourable gentleman when he says
it would be desirable to take action by way of
legislating on unemployment insurance without having to appeal to the British Parliament.
I would suggest-my suggestion may not be
received with much favour-that the proper
way to correct the present position is for the
Parliament of Canada to have the right to

Government has adopted. The other is to

methods will embody what, to my mind, is a
vital element of this proposed legislation?
For years unemployment insurance legislation
has been held up by reason of the fact that
we have not been able to reach uniformity in
all the provinces. The essential element of
this measure is that the Parliament of Canada
shall have final jurisdiction in respect of unemployment insurance. I contend that the
resolution now before us is the only way in
which you can obtain that uniformity. Take
for example the method suggested by my
right honourable friend, that by virtue of
section 94 we should pass an unemployment
insurance measure. Then eaeh of the provinces, except Quebec, would have to consent-

Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
I listened yesterday, perhaps with some profit,
to the remarks of the right honourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen),
though I did net agree with them in their
entirety. I may say that I did in large
measure agree with the reply made by the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By just one
word-"adopted."

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Adopt.

Hon. Mr. EULER: All right. Each of the
provinces, except Quebec, would have to
adopt the federal legislation word for word.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Each provincial legislature would have to adopt the federal Act.
I think it very doubtful that all the legislatures would do so, though to-day we have the
consent of all the nine provinces to this

JUNE 27, 1940
proposed amendment of the British North
America Act. If you delay now, there is no
saying what may occur within a year, for you
could not, under my right honourable friend's
plan, get the legislation through the legislatures within that time. Some may not meet
until next year. Then you might have an
election in one of the provinces and a new
Government returned, which might refuse to
adopt the federal legislation, and so, as to
that province, uniformity would be destroyed.
But suppose all the provinces with the
exception of Quebec-which I shall deal with
later-do adopt the federal legislation. In the
light of experience it is absolutely certain that
after the Act has been in operation for some
time amendments will be found desirable.
It may be that once the provinces have
adopted the federal legislation we shall also
be empowered to make any amendments
without consulting the provinces. There may
be some doubt as to that. I am not lawyer
enough to say.
But a further vital factor comes into the
question. In the case of the province of
Quebec the procedure must be different. If
you are going to have general uniformity, the
province of Quebec must enact a statute in
absolute conformity with the one passed by
the Federal Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In practical
uniformity, yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Now, if the province
of Quebec must pass its own statute, I should
say, though not a lawyer, that it would also
be within the competence of the legislature
of that province to amend or repeal that
statute.
It might repeal the legislation
altogether, or it might amend it from time to
time in such a way as to destroy the unifornity
which is so desirable. It might, in the first
instance, adopt the law we have adopted;
it might then find it desirable to make certain
modifications to that law, and there would
be nothing to prevent it from doing so.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable gentleman permit me? He has
been fairly right up to the present. If the
province of Quebec passed an Act in substantial conformity with the general Act, there
would be some agency to which the Dominion
would consent. There would then be a
contract whereby the Dominion would undertake to operate the Act as the agent of the
province. After that, if the province of
Quebec chose to repeal the Act, there would
be no unemployment insurance in Quebec.
If it amended the Act, and the Dominion
agreed to the amendment, all right. But
the province of Quebec would always have to

241

choose between coming to terms, which would
be the same as the terms between the other
provinces and the Dominion, and being in the
position of having no unemployment insurance.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is quite true.
Once the other provinces have agreed to the
legislation there is no divided jurisdiction;
there is uniformity throughout Canada, except
for the province of Quebec. I still think the
province of Quebec could repeal the original
Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And do without insurance.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Quite so. I think it is
most undesirable that any province should
have authority or power, either by repeal or
by amendment, to destroy uniformity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It could not
destroy uniformity. It could get out, though
it would be helping to pay for the rest.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That would destroy
uniformity.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If Quebec put into its
Act an amendment which was at variance with
the federal law, would that not destroy
uniformity?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. The
Dominion would not operate it at all.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I think it is very
undesirable to have any part of Canada under
separate jurisdiction. That is the very thing
which has been delaying the enactment of
unemployment insurance. You could not get
power to legislate in the different provinces.
It seems to me that is a conclusive argument
in favour of my point of view.
I am quite sure that if unemployment insurance were forced on the province of Ontario
and the province of Quebec did not come in,
some of our industrialists in the province of
Ontario would say they were at a disadvantage
as compared with the manufacturers of
Quebec; their expense of operation, by reason
of unemployment dues, would be greater than
in the province of Quebec, and they would
therefore be at a disadvantage. Surely honourable members appreciate that the whole
difficulty has been due to the fact that we
have not been able to get uniformity. Unemployment insurance has been the policy of
various parties for years. It has been acknowl-

edged that such an undertaking, to be effective, must be nation-wide, and that all the
provinces must be on the same basis. In a
word, there must b uniformity. The only
way in which you an make certain of getting

95832-16
IMEDmON

242

SENATE

uniformity is, I maintain, to have unemployment insurance placed under one exclusive
jurisdiction. Once the Federal Government
has that jurisdiction and takes certain action,
the scheme will stand, and no one province
can interfere with it. That is my reason for
being strongly in faveur of the motion as we
have it before us.
If later on the contention of my right
honourable friend should be regarded as a
proper one, the passing of this particular resolution amending the British North America
Act with regard to unemployment insurance
would net, I think, prejudice the course the
right honourable gentleman desires us to follow, so far as any other social legislation is
concerned.
Honourable
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
senators, I listened with a great deal of interest
to the most ingenious suggestion made by the
right honourable gentleman yesterday afteirI have listened also to the debate
noon.
which succeeded that suggestion.
It seems te me there is one possible objection which may go to the very root of the
course of action proposed by the right honourable gentleman. He proposes that action be
taken under section 94 of the British North
America Act. Section 94 has never yet been
acted upon since Confederation. It has not
yet received any interpretation by the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. It is quite
conceivable, I think, that when that section
came to be interpreted by the Judicial Committee they would say it could net be applied
in the way in which the right honourable
gentleman wishes to have it applied.
Now, what was the situation at the time of
Confederation? There were four provincesOntario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The three English provinces, if I may
so denominate them, were more or less subject
in all their law to the common law of England.
The province of Quebec was subject to the
Civil Code of that province. The object of
section 94 was simply this: it was to say that
if the three English provinces wanted to get
together in respect of matters relating te the
common law of England they could do so, and
could have uniform legislation. If, for instance,
they wanted to have uniform laws with
respect to the registration of property, here
was a means by which they could give the
federal authority power to enact legislation of
that kind on their behalf.
As respects unemployment insurance, I can
well imagine the Judicial Committee saying
this: "Unemployment insurance is a subject
of legislation which was quite unknown at the
time of Confederation; it was not in the minds
of the framers of Confederation." I am quite
Hon. Mr. EULER.

sure they would have substantial grounds for
saying that section 94 was never intended to
apply to a new subject of legislation like
unemployment insurance, which in its very
essence is nation-wide.
So, if we adopted the suggestion of my
right honourable friend what would be the
situation, quite apart from the delay? In a
year's time we should have all the provinces
of the Dominion in agreement about this
legislation. Then action might be started in
the courts to determine whether this procedure
under section 94 was really valid or constitutional. The litigation, which would require two
or three years, would reach the Privy Council,
who might well decide that section 94 was
inapplicable to the situation, and four or five
years bence we should be back exactly where
I nay be wrong in my

proposition of the law; the Privy Council
might not render any such decision; but, as
my right honourable friend has said. the Privy
Counil in the last twenty or thirty years
have made decisions so strange that it is
well within the bounds of possibility that
they would say section 94 was not intended
for anything like new nation-wide legislation;
and in that case we should have spent a great
deal of time and energy in trying to do something. only to find that we had net donc it and
were back where we are now.
From that point of view, it seens to me
the suggestion of the Covernment to bring
unemployment insurance specifically witlin
the purview of section 91 is ideal. We pass

for the life of me I cannot conceive of any
scheme of unemployment insurance which
would cover them all. In certain cases, I
think, it would lead to things being done

Jones is employed in a saw-mill for five or
six months every year. When the season

farmers, go into the woods and work in the
winter-tinie, and go back to the Iarm in the
spring. In the fail, when it is time for men
to go to work in the woods, some of them
may say, 'Well, now, we will just let this
work slide for a month or two, and we will
get a position there later on." But the work
cannot wait for them, and ofhers have to be
employed.
There are so mnany difficulties in the way
of its operation, that 1 fail to see how
unemployment insurance can be made to
apply to seasonal workers.
Perhaps while I arn on my feet I may he
allowed to ask the honourable leader of the
Government how it is proposed to collect the
new national defence tax from this same
class of people. I hope there will be a
ruling before long, because I understand
employers ivill be required to make their
calculations as from the first of July. I
cannot get it inf o my head bow an employer
wi]l be able to estimate in advance a fax
bàsed on the annual earnings of men who
work only part of the year. I believe this
tax will probably bring in a large amount
of money to help pay for defending our
country, and my only point is that a ruling
should be made for the guidance of employers of seasonal labour, and the ruling
should be sent to ail sucb employers as
soon as possible.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, there is one point I should like
cleared up in connection with the proposaI
made by the right honourable leader across
the loor (Righf Hon. Mr. Meighen). As I
undersfand it, he would have the Parliament
of Canada enact an unemployment insurance measure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: And leave it to
each. province to accept or reject that
mneasure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
Weil, 1 doubt
if any province would accept the measure
until safisfied that fhe other provinces also
would accept it. An industry operating in
the province of Alberta, let us say, where
fthe Unemployment Insurance Act was in
force, would be handicapped as compared
wvith a similar industry ini British Columbia
if the Act were not in force there. Alberta
would hesitate to place any of its indus~tries
at Ruch a disadvantage, and se, would every

243

other province. But under fhe Government's
plan, which is now before us, the law would
ho made uniform in ail the provinces at the
same time.
Riýght Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I presumne,
if we proceeded as I suggest, our Bill would
confain a clause providing that the law
should corne into effect by proclamation, and
either there would be a statement in the
Bill itself-this I would flot recommendthat the proclamation would flot issue until
eight provinces had, in the language of
section 94, adopf cd our Act, or the Government would stafe to Parliament that the
proclamation would not issue until the eight
provinces had done so.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Then any one province
could prevent the measure from becoming law.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
Would that
method not delay the bringing of unemployment insurance into effeet?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I assume
that if the nine provinces are now willing
to give us jurisdiction a great dýeal wider
than it would be under the plan I propose,
they would be prepared to support that
plan.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
Ail the provinces have consented to the Government'splan.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How do they
give their consent? Have the legisiatures
acted, or only the governments?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The governments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They could
withdraw their consent before the Address
reached London.
I should like f0 know, as a matter of
interest, how the provinces have agreed to
this Address. What authority is behind the
consent in each case?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Government of each province bas authorized the
Prime Minister of the province ta agree.
It is the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in
each province.

CABINET CHANGES-REVIEW OF WAR
ORGANIZATION OF THE
GOVERNMENT
STATEMENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, as I have said before, it is a truism
that this Chamber is entitled to all important
information which reaches the House of Commons. This afternoon the Prime Minister
made a statement to the other House. The
first part is an epitome of what the Government has done since the beginning of the
war, and it contains the names of the gentlemen who are helping in carrying on the work
of the varions departments. With the leave
of the House I will place this on Hansard.
This is the first part of the Prime Minister's
statement:
On different occasions, the Leader of the
Opposition bas drawn attention to ways and
means of increasing the effectiveness of Canada's
war effort.
This is an aim which is shared by all honourable members of Parliament. By none wili
constructive suggestions, calculated to contribute
to its fulfilment, be welcomed more cordially
than by my colleagues and myself.

245

The particular ways and means to this end
which, at one time or another, were suggested
by the Leader of the Opposition have been the
enlisting of the services of "the best men":
(a) In executive and administrative posts,
particularly in those branches of government
which have to do with the prosecution of
Canada's war effort;
(b) In an advisory capacity, where not
possible to have their services enlisted either
in whole or in part in executive or administrative posts;
(c) In the Government itself.
By "the best men" is meant, I think I may
assume, persons whose services or advice are
available, and who, all circumstances considered, appear best suited for the positions it
is necessary or desirable to fill.
It bas also been urged by the Leader of the
Opposition that the work of the Cabinet should
be so arranged as to free as largely as possible
from other duties, Ministers of the Crown who
preside over those departments of government
which are primarily concerned with war activities in order that the time and attention of
these Ministers may be given as exclusively as
possible to a consideration of war policies and
their effective prosecution.
A review of what, in fact, lias actually been
accomplished will make clear that it is precisely along these lines that from the very outset
the Government bas been proceeding. We have
not sought to do everything at once, thereby
involving unwarrantable expenditure, and having, as the war has progressed, to undo much
that should never have been done; or, what
is worst of all, by premature action, creating
problems and situations more difficult of
solution than those we have been called upon
to meet. Rather.have we sought to anticipate.
as far in advance as was possible, the problems
which were certain or likely to arise in the
progress of the war, and to prepare as far in
advance as was possible for the meeting of each
new situation as it might arise, taking, when
the right moment came, the additional measures
required to deal effectively with it. These
additional measures to meet new situations as
they have arisen, have involved bringing continuously into the service of the State and to
the aid of the Ministry, in an executive,
administrative or advisory capacity, available
persons of outstanding ability and experience.
It is along these lines that we shall continue
to seek to meet each new situation as it is
born of the exigencies and demands of the war.
In speaking on these matters, the Leader of
the Opposition called attention to the following statement which I made in the course of
the general elections held at the beginning of
this year:
"With the war and its problems growing in
intensity and magnitude. I shall seek. if we
are returned to power, to bring to the aid of
the Ministry, in an advisory capacity, a still
larger number of men of outstanding ability
and experience whose services in one way or
arother might be made available to the State,
and add strength to the administration of our
policies. How best their services might be
consolidated and used whether (a) in an
immediate association with the War Cabinet,
or (b) with a member of the Cabinet. intimately associated with its war activities, is
something that I would like to consider with
my colleagues before the next Parliament
reassembles."

AUXILIARY

DEPARTMENT

SERVICES

Early in October, 1939, a Directorate of
Auxiliary Services was set up in the Department of National Defence to co-ordinate and
facilitate the work of the various agencies
promoting the welfare of the men in the
Service.

Brigadier W. W. Foster President of the
Canadian Legion, was calfed upon to serve
as Director. The work of the Auxiliary Services has increased with the growth of our
armed forces, and more and more representatives of the voluntary organizations have come
to work in active co-operation with Service
officials in the conduct of this work.
Besides the organization at headquarters
in Canada and in each of the military districts, an overseas organization has been
established at Canadian Military Headquarters whici includes representatives of the four
principal voluntary organizations, the Canadian Legion, Y.M.C.A., Salvation Army and
Knights of Columbus. Each of these bodies
also has representatives working with the
First Division. The Government has undertaken to provide the pay and expenses of a
portion of these overseas workers.

DEPARTMENT OF MUNITIONS AND SUPPLY

I shall refer a little later on to the genesis
and evolution of the Department of Munitions
and Supply from a purchasing board associated,
before the war, with the Department of Finance,
and later, at the commencement of the war, as
a War Supply Board under the supervision of
the Minister of Transport, to the present fullfledged Department of Munitions and Supply.
For the moment it is sufficient for me to recall
that the department itself was duly established
on April 9, at which date the existing organization of the War Supply Board was absorbed into
the new Department of Munitions and Supply.
In no branch of the public service has need for
rapid expansion and the enlistment of services
of able executives and persons possessed of
special knowledge been greater than in that
concerned with the production of munitions and

relation particularly to the branch of the
department concerned with the air forces and
the development of the British Commonwealth
Air Training Plan. The Government was fortunate in securing for this all-important post
the services of Mr. James S. Duncan, VicePresident and General Manager of MasseyHarris Limited, Toronto, one of the best
known and ablest industrial executives in
Canada. Mr. Duncan's appointment was made
on April 11.
On May 22, Parliament authorized the
establishment of a separate Ministry of
National Defence for Air and, on the day
following, the Honourable C. G. Power was
sworn in as Minister of the new department.
Since that date, the administrative staff
of the Department of National Defence for
Air has been further strengthened by the
following appointments:

other war supplies. The services of a large
proportion of those at present in these positions
have been enlisted since the new department
took over the work of the War Supply Board.
The administrative staff of the Department
of Munitions and Supply is, like other departments, presided over by a Deputy Minister.
There is, as well, an executive committee of
7 members. This committee migit lie compared
to a small cabinet concerned exclusively with
war supply. It meets from day to day; considers and decides upon matters of policy with
respect to production of munitions and other
war supplies as well as upon the best methods
of carrying out policies already determined.
The department is divided into a Purchasing
Branch, a Construction Branch and a number
of Production Branches for Aircraft, Shinbuilding, Munitions and Gauges and Chemicals
and Explosives.

248

SENATE

For the mobilization of supplies of raw
materials, Controllers of Metals, Timber, Oil
and Steel bave been appointed. These Controllers not only act individually, but collectively
constitute a War Industries Control Board
within the department.
On the administrative side the Deputy Minister is assisted by the Comptroller and Secretary and the officials of his branch.
A branch of the department is aiso being
organized for economie research and planning
required in order to maintain a constant and
uninterrupted development of ever-increasing
quantities of the materials of war.
The department has a Labour Liaison Officer
and Liaison Officers in New York and London.
Beyond the department itself, several nonprofit-making private organizations, fully owned
by the Government, bave been set up to carry
on special phases of the work. Speaking in the
House on June 4, the Minister of Munitions and
Supply explained the purpose of these companies
as follows:
"It
bas been found utterly impossible to
assemble in Ottawa a sufficient staff to hantdle
all the multiplicity of undertakings that the

department has in hand at tise present tine.
The Act provides that certain Government
owned and controlled companies shall be established and headed by business men chosen by the
Government who will be able to carry on certain
operations as companies rather than as part of
a departmental staff."
Each of these companies is being or will be
adininistered by a board of directors, chosen
from outstanding business men and industrialists.
At the present time within the Departinent
of Munitions and Supply there are, besides those
who are connected with these Government-owned
companies, some 65 persons serving in key
positions or as departmental heads, of which
number, 10 are outstanding permanent civil servants.
A list of departmental heads and key men in
tbe Department of Munitions and Supply was
placed on Hansard by the Minister on June
20. The names of the persons, whose services
have been classified in relation to their present
are as

Another company has been organized of which, as yet, no public announcement has been
made, which will be known as The Allied Supplies Limited. This company will be concerned
with administration of the munitions and explosives programme undertaken on behalf of the
British Government and of any joint British-Canadian developments which may be assigned
to it.

The officers will be:
Chairman...................
President...................

Directors:.....................

Hon. C. A. Dunning......... An ex-Minister of Finance in
the Federal Government.

E. A. Wilson.................. President and General Manager

It will be observed that the lists of persons
I have quoted contain the names of many
whose names, from one source or another, have
been mentioned as those of individuals whose
presence in the Cabinet might be expected
to add to the effectiveness of Canada's war
effort. I submit that in the positions in which
the services of the persons cited have been
enlisted their opportunity to be of service to
the State and effectively to aid the Ministry
(all circumstances considered) is relatively
greater than it might -be expected to be were
they members of the Ministry itself.
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

The appointments I have mentioned thus
far have been in the departménts immediately
concerned with military defence.
In the
administration of the departments and agencies
concerned with matters of economic defence
and internal security, the Government has likewise enlisted the services of equally representative groups of outstanding and specially
qualified persons. For instance:
In the Department of Finance, the executive
staff has been strengthened by the appointment of Professor W. A. Mackintosh, Head of
the Department of Political and Economic
Science of Queen's University, as special
assistant to the Minister. But much more
than in the work of the department itself,
the services and counsel of business and professional men have been sought in connection
with the organization and direction of campaigns for nationally offered war loans and
the sale of war savings certificates, and in the
vital and highly specialized work of the Foreign
Exchange Control Board.
WAR LOAN AND WAR SAVINGS CAMPAIGNS

To direct the campaign for the first publicly offered war loan, a National War Loan
Committee was set up under the chairmanship
95832-17J

of the Minister of Finance.
Serving on it
were five former Ministers of Finance:
Sir Thomas White
Sir Henry Drayton
Honourable C. A. Dunning
Right Honourable R. B. Bennett, and
Honourable E. N. Rhodes.
In addition were the Provincial Treasurers
of all nine provinces. In order to give the
committee as broadly representative a character as possible, some 225 prominent people in
all the provinces of Canada were added to the
membership.
To direct the more purely technical aspect
of the campaign, a National Subscription Committee of men connected with the securities
business was set up under the chairmanship
of Honourable C. A. Dunninz.
In the campaign for the sale of war savings
certificates, the Government has similarly
availed itself of the services of prominent
business and professional men.
A National War Savings Committee was set
up, of which Mr. W. H. Somerville, General
Manager of the Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada, and Mr. de Gaspé Beaubien,
a consulting engineer of Montreal, and a director
of several industrial companies, were appointed
as joint chairmen. Provincial chairmen were
selected as follows:
British Columbia, Christopher Spencer, Vancouver.
Alberta, John Burns, Calgarv.
Saskatchewan, W. G. Yule. Regina.
Manitoba, E. J. Tarr, K. C., Winnipeg.
Ontario, R. V. LeSueur, Toronto.
Quebec. Napoleon Charest, Montreal.
New Brunswick, George E. Barbour, Saint
John.
Nova Scotia, W. K. McKean, Halifax.
Prince Edward Island, Edmund T. Higgs,

SENATE
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL BOARD

Early in September, a Foreign Exchange
Control Board was set up, consisting of senior
members of the public service and officers of the
Bank of Canada. The purpose of the board bas
been that of setting up a complete system of
exchange control, thus to conserve our financial
resources and supplies of foreign exchange, and
to prevent the dissipation of our capital into
speculative or other unessential uses abroad.
Working in close association with the Bank of
Canada, the board has achieved its purposes
with complete efficiency.
Its task bas been
growing ever greater and more complex. To
assist the nucleus of officials from the Bank
of Canada, the board bas secured the services
of an ever increasing number of higlily trained
men from the fields of business and finance.
I may make brief mention of some of these.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

An Agricultural Supplies Board has been
set up within the Department of Agriculture
to help meet the extraordinary problems for
our agricultural econony created by the war.
Other war-time bodies within the department are the Bacon Board, which was set up
to implement and direct Canadian fulfilment
of the important bacon agreernent with the
United Kingdom, and a Dairy Products Board,
which was created to supervise the whole question of the production and marketing of dairy
products. There is also an Advisory Committee to the Bacon Board, but this, unlike the
two just mentioned, possesses no executive
powers.

To assist these boards in the conduct of
their duties, the Government has enlisted the
services of specially qualified persons from
outside the permanent service. The Department of Agriculture has obtained the full-time
services of Professer S. R. N. Hodgins, of
Macdonald College, Montreal, as Secretary of
the Agricultural Supplies Board, of Mr. D. J.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE LOBSTER
CONTROLLER

The dissolution of markets has necessitated

the appointment of a controller who will have
supervision over the entire field of production
and marketing of canned lobster.
In the
initial stages, Dr. D. B. Finu, Deputy Minister
of the Department of Fisheries, is serving as
Controller; but to assist him, an advisory com-

mittee of men immediately concerned with this
problem has been appointed. The comittee,
chosen to give representation both to the fisher-

men and to the lobster canning industry, consists of: G. S. Lee, of Halifax; Bert Mclnerney,

of Halifax; W. H. Tidmarch, of Charlottetown;
Emile Paturel, of Shediac.
WAR-TIME CO-OPERATION WITH THE
PROVINCES

I should not like to conclude this portion of
the review of the services given in an advisory
ançi practical manner by existing organizations,
associations and individuals without making
special mention of what might be spoken of
as war-time co-operation extended on the part
of the provinces of Canada.

256

SENATE

I have already indicated wherein the Federal
Government received the closest co-operation
from the provincial governments in the first
National War Loan campaign. As mentioned,
the Provincial Treasurers of all the provinces
served on the National War Loan Committee.
Also, as just mentioned, the closest co-operation lias been received from the welfare departments of the provincial governments in working
out arrangements for the reception in Canada
of refugees and evacuated children, and as
mentioned, the Department of Pensions and
National Health is co-operating with the provinces in tc
provision of air raid precautions.
The Department of Munitions and Supply
is receiving valuable assistance and co-operation
from provincial departments of natural resources, mines, lands and forests, etc., in the task
of mobilizing our resources of raw materials
to meet war-time needs.
As in peace-time, close co-operation is maintained between the federal departments and tc
provincial authorities in the Departments of
Agriculture and Fisheries.
In the field of health and welfare, war-time
conditions have made more essential than ever
the closest co-operation between federal and
provincial authorities.
In peace-time, the primary responsibility for
public order and the administration of justice
rests with the provinces. It has been recognized, however, that in time of war a share of
this responsibility must necessarily be assuned

relieved the provinces of their constitutional
function, but it has served to emptasize the need
for the closest co-operation between the provincial police and law enforcement agencies,
one hand. antd the Royal Can,adian
on tc
Mounted Police anid the Department of Justice
on the other.
In tlese and other ways, the Federal Administration lias been materially aided by the governments of the several provinces in the successful prosecution of Canada's war effort.
The second part, which I shall read, contains
interesting information concerning the policies
which the Government tas formulated for the
more effective carrying on of our war effort,
and also particulars of the reorganization of
the Cabinet, rendered necessary by death and
withdrawal.
I allude to my honourable
friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Euler) and to
the late Minister of National Defence, Hon.
Mr. Rogers.
INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE
CABINET
I coie noiw to mneans of increasing the
efficiency of tlc Cabinet, other than those of
enlisting the services of the best available
persons in executive and administrative positions or in an advisory relationship to individual Ministers.
In other words, I come
to the Cabinet itself, and tere I wish to speak
first of the plan of war organization within
the Cabinet and later of Cabinet responsibility and personnel.
Canada's war effort tas been, from the first,
and will continue to te, organized and directed
by the Cabinet.
From the outset, the work
of the Cabinet tas been so organized as to
permit of immediate and effective direction of
the varions activities, and at the same time
to ensure their complete co-ordination.
For
the most effective conduct of that effort, the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Cabinet itself tas been organized into appropriate comnittees, each charged w ith responsibilities in specific spheres of activity.
WAR ORGANIZATION
CABINET COMMITTEES AND RELATED
AGENCIES
Prior to the war, there liad been established
a,
coimmittee
of the
Cabinet
especially
appointed to consider matters of defence.
Wlien the war broke out, and it became
necessary to view the problems of war in
relation one to the other, and as a whole, in
order the better to co-ordinate the work of
the Government, to prevent duplication of
effort, and to promote efficiency, special coinmittees of the Cabinet w-ere formed in relation
to the several probleis of major concern.
As a supervisory body in a position to view
the war effort as a whole, an Emnergency Council was appointed with an inmediate relationship to the work of the several governmental

over those of the Defence Commeittee establisled prior to the war. As occasion has since
required, its personnel lias been altered or increased to include the Ministers whose departients aro especially concerned with the war
effort.
In an early reorganization, its name
aias clianged.
It tas since been designated
and is now known as the War Committee of
the Cabinet. The Ministers at present conposing the War Conmittee are the following:
The Prime Minister;
The Leader of tIhe Governmient in the Senate;
The Minister of Mines and Resources;
The Minister of Justice;
Th e linister of Finance;
The Minister of National Defence;
The Minister of National Defence for Air;
The Minister of Munitions and Supply.
The War Conmnittee of the Cabinet gives
continuons consideration to, and recommends
decisions by the Cabinet upon, major questions
of war policy and defence.
Related to the War Commnittee are special
ceoninittees especially charged witih the consideration and supervision of specific problems.
They are conposed of the Ministers principally
concerned axwith related phases of awar effort.
The committees also assist in the co-ordination
cf activities in whieh more than one department
is involved.
Of these special committees, six
are concerned
avith
problens
related
to
Ecoonmic Defence:
War Finance and Supply;
Food production and Marketing;
Wheat;
Fuel and Power;
Shipping and Transportation;
Price Control and Labour.
In addition there are special committees
whiclh deal also with m.atters of:
Interna Security;
Legislation;
Public Information;
Demobilization and Re-establishment.
Related directly to the work of the Cabinet
commnittees are the activities of the boards and
agencies to which I have already referred.
Certain statutory bodies already existing prior
to the war. and as a result of the war charged
with special responsibility, have also been

257

JULY 8, 1940
related directly to the functions of the special
Cabinet committees which I have just described.
In order to further the effective co-ordination
if the economie and financial policy in wartime, to facilitate the work of the Cabinet
ceommittees in the consideration of specific problems, and to assist in avoiding duplication of
effort by departments and agencies, an Advisory
Committee on Economie Policy, composed of
members of the public service, has been established. This committee acts in an advisory
capacity to the Cabinet itself.
I have in my hand a diagram which discloses
at a glance the relationship to the Cabinet of
the war-time and statutory bodies and boards
to which I have referred. It also designates,
by the departments over which they preside,
the ministerial personnel of the several committees. With the permission of the House, I
will askz that the diagram be inserted in
Iansard.
There is thus, at the present time, an extensive and complete organization as between
the different departments of the Government
whereby the duties and burdens of Ministers
are widely distributed and shared.
Also,
through the War Committee of the Cabinet,
the most immediýate and special attention is
given to the general problems of the war.
I have shown how, under the war organizatien of the Cabinet, the burdens and duties
of individual Ministers have been lightened
by the sharing of duties between Ministers
themselves and by the consideration and coordination of war activities by inter-related
committees representative of different phases
of war effort. It has been urged, as already
mentioned, that the efficiency of the Government might further be enhanced by the work
of the Cabinet being so arranged, and responsibilities of Ministers so divided, as to free
as largely

as possible from other duties

and

responsibilities, the Ministers of the Crown
who are concerned with those departments of
government which have primarily to do with
war activities, in order that their time and
attention may be given as exclusively as possible to the consideration and effective execution of war policies.
As a corollary, it bas also been urged that
matters pertaining to war policy and the
direction of the war effort should as largely
as possible be entrusted to a War Committee
of the Cabinet, the members of which would
be free to give most, if net the whole, of their
time to matters pertaining to the war, leaving
to other members of the Government the
administration of the departments concerned
with matters of state which, in time of peace,
are of great importance, but which, in time
of war, are relatively less important.
From what I have already said with respect
to the War Committee of the Cabinet, it will
be seen that it bas been precisely along these
lines that the Government bas been proceeding. The need for the expansion of administrative personnel was more urgent at the
outbreak of war than the need for the expansion of the Cabinet. The need, however, of
creating new ministries to meet war-time demands and of assigning to their administration Ministers whose time could be exclusively
devoted to the supervision and encouragement
of their affairs bas become only too obvious.
Existing ministries have accordingly been enlarged. New ministries have been established,
and yet further ministries concerned exclusively with war-time activities are about to be
created. To offset this expansion of war-time

services, the activities of peace-time services
have been materially curtailed. Their administration has been placed as completely as possible under members of the Government other
than those primarily concerned with war activities. Where circumstances warrant it, a single
Minister has been given the responsibility of
administering the affairs of more than one
department.
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE

The natural place of beginning the expansion
of war services was with the Department of
National Defence.
The Department of National Defence was the
nucleus of the war administration. Until July,
1939, the department was entrusted not only
with the organization of the defence forces, but
also with the problem of supply. The progressive increases in our defence expenditures
from 1936 made it necessary to develop additional machinery for coping with the problem
of supply. As a r-esult the Defence Purchasing
Board was set up on July 14, 1939. When war
came, we had al.ready provided the beginnings
of an organization to meet the supply problem.
The actual outbreak made necessary immediate administrative expansion in four directions.
The fighting forces had to be increased in
numbers, they had to be provided with vast
quantities of war supplies, and the necessary
funds had to be obtained to finance this
expansion. Finally provision had to be made
for internal security and economie stability on
the home front.
The mobilization and recruitment of the
fighting forces threw added burdens on the
administrative staff of the Department of
National Defence. Two acting Deputy Ministers, both veterans, and both prominent industrialists with wide administrative experience,
were immediately a.dded to the staff. One was
entrusted with the Militia services, the other
with the Naval and Air services.
DEPARTMENT

OF MUNITIONS AND SUPPLY

At the outbreak of war, the work of the
Defence Purchasing Board was transferred to
a War Supply Board. At the special session of
Parliament, the Government took steps to provide for a Department of Munitions and Supply
under a separate Minister of the Crown.
That department has since come into being
and grown to vast proportions. It bas been
under a Minister who, until to-day, had also
been

administering the affairs of

the

Depart-

ment of Transport. The maintenance for a
time of the association between the two departments made possible a needed rearrangement
of some of their activities and the effecting of
economies which would not otherwise have been
possible.
The former Minister of Transport, who also
for some time past bas been the Minister of
Munitions and Supply, will hereafter give his
entire time to the work of the latter department. There have been transferred te the
Department of Munitions and Supply, as being
closely related to war activities, the branches
of the Department of Transport concerned with
the Trans-Canada Airways, civil aviation, and
national radio broadcasting. The new Department of Munitions and Supply is the first new

ministry which has been created since thie outbreak of war.

posts. Ability to direct the work of the Government departments concerned is, of course, an
important requisite. It is however, far from
being the only one. A Cabinet Minister must
also be prepared to assume his full share of
responsibility for all acts of government, and
for explaining the policies of the Government
to Parliament and to the country. He muet, of
course, be -a member of Parliament. If he je
not in Parli-ament when lie is called to the
Cabinet he must find a constituency and be
elected in it. Above all, he must have a
cap.acity to work in immediate association with
other Ministers in the Cabinet in the formulation of policy. Nothing would paralyse government more quickly than divided counsels or
dissension within the Ministry.
That does net mean that narrow party considera.tions or, as some impatient critics are too
eager to suggest, the dictates of "party politices"
or of personal whim, govern the choice of
Ministers, .particularly in war-time. But it does
mean that different qualities are required for
effective work as a Cabinet Minister than those
required in .an administrative or executive post.
It is a common experience to find that a business
man is willing to make very great personal
sacrifice in order to serve his country in an
administrative capacity, but is exceedingly
reluctan-t to enter the Cabinet because a ministerial post involves election to Parli.ament,
public speaking and other activities for which
he feels be bas neither aptitude nor training.
Furthermore, the acceptance of a Cabinet post
involves a more complete severance of business
and professional tics than is necessary in undertaking temporary administrative or advisory
appointments.
There is no business of any
magnitude or importance in this country to
which the war bas not brought particular
problems of its own. Highly placed executives
may be spared by such concerns, either in an
executive or advisory capacity, for whole or
part time, without the risks attendant upon
a complete severance of business relations such
as would be involved in their entering the
Ministry.
If I ever had any doubt on this score, it
bas been renoved by some of the steps I have
recently taken in seeking to increase confidence
in the disinterested motives of the Ministry
by bringing into the Cabinet one or more
persons whose inclusion would, I felt, have
demonstrated the readiness of the Government
to meet, if that were possible, the wishes
of members of political parties to have the
basis of representation in the Cabinet widened
by the inclusion in the Cabinet of persons
known to command their confidence.
It is
an open secret that I have directly and indirectly offeredl to take into the Ministry
outstanding persons, none of whom are at
present in public if e, but whose presence in the
Ministry would, I believe. have made wholly
apparent the readiness of my colleagues and
myself to associate with ourselves in the work of
the Ministry persons whose appointment could
in no sense be regarded as made from any party
political motive. but only on the ground of the
outstanding qualities they were known to
possess. Were I at liberty to give their
names, I am sure that honourable members in
all parts of the House would consider them
among persons highly qualified to inspire confidence in the non-partisan character of the
Government's war effort.
I have found that those I approached felt
that such special services as they could render
could he given more effectively, either in

259

administrative posts or in an advisory capacity
or by their continuing to eccupy an eminent
and independent position in the community.
The prevalence of this attitude was not the
least of the reasons which led me to abandon
the attempt to add to the Cabinet from outside. from the ranks of those without previous
experience of public life.
It le sometimes forgotten that the intimacy
and prominence of the associations enjoyed
with large enterprises is not infrequently a
barrier rather than a passport to membership in a cabinet. The same consideration does
not so generally apply where the services to
be rendered are concerned not with the determining of policy, but with its execution.
I have come to the conclusion that, for the
present at least, the most effective use can
e made of the services of men without previes experience of publie life by bringing
those men into association with the Ministry
in an administrative or advisory capacity
rather than by including them in the Ministry
itself.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE CABINET
CONSIDERED

From like motives, I have also given consideration to the appointment of an Advisory
Committee to the War Committee of the Cabinet which would include a limited number of
persons chosen because of their prominence
in representative fields of activity. To this
proposal there are a number of objections,
which, everything considered, appear to me to
rob such a step of the advantages it might at
first sight appear to possess.
In the first place, no matter what the political
affiliations of members of such an advisory
committee might be, the mere fact that they
bad been appointed by the Government and
had not sought or obtained any mark of public
confidence from any section of the electorate,
would tend to lessen their representative
capacity in the eyes of the public. They themselves might naturally feel that their power
was not equal to the responsibility which they
might be heId to he assuming. Indeed, the
objection on this score bas been raised on the
part of one of them with whom I bave discussed the proposal.
The need for such a committee is itself more
apparent than real, once it is realized that
it is always possible for the Government to
obtain the benefit of the advice of those best
qualified to counsel in particular matters, apart
altogether from any membership in an advisory
body. Business men and professional men of
wide experience and high standing can always
he consulted and are, in fact, continually being
consulted by the Government whether they
are members of an administrative branch of
government or not.
ASSOCIATE MEMBERS OF WAR COMMITTEE

Realizing the importance of inereasing public
confidence through bringing to the aid of the
Ministry all points of view and opinions, I bave
considered yet another means by whicb this
end might possibly be attained. I bave thought
of inviting leading members of the Opposition
to become associate members of the War Coinmittee of the Cabinet, to share its deliberations
and to assist in the formation of its proposals
to the Cabinet. Regardless of what course may
be adopted, the Government itself must, in the
last analysis, take the responsibility for whatever is done or left undone. That responsibility

SENATE
cannot be escaped or evaded.
It is difficult
even to share it. It would not be my idea, in
case nienbers of the Opposition became associate members of tie War Committee of the
Cabinet, that the Government should by that
means seek in any way to evade full and final
responsibility for Canada's war effort.
But tise presence iii an advisory and associate
capacity of members of the Opposition would
have a nnumber of advantages.
While their
addition to the War Cabinet would leave unimpaired the requirements of responsible government, it would mean that the Government's
policies were being shaped and made effective
not only under tie open gaze of members of
the Opposition, but with tie assistance of thseir
counsel, experience and advice. It would mean
tiat in all major mnatters of defence, internal
secrity, international co-operation, the leading
mîenbers of tie Opposition, ciosen to act i
association with nembers of tise War Cabinet,
would bc fully informed.
At the present tinte, one of the great difficulties of governmsent lies iii the fact that many
matters of wicii tie Goverisnment has knowledge,
many steps wich tie Government takes, many

acstions which the Governiment plans, are, iii
tie very nature of things, iigily confidential,
and must remain so for varying periods of tinte.

Tiis obstacle would, iii part at least, be overcotie by tise proposed associate menbership of
Opposition leaders in tie War Comnitteet tihe
Cabinet, wliere, to its ienibers, thisr experience,
advice, and point of view would certainly bc

of value.

in all its proceedings. J ais prepared, also, if
this invitation is accepted by my honourable
friends opposite, and if it is agreeable to tise
otier political groups in the House, to consider
tie extension of the invitation also to their
leaders.
If tie Hsouse and tie gentlemen whom I have
invited look upos tise proposal with favour, it
would inean that the country w'ould lave the
beneflit of their wisdom, advice and experience,
and the Government would retain tise responsibility for the direction of Canada's war effort,
taith whiih it has been ciarged. It would also
be understood that members of the various
opposition groups in this House would continue
to be free to criticize the Administration as
tiey thissk fit, and to vote and act witi complete
independence.
CONFERENCE WITH THE OPPOSITION
If tie honourable gentlemen opposite should
feel that they were unable to accept the
invitation I have just extended, believing that
thereby they would be accepting a share of
responsibility without being accorded an equivalent share of power, J am prepared to make yet
another proposal, the acceptance of which, I
siouîld hope, would net occasion the slightest
embarrassnent and, I feel, would be essentially
helipful at this time.
As I have already said, much of the action
of tie Government and even more of the information on which its actions are based must,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

for military reasons, remain secret. This consideration hampers the Government in the discussion of its policies and action in Parliament
and before the people. WTe recognize that it is
an even more serions embarrassment to those
in opposition in war time.
Their lack of
knowledge makes effective criticism difficult; it
bas also a tendency to breed misgivings which
need not exist if tie facts could be made

available.
I believe that this situation could be remedied, at least in part, while Parliament is in
session, by regular weekly conferences between
the War Committee andfithe members of the
Opposition, and by similar conferences held at
intervals wien Parliament is net in session.
At such conferences the Government will bc
prepared to disclose, in confidence, full and
detailed information, both as to its actions and
the considerations on which those actions are
based. The effectiveness of the Opposition, far
from being impaired, will be greatly increased
by the knowledge gained by their leaders by
such conferences.
Members of the Opposition,
as regards their rigits of criticism, will have,
as tiey haare now, only the limits imposed by
their personal sense of responsibility as citizens
and mnembers of Parliament. From the standpoint of the public interest, conferences of this
kind would certainly have the merit of increasing confidence in Canada's war effort and
thereby belp to prevent the development of
nneasiness which provides such a fertile ground
for subtle enemy propaganda aimed at destroying the unity of that effort.
CABINET RECONSTRUCTION
Tie acceptance, on Friday las.t, by Colonel
J. L. Ralston of the portfolio of National
Defence was followed by Colonel Ralston's
resignation as Minister of Finance. I am pleased
to announce tiat the Honourable J. L. Ilsley,
w ho until to-day was filling tise office of Minister of National Revenue, bas been appointed
as Colonel Ralston's successor as Minister of
Finance.
As honourable members are well aware, Mr.
Ilsley, during recent years, whenever occasion
required, bas been the .acting Minister of
Finance.
During the period of the illness of
tie former Minister of Finance, the Honourable
Charles Dunning, and during Mr. Dunning's
absence abroad, Mr. Ilsley ably presided over
the affairs of the Finance Department. He is
wholly familiar with its several activities. His
ability as administrator in the years that he has
been a member of the present Cabinet bas
gained for him an enviable reputation in al]
parts of Canada. It is not a surprise, there-

fore. that public opinion generally, as reflected
throghi the medium of the Press, seemed to take
it for granted. when it became known that
Colonel Ralston had agreed to leave the Department of Finance for that of National Defence,
that Mr. Ilsley would be the logical successor.
I hope that the Prime Minister's conmendations of his colleagues do not create
any uneasiness on the ýpart of honourable
members of this Chamber. If it is felt that
I should limit this statement to an announcement of the changes in and additions to the
Cabinet, I will do so.
Mr. Ilsley was sworn to his new office at noon
to-day. In order that Pe may give his undivided
attention, at this time of war, to the work of

JULY 8, 1940
the Department of Finance, Mr. Ilsley bas
zesigned as Minister of National Revenue.
Honçurable members are aware that, in
addition to his duties as Minister of Transport,
the Honourable C. D. Howe has, since April 9,
been at the head of the new Department of
Munitions and Supply. Mr. Howe bas to-day
given up the portfolio of Minister of Transport
in order that, from now on, be may devote his
entire time te the work of the Department of
Munitions and Supply.
I have referred to the contraction in the work
of the Department of Public Works, occasioned
by the Government's policy as largely as possible
te restrict, during the period of the war, the
construction of public works. I have also
referred te the transfer of certain services
from the Department of Transport to the
Department of Munitions and Supply. As the
services of each of these departments have been
somewhat curtailed, it bas been felt that the
administration of both departments could be
entrusted to the one Minister. Accordingly
Honourable P. J. A. Cardin, who is Minister of
Public Works, has to-day been appointed Minister of Transport.
I am pleaeed to be able to announce that my
colleague the Honourable J. G. Gardiner, the
present Minister of Agriculture, bas agreed,
once the Act creating the new Department of
National War Services bas been passed, to
undertake the organization of that new and
important department of government. I need
not say anything of Mr. Gardiner's special
qualifications for such a task. His long experience in public life, his exceptional organizing
abilities, his power as administrator se effectively disclosed in the years of his premiership
of the province of Saskatchewan, and as a
federal Minister, are all guarantees that the
purposes of the new department will be promoted with zeal, energy and skill, and the
department made one of the most effective
instruments in a nation-wide furtherance of the
war effort of our country.
Mr. Gardiner will become, when he assumes
the office of Minister of National War Services,
a member of the War Committee of the Cabinet.
That his undivided energies and time may be
given te the work of the new department, he
wilI shortly vacate his present position as
Minister of Agriculture.
I am particularly pleased te be able te
announce that I have obtained from the Premier
of Nova Scotia,
the Honourable Angus
Macdonald, the promise of his willingness te
resign the premiership of the province of Nova
Scotia, a position which ho bas held with such
honour and distinction alike te his native
province and te himself, and te accept, immediately upon the establishment of the new department. the portfolio of Minieter of National
Defence for Naval Affairs. In thus responding
te my request to assist my colleagues and myself
in the prosecution of Canada's war effort, Mr.
Macdonald is giving te our country another
example of devotion te public duty and of a
willingness te serve, which in the public mind
In
are already associated with his name.
addition te bringing te bis new post his proven
administrative ability, Mr. Macdonald bas had
an experience of military affairs gained as an
officer in the last war. Such experience as will
come with him te the council table will serve
te strengthen net only his own, but all branches
of the defence services.
It will be recalled that when Mr. Power
accepted the portfolio of Minister of National
Defence for Air, in order that he might give
his entire time to the work of the Department
of Defence, he resigned the position of Post-

261

master General. The affairs of the Post Office
Department have since been administered by
Mr. Ilsley, as acting Minister. It is felt that
the vacancy created in the office of Postmaster
General by Mr. Power's resignation should now
be filled. I need net say te honourable members of the House, and particularly te those
who are numbered among my own supporters,
that I have had few more difficult tasks than
that of deciding te which of their number I
should entrust the administration of the Post
Office Department and the administration of the
Department of National Revenue.
The resignation, at the ine of his appointment te the Senate, of the Honourable W. D.
Euler as Minister of Trade and Commercea portfolio subsequently filled by the appointment te that position of the Honourable J. A.
MacKinnon, as a Minister from Alberta-and
the tragic death of the Honourable Norman
Rogers, have deprived the province of Ontario
of half of its representation in the Government. It would I am sure, be generally expected that in the filling cf existing vacancies
this representation of Ontariu in the federal
Cabinet should be restored. At all events, my
colleagues and I have se viewed the matter.
That has been the least of the difficulties. A
much more perplexing problem bas been that
of making a choice frem among the many
honourable members from the province of
Ontario who possess qualifications and claims for
Cabinet recognition. I have felt that at this
time of war, the citizens of Canada generally,
and in particular those of the province of
Ontario, would, other things being equal, welcome
the appointment of members of this House who
had seen active service in the last war, and
who, on this as well as other grounds, might
be expected te bring valuable experience to the
Ministry in this most critical of all times.
Recommendations have, accordingly. been
made te His Excellency the Governor General
to-day, which His Excellency bas been pleased
te approve, for the appointment of Colonel
William Pate Mulock, of the city of Toronto,
member for York North, as Postmaster General,
and Colonel Colin Gibson, of the city of Hamilton, member for Hamilton West, as Minister of
National Revenue.
I have given the House in considerable detail
particulars of the manner in which the administrative functions of government have been
extended and improved by attaching te the
public service a large number of outstanding
Canadians from all fields of industrial, financial
and other endeavour. Each and every one bas
been chosen because it was considered that he
was best able te advance the war effort of
this country by specialized knowledge, and
service based upon specialized education and
experience.
J have offered te honourable gentlemen opposite, in the only manner I have felt consistent
with responsible government, an opportunity te
share in our deliberations. By that invitation
J have asked them also te give te the Government the benefit of their wisdom and their
experience. I have net asked them to share in
our ultimate responsibilities, because that would
net be fair either te them or te the electors
of this country.
I hope that my honourable friends will find
themselves able te accept one or other of the
proposals J have made. Whatever may be
their decision, Iý believe that I can at least
make this claim on behalf of my colleagues and
myself. We have net flinched from our primary

favour or disfavour. While we have recognized our responsibility for policy, we have
sought to obtain the best advice available in
the country to assist us in its formation and
pronouncement.
I leave this recital of facts with confidence
to this House and the people of Canada. It
tells its own story. It is the brief record of a
Government whicl at a time of great peril in
the affairs of the world has done everything
in its power to meet its responsibilities, to
strengthen its administration, to mobilize the
brain-power and resources of this country-in
short, to do its plain duty, honourably and
fearlessly.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I cannot help suggesting
to the honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) that hereafter lie seek to
condense, in his own inimitably terse and
vivacious manner, these interminable dissertations which come from the other Chamber. Outside of the announcement of certain
changes in the Administration, which had
already appeared in the Press, I really have to
say that the disquisition just given us was a
lot more lengthy than interesting.
About this said-to-be-reconstructed Administration, very few words will suffice. I have no
adverse comment to make as to the three new
figures in the Government. It is my misfortune that I scarcely know the men. I
have heard them well spoken of. As one public man to others, I give them a welcome to
the higher sphere of public duty which they
now enter. Speaking frankly, though, I can
see no change whatever in the colour of the
Ministry. If anything, it is a little more
partisan than before. I express special disappointment that there is to be in charge of
a great new service, the administration of
which should above all others be sacredly
judicial, one who to my mind is without
question the maddest partisan extremist in our
history.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend will not deny his ability.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I doubt if in
ability as a servant of his party lie has ever
been equalled. Actually, speaking now in
advance of the work to be done, I cannot but
express amazement that the man should be
placed in charge of it.
It would be interesting indeed that the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), if he felt himself free, should
give the names of those others-of whom it
was at least intimated they were Conservatives
-- who had been offered and had refused posts
in the Administration. As the Minister is not
free to give the known facts, I am not free to
give the presumed facts, but to my own mind
they are the sane. Of the respectability of
these men and their right to the respect they
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

enjoy, I make no doubt at all. By the admission of those who have never been identified
at all, or have been identified only in a quiet
and comparatively unknown manner. with
political effort, political organization or political trust in our country, to seek to place the
Government on any other than the partisan
basis it has always been on is crude and presumptuous.
I have no word at all as to this offer to
certain persons to sit and listen in the War
Cabinet. Those to whom the offer was made
will decide for themselves. I know them. I
have not spoken to them, but I know how
they will decide.
BREN GUN DELIVERIES
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
Orders of the Day are called, I think the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr
Dandurand) should give the Government
answer-I know what it is, for lie has been
good enough to vouchsafe it to me-to the
request I made for particulars as to deliveries
of Bren guns. I am not asking him to give
me the facts, for he gave them to me as a
Privy Councillor.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I imparted to
my right honourable friend the intimation of
the department that it was not in the public
interest to give the details asked for, but I
submitted them to him as a member of the
Privy Council.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable leader of the House states the fact.
But I am justified in making this remark: Continuouslv for weeks the Government, through
its Publie Information Bureau, so called, has
issued to the Press an official statement as to
the Bren gun plant being in mass production.
Now I want ta say very plainly and in a
sentence: that statement is not truc.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend may cross swords with the
Department of Information for making a
statement that he believes is misleading or
untrue, but I would ask him whether there is
any special reason for discussing the matter
from that angle. My right honourable friend
has requested me to make sure that the work
of the contractors was being carried on according to schedule, and lie has asked for some
special information on the point. When I
give it ta him, I suppose, he will be satisfied,
because I shall make the statement authoritatively. As to figures being given and the hope
expressed that the contractors are in mass
production. it may be truc within a few weeks.

JULY 8, 1940

263

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is stated,
not as a hope at ail, but as a fact.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: i t.hink we shahl
be on safer ground when we get the contract.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know. But
what does "masýs production" mean? In ordeT
ta be in a position ta answer my right honourable friend I should have ta ascertain
what the termn implies and read the statement
issued by the Information Bureau. He says
I bave it on my desk; very iikely I have.
But I think this is of minor importance. The
contractors for the British Government and
for the Canadian Government are, I believe,
doing their level best ta secure maximum
production and are in advance of sehedule;
so no compiaint could be made as ta their
work.
My right bonourable friend wil
appre-ciate that the Department of National
Defence is particularly interested in peak production and is fahlowing the work very eiosely.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shall be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend will see. 1 hope he will be.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: I arn not now
calling in question the right of the Government nor its wisdomn in flot divulging exact
figures. AIl I protest against is the statement,
repeated day in and day out for weeks, that
the Bren gun plant is in mass production. It
is not a truc statemcnt. Now the Minister
says deliveries are at least in advance ofwhat is the word?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Schedule.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have nat
seen -the contract, but I do know that on May
16, 1938, the Minister of National Defence of
that day, Hon. Mr. Mackenzie, describing in
the Commons in saine detail the final terms
of the contract, said that it was dated March
31, 1938,Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I couid flot find
it in his speech of May 16, 1938.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -and that
the company had guaranteed deliveries within
two years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: If tbat is the
case, the company is not six montbs ahead
of scbedule. It is not even up ta sehedule,
however well it thinks it is doing.
This is ail
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bypotheticai. I hope ta 'be able to-morrow
ta give my right honourable friend the actual
date of the contract.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No matter
what the date is, the contract certainly was
dated at the timne the Minister spoke, and
that was May 16, 1938. There were no
deliveries whatever within two years of that
date, aithougli he said deliveries had been
guaranteed.

PRESS REPORTERS 0F THE SENATE.
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

On the Order for consideration of the
second report of the Standing Comrnittee on
Debaýtes and Reporting:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Sir
Thornas Chapais) is absent, whicb is rather
rare for hlm. I suggest that consideration of
the report stand over until to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have been
informed by one of our colleagues that he
intends ýta oppose the adoption of this report
on the ground that there is no need for the
expenditure. I would suggest that, as the
arrangement dates fromn 1917, it would be
advisable to refer the report back to the committee, or ta the Standing Oommittee on
Banking and Commerce, in order that we may
consider the advantages which -the Senate
derives fromn the arrangement. I suppose a
mai ority of honourable members now present
wer-e not here in 1917, and consequently do
not know the circumstances under whicb the
arrangement was made.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In 1938 a similar
report was presented ta the Senate by the late
Senator Gillis and referred to the Cormîittee
on Internai
Economy
and Contingent
Accounts. I understood that a motion would
be made to-night for the adoption of the
report, and therefore I was going ta discuss it.
However, if the procedure of 1938 is followed
now, I shall be quite content to discuss the
report in the Cormîittee on Internai Economy
and Contingent Accounts, of which I arn a
member.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I only suggested holding the report over because of the
absence of the chairman, the honourable senator from Grandville (Sir Thomas Chapais).
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I agree with that
suggestion entirely.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do not think
we ought in bis absence ta deal adversely
with the report.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 12, an Act to amend the Northwest
Territories Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Banking
and Commerce Conimittee. to which this Bill
was referred hack, have considered the same
and now beg leave to report it with an amendment: to strike out the proposed section 35
and substitute a new section. The first part
of this section would extend jurisdiction in

JULY 10, 1940

265

civil matters to the courts of the provinces
of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island with respect
to all parts of the Territories lying east of
the 89th meridian, and to the courts of the
provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta
and British Columbia with respect to all parts
of the Territories lying west of the 89th
meridian.
The second part of this section would read
as follows:
The courts having surrogate powers, of all
the provinces, shall, throughout the Territories,
have the like jurisdiction and authority in
relation to the granting or revoking probate
of wills and letters of administration of the
property of deceased persons and all matters
arising out of or connected with the grant or
revocation of grant of probate or administration as the said courts have within the territorial limits of their respective ordinary
jurisdiction.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend will perhaps defer his remarks until
the third reading.

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, as I have not had occasion to discuss
this amendment with the Minister who presented the Bill in the other House, I shal
not oppose the amendment, but leave it to
the good judgment of the Commons.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am inclined

third reading of the Bill is in order.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Honourable senators,
before the report is adopted-the report has
not been adopted yet?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Had I been a member of the Banking and Commerce Committee,
I would have put forward a certain amendment.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I want to make
myself clear before the report of the committee is adopted. As would be expected from
the remarks I made a short time ago, I should
like to sec the legislation donc away with
entirely; but if the Act is to remain in force
in Saskatchewan and Alberta, I intend, on the
motion for third reading of the Bill, to move
an amendment respecting appeals from boards
of review.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable gentlemen, that this Bill
be now read a third time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
proper procedure is to put a motion for adoption of the committee's report.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the Bill is
reported by the committee without amendment,
that is right.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, I would move, seconded by Senator
Horner:
That the Bill 25 be not now read a third
time, but that it be amended by adding to it,
as clause three, the following:
"3. The said Act is amended by adding
thereto, next after section twelve, as section
twelve A, the following:
'12A. (1) For the purposes of this section
"Appeal Court" means the same court as that
mentioned in subsection four of section one
hundred and fifty-two of the Bankruptey Act.
(2) The farmer or any creditor may appeal
to the Appeal Court from a proposal whieh has
been confirmed by the Board and the Appeal
Court may pronounce such judgment or make
such order or formulate such proposal as in
its opinion the Board ought to have pronounced,
made or formulated, and the decision of the
Appeal Court shall be final and conclusive.
(3) The Board shall certify to the Appeal
Court a record of the material filed with it and
the information obtained by it upon which it
bas purported to act.
(4) The Board may state a case for the
opinion of the Appeal Court on any question
of law arising in connection with a proposal.
(5) An Official Receiver may act on behalf
of the farmer on any appeal or on a stated case.
(6) No costs shall he imposed upon or
charged against the farmer on any appeal or
stated case.
(7) The Governor in Council may make rules
and regulations governing the manner of taking
evidence and obtaining information by the
Board and the procedure in the case of an
appeal or stated case and, subject to any such

266

SENATE

ries and regulations, appeals shall be governed
by the rules of the Appeal Court to whieh the
appeal is taken.'"
J should not like my action in bringing
forward this amendment to be interpreted as
a reflection on the boards of review administering the Act in the different provinces. The
men composing these boards are, without
question, men of the highest calibre; they are
highly respected, and, in my opinion, are doing
their best under very difficult circumstances.
We all admit, I think, that the Act is a very
difficult one to enforce. The trouble I find
is this. The boards of review, in their desire
to rehabilitate the farmer financially and keep
him on the farm, are sometimes led by their
ardour into thinking that they must make
cuts here and cuts there. In consequence
injustices of various kinds arise and many a
creditor finds his property being taken away
from him.
As has already been explained in the House,
a proposal that bas been formulated by a
board of review is final, and the creditor on
the one hand and the farmer on the other hand
must abide by it. There is no appeal. The object
of this amendment is te rectify that state of
affairs, and to give the creditor, and also the
farmer, the right of one appeal, and no more.
That is te say, if the creditor makes an appeal
to the Court of Appeal of the province, and
that court decides upon it, its decision is the
end of the case.
It is not my intention to enumerate any of
the cases in which, in my opinion, injustice
bas been done. Some of them were enumerated in the Committee on Banking and
Commerce the other day, and J mentioned one
or two of them a week or su ago. It seems
te me only right that, in accordance with the
custom of British law, a man should net be
deprived of his property except by due process of law. Under the Act as it stands, this
has net been the rule, but if the amendment
carries it will be, and I appeal to this honourable body to accept the amendment on that
broad general principle.
I should like te refer honourable senators
to subsection 6 of the proposed amendment.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman how a provision of that
kind can be enforced? The official receiver
is net a lawyer. A lawyer bas to bu employed,
and the cost of employing him must be paid
by the farmer if the farmer makes the appeal.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I do net agree with
he honourable zentleinman. I shall doal with
that question in a moment.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

Subsection 6 provides:
No costs shall be imposed upon or charged
against the farmer on any appeal or stated case.
That means that if the creditor appeals lie
must pay all the costs of the appeal except
the costs of the solicitor acting for the farmer.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Under this amendment no costs can bu charged against the
Government, so far as I can see. If the
amendment is passed it will do away with one
of the chief objections to the Act. It is not
fair that a man's property should be taken
away from him in any way whatsoever without
recourse to a higher authority, as can be done
under the Act as it stands. If an appeal is
taken in Manitoba and a certain point is
decided there, the decision will bu binding in
Saskatchewan and Alberta. If the creditor
lias to pay his own costs, and no costs are
imposed on the farmer in any event, there
will net be many appeals. They will be taken
only where an obvions injustice has been done.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: One moment.
The amendment has net been read from the
Chair.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman bas proposed an amendment, but
it bas net yet reached the Table, and bas net
been read.
Honourable senators, it is proposed by Hon.
Senator Aseltine, seconded by Hon. Senator
Horner, that this Bill bu not now read a third
time, but bu amended as followsSome Hon. SENATORS: Dispense.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the amendment bas not yet been distributed. I would
suggest that His Honour the Speaker read it
slowly, se that all honourable members may
understand it.

JULY 10, 1940
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved:
That the Bill 25 be not now read a third
time, but that it be amended by adding to it,
as clause three, the following:
"3. The said Act is amended by adding
thereto, next after section twelve, as section
twelve A, the following:
'12A. (1) For the purposes of this section
"Appeal Court" means the same court as that
mentiorned in subsection four of section one
hundred and fifty-two of the Bankruptcy Act.
(2) The farmer or any creditor may appeal
to the Appeal Court from a proposal whieh bas
been confirmed by the Board and the Appeal
Court may pronounce such judgment or make
such order or formulate such proposal as in
its opinion the Board ought to have pronounced,
made or formulated, and the decision of the
Appeal Court shall be final and conclusive.
(3) The Board shall certify to the Appeal
Court a record of the material filed with it and
the information obtained by it upon which it
bas purported to act.
(4) The Board may state a case for the
opinion of the Appeal Court on any question of
law arising in connection with a proposal.
(5) An Official Receiver may act on behalf
of the farmer on any appeal or on a stated case.
(6) No costs shall -be imposed upon or
charged against the farmer on any appeal or
stated case.
(7) The Governor in Council may make rules
and regulations governing the manner of taking
evidence and obtaining information by the
Board and the procedure in the case of an
appeal or stated case and, subject to any sucE
rules and regulations, appeals shall be governed
by the rules of the Appeal Court to which the
appeal is taken.'"
The question honourable senators, is on the
amendment. Is it your pleasure to adopt the
amendment?
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
I intend to vote against the amendment, and
want to state my reasons for so doing. I
should like to vote for an appeal from the
unreasonable decisions sometimes given by
boards of review, but this amendment would
make the situation worse than it is now. If
an appeal is taken by a farmer and he loses
his case, the creditor, the man who wins the
case, has to pay the costs. That is what it
says.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think there
is some misunderstanding. That is not correct.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I am glad to hear
that it is not correct.
If the amendment
is a reasonable one I will vote for it, but in
my opinion the explanation given killed the
amendment.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I rise, first of all, to state
again my opposition to the whole measure.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

267

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am opposed
to it and will vote against it.
We have
had lengthy hearings on the subject before the
committee, and have had before us members
of the board of review of Manitoba, the Prime
Minister of that province, the leader of the
Conservative party in the provincial House,
the leader of the Social Credit party and the
leader of the C.C.F. party. Two other parties,
headed by and composed of Ex-Judge Stubbs
and a Communist, did not appear, but we
were assured both these gentlemen supported
the others in their desire to have the Act
reinstated in Manitoba. All who listened to
the evidence will agree that the Premier of
the province presented his case in a very
fair and thoroughgoing manner, and with the
courtesy which is his wont. The same can
be said for Mr. Willis and for the others
present, although their statements were more
extreme.
I am not now going to review the matter
at length, because I am afraid I have already
talked almost ad nauseam on the question
in this and other sessions. I am opposed to
the reinstatement of the Act in Manitoba,
even if it was sound and in the public interest
in the beginning. I not only voted for it,
but introduced it. I cannot help feeling complimented by the frequent references of bonourable members to that fact. In the minds
of many honourable members it appears to
be the principal pedestal upon which the Act
rests.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suppose it
is not altogether immodest, either, to feel a
certain self-satisfaction that any admission
on my part of ever having been wrong is a
source of tremendous surprise to many honourable members.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Instances
admittedly have been rare, and consequently
there is justification for the expressions of
amazement which corne from so many quarters.
Even had the measure been soundly based
and in the public interest in the first placefor at the time it was passed the situation
was doubtless emergent-the time bas come
when, in my judgment, the Act sbould no
longer apply, anywhere.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a most
extraordinary measure. It empowers tribunals
to take the property of one man and give it
to another, to strip this man of his coat and
put it on that man. Worst of al, it spreads
everywhere the feeling that we have reached

SENATE
that stage in the world's evolution when debts
no longer mean debts, and when it is only a
matter of custom and of no discredit at allon the contrary, perhaps, a matter entitling
one to admiration-to avoid payment of one's
just obligations where possible. It has undermined business morale wherever it has operated. Indecd, thougb it may have temporarily
helped some, at the cost of much to them,
it bas injured far more than it bas helped.
It has injured the honest as well as the disionest, and the honest chiefly. It has brought
about a condition where we no longer have a
healthy feeling of self-dependence and selfreliance, upon which alone the civilization we
enjoy can rest.
But what I set out to say was this. Even
had the Act been justified by emergent conditions existing when it was passed, surely now,
when every farmer has had ample opportunity
in the last six years to apply to a board wi.th
respect to any debts contracted before May 1,
1935-and no debt contracted after that date
is affected by the Act-and when it is not
claimed that the boards have been congested
with work. there having been only 177 cases
dealt with last year, surely now it is impossible
to argue that legislation of this most extraordinary and deleterious character should remain longer upon the Statute Book. Once
you establish interference of this kind with
debt principles, to get away from it is a
Herculean task. Show me the province that
has not had trouble even with its own legis-

lation. Talk about calamitous results to credit
in Albertal How long is it going to take in
that province to get away from the catastrophie
course which has been pursued there during
these last few years?
Here we are asked to renew an Act in
Manitoba after Parliament decided that its
usefulness was over; to renew it with respect
only to debts incurred prior to May 1, 1935,
five years ago. Do we think that if we
restore this law it will be cancelled some day
by an Order in Council? I think it is infinitely
more likely that we shall receive a further
appeal, to bring within the purview of the
Act debts contracted since May 1, 1935.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And to restore the
Act in Prince Edward Island.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And, perhaps,
to restore the Act in other places.
I will not say more at this time in opposition to the Act itself. But if the Bill must
pass-and I know it may, as some honourable
members are very much influenced by the
unanimity of the Manitoba Legislature's
desire-I sincerely think the amendment as
moved, or sme better amendment, if one to
the same end can be found, should be adopted.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

To-day the Act is in operation in only the
three Prairie Provinces; in two of them without restraint, and in Manitoba with respect
to applications filed up to June 30 last year.
It applies most inequitably and unevenly to
farmers and creditors in one province as compared with farmers and creditors in another
province.
The fhonourable gentleman from
West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) says the law bas been a difficult one
to administer and he thinks the boards of
review have done their best. I am net sure
I can follow him in that conclusion. I believe
the board has done its best in Manitoba, but
Manitoba has been particularly favoured with
the character of its board. I am told that
Nova Scotia has been equally well favoured.
But no one can suggest that instances such
as were brought te the attention of the committee froi the other two Western provinces
couild ever have occurred if all boards of review
had been competent and fair. Aside, though,
from the competency and fairness of boards,
the inequitability of application between provinces, and even be.tween districts of the same
province. is most marked. In one province
the board will take five per cent as a basis
of interest for what debt it will allow te
continue, and in another province a rate of
six per cent will be taken. In respect of
certain debts the rate of interest will be set in
one province at three per cent and in another
province at five per cent. Besides, the boards
adopt different systems of fixing valuation,
and, particularly, different systems of distinguishing the rigbts of first mortgagees or
secured creditors from those of unsecured
creditors. In certain provinces the unsecured
creditor seems to be able to get something
out of the first mortgagee, whereas in another
province the first mortgagee has his security
held intact if the security equals the debt.
That these inequalities of application should
net be allowed to continue, I think every
honourable member will agree. No one can
defend such unfairness of application in one
district as contrasted with another.
It was further shown te the committee
that on the part of certain boards there
was a presunption of authority in law, which
in the judgment of counsel for the Mortgage
Association was a wholly false presumption,
but when the matter was referred to the court
of appeal the court said that because of the
exclusive provision of the Act it had no
jurisdiction. Se, as the Act has operated up
to date, and as it stands now, there is no
appeal on any ground, whether on fact or on
law. The right of appeal to the courts of the
country is the very essence of democratic
justice. Yeu cannot do away with that and

JULY 10, 1940
maintain even the show of having a democratic nation. To the extent that you take away
the right of appeal to the impartial court,
you establish despotism. There has'been a
tendency to do that in many fields, and no
better example can be found than this very
law. Give the right of appeal, and that evil
feature of the present measure will disappear.
What is the nature of the right of appeal
which is embodied in the proposed amendment? Under it the farmer and the creditor
would be able to appeal to the provincial
appellate court from the decision of the board
of review. It forbids going farther than one
court of appeal. I fancy there has been in
the minds of all honourable members, though
expressed by only some, a dread that once the
door of appeal is opened the farmer will
fight shy of the board, lest he be dragged
before the courts at an expense which he cannot afford. That state of mind is quite consistent with a full sense of duty on the part
of honourable members of this House. We do
not want even to think of giving such access
to the courts that he who is in forma pauperisas every applicant under this Act necessarily
is; otherwise he would not go before a board
of review at all-will have red lights in front
of him, warning him that he must keep away
or he will only render himself liable to further
legal obligations. On the other hand, those
who want to make the appeal a matter of
pure justice are averse to burdening a mortgagee or any other creditor with the costs
of appeal even when he is right. That is what
is in the mind of the honourable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes).
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes. But that would
be the effect of the amendment, I think.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And they are
rightly averse to that. The amendment makes
an attempt to provide some method of meeting the situation. I had not to do with the
formulation of this amendment, that having
been donc by our Parliamentary Counsel. The
amendment seeks to meet the situation by
providing right of appeal to the appropriate
court, that is, the appellate court of the
province in which the action arises. The farmer
is entitled to ask to be represented by an
official receiver, that is, any official receiver,
not necessarily the one nearest where the
farmer lives.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: They are not lawyers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
McMeans) says the official receivers are not
lawyers. Not all of them are, but commonly
they are lawyers, and the farmer would be

269

able te choose from a good many of them.
He would not need to be represented by an
official receiver who is not a lawyer, for he
would have a right to the services of one who
is a lawyer. This amendment would make it
the business of the official receiver, who is an
official of the State, to give such legal
assistance as the farmer desired, and for this
there would be no charge to the farmer. Nor
would there be any cost to the creditor. Suppose the farmer wins in an appeal. I should
say that, under this amendment, the judge
would have power to give costs against the
creditor. But, no matter wo wins, the judge
would not be able to order the farmer to pay
the creditor's costs. So in an appeal the farmer
would be put to little or no expense.
Mr. D'Arcy Leonard, general counsel for
the Mortgage Association, said: "In order
to have the right of appeal, so that we
shall be able to establish some uniform
law, some defensible principle of operation,
with uniformity of application in the three
to take that
provinces, we are ready
special burden so far as our association is
concerned. Even if we do win, we will never
ask that any part of our costs be paid by
the other side. The farmer, on the other hand,
has very little, if any, costs; he has no lawyer's
fees te pay; consequently he need not fear
he will be burdened with the usual expenses
of litigation which otherwise everyone who
resorts to law must shoulder."
Such is the amendment as framed.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Before the right
honourable gentleman leaves that point with
regard to the official receiver, I should like
to put this question. The official receiver
is the one who, in the first instance, tries to
make a settlement between the farmer and
his creditors, and he must act fairly between
them in the capacity of judge. Is it fair,
then, to ask him to plead the case of the
farmer before the appeal court?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should think
it is all right, for this reason. The official
receiver having failed to make a settlement,
the case goes to the board of review. The
board of review either confirms the proposed
settlement or makes a finding of its own on
somewhat different terms, in which finding,
without doubt, the official receiver concurs.
He is no longer an antagonist.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Not necessarily.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He may think
the finding is unfair to the farmer. It is
possible, though very unlikely, that he may
think it unfair to the creditor. The finding
then becomes law. He is still the official

270

SENATE

receiver, and there is nothing unreasonable in
saying to him: "Now, the board of review
having established that settlement, it becomes
your business to act for the farmer before an
appeal court. It is your busines to go there
and presont his case to the best of your ability."
I can think of no one more competent to
do so. The purpose is merely to save the
farmer the expense of engaging counsel.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think you are
putting the official receiver in an unfair
position and hanpering him in dealing with
the case before the board of review. He
knows that should an appeal be taken he will
represent the farmer, and naturally when
acting as official receiver he will try to look
nfter the farmer's interest rather than the
interest of the creditor.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not see
how lie would be hampered in settling the
case because he knows before he goes to the
board of review that he may act for the
farmer in the event of an appeal. He does
not even know that he will be called upon to
act. The farmer does not have to go to that
particular receiver; he has the right to the
services of any receiver. I think so.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The amendment
does not say a farmer shall have the right to
the services of an official receiver. All that
subsection 5 says is that an official receiver
nay act on behalf of the farmer on any appeal
or on a stated case.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. I am
glad of the interruption, because possibly I
overstated the obligation. I have not consulted with Counsel on the subject, but I
sec no reason why, if the services are
icquested, they should not be made an obligation of the official receiver.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps so.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: In the event of the
official receiver not being a lawyer, or being
a very unworthy one-as sometimes happenswould the farmer be compelled to accept him?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This Act is
in operation in only three provinces. I do
not know how many official receivers there
are in ManitobaHon. Mr. HAIG: Fourteen.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Several of
those would be lawyers; se the farmer would
have a pretty good choice, since all Manitoba
lawyers are good lawyers. The same remark
applies to the other two provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: In case a farmer,
instead of asking the official receiver to act
for him, retained high-class counsel at $100 or
$200 a day, who, under the amendment, would
pay that fee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the farmer
is not satisfied with an official receiver, he
would, I am afraid, have to pay his counsel's
fee. But he has a wide range of choice; in
Manitoba, for instance, where, I suppose, most
of the fourteen official receivers would be
lawyers.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Most of them are.

Hon. Mr. HARDY:
take one.

He is not obliged to

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You cannot
do everything for a fellow who is getting his
work done for nothing.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: But he might retain
high-class counsel out of spite, in order to
penalize the appellant by adding just so much
more to the costs of the appeal.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then he does
not get those costs back; he has to pay them
himself.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I do net sec anything
in the amendment to that effect.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
He
first, his lawyer free, and, secondly, if he
lie does not have to pay the costs of the
side. That is all. The other side, if it
may be asked to pay his costs.

gets,
loses,
other
loses,

Hon. Mr. HARDY: But would the creditor
have to pay the farmer's lawyer?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

Oh, no.

Then that is all right.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Only if he lost.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The amendment decs not make the creditor liable; and
I am sure if a farmer refused the choice of
counsel from among half a dozen or a dozen
lawyers of such standing in the community
that they have the confidence of the Government, and if he insisted on retaining his own
counsel, the appeal court would net allow him
his costs, no matter what happened.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Suppose the creditor
lost his appeal. Could he be saddled with the
costs of the official receiver?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He could be
saddled with such costs as the court of appeal
thought were reasonable.

JULY 10, 1940
Hon. L0 McMEANS: I should like to ask
the right honourable gentleman on what
grounds an appeal could be based under this
amendment. The only record for the appellate
court is what you may be able to get from
the board of review. The board of review
with their inspector and their valuator survey
the farm very carefully, take into consideration
the reputation of the farmer and the conditions under which he has managed his land,
and decide whether or not he should be granted
relief. But the discussions are not recorded; so
you have nothing with which to go before the
court of appeal except the papers of the board
of review and the written opinion of their
valuator. There is no other evidence on which
the court of áppeal can base a decision. Would
any honourable senator ask two or three judges
to decide whether or not a farm had been
too highly valued? They would be the last
men I would go to for such an opinion. I
cannot see what material there is for the court
of appeal to act on. You cannot produce
before it any new evidence, and the only
record you have is contained in the papers
and the valuation of the board of review.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have almost
lost track of the honourable senator's question. As I apprehend it, it is: What can
His
corne before the court of appeal?
remarks in support of his question seem to
be based on the assumption that nothing can
be appealed except the valuation, and that
that is mainly a matter of opinion, based on
evidence, and something with which a court
of appeal would not lightly interfere. Assuming that nothing more will corne before the
court of appeal than the valuation, there
may be very good grounds of appeal. The
record may show that the valuation has no
supporting evidence at all, just as, when the
verdict of a jury is appealed, an appellate
court may find there was no evidence to
support the verdict. In any case from a
board of review where the appeal is in respect
of a valuation, the court of appeal could
interfere.
But many questions other than that can
come before the court. Some were mentioned
by Mr. D'Arcy Leonard. For example take
the case of a $6,000 farm in Manitoba, with
a first mortgage for $5,500 and a second mortgage for $2,000 and other debts. The board
of review are legally competent to reduce
that first mortgage to $4,000 and say to the
applicant: "That is all you need ever pay,
even though your farm is worth $6,000, even
though your mortgagee is ready to take over
your farm and give you $500 into the bargain."
The mortgage companies contend: "That is
neither within the power of a board of

271

review, nor is it the meaning and intent of the
Act, and we want to appeal the case." But
they find the door of the appeal court closed
to them by the terms of the Act. Should
they not be allowed to appeal?
Without
doubt they should. Before another board of
review a very different principle may be
applied. The result of giving a right of
appeal will be to bring about uniformity in
the application of the Act, and all concerned
will know where they are at. They do not
know to-day. We were told that in one
district a board of review reduced a first
mortgage to $4,000, and the interest to 3 per
cent, and told the mortgagor he need not
pay it off any faster than $100 a year, even
though he has crop enough in one year to
pay off all arrears. But in another part a
board of review would say: "You must pay
interest at 5 or 6 per cent and discharge it
at the rate of $500 a year." It does seem to
me manifest that means should be adopted of
bringing about something approaching uniformity of principle in the application of this
law.
This amendment is satisfactory to the
general counsel of the Mortgage Association.
I feel it would also be satisfactory to anyone
representing other creditors, who have suffered vastly more than the mortgage companies from -the operation of the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. In the main they
are left destitute.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Will this amendment apply to cases already heard, or to those
to be heard in the future?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not like
to give too many legal opinions, and I will
ask someone else to take over the obligation.
But it appears to me that if we pass a law
giving a right of appeal it will not apply
to past cases. However, if it did apply I
should not be a bit worried. I should hope
it would.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It seems to me
that under this amendment, no question of
law being involved, a court of appeal would
have no power whatsoever to refer a case
back to the board of review. The court of
appeal would either have to allow the appeal.
or refuse it on the ground that they could not
interfere.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think there

are many questions of law. We are told by
counsel who for years has handled cases under
the Act that questions of law are involved and
he is debarred from having them decided.
Surely that ought to satisfy us. But subsection 2 gives the appeal court power to

"pronounce such judgment or make such order

272

SENATE

cr formulate such proposal as in its opinion
the board ought to have pronounced, made or
formulated." I feel certain that no power is
given to submit new evidence; but if, on
exvidcnce already submitted, there is an error
of law, the court can correct that error and
n'ake such a proposal as it would appear
should have been made on the basis of that
evidence. I an not going to say the courts
annot apply their judgmuent in the matter
of [thc weight of the evidence. Possibly they
'an. under tbis amendment. I hope they can.
If tley cau, so much the better. But certainly they may alter the proposal to such
fori as they feel it should have been in,
and on questions of law they can correct
ithe board of review. No one cau say there
may not be questions of law. Already there
a ve been plenty of them, and no means of
deciding them. It is to provide a means
that this amendment is now introduced. Also,
as questions of law are decided, there will
be established a unifornity of principle of
application wherever the Act remains in force.
Hon. Mr. COPP: So far as the farmer is
concerned, subsection 6 is all to the good. If
a farmer is dissatisfied with a decision of
(te board of review, he will say: "I will
appeal. It will net cost me anything." But
what about the creditor?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
There is an element of unfairness there, but
you cannot protect the farmer, who is appealing in forma pauperis, without someone else
suffering. I cannot say that all creditors agree
to this, but the main creditors do. It is worth
while to get these principles established,
especially in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and
those concerned are ready to pay the cost.
I do not think there will be many appeals
from the doctor and the storekeeper. There
may be. If they win they will have to pay
their own counsel. Of course they will not
bave to pay for the other side.
Hon. Mr. EULER: In view of the questions that have arisen, even in the mind of my
rigit honourable friend, who is a very conpctent lawyer, as to exactly what the amendaient neans, it seems to me it would be advisable to have this amendment referred back
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objection to that.
Hon. JAMES CALDER: Honourable senators. I was about to make a similar proposal.
I think it would be most unfortunate to call
upon honourable members to cast their votes
upon this question at this time. Take the
matter of costs, for instance. As the amendRIght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

cent reads, I do not know what it means.
I an not intimating that what is proposed
should not be the law. but the amendment
as drafted is so indefinite and so lacking in
real point that one does not know what may
happen.
Then there is the question whether or not
the amendment will apply to all the cases
that have bcen heard in the past. Subsection
2 says:
The farmer o any creditor niay appeal t')

probably thousands, of cases, and as I read
the amendment they would all be thrown open
to appeal. I may be wrong. I do net intend
to labour the point, but it seems to me that
more time should be given to it if this is to
become law.
Thxere is only one other matter I wish to
refer te. I am not a member of the Conmittee on Banking and Commerce, but I
have listened to all that has been said, and
nobody bas given the slightest intimation
as to why this law should be continued.
I agree wibth the stand taken by the right
hionourable gentleman to my left (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen). We put an end to this law
in Manitoba a year ago. We are now asked
to bring it into force again. Why?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Because we did net
then have the facts we have had since.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps for the
reason that actuated the honourable gentleman
in leaving Saskatchewan under the law.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I do not get the point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We eliminated
Manitoba, but we left Saskatchewan under

the law.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. We left Saskatchewan under a law that could be terminated,
and there was an idea that it would be terminated within a reasonable time.
As I say, J thoroughly agree with the right
honourable gentleman that this class of legislation should be brought to an end everywhere
in Canada just as soon as possibleSeme Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -and unless someone
can indicate why we are again asked to perpetuate this law in the province of Manitoba,
I shall certainly vote against it.

JULY 10, 1940
Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
senators, may I be permitted to call attention
to the fact that the discussion this afternoon
has been proceeding somewhat irregularly,
not in accordance with the rules of the Senate.
However, if honourable members are satisfied
to continue in this manner, the Chair will
remain silent.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
as I am not a lawyer, I make no pretence of
understanding the amendment offered to the
House. There has been a great deal of talk
about the principle of this legislation. Personally, I cannot see that the principle is in
issue at this time. Good or bad, favourable
or unfavourable, the law is in effect in the
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And there is power to
terminate it.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: That is correct.
As we all know, Manitoba is in the same
economie sphere as Alberta and Saskatchewan,
but two years ago we removed it from the
influence of the Act.
As one honourable
senator has said, we did that because of a
lack of knowledge of the situation. At that
time I voted for the removal of Manitoba
from within the provisions of the Act because
I did not understand the true situation. Now,
as a result of the facts placed before your
committee during its several sittings, I am
supporting the Bill.
I do not think we need to refer to the
question of principle. What concerns me at
the moment is the question of what is fair
to the province of Manitoba. That province
is as much entitled to the benefit of the legislation as is the province of Alberta, and almost
as much as the province of Saskatchewan. As
to the evidence submitted to the committee,
I may say to honourable senators, particularly
to those who are not members of the committee, that it showed that the administration
of the Act in Manitoba had been eminently
satisfactory. The representative of the mortgage companies who appeared before the committee stated distinctly that he was satisfied.
He said in so many words that he had no
complaint so far as Manitoba was concerned,
but he hoped the situation in Saskatchewan
and Alberta would be rectified.
If honourable members are dissatisfied with
the Act they should introduce a Bill to repeal
it; but if it is going to remain on the Statute
Book, as undoubtedly it is, then I say Manitoba should receive the same treatment as
Saskatchewan and Alberta. It seems to me
that the only thing we have to consider is
whether we are going to reinstate Manitoba
under the Act and extend to the people of

that province the same privileges as are
extended to the people of Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and certainly I am in favour of that.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, when Bill 25 came before us in this
Chamber it was agreed that it should be
referred to the Standing Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce in order that the question
whether the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act should corme into effect in Manitoba
should receive closer study than could be
given to it in this Chamber. The Committee
on Banking and Commerce invited the members of the board of review in the province
of Manitoba to appear before it, and after
hearing them, the Prime Minister of Manitoba,
the leaders of the largest groups in the Legislature of that province and the representative
of the mortgage companies, the committee,
which is composed of prominent members of
the Senate, decided to report the Bill to this
House without amendment.
To-day an amendment is proposed which
nobody understands.
Even the right honourable the leader of the Opposition was rather
reluctant to give an opinion upon its meaning.
There are one or two clauses of the amendment to which I wish to refer particularly.
The first is this:
An Official Receiver may act on behalf of the
farmer on an appeal or on a stated case.
The official receivers to-day receive $15 for
every application brought before them by
the farmers. Who is going to compel the
official receiver to act for a farmèr without
remuneration? Surely you are not going to
say that the farmer in Manitoba may have his
case decided by the court of appeal, unless
you make some provision for him to be well
represented by counsel. I should like to ask
honourable members of this Chamber who are
lawyers how much they charge when they go
before the court of appeal of any province on
an important case-and every one of these
cases is important, for it may determine
whether the farmer is to remain on the land
or not. If I hired counsel to represent me,
as a farmer, before the Manitoba Court of
Appeal, what would the fee be?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
yoi?

How much have

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: That is well answered.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I think that is a
fair answer to the question. My experience,
since I have been in public life, is that
lawyers charge pretty heavy fees.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

95832-18
REVISED EDITION

All you have.

SENATE

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: And I have no
objection, none whatever. If I, as a farmer,
have my case taken by a creditor before the
court of appeal, I ought to be represented
there by competent ceounsel. In many cases
before the courts points of law are argued
for days and days. Well, I do not suppose I
could get competent legal counsel for less than
$100 or $200 a day.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Oh, yes.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I can say to this
honourable House that I have heard a great
deal of criticism because counsel in important
royal commissions were getting $150 and $200
a day.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That is what they
charge.
Who is going to compel an official receiver
to act for me, as a farmer, and who is going
to pay for his services? There is nothing in
this amendment requiring an official receiver
to act without remuneration.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the honourable
gentleman permit me to make an interjection?
I think the point is well taken. Suppose the
Act permitted the farmer to select any official
receiver to represent him. Then, let us say
that in a certain case the receiver chosen had
to travel a considerable distance to reach the
court, and was obliged to spend two or three
days away from home while the case was being
heard. Who would pay his travelling and
living expenses?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That is what I
should like to know. How can a farmer avoid
being compelled to disburse a good deal of
money if his case goes before the court of
appeal, whether he or a creditor appeals?
The Act has been in force since 1935. At
the committee yesterday-I was present,
though I am not a member of the committeecounsel for the mortgage companies tried to
build up a case in support of the right of
appeal to the provincial Supreme Court by
citing isolated instances of probable misjudgment on the part of boards of review.
There is some misjudgment on the part of
those who administer any law on the Statute
Book, but that does not make the law
unsatisfactory. I do not think our judgment
with respect to the proposed amendment to
this Bill should be based upon what has
happened in isolated cases.
I repeat what I said when the Bill was
before us in this Chamber a little while ago,
before it was sent to the Committee on Banking and Commerce, that the economie and
Hon. Mr. SHARPE.

debt situation in the province of Manitoba is
similar to, though probably less acute than,
that in Alberta and Saskatchewan. To-day
our Western country is facing perhaps one of
the most serious situations that it has ever
faced. Our cost of production is bound to
go up, and our markets are being taken away
from us day by day. That situation should
be appreciated by this Chamber, and I think
it would be only a matter of justice to the
West to restore the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act in Manitoba.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I am strongly in favour of the amendment. May I point out that I think it is
unfortunate the suggestion of His Honour
the Speaker was not accepted by honourable
members. For we are not now discussing the
merits of the Bill. What we are discussing is
the amendment, which is that the right of
appeal shall be incorporated in the main
statute. As I take it, the question of the
merits or demerits of placing Manitoba within
the jurisdiction of the Act is not immediately
before us.
Speaking to the amendment, I am strongly
in favour of the provision for appeal, on two
distinct grounds. First, there is the broad
ground of principle applicable to all tribunaIs
vested with semi-judicial or actual judicial
powers. Mr. Leonard, who was before the
committee yesterday, took the liberty of quoting an address which I gave to the Canadian
Bar Association two years ago, dealing with
this subject of administrative tribunals. He
also quoted, as I myself did in that address,
from a book by Gordon Hewart, Chief Justice
of England, called "The New Despotism."
From wide experience gained as counsel and
in the positions he had held, the author gave
solemn warning of the danger in tribunals
which have powers similar to those of the
courts, but are not restricted as the courts are,
and whose orders or findings are not subject
to the right of appeal, which for so long has
guided our jurisprudence under the British
system. It is my belief, honourable senators,
that if completely arbitrary powers are given
to any group of men for an indefinite period,
and no right of appeal is provided for, abuses
will sooner or later creep in.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In that address to the
Canadian Bar Association-I should not speak
of it here if it had not been mentioned yesterday-I referred to the Workmen's Compensation Board of British Columbia. I know the
members of that board and had something to
do with their appointment. I consider the
chairman to be as able a lawver as we have in
the province, and a fair-minded man. But

JULY 10, 1940
the board lias now been exercising unhampered power in the province, subject to no
appeal, for twenty years, and cases that have
corne to my attention show what is bound to
happen under conditions of that kind.
These are war times, when it is necessary
to create tribunals with respect to which it is
flot praticable nor feasible to stop and give
thouglit as to what could be done in normal
tirnes. But thougli the need for assistance
under this Act may be an outeome of war,
what the boards of review are doing is not
relative to immediate problems of the war,
and I think here we should tie up to wellestablishcd principles and be guided by that
experience which lias taught us over the years
how necessary certain safeguards are to the
riglits of individual citizens and of the coinmunity.
I believe there are somne very essential
reasons for a riglit of appeal fromn the findings
of boards of review under this Act. 1 arn
surprised that my honourable friend from St.
Jean Baptiste (Hon. A. L. Beaubien) and other
honourable members who, have such strong
convictions in favour of the Act are opposed
to the amendmaent.
What has been the
principal ground of attack on the legisiation?
In almost every case the opposition they have
had to figlit in order to keep the Act alive
lias been based upon instances of abuse. As I
see it, any person who bas this law at heart
ought to be prompt to say, "Let us take steps
to get rid of these abuses, and so do away
with the chief argument against the Act."

275

that there are different cour-ts of appeal in
Canada, but almost without exception the
judgment of one appellate court will be
accepted by another. If this amendment is
adopted, a judicial interpýretation by the court
of appeal in Manitoba, let us say. on the
question of the board's jurisdiction, ýor on the
effect of any particular section of the Act,
would bc binding upon flot only the Manitoba
board, but, as a matter of practical experience,
upon the boards in the other provinces. If
either of those boards failed to follow that
interpretation, an appeal would go to the
appellate court of Saskatcbewan -or Alberta.
and that court would be almost sure to accept
the ruling of the Manitoba court. So in the
result tbere would bcecomplete uniformity
of interpretation.
Nothing -can be more
desirable than that. On the other hand,
nothing can be a greater hazard to the satisfactory administration of an Act than haîf a
dozen different interpretations by haif a dozen
arbitrary boards, none responsible to the
others for to a common head. In my judgment tbat is the strongest reason why there,
should be a right of appeal in cases of this
kind.
The honourable the senior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) lias suggested
that in some cases there will be no recorded
evidence to present to the appeal court. I
would refer my honourable friend to subsection 7 of the amendment, which. provides
that "the Governor ini Council may make

if they are conscious that what they do may
be scrutinized by a superior authority. I
predict the mere fact that a court of appeal
is empowered to review what all boards are
doing under tie Act will have a very salutary
effect on their disposition of every case. From
my experience I know that these boards are
often swayed by their sympathies when dealing
with cases involving considerable persoial
bardship. Nothing more certainly tends to
cure rthat weakness than the knowledge that
sitting over them always, with the power of
reviw, is a court of appeal.
One or two questions of interpretation have
been raised in this debate, one having to do
with costs, and some honourable members
Lave said that they do not know exactly what
this proposed amendment means. It has been
said that you can drive a coach and horsesHon. Mr. COTE: A coach and four.
Hon. Mi. FARRIS: -through any statute.
While that is of course a playful exaggeration,
there is always room for argument in the
interpretation of any legislation. If, however,
we were intimidated by such a statement
there would never be any progress in the
improvement of our statutes.
As to the official receiver acting for farmers
on appeals, I do not think there is much
ambiguity. As I read the amendment, it is
not compulsory, and I think that unless something further were done it could not be considered as compusory. But I ienture to say
furîher provisions will be made.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Who will make those
provisions?

by the boards. It secis to nie that is the
eul'y wiy in which it can be done under the
Act. But, as someone ias already said, you
cannot make every provision for the farmer.
There may be some cases of iardship because
the farmser cannot get tie official receiver to
act and cannot afford to pay a lawyer. But
I would remind honourable nsensbers that we
bave a Bankruptey Act which very seriously
affects the rights of insolvent debtors, and
many cases are appealed, but no provision is
made to assign counsel to the bankrupt.
This proposal goes further than any legislation
I know of to assist the unfortunate farmer
who seeks protection under the Act. I would
point out, however, that even if he cannot
afford counsel he will be at no disadvantage.
I an sure it is the experience of every member

FARRIS.

of the Bar in this Chamber that the most
embarrassing case in court is where the other
side has no lawyer.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Suppose the court is
eomposed of five judges. He finds every one
of them is looking after the interest of the
poor litiganît. who is trying to conduct his
own case. It is perhaps a foolish statement
for me to nake that it is good policy te
appear in court without a lawyer. However,
I have no doubt that in the few instances in
which this will happen the coit of appeal in
tie provinces wherein the Act is still operative
will take good care to se substantial justice
is accorded to the unfortunate respondent.
Sonie question was raised as to the retroactive effect of the proposed amendmient. I
have no doubt in my mîrind that i could not
be retroactive unless so expressed. Only pure
questions of procedure are implied to be
retfroactive in legislation. Anything involving
a substantive right is not retroactive by implication. An order under the Act for the benefit
of the applicant would be a substantive right,
and therefore, in my opinion, the amendment
would not affect past cases of that kind. I
would point out also that under subsection 7
it is provided that the ries of the appeal
court in each province shall apply. In British
Columbia the maximum finie allowed for an
appeal is three months, and I do not think
if is longer in any of the other provinces. So
only as to cases that have coue up in the
last three monflis could this proposed amendment be retroactive, even supposing it to be
capable of such interpretation.
For these reasens, honourable memîbers, I
am in favour of this amending legislatien,
for I believe it will improve the statute and
give the publie greater confidence in its proper
administration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators. I ai in a somîewlat especial position.
This Bill, based upon a unanimous resolution
of the Legislature of Manitoba, was submitted
to the House of Commons by the Government.
A very important amendmient is suggested,
which covers not only Manitoba, but also the
otlier two provinces, in which the Act is still
in operation. Yesterday the representatives of
the Provincial Legislature, from Premier
Bracken to the leaders of the other groups,
appeared before our Banking and Commerce
Committee. Most of them were asked if they
would object to such a right of appeal being
given to parties applying before a board of
review. So far as mey iiieiory goes, no one
expressed anv clear hostility to the proposal.
Premier Bracken said he was not ready to give

JULY 10, 1940
an answer. I am not disposed to stand in
the way of the Senate reaching a decision on
this matter, and therefore I refrain from
expressing any opinion at this stage. I had
intended moving adjournment of the debate
until to-morrow, in the hope of being able
then to give a definite opinion personally and
on behalf of my Government colleagues.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Do I understand the honourable senator to make a motion
for adjournment of the debate?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I do so.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.
BREN GUN DELIVERIES
INQUIRY

AND

DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called, I should like to give to my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
the answer which I promised him last Monday.
He then said:
Now the Minister says leliveries are at least
in advance of schedule. I have not seen the
contract, but I do know tiat on May 16, 1938,
the Minister of National Defence of that day,
Hon. Mr. Mackenzie, describing in the Commons
in some detail the final termis of the contract,
said that it was dated March 31, 1938, and
that the company had guaranteed deliveries
within two years. If that is the case, the company is not six months ahead of schedule. It
is not even up to schedule, however well it
thinks it is doing.
This is the answer which I promised my
right honourable friend:
The contract for the manufacture of the
Bren machine-guns was signed on the 31st of
March, 1938.
The delivery of the said Bren machine-guns
was to be completed within the time limits
specified in Exhibit "D," forming part of the
contract.
The schedule of deliveries fron the date of
execution and the dlelivery of the attached
agreement was as
follows,
according to
Exhibit "D":
24th-36th month, inclusive ......
1,000 guns
37th-48th
49th-60th
61st-64th

"
"
"

"
"
"

......
......
......

3,000
6,000
2,000

It will thus be seen that it was an erroneous
statement whieh allowed the right honourable
gentleman to say that the first delivery had to
be made within twenty-four months, which
would have ended on the lst of April last.
The first batch of the Bren machine-guns
under the contract is due for delivery any time
from the 24th to the 36th month, inclusive.
As delivery has already been made of a certain
number of guns, it is quite logical to say that
the delivery of those guns is in advance of the
sehedule thus agreed upon.

277

Naturally, the first thousand guns will have
to be completely delivered before the end of the
36th month, or before the 1st of April, 1941.
It is quite evident that that first delivery
will be completed quite in advance of that date.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In the statement quoted by the honourable leader of
the House I said the assertion given out by
the Public Information Bureau, and continued
for two or three weeks, that this gun was
now in mass production, was false. This is
wholly confirmed by what is read to-day,
and toHon. Mr. DANDURAND: It does not
bear on the statement my right honourable
friend makes now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Wait until
I get through. What is read to-day shows
something else is wrong. The statement that
deliveries are six months in advance of
schedule has no foundation whatever in fact.
And that assertion has gone on for about
three weeks. I never knew until just now
what the contract called for in the way of
delivery. The contract, which was dated the
31st of March, 1938, called for one thousand
guns between the twenty-fourth and the
thirty-sixth months.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Now some
have been delivered; I wish I were in a
position to say how many; but not one was
delivered until June, which would be the
twenty-sixth month. For anyone to assert in
the name of the Government that that is six
months in advance of schedule is simply
stating a falsehood. There is nothing done
in advance of schedule. The number delivered
between the twenty-fourth and the twentysixth months is not in advance of schedule,
nor will the number be up to schedule unless
one thousand are received within the year.
I presume they will be. I am not saying the
deliveries are behind schedule under contract,
but I do say this: to assert that they are
six months in advance is to assert a falsehood.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On whose authority does my right honourable friend make
that affirmation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You cannot
be six months in advance of a schedule which
calls for delivery of one thousand guns between
the twenty-fourth and thirty-sixth months
unless you have delivered before the twentyfourth month.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.

278

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You cannot
be. Cannot we all understand English? The
company undertook to deliver one thousand
guns between the 31st of March, 1940, and
the 31st of March, 1941.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They have
delivered a few guns up to now, the twenty-

sixth month. Who says that is in advance of
schedule? Does anybody say so? It is not
a day in advance, not an hour.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend not admit that if there
were no delivery for the next six months, and
a thousand guns were delivered on the lst of
January next, it would be ahead of schedule?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If one
thousand guns were delivered before the
thirty-sixth month the delivery would be
ahead of schedule; but as yet there is nothing
ahead of the schedule requirement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think the right
honourable gentleman is splitting hairs.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They start
delivering guns in the twenty-sixth month,
and they are under contract to deliver one
thousand between the twenty-fourth and the
thirty-sixth months. Yet we are solemnly told
they are in mass production and ahead of
schedule. It is false.
It is true that I said the Minister of
National Defence, when speaking in the
House of Commons on the 16th of May, 1938,
gave to this country the solemn assurance that
the company had given an agreement guaranteeing delivery within two years. That is
what I said.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Within what
time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Within two
years. In his speech of May 16, 1938, the
Minister led the country to believe that the
company had so guaranteed; and I do not
say he was making any wrong statement when
he said it. Assuming that he was making a
perfectly correct statement, the company
undertook to commence deliveries before the
31st of March this year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. There
never was a contract to deliver before thirtysix months. If that statement was made by
the Minister, I do not doubt it was erroneous.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will get it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But there is one
thing my right honourable friend does not
know, or feigns-I will not say that; I will
say has forgotten, for I doubt very much that
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

a document so important would have escaped
his attention; and that is that the whole
contract, bearing the dates of delivery just as I
have stated them, was laid on the Table of
the House of Commons on the 29th of June,
1938. Even if the correction of the statement
made on the 16th of May escaped the
Minister when he received his manuscript, it
could not have escaped the attention of
Parliament on the 29th of June, 1938, when,
in response to an address on the 27th, he laid
on the Table of the House the whole contract.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Quite all
right. I am glad to have my honourable
friend frankly say the Minister was wrong.
He gave to the country a statement which was
not true.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Why?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Speak upl
Do you say he did not? He said the Government had a covenant that delivery should
start within two years. The honourable
gentleman says that is not correct, and the
wrong statement was corrected by the tabling
of the contract on the 29th of June. I accept
that-that the statement given on the 16th
of May was wrong.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It may have been
a misinterpretation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; it is
as plain as day. That is what I have been
referring to all along. It is pretty serious
to make a statement which is wrong.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It was corrected within thirty days.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You are not
correcting it by filing thirty days afterwards
a big, voluminous contract. Besides, I always
thought that though the contract might not
have provided for deliveries within that
time, a post-contract covenant had been
taken for further deliveries. Then I call
attention to the fact that the date given
by the leader of the House now for the filing
of that contract was the next to last day
Parliament sat that year. Parliament, I
am pretty sure, prorogued on the lst of
July.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In 1938?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

I think so.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Was it not
last year?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
infallible, but I think I am right. This
contract was filed at that time, and it is
not very likely that honourable members
would soon be corrected in the wrong impression which they got frorm the Minister.

279

JULY 10, 1940
SBut it does flot matter a whit. I did not
read the Minister's assurance as meaning
that the contract so provided, fur he referred
to a covenant that delivery should commence
within two years. Consequently I should
not have heen correct,-d if I had seen the
contract. So what I have stated in this
House is true in every essence; and more
th-an I have stated is true. The assertions
of the Public Information Bureau are wrong,
first, in declaring for two or three weeks that
the company has been in mnass production,
and, secondly, in telling the country the
company is six months ahead of schedule
in deliveries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn most surprised at the stand my right honourable
friend is taking. This, as I have said before,
is a tempeet in a teapot. In view of wh-at
we are facing to-day, and faced yesterday,
it does not matter whether or not the
Minister said on the l6th of May, 1938, that
deliveries would begin in twenty-four months,
because a month afterwards lie placed on
the Table of the House a contract which
shows the time as thirty-six months, flot
twenty-four mon*ths. My right honourable
friend forgets that in the first session of
1939 an inquiry into this very contraet occupied the attention of a committee of the
buse of Commons for weeks. Surely this
petty error, which mnay have been oommitted
hy the Min ister, or may have been the resuit
of the shorthand writer Vaking down twentyfour instead of thirty-six, should flot assume
the dignity of a full-fledged assault against
the Public Information Bureau.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is tlie Information Bureau which lias said the guns were
in process of mass production, and aliead of
achedule. As a matter of fact, anything that
is being done now would show that tlie contract is being carried on fairly weIl ahead of
the, schedule; and delivery of the one thousand
guns could wait until the last day of Mardi
next. But delivery has been started, and will
continue in increasing quantity. Yet my riglit
honourable friend quarrels with the Information Bureau because it speaks of mass production. Mass production, of course, is a very
difficuit expression to analyse, and leads us
nowliere. It does not help the country in the
very important job before it of carrying on
the war.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I leave what
we liave said to, be quietly read and reviewed
by lionourable members, so they may see wlio
was riglit.

DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL
DEFENCE BILL
FIRST

READING

X mcssage was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 74, an Act to amend the

Departmenut of National Defence Act.
SFCOND

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, with the leave of thte Senate, I would
move the second reading of this Bill. It will
be recalled that last May we passed a Bill
to amend the National Defence Act and it
was given Royal Assent on the 22nd of that
month. The purpose of that legislation was
to appoint a Minister of National Defence for
Air. The present Bill repeals that statute and
provides for the creation of an Associate
Minister of National Defence, a Minister of
National Defence for Naval Services, and a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Minister of National Defence for Air. In fa-t
the Bill goes a little further, as appears by
subsection 2 of section 3:
During the tenure of office of any such
additional Minister of National Defence the
powers exercisable by him shall be as follows:
(a) An Associate Minister of National
Defence shall. unless the Governor in Couneil
otherwise directs, be entitled to exercise all
the powers of the Minister of National Defence,
iucluding those defined by this Act.
The object of this enactment is to allow
the Minister of National Defence to have by
his side the Minister of National Defence for
Air, who may act as his Associate, fully clothed
with all his powers. When the Minister for
National Defence, Hon. Mr. Ralston, was
asked to take upon his shoulders the heavy
duties of his office, he suggested that he should
be allowed an Associate Minister upon whom
hie could rely to further the activities of the
Department of National Defence when he,
the Minister, was absent, or was for sone
other reason unable to perform his duties.
This would give the Minister of National
Defence for Air, Hon. Mr. Power, who is
working very closely with the Minister, full
authority as Minister before the personnel of
the department and before the public.
This explanation as to the end in view
covers fairly well, I think, what is contained
in the Bill, namely, the appointment of a
Minister of National Defence who will be
clothed with authority to attend to naval
matters, and an Associate Minister of National
Defence to help the Minister who bas accepted
the responsibility of that department.
With this short explanation I move, seconded
by Right Hon. Mr. Graham, that the Bill be
rned the second time.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honcurable members, I have not the Bill before
me, on my desk. I received it just before I
came into the Chamber and was able to give
il only a very hurried reading. I gatheri
from that hasty perusal that the Bill provides
for two new ministerships, one for the Minister
of National Defence for Naval Services and
the other for an Associate Minister of National
Defence, or a total of four ministers in charge
of var departments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
by three individuals.

But represented

Riight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is the leader
of the House sure of that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not sav
the honourable gentleman is wrong, for I read
the Bill hurriedly; but I will read section 4A.
It says:

JULY 11, 1940
When such a proclamation as is first mentioned in section two of the War Measures Act
has been issued under the said section additional
Ministers of National Defence may be appointed
as follows:
Minister of National
(a) an Associate
Defence;
(b) a Minister of National Defence for
Naval Services, and
(c) a Minister of,National Defence for Air.
That is, three in addition to the Minister of
National Defence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Will my right
honourable friend allow me to read the statement made by the Prime Minister on this
very question?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is the law
that will govern, not the Prime Minister's
statement.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know, but I
should like to read to the House what the
Prime Minister said.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Bill
goes on to provide:
(2) During the tenure of office of any such
additional Minister of National Defence the
powers exercisable by him shall be as follows:
(a) An Associate Minister of National
Defence shall, unless the Governor in Council
otherwise directs, be entitled to exercise all
lie powers of the Minister of National Defence,
including those defined by this Act;
(b) A Minister of National Defence for
Naval Services shall be entitled to exercise al]
the powers of the Minister of National Defence
in respect of any matter relating exclusively
to the naval service;
(c) A Minister of National Defence for Air
shall be entitled te exercise all the powers of
the Minister of National Defence in respect of
any matter relating exclusively to the air
service.

Quite clearly this Bill, whatever the Prime
Minister may have said, would provide for
the existence of three additional Ministers
of National Defence-necessarily all members
of Parliament-besides the Minister of National
Defence. If, as I gathered from the remarks
of the honourable leader with respect to the
clause providing for appointment of an
Associate Minister, the intention is only to
authorize someone to take the place of the
Minister of National Defence in his absence,
that someone to be, in the first place, the
Minister for Air, or, in the second place. the
Minister for Naval Services, there is no need
of having such a clause in the Bill, because
the desired effect can be achieved by making
one of these additional Ministers the Acting
Minister of Defence. You do not require any
cumbersome Bill for the purpose of clothing
one Minister with the powers of another:
it is necessary only to pass an Order in

281

Council making the Minister for Air, say,
the Acting Minister of National Defence.
just as is donc frequently in the course of
any government's history.
Whatever the Prime Minister may have
said, if this Bill were passed and carried out
Canada would have four Ministers of National
Defence, whereas Great Britain bas only three.
Our war effort at the scene of the conflict may
not compare very well with Britain's, but on
the home front, what might be called the
Civil Service front, we have a very formidable
army. I sec that it bas been increased by
some six thousand odd. I sometimes think if
we could move it overseas it would have a
fearsome effect upon the enemy. The Service
is growing at a prodigious rate. The number
of co-ordinating officers-the term appears with
a harsh frequency in the Prime Minister's
statements to the Commons-the number of
these alone is almost terrorizing. I do impress
upon the Government that you cannot win
a war on paper, and you cannot win it by
multiplying the Civil Service in Ottawa. I
bave no objection at all to our having a
Minister for Naval Services, and a Minister
for Air, in addition to the Minister of National
Defence, but I am really in fear-as I should
like the Germans to be-of the Civil Service
of Canada. It is an army of formidable proportions, and growing every hour. Would that
our other army were growing as fast!
I call attention to another feature of the
Bill, which is of much less consequence, and
I do not know that I am right about it. One
clause provides that certain duties, under
certain conditions, shall be performed by the
Minister for Naval Services, and certain duties,
under certain conditions, by the Minister for
Air, and that under certain other conditions
those same duties shall be performed by the
Minister of National Defence in consultation
with the Minister for Naval Services or the
Minister for Air. Well, of course, Ministers
often perform duties in consultation with their
colleagues, and properly so, but I doubt the
wisdom of providing for this by legislation.
A question comes to my mind. If the Minister
of National Defence should take action without consulting the Minister for Naval Services,
say, under conditions for which this Bill
stipulates consultation, would such ministerial
Provision for
action be deemed invalid'?
consultation, and that sort of thing, are all
right in newspaper articles and in service club
constitutions, but I do not like them in
statutes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As my right
bonourable friend knows very well, no official
or written record is kept of the relations

95832-19

REVISED
EDITION

282

SENATE

between Ministers. And of course, as he
says, it is always open for Ministers to consult
one another.
My right honourable friend criticizes the
provision that an Associate Minister of
National Defence shall be entitled to exercise
all the powers of the Minister. The present
Minister bas asked for a parliamentary enactment that would clothe his Associate, whenever acting in place of the Minister, with full
ministerial authority, so that the whole staff
of the department, and the public at large,
would understand that for anything he might
deem it wise to do, the Associate had full
authority, not merely authority temporarily
delegated to hi.m by the Minister. The right
honourable gentleman will see how important
it is that all concerned should realize this.
There may be occasions when the Associate
Minister would have to make a decision
affecting a large number of people, and it is
well that not only in the military and civil
services, but throughout the country, there
should be no doubt as to the Associate's
powers.
My right honourable friend contends that
the Bill would authorize the appointment of
three Ministers in addition to the Minister
of National Defence himself. When the Bill
was before the House, a question on this very
point was put to the Prime Minister by an
honourable member, Mr. Stirling. I should
like to read a brief extract from the Commons
Hansard:
Mr. Stirling: Do I understand from the
explanation given by the Prime Minister that
there will be three individuals. namely the
Minister of National Defence, the Minister of
National Defence for Naval Services and the
Minister of National Defence for Air, wlho, at
least for the present, will also be Associate
Ministers?
Mr. Mackenzie King: No; there will be three
ministers of defence. There will be the Minister of National Defence, the Minister of
National Defence for Air and the Minister of
National Defence for Naval Services, each of
whom will have full authority with respect to
bis own immediate department.
But with
respect to the Department of National Defence
there will, when this Bill becomes law, be
associated with the Minister of that department
the Minister of the Department of National
Defence for Air, who will have the same
authority with respect to matters of national
defence as the Minister of National Defence
himself would have. There is no provision made
for an Associate Minister beyond the Department of National Defence.
Mr. Stirling: Just three individuals?
Mr. Mackenzie King: That is correct. The
purpose is to expedite matters, and also to
assist the Minister himself in connection with
the many matters which will come before bis
immediate department.
In other words, the
Minister while dealing with one important
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

matter might wish to have someone with the
authority of a Minister of National Defence
deal with some other matter also relating to
defence. This provision would give authority
without question arising in the mind of anyone
as to whether or not authority existed.
I noticed from further discussion on this
point that although the Prime Minister
admitted the clause could be construed as providing for the appointment of an Associate
Minister, he said the Government's present
intention was not to name a separate individual to this post, but to utilize the Minister
for Air as the Associate Minister. He thought
it was wise, though, to leave the Bill in its
present form, because no one knew what might
become necessary in the future.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I accept what
the honourable leader says as to the present
intention of the Government, but there is no
doubt that this Bill would authorize the
appointment of three ministers besides the
Minister of National Defence. And if we pass
the Bill, the Government may make the three
additional appointments at any time it chooses.
It is not necessary to come here with a Bill
providing that in the absence of the Minister
of National Defence the Minister for Air may
be given full ministerial power. There is
already in existence a statute under which the
Minister for Air would be vested with full
power.
But not with
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the authority which would be vested in him
under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Without this Bill, an
Order in Council would be necessary, would
it not?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, but that
would take only five minutes. By statute,
the Acting Minister has all the power of the
Minister, without reservation of any kind.
That would be an
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
intermittent, instead of continuous, authority.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. During
the absence of the Minister, he could be given
full power by Order in Council, just as under
this Bill.
The honourable leader did not reply to the
last point I made, as to the danger in a
clause requiring that certain matters shall
be dealt with, in certain circumstances, by the
Minister in consultation with the Minister
for Naval Services or the Minister for Air.
It is true no record is kept of ministerial
consultations, but that does not affect the
point. There is danger that an undesirable
situation may arise. It is not likely, I know,
but there is no use in legislating to make it
possible. Suppose the Minister of National

JULY 11, 1940
Defence exercised certain powers without -consulting one of the other Ministers, when,
according to the terms of the section, there
should have been consultation. If later on
that other Minister should fali out with the
Government and resign, he miglit be abie to
prove that he was flot consulted-and even
have some record of that fact-and take action
to upset what the Minister had donc. I do
flot think there is any sense in putting in
that clause. It does; not do a particle 'of good,
and it creates danger.

Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
1 do not quite agree with my right honourable
friend (Rigit, Hlon. Mr. Meiglien).
Apparenýtly he prefers -that whenever the Associate
Minister, the Minýister for Naval Serv-ices, or
the Minister for Air is to act in place of the
Minister of National Defence, it should be
necessary to have Orders in Council passed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Just, one.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes. The point I make
is this: any of those Ministers could act oniy
in the absence of the Minister of National
Defence, whereas if you give him associate
powers he lias those powers at aIl times.
It is possible, and, I think, very probable,

that occasions will frequently arise when it is
desirable that there be to ahl intents and
purposes two Ministers of National Defence.

For instance, Colonel llalston might be very
busily engaged in some particular work and

at the same bime it miglit lie desirable that
he sbould lie working on something else. An
Associate Minister, in such a case, could set
for the Min.ister of National Defence.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would objeet
still more if that were so. The bonourable
leader of tbe Hou--e said the Asso>ciate
Minister would act only in the absence of
the Minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There are many
reasons why the Minister of National Defence
rnay need other persans in -tlie department.
Right Hon. Mr. :MEIGHEN: But not with
ministerial powers co-ordinated with bis own.
I do flot tbink the Minister of National
Defence in'tends thaýt. You cannot have two
Ministers with equal powers in the same
department. I do flot see liow ýit could work.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
memýbers, it seems to me this proposal 1.5open
to very serions objection. My honourable
friend the former Minister of Trade and
Commerce (Hon. Mr. Euler) favours it, but
I do net think lie would like to have liad
an associate Minister of Trade and Commerce, and I arn quite satisfied that if lie were
Minister of National Defence lie would flot
UU82-loj

want to bave a second Minister associated
with hin. These war days cali for quick
decisions and the Associate Minister miglit
have one point of view on a very important
matter while the Minister himself miglit bave
another. and one would not kn*ow what the
other was doing. This is dangerous legisiation.
As my riglit honourable leader (Riglit Hon.
Mr. Meiglien) lias pointed out, it is a vcry
simple matter to pass an Order in Couneil
naming a certain Minister to be Acting

Minister, and this would cover the wliole
situation. I know what would happen to a
business if two general managers were running
it, each not knowing what orders the other
was giving.
Hon. Mr. EUfLER: I do not like to speak
twice on the same motion, but may I lie
permitted to add this. I quite agree witli my
riglit honourable friend that ordinarily it
would not be desirable to bave two men of
equal autliority in tlie department; but we
are now -living and working under unusual
conditions.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. IEULER: Everyone knows bliat
the work in the Department of National
Defence is tremendou8ly extensive, strenuous
and diffleult, and if it could at times bie
divided, a division would certainly be, desirable ini the present unusual circumstances.
I shýould like to draw this further point
to, the attention of the Senate. I think we
ýmay take it for granted that the present
Minister of National Defence and the Minister
for Air, and the Minister for Naval Services
who is to be appointed, bave the fullest
desire and intention to co.-operate in cvery
way possible, and I do not anticipate that
there would ever be any friction among thýose
gentlemen. I repeat týhat I agree witli tlie
opinion that ordinarily it would be entirely
undesiralile to bave divided autliority in this
department, but in view of the fact that
to-day the work is sn tremendous and so
extensive, it miglit be worth while to divide
that work systemnatically in order to get it
dýone promptly and satisfactorily.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would Great
Britain not lie more than justified in having
two Secretaries of State for War?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not think that argument is relevant.
Hon. J. A. CALDIER: I think they have
Assistant Secretaries of State over there.
I arn inclined to agree tbat there sliould
lie an assistant Minister. As the lionourable
member lias said, these are extraordinary

SENATE

284

times,. and from the experience T have had
J know that one of the great dangers in a
-ituation sucoh as this is that Ministers are
irente ndiously overworked.
lion. Mr. EULER: They are.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: They never get the
rial assistance they should have in order to
carry on their work properly. For that reason,
if for no other, I am very strongly inclined
to approve this proposal.
There is another reason why I favour if.
As every person knows who has been in a
Government, when an Acting Minister is
appointed he is never reailly looked upon as
a real Minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: He hesitates to a
great degree to act as a full Minister. I know
When I was
fron my own experience.
appointed as Acting Minister of a department-as I was on many occasions, both
provincially and federally-I always hesitated
to deal with anything of importance. I would
shelv it for tho Minister himself to deal
with.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Exactly.
lon. Mr. CALDER: This proposed measure
takes carc of such a situation. In these
days iatters must be dealt with promptly.
There rnay be two, three, four or five problems,
all pressing for consideration at the same fime,
and the only man who can give a decision
is flic Minister or someone clothed with his
powers. The proposal simply means that
instead of this entire burden being carried
by one person, it will be divided between two.
J think that in the present circumstances this
is a move in the right direction. We all know
that if any Minister in this country was ever
burdened with work that he should not have
been called upon to perform it was Hon. Mr.
Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.
I was delighted to see that an arrangement
had been made in order to take some of that
burden off his shoulders. I am quite sure
that Hon. Mr. Ralston is n.ow very much
in the -ame position, and anything that can
be done to relieve him and others of a portion
of the enormous load t'hey are carrying should,
I think, be approved.
I would draw
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my right honourable friend's (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen's) attention to this situation. We
do not know what may happen in the near
future. This war may be long, it may be
short; we do not know. But suppose someHon. Mr. CALDER.

and the Minister of National Defence is called

He

might

go

to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -to attend to a
very serions situation. He leaves behind a
Minister clothed with full power, and this
Minister will not have the hesitancy of an
Acting Minister. such as mv honourable friend
fron Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) bas just
ientioned.
My right honourable friend has said that I
have not answered his argument. I direct
his aittention to subsection 3:
In respect of aiiy matter affecting both the
naval service and any other service, the powers
of thte Minister of National Defence shall be
exercisable

by

himi

in consultation

with

the

Minister of National Defence for Naval Services, if any, and in respect of any matter
affecting both the air servicee ant any other
service, such poxiers shall be exercisable by the
Minister

of National

Defence in consultation

with the Minister of National Defeiee for Air,
if any.

By that subsection it is directed that when a
matter affects two services the responsibility
for deciding if shall be divided. I do not see any
difficulty in that. And if in my right honourable
friend's view if goes without saving, I submit
it goes still better I being said.
Right Hion. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will not
labour the latter point any more, but I have
something to say about this Acting Minister
business. By statute an Acting Minister lias
ftle full pow ers of the Minister in the latter's
absence. The Acting Minisier can be appointed
and givnii power to act any tinte the Minister
is two miles from Ottawa, even for a period of
only two or three days. That authorization
accomplishes everything. The argument of the
honourable senator frorn Saltecoats is just this:
an Acting Minister having full power given
him by one statute will defer action on important matters, but if he bas full power given
him by two statutes lie will act without hesitation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. In practice he
does not do so.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is what
if anounts to.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND, with the leave
of the Senate, moved the third reading of the
Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

PROPOSED UNEMPLOYMENT
ANCE LEGISLATION

INSUR-

DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, on the Orders of the Day
I want to say a word as to a statement appearing in the Press this morning to the effect that
we are to be presented soon, and the House of
Commons still sooner, with an Unemployment
Insurance Bill. I have heard it said, and I
think the honourable leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will probably not disagree, that it is the intention to prorogue
Parliament in the course of, say, about two
weeks: that is what we are seeking to do. I
protest against an Unemployment Insurance
Bill coming before our House within two
weeks of the close of any session; and we shall
probably have such a measure submitted to
us within one week of prorogation. To that
Bill this House, if it is to have any
value to Canada, should give prolonged, careful and close attention, and we should hear
the views of those affected thereby. Those
who desire to be heard will be many, and the
effect of the Bill upon them will be very
heavy. I cannot see the remotest justification for trying to deal hurriedly with such
proposed legislation this session, unless we
intend to sit here until at least the month
of September.
Now, while I am on my feet I want to say
something more, and I hope the honourable
leader opposite and the House generally will
give me credit for sincerity. I cannot have
any other reason. No man can add to his
popularity-if such a thing exists-by what I
am going to say. I do not think this is a time
for unemployment insurance legislation, and 1
will say why. We are in the black, crucial
period of a fearful peril, of a war of unparalleled and unprecedented intensity, in which the
last ounce of energy of everyone, on our side
at least, is necessary if we are to have a
chance of success. The weight of destiny that
depends on the few months or, maybe, few
weeks ahead, can scarcely be comprehended
by the human mind. What is going to be
required in the way of human and material
contributions is terrifie. The end we cannot
see, but we do know that the immediate
demand passes all the efforts of the imagination.
In these conditions is this country to be
advertised as launching upon new and very
expensive social reforms?
Ordinarily I am
in favour of unemployment insurance. I took
that position six years ago, and in similar circumstances, or anything like them, I would
take it again. But surely circumstances are
not similar. Is it going to be of value for us

to be known as launching upon this great programme of reform, entailing scores of millions
per annum, at this truly desperate stage of our
war effort?
What is going to be the influence on other
nations? What is going to be the reaction
in the United States? We may think, and
many do, that we are carrying on a very
vigorous and thoroughly creditable effort; but
the Press of the United States is none too
laudatory, to put it very mildly. Tremendous
things depend upon the attitude and conduct
of that nation--so tremendous that I would
not even venture to indicate them. Will it
appear that we feel we have given our last
ounce, have thrown our last atom of energy
into the struggle, if we are seen providing a
great and tremendously burdensome system of
unemployment insurance at this time? That
will not be the effect. There is not a member
of this House but knows that will not be
the effect. On the contrary, our action will
have an ill effect on the measure of help,
in such form as it may choose, that we know
we must have from that great country. I say
this now in hopes that the Government will
reflect upon it and let us wait for a more
convenient season.
I do not like referring to the tax situation.
I think the Government's tax programme has
been pretty well received. No matter how
heavy the tax is now, the people will pay it
if they can. But I have heard, almost directly,
men who are the closest political friends of
the Government itself say that business after
business will have to close or be taken over
by the Government under the present scale
of taxation. I do not know that they will
have to close, but I do know that in a city
not far from here there are men who think
so. The burden is fearfully heavy, and it is
going to take all the ingenuity of the business
and industrial community throughout the land
to keep the economic machinery of this country
going.
In the face of these two positions, the first
of which I emphasize more, and the second
of which I emphasize much, I ask the Government to give second thought to this subject.
If they do, I promise to give them utmost
credit for so doing.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
My right
honourable friend brings up this subject in
advance of legislation which may reach us.
He does so with the conviction that the Government would benefit by weighing anew the
reasons he gives in favour of postponement.
At the moment I see one paramount reason
which has been advanced in favour of our
moving now towards unemployment insurance.
It bears on the day when the war will be

SENATE
at an end, the various war industries will stop,
and tens of thousands of men will lose their
employment. The argument in favour of proceeding now arises frorn the fact that more
and more men throughout the land who are
now earning a wage, and, with the employers,
will be contributors to the fund, will be able
to enjoy the benefits of insurance during the
period of readjustment. My right honourable
friend remiembers the long discussions we had
in this Chamber as to the desirability of
similar legislation at a time when, according
to the returns from the Bureau of Statistics,
there were even more unemployed men than
there are to-day. Tens of thousands of men
will be employed and in receipt of fairly
good wages during the continuation of the war.
It is surely opportune, then, to try to gather
together a fund for the dark days of unemployment throughout the land. This is the main
argument I have heard in favour of unemployment insurance at this time.
My right honourable friend has suggested
that it would be quite inopportune for the
Government to send such an important measure to this House during the last days of
the session. I may say that I have had it
in mind to suggest to my colleague who will
have charge of the Bill when it comes before
the Commons that he prepare a little statement reproducing what I may call the
Bennett Act, along with the changes that
may be made by the new Bill which is to
come before us. I have no hesitation in
saying that if the changes are few in number
we shall enlist the support of honourable
members of the Senate, including my right
honourable friend himself, for those clauses
which were presented by the right honourable
gentlenman, and defended by him, in 1935.
My right honourable friend says that many
interests will have to be heard. I would
remind him that all those interests were heard
by the Senate Committee when the former
Unemployment Insurance Act was before us.
I am sure he would not ask that ail those who
appeared before us to present their views on
that occasion should again be called upon. He
knows how many sittings we gave to the
hearing of interested parties at that time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But conditions

differently affected.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a special
feature to be remrnembered. Though I do not
know the form of the Bill to come before
us, I feel that to a large extent the way has
been

forthcoming measure. However, this is simply
an academic discussion of a question which
is not even properly before us, and I only
make these few remarks so that my right honourable friend may understand the other
point of view.
I confess that sometimes when I express
certain views to members of the House of
Commons whorn I meet, they look at me and
smile as if to intimate that I have no direct
contact with the people and do net know the
trend of public thought. If such a proposal
comes before us we shall have the views of
the members of the other House; and already
the Prime Ministers and Cabinets of the
various provinces have expressed their willingness that this legislation should come before
this Parliament and not before their legislatures.
With these few remarks I leave the matter
as it stands. But I shall draw the attention
ofe my colleagues to the statement of the
right honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I wonder whether it
would be in order for me to add a thought
that came to my mind when the leader of
the Government was speaking. If we create
insurance fund while
an unemployment
employment is artificially stimulated by war
conditions, and thousands of contributors to
the fund are thrown out of employment as
soon as the war is ended, the fund will be
condemned to immediate bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But there will
be a fund. What if there is no fund at all?
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I do net wish to take up the time of the
House, but I should like to say a few words
with regard to this legislation, which is not
before us. We are only discussing what may
or may not happen.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
nothing before the Chair.

And there

is

Hon. Mr. BLACK: With the consent of
the House I should like to make a few
remarks.
The fact that similar legislation was discussed in 1935 does net mean that legislation
of this character is appropriate at the present
time. There is one feature that appeals to me
very strongly. Althaough the demand for war
materials and supplies has greatly increased
employment a.nd wages in some industries, a
very much larger and more important section
of our industrial life has net been favourably
affected by war conditions. Ordinary businesses
throughout the. country are net making money
now as they were before this war broke

JULY 11, 1940

out, nor as they did during the last war. I
myself am to some extent interested in
business, and I know of concerns that are
about to close up because they are not able
to make ends meet. That is an unfortunate
state of affairs, but there it is. The firms I
have in mind are not bankrupt. They are
simply unable to oarry on because of the heavy
taxes that have been imposed by the federal,
provincial and municipal governments. I do
not suggest these taxes are unjust; I am merely
stating the fact that in some cases they are
too greaýt a burden to be borne any longer.
I know of businesses in the Maritime Provinces
-old, well-established companies-that have
carried on for three years with an adverse
balance sheet, and the people who manage
them are now saying: "We cannot go on in
this way any longer. We do not want to discontinue these old businesses, but we must."
No doubt all honourable members will agree
there is a limit beyond which yearly losses
cannot be allowed to go. As a rule the amount
of net profit made by ordinary legitimate
business concerns is never large, and, I repeat,
war-time activities have not benefited them
to any material extent. So a considerable
number of such companies, if required to
set aside a few cents a week, or even a few
cents a month, for every one of their employees, will have no choice but to go out
of existence. That fact, and that fact alone,
explains why I urge upon this House and
the Government that it is undesirable to put
any unemployment insurance legislation into
effect at the present time.
We have no idea how taxation may be
increased at the next session of Parliament.
The expenditures Canada is now making for
war purposes are enormous, but there is nothing to indicate they may not be doubled.
Suppose taxes are increased by even ten or
fifteen per cent next year. The only way
many companies could meet them would be
to discontinue dividends. We know that joint
stock and other concerns are operated with
a view to making something in excess of their
overhead expenses in order to yield some
return to the people who have invested their
money. If for a number of years a business
finds itself unable to pay any dividend, the
stockholders become dissatisfied and disgruntled, and ultimately the business collapses.
I say to the House that if at this time
we impose a further tax in order to create an
unemployment insurance fund, we shall
jeopardize the existence not so much of the
large companies as of the infinite number
of small commercial organizations which, so
far as the Maritime Provinces are concerned

287

-and just now I am speaking for no other
section-are the very life-blood of business.
We have no very large companies, and probably never shall have any, because we are too
far away from the centre of population, but
for two centuries and longer many small
enterprises have carried on successfully down
there. We should all deeply regret additions
to the number of concerns we have already
lost, and we fear that such would be the
disastrous result of any new burden imposed just now, be it large or small. There
is no immediate demand for unemployment
insurance on the part of the provinces or
the people generally, and it does seem to me
that if ever there is a time to go slowly
before placing a heavier burden on the
shoulders of business, that time is now, when
we are in the midst of this awful war.
FARMERS'

CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT BILL
THIRD READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the amendment of Hon.
Mr. Aseltine to the motion for the third
reading of Bill 25, an Act to amend the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934.
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable senators,
before the honourable leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) makes any further
statement with regard to this Bill, I desire
to raise a point of order. In the form in
which it came here from the Commons and
was sent by us to a committee, the measure
was a simple one, whose sole object was to
place Manitoba in the same position as Saskatchewan and Alberta under the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. It was agreed
to in the committee and reported to this House,
and then the amendment now before us was
moved. I am strongly of opinion that this
amendment, which would have an important
effect upon, not merely the Bill, but the main
statute, is out of order.
Why should we attach so far-reaching an
amendment to a simple measure like this?
We might as well insert a new clause to provide that a man may be sent to jail for certain
things having no relation to the purposes of
the Bill. This amendment would affect the
operation of the law in every province where
the law is in force, whereas the Bill is concerned with Manitoba alone.
I want it distinctly understood that I am
not opposed to the right of appeal. So far
as I am concerned, any number of appeals
might be authorized. But, I repeat, in my
opinion the amendment is entirely out of
order, because it would make a very import-

288

SENATE

ant change, not only in the Bill before us,
but in the Act itself. I must confess that I
am not very sure as to the soundness of my
point. However, there are a number of
eminent authorities in this House, and I
should like to have the point decided, so that
there might be a precedent to guide us in
future. I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, to give
a ruling.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is the impression of the Chair that the most effective way
of meeting the honourable senator's purpose
would be to defeat the amendment.
No. I should like
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
to have the point decided, because I question
whether an amendment of this kind is permissible. A ruling would be valuable, not
only in the present instance, but for the
future.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I moved adjournment of the debate
yesterday afternoon because I wanted to obtain
the views of some of my colleagues, and
more especially of the one who had sponsored
this Bill in the other House. I now wish to
say the colleagues I have consulted are of
opinion that the measure should be adopted in
the form in which it left the Commons. Of
course, they are ail aware the Senate may
make any amendments it considers necessary,
but they feel it is somewhat late in the
history of this legislation to bring into effect
a new form of procedure.
However, the responsibility of piloting the
Bill in this House is mine. Having that
responsibility, and knowing the Government is
desirous that the Bill be passed, I confess I
am somewhat reluctant to jeopardize the
measure by using any authority with which
I may be clothed to oppose the amendment.
I fear if the amendment were rejected some
difficulty might be encountered at the thirdreading stage. In these circumstances, I suggest
that honourable members vote on the amendment according to their own inclinations.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
I believe the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act should never have been put into effect,
but I think that this amendment will put
more democracy into that Act than it ever
had before. I am going to vote for the
amendnent.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, I should like to say a word or two
on this Bill. I have lived in Western Canada
for more than fifty years. through ail the ups
and downs of agriculture during that period,
and I know what the farmier on tlhe priiries
has suffered.
HMm. Mr. MEIlANS.

When this Bill was introduced I was opposed
to it, but after thinking of the men located in
the rural parts of Manitoba I haveHon. Mr. HORNER: I rise to a point of
order. The question before the House is on
the amendment, nut on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: I shall come to the
amendment in a minute, if my bonourable
friend will be patient. Let me tell him that
I do not vant to see the farmers of Western
Canada threatened with appeals if they resort
to the protection of the Farners' Creditors
Arrangement Act. J do nnt want thern to
have to go near a court of law; in a word,
J do not want them to have anything to do
with lawyers.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: In the early days of
Manitoba, when great buffalo herds roamed
the prairies, there were frequent wallows on
each side of their track, and passing them
a man would turn his toes in. To-day he
has turned themn out and gone over into the
wallows, and finds himself in a mess. I want
to help him out-to be a friend of the man
struggling on the land in Manitoba. I am not
personally affected, but I say the amendment
does not suit the conditions whieh confront
the man out west who to-day is trying to
wrest a living from the land.
We have had a good many changes and
ups and downs in the West since the time
when I homesteaded there. And we have had
a good many political parties too. I have
before me a book full of the nostrums of new
parties and new organizations that have been
formed in Western Canada during the last
thirty years. When members of those parties
were returned to the House of Commons, my
good Liberal friends got them ail. I rernember their coming down bere and being absorbed
into the Liberal fold.
I am not opposing the Bill; I am opposing
the amendment, which was drafted by a clever
lawyer, whom I know pretty well. As I have
said, I want to belp the man on the land out
west, and I want honourable mrembers opposite
to help him, too. They secured the vote of
every member of those parties that came down
here, and since they are ail in the Liberal
fold I think the Liberal party should stand
right behind the men of the Western Prairies
and help then out. It is only a square deal
that oui Government shouîld come to the
assistance of our Western farmers, and it is
tlhir duty to do so. Look at the hardships
which the farmers of the West are up against.

27,000,000 pounds of bacon from the United
States. When, last Saturday, I looked at fifty
fine hogs in a pen, all very clean and nicely
bedded dowr, I thought of the difference
between the bacon which those hogs would
provide and the kind which has been brought
in from the States; and I pitied their poor
owners.
Do honourable members know how bacon
hogs are fed in the United States?
An Hon. SENATOR: We know.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Their bacon does not
compare for a moment with the quality of
ours. American hogs are put in behind cattle
to feed on the corn that comes through the
steer undigested. Our hogs are fed the very
best of grain, and as a result our bacon has
a very high reputation for quality.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order, order.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: I would remind honourable senators that I used to be in the
cattle export trade, never in the hog business.
True, once my partner and I brought 4,000
hogs from Manitoba and delivered them in
the yards at Toronto, where they came under
the hammer of a great monopolist, a splendid
man, who has since passed away. When he
came to the stockyards with his horse and
buggy he stepped down, took out a basket and
handed each one of his clients a rose. My
partner turned to me and said, "I wonder
what this rose is going to cost us." After we
got through our business we found that that
rose had cost us a lot of money. That taught
me a lesson. I retired from the hog business
and went into the cattle export trade.
It is out of the hog business that packers
make their money. If I dared take up the
time of this House, I should like to tell
honourable members what goes on in the hog
business-how bacon brought in from the
United States has dropped the price of Canadian hogs two cents a pound; and especially
should I like to point out who profits from
those conditions. I found out something about
that wealthy man; and I may tell honourable
members that to-day there is the same strain
of monopolists as existed in the early days.
As a matter of fact, to my knowledge there
has been a monopoly in the hog business all
down the last sixty years, and the farmer has
been the victim. I know my legal friends do
not understand what I am talking about, and
I am sorry I cannot put it into the form in
which I should like to bring it home to them,
but that is one of the things the farmer in
the West has suffered frorn for more than
half a century.
I was one of the few who saw the last
buffalo on the open ranges of Western Canada;

28l

and recently I read in the newspapers that
the Government had slaughtered all the buffalo
in Wainwright Park. The buffalo meat was
thrown on the market and depressed the
prices of the farmers' live stock frorn five to
seven cents a pound. How good the Liberals
are to their friends! They gave that buffalo
meat to contractors and sold the hides at a
low figure, only $150 apiece. In the old days
a buffalo hide would fetch $2.50 on the ranges.
Our farmers have to meet still further
competition. The Government allows vegetable oil to be imported freely into Canada,
and that competes with the fat which the
farmer puts on his cattle. Yes, my good
Liberal friends, you are doing him a lot of
harm. There are States in the Union that
impose a prohibitive tariff in order to exclude
vegetable oil. Yet we import trainloads for
the manufacture of soap and shortening. I do
not think this is good for the health of the
people.
Probably vegetable oil shortening
brings about indigestion, and you would not
see so many eut-rate drug-stores to-day if
vegetable oil were excluded.
I hope honourable members will not think
I am in a fault-finding spirit. I shall support
the Bill, but not the amendment. I appeal to
honest Liberals to pass this Bill. I am a
Conservative, and intend to stay that way,
but I should like to say to you: If you wish
to be kind to the struggling farmer in
Manitoba, vote for the Bill as introduced and
The farmer of
reject the amendment.
Manitoba is afraid of law courts and lawyers.
I am very much afraid of them myself, and
have always kept away from them. I do not
want to have anything to do with lawyers
except to get one of the best I know to draw
my will. As I have listened to the pros and
cons of this legislation, my thoughts have
turned to the bitter struggle of the people in
the West, and, remembering their plight, I
appeal to this Chamber to support the Bill
and defeat the amendment.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: I think the honourable senator from Marquette (Hon. Mr.
Mullins) has taken altogether too serious a
view of what he fears may be the adverse
effect of the amendment. Instead of neglecting any of the people he speaks of, and whorm
I represent as a farmer, I am endeavouring
to help those neighbours of his, from whom
he bought cattle years ago-and I hope he
always paid thern a decent price. I am
endeavouring to protect his old neighbours
who in many cases have sold their land and
retired in the hope of living on returns from
their farm mortgages. The honourable senator
does not care for lawyers. I think, like most
farmers, they are first-class. But some farmers
of the Farmers'
have taken advantage

SENATE
Creditors Arrangement Act to evade their
debts, and have neglected farm homes that
his neighbours kept in tiptop shape. All we
are asking by this amendment is to allow a
right of appeal in cases where we believe great
injustice has been done. I am convinced that
the adoption of the amendment will give
satisfaction to all concerned. The right of
appeal will not affect the operation of the
Act in Manitoba, where, it is claimed, there is
a good board of review. If a decision of the
board was correct in the first instance, then
there will be no appeal. The amendment
should not create any alarm, for it does not
adversely affect Manitoba in any particular.
For these reasons I shall support the amendment.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Aseltine was
agreed to: contents, 39; non-contents, 23.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is
now on the motion for third reading of the
Bill, as amended.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
I wish to say a word or two on the motion
for third reading. The other day I may have
said something that would indicate I am
opposed to the original legislation. I am not.
I supported that legislation at the time of its
enactment. I think it was very opportune,
because a frightful condition grew up in
Western Canada, particularly on account of
drought and other troubles, and that condition continued for a long period of years. I
know that personally, because I had to have
two or three cases dealt with, and the board
of review settled them very satisfactorily.
The point I tried to make the other day was
simply this. I did hope the time would arrive
when this legislation would cease to operate.
We dealt with the matter in previous sessions
and terminated the Act in all the Maritime
Provinces, in Ontario, and, if I am not mistaken, in British Columbia,An Hon. SENATOR: Correct.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -and in Manitoba.
We allowed the Act to continue in Alberta
and Saskatchewan, but in respect of those
two provinces we provided that the Government could by Order in Council terminate
its operation whenever they deemed it desirable te do so.
I shall vote for the Bill, even though I have
voted against the amendment. There are
some features of the amendment that I do not
like at all, but I support the main purpose
of the Bill. However, I do hope the Government will ultimately see their way clear to
terminate this legislation.
T have just one other word to say, and it
is rather in the nature of a complaint. As
I stated the other day, I do not know what
Hom. Mr. HORNER.

arguments have been advanced in favour of
this legislation being perpetuated in Manitoba.
The only matter placed before me the other
day, by one of -the honourable members from
Manitoba, was the statement that the legislation was wanted in that province because it
was still in operation in Saskatchewan and
Alberta. That is not a reason. What is the
reason for having this legislation in Manitoba?
The members of the committee have made no
statement as to the real necessity for it in
that province.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The Federation
of Farmers' Associations in Manitoba passed
a resolution asking that that province be
reinstated under the Act.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
time?

For what length of

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The Prime Minister of Manitoba, the leader of the Conservative party in the provincial House, and the
leaders of the Social Credit party and the
C.C.F. appeared before the committee and
gave the reasons.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable gentleman has just referred to what I want. I
want those reasons. The fact that this body
and that have asked for a continuance of the
legislation, and a statement of good and
valid reasons why it should be continued,
are two entirely different things. Could the
honourable gentleman inform me now as to
those reasons?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What the honourable gentlemanHon. Mr. CALDER: Would the honourable
gentleman pardon me a moment?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I want to answer
the question.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I did net ask the
question of the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Premier Bracken
and others gave very good reasons.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have no objection to
that. My objection is that we have not had
those reasons stated in this House. I am net
a member of the committeeHon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am not a member
of the committee either, and I heard the
reasons.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable gentleman was probably there.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes.

JULY 11, 1940
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Every honourable
member of this House is not expected to
attend the meetings of every committee
appointed by the House. However, that is
beside the question.
Since 1935 five years have elapsed, and
during that time any farmer in Manitobaand this applies equally to Alberta and Saskatchewan-could have put in his application
and had bis case heard.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: One of the main
reasons given by the representatives of the
Legislature of the province of Manitoba as
to why this legislation should be re-enacted
was that in many sections of the province
which were in the dried-out area it was
useless for a farmer to apply for a readjustment of his debts under the Act, because
there was nothing ta readjust. Since that
time, in 1937 I think, we have had one good
crop, and many of the farmers who did not
come under the Act want ta do so now.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That may be a very
good reason. I am not going to labour the
point any further; but it seems to me the
House is entitled to full information as to
the necessity for this legislation. All I desire
to say is that I trust the Government will see
their way clear to put an end to the legislation
at the earliest possible date. It was necessary
at one time; but in essence it is bad, and we
do not want to sec it continued over a long
period of years.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: May I point out
to the honourable gentleman that the committee went into this matter very carefully.
They heard, among others, the representative
of the loan companies, and he said, "We have
no objection ta this Act as long as you
provide for a court of appeal." What more
evidence does the honourable gentleman want?
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Honourable members,
I have not taken part in this debate, and I
rise simply to enlighten the honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder). I am
surprised that he should ask the question he
has asked, or that he should be in the maze
that he is in at the present time. He wants
to know why this legislation is being asked
for. The an-swer is that there is a provincial
election in sight in Manitoba.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should not
like that to be the last word on this Bill-

no elections in Manitoba then.

SEOOND READINGS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall these
Bills be read a second time?

292

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: With the leave of
the Senate, I move that these Bills be now
read a second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, yesterday I learned unofficially that
the Private Bills Committee of the House of
Commons, to which Divorce Bills are referred,
discussed at length the advisability of appointing certain of its members to attend meetings
of our committee in order that they might at
first hand satisfy themselves whether the evidence adduced justifies a recommendation for
divorce. I suppose there would be no objection to their attendance. It seems to me
our Divorce Committee might well explore
the desirability of having a joint committee
of both Houses to deal with divorce petitions.
I simply make the suggestion-not to be acted
on this session, but later on.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If these Bills all
deal with undefended cases, I have no objection to the motion for second reading being
proceeded with, but I think that if any cases
were opposed we should proceed with them
in the regular way.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I think there is one
defended case. I suggest that the Bill relating
to it stand over and that the other Bills be
given second reading.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If any honourable senator objects to the Bills being given
second reading now, the motion cannot be
proceeded with.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I will not oppose
second reading of the Bills being given now,
but I do think that in opposed cases the
Bills should net bc given second and third
readings without due notice.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I am not asking
that the Bills be. given third reading now.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Then I have no
objection te the motion.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bills
were severally read the second time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall these
Bills be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: At the next sitting
of the House.
With respect te the remarks of the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), I think there is a good: deal to
be said in favour of having a joint committee
on divorce. On several occasions members
of the Private Bills Committee of the House
of Commons have attended meetings of our
conmmittee. They are supposed to be present
Hon. Mr. SPEAKER.

throughout the sitting, but they do not always
stay until the proceedings are concluded. I
may say that a member of the Private Bills
Committee of the House of Commons is in
attendance at our meeting this morning.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
as an observer?

Does lie come

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: He says he comes
as a liaison officer.
NATIONAL WAR SERVICES-REGISTRATION AND MOBILIZATION
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I had hoped last night to learn that
one main and one consequential bill would
reach us from the other House in time to be
considered this morning. I understand now
that we may not receive them until four or
five o'clock. In these circumstances I would
move adjournment of the Senate during
pleasure.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before the motion is put,
would the honourable gentleman indicate to
us blind back-benchers just what those bills
are?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They have to do
with the creation of the War Services Department which the Prime Minister announced
recently. I think my honourable friend will
find full information in the statement which
I placed on Hansard last Monday.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I heard the Prime Minister's statement from the Senate gallery in
the House of Commons. So that we may not
be taken by surprise this afternoon, I should
like to put some questions to the honourable
leader of the House. If he would prefer me
to do so this afternoon, of course, I shall not
insist on proceeding now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should much
prefer that my honourable friend put his
questions now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I understand the Government intend to register every citizen between
sixteen and sixty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thought it was
forty-five.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am giving my understanding that everybody between the age of
sixteen and sixty is to be registered.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is for
national registration.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. These arc er
que stions:

JULY 12, 1940
1. Are al]

mon between

twenty-one and

fortv-five lu be called up under the Mobihizalion Act?
2. Will there be categories, s0 that those
pens.ons engaged in certain occupations wilh
be 'exempted?
3. Wilh they be cahled in these classes: (1)
men, unmarried, fromn twenty-one to twentyfour or twenty-six years of age; (2) men,
unmarried, from twenty-six to thirty-one, and
su on?
I should also hike to know when the Government expeets that the first eall will be made

under the Mobilization Act.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator wihh of course realize that such questions may require notice.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Pardon me, Mr. Speaker.
I amn quite willing to give notice of my
inquiry, but I gathered from the honourable
leader of the bouse that hie was eager to get
certain hegishation before the Senate this afternoon, and unhess these questions were asked
now, I shouhd have to present themn hater,
when the honourable gentleman wouhd not be
in as favourable a position to answer them,
and therefore could not very wehl proceed
mrith his buis. 1 do nul wi'sh lu delay passage
of the proposed legisiation by insisting on
answers tu these questions, but, if notice is
rcquired, and I have to ask themn this
afternoonBut they are
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
already asked.
Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators,Wihl my hionHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend pardon me? I did not catch
the point mnade by the Chair. We should be
sure chat our procedure is correct. so that
there may be nu doubt that the honourable
gentleman's inquiries are in order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I simply suggesled lu the honourable senator fromn Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) that
it might be necessary lu give notice of his
inquiries instead of putting lhem directly to
the honourable leader.
As we are dealHion. Mr. DANDURAND:
ing wilh a matter of emergeney, I am glad
the inquiries have been 'made, because I
shahl be able to answer them this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
the Senate.

With the consent of

Honourable
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
members, I just wanted to say to the honourable leader that I have flot read the Bill,
but I realize what a far-reaching and important

293

ineasure it is, and I cannot see how, in
the vcry short time that will be at our disposal this afternoon, the Senate could -ive
iL due consideration. I do flot know what
the views of my leader (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) may be. H1e will probably be in
the House later. I personally feel that a Bill
of this character should flot be deait wjth
hurriedly, this afternoon, especially as we
are likely to have a slim House. A good
many senators are away, and others are likely
to be going. Could the matter flot stand over
tintil next week?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have taken it
for granted tliat the Government is very
desirous of having this deparîmnent set up,
for many reasons, but especially in order to
have the national registration proceeded with.
The preliminary work is nuw in the hands of
the Minister who will be at the head of the
department, and I think hie hais already given
a statement 10 the Press or to the Commons
as to how hie intends to proeeed. H1e is a
man of action, w-ho will see that the whole
seheme is organized thoroughly and quickly.
So I think there is nu time to lose, and I
would suggest that the Senate should flot
postpune consideration of the Bill. iNevertheless, wc should have ail the time we need
tu examine it seriously. When I suggest that
wc couvene again between four and five
oclock, at the eall of the Chair, I do not
mean that Royal Assent is to be given by
six o'clock. We may continue our discussions
this evening, a nd again to-morrow morning.
Su we can have ahl the time we need to
dea] with the measure. I understood the bouse
of Communs did not intend to enter into a
lengthiy discussion on the Bill, because ail
honourable inembers of that House are wel
aware of the objeet of the measure, as I suppose ail honourable members of this House
are. I feel a duty devolves upon the Senate
tu assîst in the progress of the work that is
going on, and I hope we shahl not hamper
that progress by postponing consideration of
the Bill tili next week. The Privy Council
will be holding a meeting at noon, and I shahl
then transmit my honourable friend's views to
it. At four o'ciock, or whenever we resume
this afternoon, I shahl make a statement to
the Senate.
1 quite underHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
stand my honourable friend's rcmark, and I
arn glad hie has stated we can sit to-night and
to-morrow, if necessary. I really do flot think
it is possible for us to put through su important
a Bill as this in hess than an hour and have it
given Royal Assent this afternoon.

2Ji

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend now understands that the Senate can
have all the leeway it wants. We could discuss
the Bill this evening and all day to-morrow,
if necessary.
Of course, we could not sit
beyond midnight to-morrow, because then we
should be into Sunday.
DEPUTY MINISTER OF INFORMATION
INQUIRY ABOUT PRESS REPORT

Hon. A. D. MeRAE: I take advantage of
this opportunity to raise another point. I
noticed in the morning Press a report that
a Deputy Minister of Information may be
appointed. With that I should be in agreement.
What I want to ask is:
If such
an appointment is made, will that Deputy
Minister co-ordinate all the publicity departments in the various branches of government
and be the head of that one body? The
press report says it will be his duty to arrange
for platform and radio speakers, cinemas, and
other forms of publicity. That is quite in
keeping with the decision of the Senate's
Special Committee on War Co-operation. I
should welcome such a Ministry if the man
at the head of it were one to whom we could
look as possessing authority over all the
publicity branches. It dots seem to me that
there is a necessity for co-ordinating the
publicity work of the various departments,
and I think the practical way to co-ordinate
it would be to appoint some one person in
charge of it all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am glad my
honourable friend has put this question. I
think it was in this morning's papers that I
read a statement by the Mînister who will
be in charge of this new department-if the
Senate passes the Bill which is to come to us
-to [lie effect that there was no co-ordination
among the publicity branches in the various
government departments, and that he would
make it his duty to bring about such co-ordination. If that is done, a complaint which we
heard at meetings of the Senate's War Cooperation Committee will be cured. It has
been pointed out that to place these publicity
branches under one head would be difficult,
because they want to remain autonomous. But
I am quite sure the Minister who will have
charge of the new department will see they
are brought together, under one roof, so as
to provide a common source of information
for the public. That is what he said would
be done, and I think it is a good idea. I
have heard nothing about any proposal to
appoint a Deputy Minister, but I shall see
to it that the wish expressed by my honourable friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
Hon.

Mr. BALLANTYNE

McRae) is transmitted to the Government this
noon.
I now move that the Senate adjourn during
pleasure, on the understanding tbat we may
be summoned by the ringing of the bell
between four and five o'clock. If the Bill
has then come over from the other House we
shall have at least an hour for discussion
before six o'clock, and if that is not sufficient
we may resume at eight and examine the
measure to our heart's content.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After some time the sitting of the Senate was
resuied.

ADMISSION OF TOURISTS TO THE
PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, certain articles have recently appeared
in the Press stating that Americans or other
tourists would be refused admission to the
precincts of this building. It is my understanding that in the buildings there are two
Houses, namely, the Senate and the House of
Commons, and that each House bas control of
its own privileges.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: What I want to
bring to your attention is this. There is no
intention on the part of the Senate, so far as I
can judge, to prevent tourists from being
courteously received and allowed to enter this
building. It is understood, of course, that
honourable members will be responsible for
their own friends while they are in the building, and that privileges may be granted by the
Speaker of the Senate delegating his powers,
as occasion may arise, to the Clerk of the
Senate.
I hope, honourable senators, that this meets
with your approval, and that your co-operation
is granted.
Hon. W. H. SHARPE: Mr. Speaker, would
not each member of the Senate have the
privilege of bringing friends into the buildiQg
if he so wished?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
saying that members of
sufficiently trustworthy to be
in their own friends, and
friends, when they so desire.

It goes without
the Senate are
allowed to bring
friends of their

Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I quite agree with what His Honour
the Speaker has said as to tourists coming
within the precincts of this building if some
honourable member of the Senate vouches for
them.
At the same time, there must be

295

JULY 12, 1940
thousands of people, friends of ours-not
personal friends-who come here from the
United States and elsewhere, and for whom
neither you nor I can vouch. Of course we
must protect our liberties at this rather
difficult stage in our history, but something
should be done to extend every privilege
possible to our neighbours from the south
when they come to visit us.
During the last few days, when I have not
had anything else to do-and I have not had
much to do around this building of late-I
have had occasion to walk over to the main
door, and there I have seen many people
refused admission because of a lot of red
tape.
In looking at the ladies, especially
those in summer dresses, it would seem to
me there is little possibility of any of them
carrying concealed bombs. Seriously, however, I would go a long way, and I think the
people of Canada would go a long way, to
extend a welcome to persons coming here from
the United States. Unless they are carrying
satchels or grips which might contain dangerous articles, these people should not be
excluded. After all, this is an historic building, and visitors to this country are desirous
of seeing it. If when they reach our doors
we turn them away, they will go back to their
homes and tell their friends about the kind
of reception they had in Canada. We do not
want them to have any complaint. We want
to bring or allow into this country every
decent citizen of the United States who wishes
to come here. The immigration officers and
the customs officers at the border should be
the ones to know and say who should and who
should not be welcomed into this country.
Only a few weeks ago Hon. Mr. Howe made
a statement to the Press in which he said
that because of the state of foreign exchange
and the desirability of getting new money into
this country, we wanted every tourist we could
possibly get to come here. The Minister of
Finance, in introducing the Budget, said he
wanted Canada to derive every dollar that
could be derived from the tourist trade. Then
let us lift the barrier. Let us remove every
restriction we can. Surely there are enough
people in this country whose duty it is to
protect us and to know whether a man is a
pro-German, or a pro-Nazi, or some other
undesirable, who might want to blow up the
Parliament Buildings.
Let us do away with red tape, and instruct
the policemen on the door accordingly. Let
us welcome visitors in such a way that they
will be able to tell their friends and neighbours
that if they come to Canada they will be
warmly received by their friends and neighbours to the north.

HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, all I can say is that I will draw
this very important matter to the attention
of my honourable colleagues in order to bring
about harmony in the matter of admitting
strangers to the Senate and the House of
Commons.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATEADJOURNMENT
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, the Bill which we are awaiting is still
being discussed in the House of Commons. I
would therefore move that the Senate adjourn
until 8 o'clock to-night.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:

Call it 6 o'clock.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
6 o'clock.

We will call it

At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL WAR
SERVICES BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 75, an Act respecting a
Department of National War Services.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading.of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill has
been considered in the other House and
adopted unanimously there. It is a very short
and simple measure. By way of explaining
its purport, I will read the memorandum which
was read to the Commons by the Prime
Minister:
The purposes for which the Government proposes to establish the Department of National
War Services were given to the House in
general terms by myself on June 18, and again
on the 8th instant.
The department, among other matters, will
have to do with the due execution of some of
the purposes of the National Resources Mobilization Act. Certain of the purposes of the
Mobilization Act involve functions whieh will
be performed by departments of the Government already in existence. Others do not so
readily fit into any existing department. There
is need, moreover, for seeing that all functions
of the Act are properly co-ordinated.
The most immediate and pressing of the
duties to be discharged under the Act is the
The
conducting of a national registration.
Minister of the new department will be charged
with this responsibility. As I have already

JULY 12, 1940
departments has not been followed, and the
Government, because of neglecting to do at
the right time the things that now have to
be done, are pushing people from the ends
of the Dominion into the Service at Ottawa.
Now we are to have two Deputies for this
new department. Why can we not get along
in the old way? The two Deputies are pretty
well chosen-if the department is to be a
political organization; just as the Minister
is admirably chosen. What is in his mind
all the time is making his public service
an engine of party advantage; that is the type
lie is; and that is what will eventuate in any
department lie presides over. He takes care
that the Deputies shall not stand in his way;
and their names have been announced.
To read this Bill you would think the
Governanent were getting ready for a great
new work. A statute merely declaring that
a new department is to be created and it may
have two Deputy Ministers would do all that
this Bill does. The rest is nothing but soapsuds. Everything provided for in the rest
of the Bill the Government can do now under
the Mobilization Act. But that does not
satisfy the Government, and they have to
present another Bill containing pretty much
the same stuff. I ask the honourable leader
of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to name
me one section, the powers under which, outside of what I have said, cannot lie fully
executed under the Mobilization Act we
passed last week. And indeed under previous
legislation you could do anything that Act
provides for except conscript men. Most of
this stuff we are getting is just show, a mere
cover-up for what has not been done. There
is no need of all these clauses to the effect
that the Minister may co-ordinate this and
that. When are we going to be through with
this "co-ordinating" and get down to fighting?
If a war could bc won on paper, we should
be masters.
I feel strongly about this war services
scheme, because I know that where the Minister who is to be in charge of the new department is known there is no doubt of what will
result from his organization of this department. We are in times when such things do
certainly rouse feelings in the hearts of those
who know the task to which this country has
addressed itself. I am not objecting to registration, but to say it is the main purpose of
this department taxes my patience. We are
going to start-I do not know when-and get
some registration done. But if we look across
the Atlantic we can see, as plainly as we see
the sun, developments that will determine the
destiny of mankind before we are through
with this registration.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
in four days.

297
It must be done

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, we shall
not be through with registration in four days.
Wait until you see. Four days! What?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
from a certain date.

Well, starting

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, four days
from a date some time ahead-and the world
will end at a date some time ahead.
An Hon. SENATOR: It took just one day
for the election.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is just
what the Government have done. Let me
tell the House something the proposed Minister of National War Services may do, and it
is pretty significant. Under subsection 2 of
section 3 lie can appoint and fix the remuneration of such officers, clerks and employees
as lie shall from time to time deem necessary.
That is preceded by this provision:
Such other officers, clerks and employees as
are necessary for the proper conduct of the
business of the department may be appointed
in the manner authorized by law.
But it is provided that the Minister may
appoint them in a manner not heretofore
authorized by law. Authorized by that section, he may appoint the whole of them himself and fix their salaries. I wonder whether
anyone here who knows his own initials is
not quite certain that is exactly what the
Minister will do. The powers in paragraphs
(a), (b), (c) and (d) in section 5 are just so
much eyewash. The law would be the same
if this Bill were not passed at all. The same
can be said of sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 awi 13.
I did listen with some interest to the reading
of what was said in the House of Commonsno doubt by the Prime Minister-that the
great advantage of a democracy over an
autocracy was that if the people just got the
facts, then their energies in so many different
ways could be thrown into the conflict. Well,
it is amusing. I have never seen such systematie, tenacious determination exercised to
ensure that the public do not get the facts.
Has anyone heard in this House this session
an answer that amounted to a hill of beans?
There has not been one. "It is not in the
public interest." We have to take steps to get
accurate information fron the Government.
They have a Public Information Bureau feeding the newspapers day by day, shaping up
and forging news to suit the Government and
getting it into the hands of the Press, and a
lot of it is just as false as could possibly be
invented by the mind of man. Talk about
accurate information! I do not know how
many honourable members get this news, but

298

SENATE

I find it on my desk. In two or three matters
I have noticed that, as is quite apparent to
anyone who knows the truth, the news is
absolutely false. It is so grotesquely false that
one wonders at the bravado of its being sent
out at all. And now we are told of this effort
to get accurate information so that democracy
may do its work. I am informed, and I am
pretty sure my information is correct, that
the Government intend to see that no
independent news agencies get access to the
radio in Canada, whether the C.B.C. or any
other, and that after this all news is going to
be put out four times a day, I think, by the
Canadian Press; and it will be well edited
by the Government when it is. Never was
there so efficient, so pitilessly selfish an organization to feed the agencies of public information as that erected and conducted by the
Government. Control absolute! If we keep
on in the way we are going, propaganda will
not be any more thoroughly controlled under
the despotism of Germany than it is here.
What will be the result of taking control of
everything that goes over the radio, and using
that one agency, which will work side by side
with the Government every day, and, indeed,
draw large sums of money from it? Nothing
will go over the radio which is not coloured
exactly to suit the Administration.
I am led to these remarks by the statement
about the struggle to get accurate information
to the people. Whenever you hear a statement like that, watch out. The struggle is
just the opposite. Everything that goes over
the radio in that way will be controlled and
supervised and edited by the Government.
The next step is to control everything that
goes into the Press. True, we must have
to-day a measure of censorship with regard to
war news. But there is a great deal more
censorship exercised than that, and when
everything said over the radio is controlled,
and the Press is edited besides, the liberties
left are hardly worth preserving.
This Bill establishes a War Services Department. That department will be active, and,
from a party standpoint, will be efficient, but
I should like to see more war activity and less
propaganda.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I confess that I am daily more and
more dissatisfied with the state of mind 3f my
right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So am I.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I thought he
had been long enough with us to shake off
the prejudices and party passions that sometimes animate commoners. I thought he had
made some considerable progress along that
Right Hon. MIr. MEIGHEN.

line. But during this session I have found him
a pessimist who saw no good in the Government in general, who damned everything it
did, and offered no constructive suggestion.
Yet, if I may question him as to the value
of the men who are holding responsible positions in the present crisis, I would ask whether
he can find another man who is worth the one
I will not mention.
We have had as Minister of Finance Hon.
Mr. Ralston. I have heard no criticism of
him from the lips of my right honourable
friend.
At the pressing demand of public
opinion Mr. Ralston was transferred from the
Department of Finance to the Department of
Defence. Everybody acclaimed that appointment. As everyone says, he is one of the
best men that can be found. I do not say the
best, for it is always hard to pick one man
from among ten millions and say he is the
best; but I will ask my right honourable friend
to indicate a man who is more than his equal
in reputation and intellectual capacity. We
have had Mr. Howe, a wonder for work,
carrying four or five departments on his
shoulders and attending to his work from
morning till night; jumping into his aeroplane and going to New York, and returning
the next day and doing the work of ten good
men. We have had as Minister of National
Revenue Mr. Ilsley, a first-class Nova Scotian,
who bas now taken over the portfolio of
Finance. We have had as Minister for -Air
Hon. Mr. Power, the popular "Chubby" Power.
I wonder if anyone will rise in his place in
this Chamber and say that Mr. Power is not
fit for his job, and is not doing the best that
any intelligent and experienced man could
do. Can honourable senators indicate any
men in Canada whom they would prefer to
these? Now we have called Angus Macdonald
for the Naval Services, and everyone has
acclaimed his appointment. Yet the Prime
Minister, who directs the Cabinet that chose
these men. is always belittled. It is always
the strongest figure at which stones are
thrown. No credit is given to the Prime
Minister for surrounding himself with strong
men. It is said be is an ideal Prime Minister
in time of peace, but not in time of war. I
should like to have my right honourable
friend nane someone who could replace him.
Here we are with a Cabinet composed of
men who have in their hands the organization
of the country. We are in daily contact with
Great Britain. My right honourable friend
says, "You are making a fight on paper, but
not on the field." I may tell the right honourable gentleman that we are in contact with
the War Office and the Chiefs of Staff, and

JULY 12, 1940
that Canada is doing all they can expect Canada to do and all they are thinking of asking
of her.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
It is all very
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
well to take one or two small things and say:
"Look at what they are doing with the radio.
Look at the information they are giving us."
I want to inform my right honourable friend
that by adopting an inimical attitude towards
the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Gardiner, he
is rendering him homage.
The right honourable gentleman himself
knows what party passion and party activity
mean, and as a party man he bas found his
equal in Mr. Gardiner, one-time Prime Minister of Saskatchewan. Why bas the Prime
Minister chosen him for this work, which is
considerable? He bas done so because he bas
seen Mr. Gardiner at work; because he knows
what he bas done in the West in meeting the
difficulties in the southern parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta in the matter of rehabilitation. Mr. Gardiner is a man of action, a
man of organization. The Prime Minister is
interested in getting the best man, and he has
chosen Mr. Gardiner because be knows he will
carry on. My right honourable friend says,
"We know him as a party politician." What
bas my right honourable friend been all his
lifetime but a party politician?
Some Hon. SENATORS. Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is no insult
to my right honourable friend. He started as
a young lawyer, made his way, won in his
constituency, carried the House of Commons,
and became Prime Minister. This is no small
accomplishment. But my right honourable
friend did it as a party politician, as a fighter,
and because of his capacity, which we all
admire. Why should he throw stones at a
rival who has met him in single combat more
than once?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I never met
him in my life.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend did not meet him on the
hustings, but when he dissolved the House and
asked the suffrage of the people he knew what
he had against him.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The machine.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: There will be a Tory
machine some day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Pretty poor.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In recent days I
have felt that my right honourable friend was
speaking as the leader of the Opposition in

299

the House of Commons rather than as leader
of the Conservative party in the Senate.
Here, we are a revising body, removed from
active party politics, reviewing bills from the
House of Commons. Yet we have from my
right honourable friend the kind of criticism
to which we have listened this evening. I
want to tell him that Mr. Hanson, Leader of
the Opposition in the House of Commons,
who had made some disparaging remark about
Hon. Mr. Justice Davis, rose this evening at
six o'clock and said: "I want to withdraw al]
I have said. I have discussed the situation,
and I think ho is the best man that could be
selected for the job."
The House of Commons, with an Opposition
which is not as strong, perhaps, as it should be,
but which has some good men at its head,
studied this Bill clause by clause, put questions and accepted explanations, and sat until
a quarter to seven in order to allow the
Government to pass the Bill and send it here.
And this they did unanimously, without
criticism or recrimination. I am sorry that
my right honourable friend, whom I like very
much, should show a cantankerous spirit in
nearly every speech he makes in disparagement of the Government.
Let me ask him when loyalty to democratie
institutions, to our system and to our Constitution, is tested. It is tested on the night of an
election, when the minority in a democratic
country agrees to be governed during the next
four or five years by a majority whose
principles it dislikes. I would remind my
right honourable friend that the Prime Minister of 1911 and 1914 had opposite him a man
who knew something about the value of
democratic institutions, and that was Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. Sir Wilfrid Laurier never
dared to disparage, he could not think of
disparaging, the man who had defeated him
at the polls and become Prime Minister. He
told the Prime Minister that he would help
him, that he would not try to open the door
to power with a bloody key, and he constantly
did his best to co-operate. I know something
of that, because I worked by his side. Can
anyone imagine that in 1914 Sir Wilfrid
Laurier would have considered it in accordance
with his sense of dignity to ask the then
Government to take him into the Cabinet?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: There was no scuttling
of Parliament then.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He never thought
of making any such request. He loyally acted
as Leader of the Opposition, and helped the
Government from day to day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Surely the
honourable leader does not mean that. I sat
in the House, and I know that what the hon-

SENATE
ourable leader says is not so. After the first
week of the war the Government had to face
opposition as bitter as any government ever
faced in peace-time, and that was consistently
so, day by day, right to the end of the
chapter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I can say
that the Opposition never advocated that it
share power with the majority in a union
government. Sir Wilfrid Laurier accepted the
verdict of the people in 1911, and co-operated
loyally in all the Government's war effort.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He refused to cooperate by entering a union cabinet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And I may add
that in 1914 the Borden-Meighen Government
had a Nationalist wing. The Nationalist
members had been elected across Quebec on a
policy of no contribution to a British war
except for the defence of Canada. We bad
to step in and carry on meetings to encourage
the young men to enlist. At the end of
October or the beginning of November, 1914,
I helped to organize a large meeting in Montreal for Sir Wilfrid Laurier. in the interest
of recruiting for the Twenty-second Regiment
and other units. Some 10.000 people were
present and 4,000 young men offered their
service-. I came to Ottawa and asked Mr.
Sam Hughes. the Minister of Militia, to give
us a brigade. He answered: "Oh, no. We
have as many men as we want, and we lack
offieers."
Sir Wilfrid Laurier carried on a
voluminous correspondence on matters relating
to co-operation in war efforts, during the
year; 1914, 1915 and 1916.
I heard a member of the Senate say, "There
is a Liberal Government in office." Yes, and
in 1914 there was a Conservative-Nationalist
Governient, as there was in 1915, and 1916
and up to May of 1917. Did we assail that
Government on the ground that it was not a
national government and not representative of
the majority of the people? It had won
the day in 1911 and we felt that it should
carry on. Therefore we helped as much as
we could. During those years I never spoke
a word of politics in the Senate, as my right
honourable friend can see by looking through
our Debates. I worked day and night in
trying to help win the war.
We recognized that the Conservative party,
with a Nationalist wing, was in power in 1914,
1915, 1916 and up to May of 1917. In those
years did anyone hear that young Beau
Brummell, Mr. John Bassett, clamour for
union government or a national government?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Oh, no. The Conservatives were satisfied to
retain power. We did not trouble them. On
the contrary, we allowed then to extend their
term by one year. In this Senate and in
the other House we agreed to the extension.
We did not stand up and say that everything
the Covernment did was bad, crooked, and
that the main purpose they had in mind
was the winning of elections. The Conservatives were in power. I will not discuss now
how they retained power in 1917; that is
another chapter.
I should like my right honourable friend
to realize that the Prime Minister stands
high in the estimation of the people. The
Government appealed to the people in March
last and was returned by the largest majority
any government ever received in Canada.
The Prime Minister has surrounded himself
with good and solid men, xvho are at the
helm.
Most people admit that our war
boards are being administered by the best
men obtainable. many of them standing high
in the industrial and financial world. But
apparently all that does not count with my
right honourable friend. If you will read
to-morrow the speech that he has made here
this evening you will find it is a sorry exposition of party politics in this Chamber.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable senat ors,
I have read and listened to scores of speehes
like the one we bave just heard.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

Whici one?

lon. Mr. TANNER:
What informition
did we get from it? How much wiser are we
now with res

affairs than we were before the speech was
made? Not tle slightest. It was on a par

They are all of one tenor: general. miscellaneous, uninformative. For fifty years, mote

to the conclusion, which I think many people

have come to, that because a man is able to
write P.C. after bis name it does not follow
ho has anything more than ordinary ability.
If a person is not born with brains, he will not
acquire them automatically upon appointment to a Cabinet. Yet there seems to be a
general feeling in this country, and perhaps
in other countries, that once a man steps into
the Council Chamber as a member of a government he becomes a superman. There never
was a greater fallacy. As I say, for fifty years
I have been in contact with governments
here and in Nova Scotia and other parts of
Canada, and I am sure tiat no one listeninir

of supermen. Therefore I resent most strongly

fI iýýaIl very well for thie honourable leader
to tell us in a general way that the war effort
is bcing,, well administered, because we have
a lot of respectable men in the Government
to-day. I do not doubt thcy are respectable,

1914 the Right Hon. Mr. Asquith was one of
the most eminent lawyers and prominent
Liberals in Great Britain. What happened to
him? I suppose that if he had been appointed
to the Bench ho would have heen regarded as

one of the most brilliant judges that ever
presided over an English court. 11e had ail
the necessary ahility to qualify him. for a post

of that kind; he was cultured and scholarly.
But rny honourable friend would not deny for
one minute that as Prime Minister of Great
Britain in time of war he was a total failure.

That was no ground for reproach to him as a
man. To use the language of the street, he
was flot eut ont for the job. So he had to
give way to a man who was eut ont for it.

The other day the honourable leader brought
before us a long list of men who have heen
taken into the public service of this country,
into the Department of Munitions and other
departments. Many of them were said to be

301

eminent men, and perhaps they are enjinent

in their own linos. I say nothing against them,
but hecause we have one or two hundred men
in these departments carrying on the business

of the country it does not follow that that
business is being administered as it ought to,

be. The proof that it is being properly administered is to be found in what they succeed in
doing, not in what they say they are doing.
We are told they are doing things, but we
are neyer told anything of their concrote
successes. We cannot get any information.

We have been here since the middle of May,
and probably in less than two weeks we shaîl
be going home. When we go into our respective districts people will ask us: "What are
the Government doing? How are they preparing for this war?" What have we to tell
them? We cannot tell them anything, because
the Governient will not tell us anything.
Does anybody challenge that statement? I
should like to hear it challenged.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: You are the challenger.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: When we go back to
our home districts we shahl have to be witnesses of what? That this Government have
refused to tell us what they are doing to
preparo for war. It means nothing to me to
see a long list of men who have heen taken
into this and that dopartment, or to listen to
my eloquent friend opposite making the kind
of speech we heard a few minutes ago. Thero
is no meat in that speech. It contains nothing
to carry home to our people. It is only a
pieco of partisanship to hoast of winning
eloctions. What in Heaven's name do we care
about elections now? Talk about winning
elections and about having a great majority I
Does my honourable friend not know as well
as I do that bis majority might moît away in
twenty-four hours? Has he not often seon
sucli things happen? I have, on both sides.
I am ashamed to hear my honourable friend
opposite boasting about winning elections
while the world is in flames.
Let us know something about these matters.
Tell us what is being done to prepare for the
fight that is ahead of us. Does my honourable
friend pretend to ýteil me that if the Germans
and Italians were successful in hreaking down
ber defences and taking possession of England,
this country could stand up against invasion?
I do not think he would dare tell me that.
The defence of Canada is ovor there, in Great
Britain. If that defence goes down, may the
Lord help us, unless we do more than we are
doing now. For my part, as I have said before
-and I adhere te, my statoment-I am convinced that this war can neyer be allowed to
come to an end until the forces of the British
Empire are marshalled and equipped with

502

SENATE

every implement of war that can be invented
and made, in order that they may march into
Germany and leave behind them a flame of
devastation, not stopping until they reach
Berlin and there dictate the terms of the
British Empire to the barbarians of Germany
and of Italy. I should like to know if my
honourable friend opposite will challenge that
attitude. I should like to know whether he is
in favour of making peace with the Germans
before the British armies march into Germany
as they did in 1918. If such a folly were to
be committed, we might as well stop now, for
otherwise we should only be postponing the
crushing results that would surely come upon
us in the future.
Now, what are we doing to prepare for
victory? What are we doing to equip our
troops so they can go over fully armed to
join in the march upon the German and
Italian peoples and show them that the British
Empire stands not only for freedom but for
victory, and victory so overwhelming that the
enemy will not forget it for a century?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: What are we doing?
We are passing a great deal of legislation, we
are appointing Ministers and Deputy Ministers and sub-deputy ministers galore. We
are creating an army of officials, and we shall
have to pay them. What are these persons
doing in the way of preparing Canada for the
part that she must play in this war in order
to bring it to a successful end? Ask the Government. Ask my honourable friend. What
does he tell us? "Oh, it is not in the public
interest for you to know." As if the public
interest were identical with the interest of the
Gcovernment! I read to-day a speech which
the Prime Minister delivered yesterday in
another place, and in which, as usual, he
emphasized the rights of Parliament, expatiated on parliamentary government and all
that kind of thing. I presume we may consider ourselves a not insignificant part of this
Parliament. But when Parliament, in the
exercise of its rights, asks to be informed
about what is going on, what is the answer?
"It is not in the public interest to tell you."
I should not have taken part in this debate
had I not listened to my honourable friend's
eloquent, but not informative, address-an
address that was an appeal not to reason, but
to partisanship.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer, too.

It

was an

Hon. Mr. TANNER: It is not the first
time he has told us about winning elections.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

What has he to do with elections? He is a
member of the Senate and should be above
partisanship.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I was not
speaking of that.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Why does he boast
about winning elections, then?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Why does he talk
about victory in the election? What we want
to know about is victory in the war.' But we
shall never win this war with broomsticks or
bows and arrows. We must have all the
implements that genius can devise and
mechanics make, and we have the genius and
the mechanics right in this country. They
can devise and make anything if you give
them a chance. But they are not being given
a chance.
We are pouring millions and
millions of dollars into the United States for
equipment that we should be making in our
own factories, where we have men every bit
as capable and skilful as any to be found in
the United States.
As I have said, the Prime Minister's theme
yesterday was that Parliament is supreme. It
appears that Parliament is supreme only when
it pleases him. As an instance, take one
statement of his. I do not know whether my
honourable friend opposite has been informed
regarding it, but so far as I am aware no one
in this House has been informed. Speaking
yesterday, as reported at page 1627 of the
House of Commons Hansard, from which I
may be allowed to quote a short paragraph,
the Prime Minister said:
I have here on this table communications
that have ariived to-day, one of which I rueard
as so serious that I propose to show it t my
honourable friend tins evening.

He was referring te Hon. Mr. Hanson.
I think he ouglt to know of if at
aonce.

I

thinlik his party ought to know of it.

And that is the end of it. Do we know
anything about it? Are we taken into his
confidence on such an important matter?
No. I do not know whether my honourable
friend has seen this statement or not, but
there it is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have seen the
document itself.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What I really had in
mind in rising to my feet was this. I have
said more perhaps than I intended to saySome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -but I am not sorry
for anything I have said.
An Hon. SENATOR: It is just what was
needed to be said.

JULY 12, 1940
Hon. Mr. TANNER: In the Mother
Country Parliament is taken into the confidence of the Government.
Hardly two
weeks pass there without a secret session
being held, at which the Government invite
criticismn and constructive suggestions. This
week there was such a secret session. The
preceding night I listened to a broadcast from
London by an eminent economist, during
which he intiinated that the purpose of the
secret session was to deal with economic
questions. "0f course," hie said, "I do not
know what the questions or the discussion
wilI bring forth," and hie went on to make a
most interesting and illuminating address of
fifteen minutes on the subject of the economic
questions which he thought might be considered at that secret sesion. Why can we
flot have a few secret sessions of Parliament?
Why can we not be told by men who know
the facts about what is really being done to
prepare us not only for our own defence,
but for our offensive overseas against the
German people? Why can we not have a
secret session to which the honourable leader
opposite could bring these men who know the
facts as to what is being done, so that when
Parliament closes we can go back to our
homes feeling strong and resolute in the
knowledge
that concrete
and practical
ineasures are being taken, and that no matter
what happens Canada will be prepared to
play her part in the offensive as well as in the
defensive operations of this war?
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, some few days ago I intimated,
perhaps improperly, that General Gort, Çommander-in-Chief of the British Forces, should
be replaced. I think that after fistening to the
speech of the honourable gentleman from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner), honourable members will agree that that distinguished old
soldier believes hie is the man for the job.
He has asked frequently, "Why are we not
being given the information that we should
like to have?" Whenever I have felt resentfui at flot knowing just what was being
done, I have had sense enough to realize that
if I were gîven publicly such information
as my honourable friend from Pictou is
demanding, the spies and traitors in Canada,
if there are any-and there are-Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Where?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You have some of
themn in the West--those epies and traitors
would be getting that information as well
as ýI should. I arn confident my honourable
friend fromn Pictou dos not want spies and
traitors to get information that may be handed

303

to the Italian or the German Government,
or to their representatives just across the
line to the south of us.
Now, in just a few words I want to refer
to a statement made, I think, *by the right
honourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen). Early in his speech he referred
to a former Deputy Minister who was in
office during the last war, and who asked him
the other day, as I understood: "How did we
get along ini the last war? How did we carry
on?" Well, I am going to reaurrect some
notable evidence as a very brief intimation
of how we got along. The United Stes
entered the war in 1917, early in April. It has
been said by some that they won the war.
Maybe some of us do not agree with that.
On the 3Oth of January, 1917, a distinguished
gentleman, now deceased, the late Sir Sam
Hughes, who during the early part of the war
wa.s Minister of Militia and Defence, gave
some înteresting evidence in another place
as to what was happening in Canada. Anyone
of an inquiring mind may read at page 673
of the Hlouse of Commons Hansard the following statement:
I wish to relate another incident. One day
I drove fifteen miles through the Valcartier
camp and I found twenty-one offleers on duty,
out of some fifteen hundred. H-aving made
inquiries, 1 found that the flshing was good up
in the mountains, and that the company was
very genial at the suxnmer hotels. In other
words, the camp had degenerated early in the
game, into a huge pienie party.
Far *be it from me to suggest that in the
last war Canada did not do a wonderful job.
I was interested then, and I have been, interested ever since. But why this diaparagement and the criticism that nothing good has
been done during the last ten months, though
the records indicate, as some honourable gentlemen, know, that much more has been done iii
every necessary field of effort than was done
in the firat tan monthe of the Great War?
No honourable gentleman can deny that statement.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot think
of any statement more untrue.
Hon. J. A. MACDONALD: Only one mind
could conceive of that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.: There were
several battles fought before this stage in the
last war. We had a lot to do with winning
them.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes, but my right
honourabie friend knows better, possibly, than
any other man in this House that the batties
in this war are not being fought as were
the battles in -the last war.

SENATE

Thus far
Hon. J. A. MACDONALD:
Canada has had no part in any of the battles
that have been fought.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is the honourable gentleman's view. The honourable gentleman knows the reason why. He has heard
repeatedly of the Canadians being started on
the way to Norway; he has heard of them
being sent across the Channel; but simply
because hundreds of them have net been
slaughtered he insists that Canada has had no
part in the war.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators,
may I ask the leader of the Government if

I think we had better follow the usual

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, I have the honour to inform the
Senate that I have received a communication
from the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General in the following words:

The motion was agreed te, and the Bill

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair in the Chair.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I was about to ask Hon. Mr. Justice
Davis, who will be Deputy Minister if this Bill
passes, to come to the floor; but I have just
met the Minister-to-be, Hon. Mr. Gardiner,
and, if the Senate has no objection, he is ready
to sit by my side and answer directly, and
not through me, the questions you may ask
him. Is that satisfactory?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is quite
a change. I have no objection. It will be
a precedent, though, which will likely be
invoked for a long time to come.

On section 1-short title:
Honourable members,
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
this morning I asked some questions of the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). He
probably has the answers, or, if not, Mr.
Gardiner can give them.
I have an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer from the Minister of National Defence.
It is a general statement, and perhaps after
I read it Mr. Gardiner will give more precise
information. The statement is as follows:
The regulations are now in course of preparaThe exact details are not sufficiently

settled to permit of categorical answers being

JULY 12, 1940
given. Registration le expected to include ail
those of sixteen years and over and the present
plans, subject to final determination, will be
that those to be called up will bie from twentyone Vo at least forty-five years of age.
The plans are that men will be called up
by age categories lu rotation. It is probable
that there will be no exemptions froni those
provided for in the Militia Act and that tîjere
will be no exemptions for individuals as sucli,
but the matter of essential occupations will
probably be dealt witli by a system of postponement as it is ln England and Australia.
It is expected that the first category wiIl be
calle(l up withini two menths.
We have long followed the practice of
asking Mmnisters to, corne to our standing
committees to explain bills. Now, for the
first firnie, we have a Minister present at aur
Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable leader
has omitted to give me the information I
wanted. In the Militia Act and the Military
Service Act of 1917, as in the British Act,
certain categories are specified for registration
purposes. That is ta say, the youths from.
twenty-one to twenty-six, as the case may be,
are required ta register within a certain time,
and aIder classes later, and so an, but variaus
exemptions are provided for. For instance,
men engaged in aircraft industries are exempt.
Now, when 1 go home, I want ta be able ta
answer any young man who cames ta me and
says: "Mr. Haig, I arn twenty-twa. When
will my class be called up?" Another man
may say to me: "I arn twenty-two, and
married. Arn I ta be called up at the same
time as the single men?" And there will bie
questions as ta whether a man with children
is in a different category from a man who has
no children.
Candidly, Mr. Minister, I think you would
do a real service ta Canada if you gave us
information that would enable us ta answer
such questions. It would set at rest a great
many anxious minds ail over this Dominion.
The young men of twenty-ane ta thirty,
unmarried, in non-essential occupations, expect
that they will be called Up under the Mobilization Act, for home defence, but they have it
in the back of their heads, I miglit as well
telI yau, that ultimately, if sufficient; volunteers are flot forthcoming, they will have ta,
go overseas. Now, it is in order ta, settie
existing unrest about these matters that I
arn desirous that we, as members of Parliament, should he able ta give definite replies
to inquiries we receive from young men when
we go home.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have some
information that perhaps covers these questions. When I finish reading, the Minister
will give further information. This is froni

a letter setting out the duties of the judges
in cannectian with national registration:
The boundaries of the registration unit will
bie co-terminous witli the boundaries of the
polling sub-divisions in each federal constituency in the election held in Mardi st. AI]
persans above the age of 16 muet register. The
registration will go on for tliree or four days.
When completed, the Registrar in the local
polling booth will extract the cards of al]
persons between tlie ages of 21 and 45, and wil]
make copies thereof.
AIl the original cards will be sent by the
Deputy Registrar in the poil ta the Registrar,
whose position corresponds Vo that of a returning officer in a Dominion election. The Registrar
sanda ail these original carda ta the Bureau
of Statistie at Ottawa. There is therefore,
left in the province -the copies OÏth carda
Ve
of single men between the aboya ages.
The
Deputy Registrar sends these copies in a separate bundle to the Registrar for the canstituency,
and the Registrar, therefore, wiIl have in hiW
possession the carda of aIl single men in Vie
constituency hetween the said ages.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Between VwenVy-one and
forty-dive.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It will lie Vhe duty of the judge in charge
of the constituency to go through these carda
and classify them juto Vwo groups, namely,
those who conld safely lie called at once for
military training in Canada, and those wio
shoulfi noV ha called up because Vhey are engaged
in some vital war industry.
It is net tic intention Vo set up tribunals
or ta have this judge hear any viva voce
evidence.
1V is realized tiat we must work out somp
principlee ta guide Vie judge, because a matter
of national policy is involved. The national
Goverument muet designate essential industries
as against non-essential industries, aud an
attempt will be made ta furnýisli the judge with
a liat thereof sa hie will have this as a guide.
Then wve are giving consideration Vo preparing
a form Vo furnish Vo ahl employers of labour,
so that if an employer lias a man of muitary
age 1working for thim and lie feels tiat hie
should noVt e puto the immediate list, lie
will be aile ta fill out that forma and make his
representations therein, and mail it ta Vie
jufige for the canstituency.
The judge wihl
tierefore have Vie card of Vie man under consideration and also any written representations
hie employer may see fit ta make.
Instructions ta the Registrar for Vie registration are going forward at once. Tie registration will take place some time about Vie
middle of August. The judges will actually
function a day or so after the registration is
complete, and hetween now and tien we will
have prepared, printed and distributed ta Vie
judges instructions as Vo what are considered
essential and non-essential services, principles
ta be followed, etc. Naturally, we will only
be able teo utline broad principles, and the
judige will have ta apply the saine ta the
individual case. We have ciasen Vie judges
su that the people of Canada will lie assured
that an independent tribunal bas deait witli

no undue, improper pressure can be brought
by any person to have a man's narne placed
on the postpoined list.
As I have said, there will be no exemptions
except a few limited by law, and a person will
always be subject to call, but when will be
dependent upon whether his name is on the
immediate list or on the postponed list.
After the local judge in the constituency has
classified the cards in this way, then all these
cards, with the report of the local judge, will
go to the central judge, who will keep them
in his possession. He will be called upon to
check the cards and classify them into year
groups, that is, 21-year-olds, 22-year olds, etc.
He will, therefore, know in each province how
nany young men of 21 there are in the prov-

ince immediately available for military training.
He will also know the number of men of 21 in
the province who are on the postponed list
because they are engaged in vital services.
When we are notified by the military authorities that a certain number of men are required,
then this central judge will go to his records
and call up the requisite number from the
21-year-old class in the immoiediate list, anti on
froin year to year iutil the requisite number
have been called up. The duties of the local
judges in each constituency vill terminate when
tleir vork is complete immediately after the
registration, but the position of the central or
directing judge will be mtore or less a continuous one. Provision will have to be made
to deal with cases of men who come of age
after the registration, anti this central judge
vill also have to deal with the calling up of
Imen fron time to time as their services are
required by the military authorities for miilitary
training.
I hope that I have made this clear.
It is our desire that as many as possible of
the Superior Courts of Canada or district
court judges should be used, and only when this
type is not available should you call uon the
services of police magistrates.
Does that give some of the information
required by the honourable member?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. Now, with permission
of the House. I should like to ask Mr. Gardiner to outline the set-up for registration.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That cannot be done.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Why cannot it be done?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The statenent would
have to be made by the leader of the House.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We asked the Minister to
come in for the very purpose of making a
statement.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Of course..
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps Hon.
Mr. Gardiner may be allowed to answer.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what I wanted.
I do not know
if there is any oljection, but I suggest there
should be none.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND!

Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I think the
proper procedure is for the Minister to prompt
the leader of the Senate, and the leader can
then reply to the question.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Chairman, technically
you are quite correct, but in a time like this
I am not a bit afraid of precedent. We might
make a new precedent here, but I do not
think there would bo anything wrong about
that. I have great confidence in Mr. Gardiner
and I think that if he tells me what he is
going to do, t will be done. I should like
to hear him explain the set-up for the
registration, so that we may all know about it.
I am not trying to have your ruling rejected,
Mr. Chairman, but I think we should hear
Mr. Gardiner.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Honourable
niembers, if it is necessary to hear the
Minister, then I think we should hear him
at a meeting of a select commnittee. I do
not think it is proper to hear him here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have another
statement, which will perhaps satisfy my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am afraid, Mr. Chairjuan, that we shall have to go to a coimittee,
because I want to hear Mr. Gardiner. I
warned the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that my honourable friend from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) would object to
the making of a staterent by Mr. Gardiner.
I was sure of it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, I
do not ihink it is fair that the honourable
junior senator fron Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) should say he knew I was going to
object. I am simply desirous that the affairs
of this Chamber should be carried on properly.
Surely my honourable friend does not think
ho is in a police court in some outlandish
place in Manitoba! We are in a very important Chamber. and we must be careful to
follow precedents. I think we have already
gone far enough afield in allowing the Minister
of this new department to take a seat next
to the honourable leader of this House. I did
not object to that, but surely the honourable
leader is quite capable of passing on to us
any information in reply to questions. It
was good of the Minister to corne here, but I
object to the extension to him of the privileges of a member of this House.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, Mr. Chairman. My

JULY 12, 1940
hope that I am participating in this discussion
according to the rules of the Senate. I understood Mr. Gardiner came here to make a
statement, but my honourable friend from
Lunenburg has objected to that. I am willing
to admit the objection is well taken, but I
suggest that the Bill will probably not get
through to-night.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We could suspend the sitting and have Mr. Gardiner give
us his explanation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is not according to
the rules.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The explanation would not go on the record.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Here is a statement which I think will satisfy my honourable
friend.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I want the statement from Mr. Gardiner. I am not allowed
to have it, and therefore we shall have to adopt
the procedure which the chairman suggests.
Let the Bill go to a select committee, where
we can get all the information we may desire.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, when the honourable leader of the
House suggested that the Minister sit in and
take part in our proceedings in committee by
answering questions, I quite agreed; but I
called attention to the fact that it was a very
important precedent and meant a great deal
to the Senate. This procedure had been
debated here some time ago, and I myself had
approved of the plan and the principle; but
I did think it was pretty hasty to adopt it
all of a sudden, without giving members an
opportunity to review the rules and consider

the subject calmly. It is an exceedingly
important precedent. I favoured our hearing
the Minister; indeed I got up and said I
raised no objection at all. As I apprehend the
discussion now, honourable members did not
realize that an important step was being taken.
They seemed to think the Minister would
attend here in thë office that usually a Deputy
Minister occupies in a committee of this
House for the purpose of furnishing information. If any senator objects, certainly our
rules do not provide for what we are doing
now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Therefore I
do not see how we could insist on hearing
Mr. Gardiner, particularly in view of the fact
that the chairman himself objects. He is the
judge of procedure while we are in committee.
I should certainly like to get the statement
direct from the Minister, but I do not think
95832-20J

307

that in the circumstances it is right to insist
on this. I merely point out that I agreed and
called attention to the importance of the step
we were taking. It seems to me we ought to
proceed just as expeditiously and thoroughly
as we can to question the Government and
have the advantage of replies coming from
the Minister through the leader of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then I will
answer myself. Here is another statement
which I think will satisfy my honourable
friend. I suppose no one objects to Mr.
Gardiner sitting by my side?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I desire to warn the
honourable leader opposite that I do not intend
to lie under the charge that I acted as though
I were in a police court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely my honourable friend is not so thin-skinned as that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Either the honourable
senator withdraws the charge or the Bill will
not be proceeded with to-night.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend allow me to withdraw it for
him?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I will ask
the honourable senator himself to do so.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It is certainly too bad
that we have such a sensitive member as the
junior senator from Winnipeg.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
fair. The honourable the junior member
from Winnipeg was proceeding according to
the rules.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I have the floor. When
I am through you may get up. The honourable the junior member from Winnipeg
deliberately made the statement that I
objectedAn Hon. SENATOR: Thàt le knew you
would.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes, that he knewHon. Mr. HAIG: That I anticipated you
would.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No; the honourable
member said he knew that I would object.
That was a stupid and ridiculous thing for
him to say, because•he could not know what
I would do; consequently I was quite justified
in saying he was trying to adopt police court
methods. Now, if the honourable senator will
withdraw his statement in regard to me, I

SENATE
will withdraw my statement in regard to him
and say that he should be made a judge of
the Supreme Court of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend to the
fact that the Deputy Governor General is in
the building awaiting the end of our debate
on this Bill. I would ask that we examine
the measure on its merits.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I gave the honourable
leader fair warning that some members on his
side might object to the procedure which he

proposed.
from Lunenburg accuses me of saying he was
going to object. I did not know, but I
anticipated he would object-and I was right.
Now, without that withdrawal there will be
no progress.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: But it was only after I
objected that the honourable gentleman said
he knew I would.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This statement
will, I think, cover the questions which my
honourable friend wants answered:
As it has already been indicated to you, it
is the intention to have a National Registration
forthwith of all persons in Canada of the ages
of 16 years and upwards. This will be a
national stock-taking of the human resources
of the nation. To be of use the registration
must be complete and the returns therefrom
available in the shortest possible time, and it
will be the objective to have everything dons
at least by the end of the month of August.
For the purpose of making the registration
it is the intention to follow as closely as
possible the procedure used in preparing voters'
lists for election purposes. The unit for registration purposes will be the federal constituency. The boundaries of the registration unit
will be based upon the boundaries of the polls
used in the l'ast Dominion election. Where for
the sake of convenience it is necessary to alter
such boundaries, authority will be given so to do.
All those who will be required to register will
have to attend in person and register. Penalties
will be provided for failure to register.
It is the intention to appoint a registrar for
each federal constituency whose position will
correspond with that of a returning officer.
There will be an assistant registrar appointed
for each federal constituency whose position
will be similar to that of an election clerk.
It will be the duty of the registrar and his
assistarnt. acting togetlier, to appoint the deputy
rcgistrars in ecnh poll.

The registrar and assistant registrar will be
paid , as will be the deputy registrars.
The registrar and assistant registrar will be
allowed their necessary travelling expenses,
including mileage, on the same basis as in the
Dominion election. They will be paid a reasonable per diem allowance for the time that they
are actually engaged in organizing and condiieting this national registration. The rleputy
Hon.

Mr. DUFF.

registrars in the registration units will be paid
a reasonable per diem allowance. Registration
booths will likely be open for three or four
days.
The most important consideration is to get
efficient registrars and assistant registrars, as
these men constitute the cornerstone of a proper
organization. We want to obtain the services
of the highest type possible. I am sure that
Members will not forget that many returned
soldiers are available capable of doing work
of this kind.
It is the intention to make this drive for
registration a national effort to be engaged in
by all people of all classes and, so far as
possible and practicable, on a voluntary basis.
We want to conduct this registration at the
minimum of cost and Canadians who wish to
help Canada in the war will here have an
opportunity of rendering service to the nation
free of charge in carrying out this most necessary registration. We want to stress this factor
-and all of this leads to the necessity for the
registrar and his assistant being persons outstanding in the community who will command
the respect of all classes in the constituency.
In the matter of deputy registrars in the
registration units, it is essential that these
persons also be such as will command the confiI would suggest that
dence of the public.
preference be given to the younger men and
women for these appointments, as they must
carry the burden of this war. It is the intention to instruct the registrars and assistants,
who will have the naming of these deputy
registrars, that they should select men or women
from say the teaching profession, municipal
secretaries, secretaries of school districts, or
other similar self-governing bodies, secretaries
of Boards of Trade, Chambers of Commerce,
service clubs, college graduates, bank clerks,
office employees, etc. It is advisable that these
people live in their registration units so that
they will know the people with whom they will
have to deal.
A questionnaire will have to be answered by
each registrant in the registration unit where
lie registers, and great care will have to be
exercised in getting them properly answered.
There will have to be a considerable amount of
tabulating dons in the registration unit, all of
which necessitates keen younger people with
clerical experience to be sure that these records
are properly compiled.
Would you please furnish me with your
recommendation for the position of registrar
and assistant registrar in your federal constituency? As soon as we have these names
instructions will go to the registrar as to how
to proceed.
It is my objective to have this registration
completed in the month of August, and to
attain this objective I must name the registrars
and assistants by Friday morning of this week,
which means that I would like your recommendation to be in hand not later than Thureday evening of this week. Naturally I would
muchi prefer that you furnish me with these
names, but if they are not received it will
likely be necessary to go ahead and nominate
people for these positions.
It is the intention that the Member for the
constituency aid in the conduct of this registration by keeping a supervisory eye over the
organization in the constituency and aiding in
the setting up of a voluntary organization to
assist the registrar and to get the people out
to register.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Chairman, if this Bill is to go through to-night,
and that appears to be the determination of
the Government, I want to, understand the
substantial factors--the policy that wili follow

from the Bill. We are being told how registration is to be carried ouît, and how, after
that, enrolment of men for the army is to be

the training. I amn talking about the man who
is enrolled and trained to fight. He is told,
"You are going into the army." What then?
I amrn ot saying there may not be a satisfactory

are going to do is to ýcall men and train
them. The Minister is to be put in charge of

No.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is what
this Bill says.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I want some
time to think this over. Place the information upon Hansard, and I will read it, and
read it carefully. I know something about
getting ready for the enrolment of men in the
army. I spent days and weeks on the Military
Service Act. How, by means of answers to
questions, you can draft men, classify them
and deal with exemptions, passes my comprehension. If you have an exemption for agriculture during harvest, in many cases it may
exempt two or three men on a farm. That
will be a reason for many to go on the farm,
and that is what they will do. If you apply
a general exemption you will do the gravest
injustice. If you do not, without consideratien of each individual case, you will do a
grave injustice again, because you lift the
exemption from the young fellow who is the
only one on the farm. I do not sec how you
can get along without the application of the
intelligence of the human mind.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Great Scotti
I thought I had read it. Look at section 4.
It says:
It shall be the duty of the Minister to assist
in carrying out the objects of The National
Resources Mobilization Act.
And look at the preamble:
Whereas The National Resources Mobilization
Act, 1940, provides for the mobilization of all
the effective resources of the nation, both human
and material, for the purpose of the defence and
security of Canada, and
Whereas it is expedient to create a Department of National War Services to assist in
carrying out the purposes of The National
Resources Mobilization Act, 1940, and for the
other purposes of this Act-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This training is
for home defence. These men are to be called
by the Defence Department under the Mobilization Act, and that department will be furnished with all the data which is mentioned
in and explained by the letters I have read.
It will have before it the number of men of
teonty-one years of age; and if it decides
that one thousand men in a group or in a certain arca are noeded, it will have cards covering those men.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Would the Minister
of National Defence not be primarily seized
with that responsibility?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How will
it decide that John Smith is to go and Jim
Brown is to stay at home?

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Good gracious! That is just what I a.m afraid of-that
we are going to do more registering, training
and preparatory and preliminary work than
anything else. Who is going to decide that
John Smith is to go into the army and Jim
Brown is to remain out?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Throughout the
and, they will all be trained for the defence
Pf Canada, and they will get their training
inder the Mobilization Act. All men of a
certain age will be called and trained.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHFEN.

and so forth. There may be someone helping
him, or he may be helping someone. But
that is wvhat he is there for. You cannot tell
the House that all the Mobilization Act calls
for is training. The authorization is wide
enough to enable you to train, but it also
authorizes the mobilization of men in the
army to fight.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If that is the
case, is ho going to mobilize men into the
army to fight on the basis of these registration cards? If he is, we are going to have
some time.

where you summon the men te the army.
Is it the intention to compel men to go into

we going to know on what principles the

what principles it is going to do it. That is

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But this is
put before us for review. Are we to be told
that the principles upon which you are going
to compel men to undergo training must be
decided by Parliament, but that the principles
upon which you compel them to fight are to
be decided in the closet by the Government?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is for the
purpose of registering the men who will be
called to the colours to train and to prepare
for the day when Canada may be attacked.
We shall give training to selected men between
certain ages, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
going to worry much about how you decide
that. But I do want the Government to
answer this question. Do you intend to lay
before Parliament the principles upon which
will be decided what men shall be compelled
to join the army to fight for the defence
of Canada, and what men shall be exempted?
Are we to have any say at all about that?

time to submit to Parliament the lists of men
who will be called. All the available men
will be called then.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not
ask for the lists of the men who will be called.
I asked for the principles which are to be
followed in choosing the men. We are told
now the principles which will be followed in
selecting men tç be trained. Is Parliament
going to be informed of the principles to be
followed in selecting which men are to fight
and which men are to be exempted, or are
those principles to be decided by the Government in closet, without any reference to Parliament?
I suppose my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honourable friend knows what he means
when he uses the term "in eloset." He has
been there himself. I suppose he means the
Cabinet.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

I may tell my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honourable friend that I will transmit
his query to the Minister of National Defence.
I have already had placed before the Minister
some questions which partially cover the
very point the right honourable gentleman is
exercised about, and here is Mr. Ralston's
answer:
The regulations are now in course of preparation. The exact details are not sufficiently
settled to permit of categorical answers being
given. Registration is expected to include all
those of sixteen years and over and the present
plans, subjeet to final determination, will be
that those to be called up will be from twentyone to at least forty-five years of age.
The plans are that men will be called up by
age categories in rotation. It is probable that
there will be no exemptions from those provided
for in the Militia Act and that there will be
no exemptions for individuals as such, but the
matter of essential occupations will probably
be dealt with by a system of postponement as
it is in England and Australia.
It is expected that the first category will be
called up within two months.
I can assure my right honourable friend
that if these regulations are prepared within
the next three or four weeks and we are still
here, as I surmise we shall be, they will be
submitted to Parliament.

I beg your pardon.

The GovRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
ernment could have the regulations prepared
within three or four weeks easily enough, and
within one week. When my honourable friend
says they will be submitted to Parliament,
does he mean they will be submitted for
review, to be passed upon by Parliament,
or not?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, if the
country is attacked there will be very little

that he would get some information from his

whether we are to have any say about the regulations which are to determine what men will
be called upon to fight and what ones will be
exempted? Will he let us know this at the
next sitting of the House?
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. DUFF:
of order.

I

should

I am rising to a point

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
order.

We are in

Hon. Mr. DUFF: No, I submit you are not
in order, and that is why I am rising. I
appreciate that the chairman, with his usual
good nature and generosity, has allowed this
discussion to go on in the way it has gone,
but I submit it is entirely out of order. The
Bill bas nothing to do with what the right
honourable leader on the other side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) is asking about. It deals
with the registration of certain people in
Canada, net with whether they fight or not.
My right honourable friend has no right-I
say that with all due respect to him-to ask
the Government what will be done with the
people after they register. I can understand
he would like to know what the Government's
intentions are in that respect. I too should
like to know, but that is something, I submit,
entirely beyond the scope of this Bill.
Whether Tom Jones and John Smith and
Jim Brown are to be called up will be a
matter for the authorities after this measure
is passed and our men have registered.
This Bill has to do with the registration of
every man and woman in the country. It
does not mention that women are to be
included, but they may be, as I understand
that under the law women are now regarded
as persons, just as men are.
The Bill
provides:
The Minister may, with the consent of the
Governor in Concil,
(a) conduct such national registration and
make such survey as may be required for the
effective carrying out of the provisions of this
Act and of The National Resources Mobilization
Act, 1940;
(b) place the results of such registration and
of such survey at the disposal of His Majesty
in the rig:ht of Canada:
lon. Mr. DANDURAND.

After the registration is completed, the name,
place of birth, age, residence, and so on, of
every man and woman in Canada will be
placed before the proper authorities, and then
it will be for them to say who shall join the
Army, who shall fight for this country, and
who shall stay at home, on the farm, or in
the fishing boat. Surely the right honourable
gentleman does not expect the honourable
leader of this House-who has perhaps the
brightest brain in Canada and probably does
more work than any other member of the
Cabinet-to tell us who will be chosen to
join the Navy, the Army and the Air Force!
I repeat that we are entirely out of order in
discussing what should or should not be donc
after this Bill is passed. All we are asked to
decide to-night is whether we are in faveur of
national registration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may be able
to end this debate by moving adoption of
section 1.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Just a
moment. I always tremble when I venture
to oppose the judgment of the senator from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff). I remember his
powerful personality from days past. What
he argues is this, that although we are asked
to pass a Bill calling for the registration of
all the people of Canada, we have no right
to know what will be dono after the registratien is completed. What effect the registration will have on individuals is said to be no
concern of ours at all.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

I did not quite say that.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He does not
mean that at all. Certainly we want to know
what is going to be done after the registration
is completed. Nothing could be more clearly
pertinent to the Bill. However, the discussion would have been through before this if
the honourable gentleman had not risen. If
the honourable leader will say that at the
next sitting of the House he will tell us what
principles are to be applied in selection of the
men and what regulations will govern, I shall
be satisfied.
While I am on my feet, perhaps I may be
allowed to say a few words about the matter
of agricultural exemptions. We all know it
is impossible to make a general exemption in
favour of agriculturists. I am sure the honourable leader will agree with that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
They are not
exemptions; they are postponements.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is to
say, after the harvest is over the farmers will
all be liable to call.

JULY 12, 1940
Yes, they will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
serve a certain number of weeks.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I ask the
head of the Department of Agriculture, who
is within my hearing, to take note. In
the last war the leader of the House was determinedly in favour of a general exemption of
agriculturists. He knew then, of course, and
he knows still better now, that such a general
exemption is utterly impracticable. I hope his
persuasive eloquence will not result in anything of the kind this time. I warn the Minister of Agriculture to be stout-hearted and
to resist importunities in favour of such exemption.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-Deputy Ministers:
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It seems to me, honourable senators, there is no necessity for two
deputy ministers in any department.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I protest against this
section and ask that only one deputy min,
ister of this department be appointed by the
Government.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: What is the reason
for requiring two deputy ministers?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move adoption of the section.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I support
what the honourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duff) says.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Thank you very much.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think there is any more necessity for two
deputy ministers in this department than in
any other department. Why two?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. DANDURAND: There have been
two deputy ministers in the Department of
Defence.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know that.
How many deputies in all are we to have?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It appears to me the
very. height of absurdity, at this late date, to
register everyone in Canada, no matter what
his age. I understand that if a man is paralysed, or otherwise so ill that he cannot go
out to register, an official will be sent to get
his registration. For the life of me I cannot
understand why people of that kind should
be included. Every card that is filled out will
mean a lot of extra work. I would ask the

honourable leader if he does not think it
would be more busines-like to set an age
limit of, say, sixty or sixty-five for persons
required to register, instead of requiring
everybody to register, regardless of whether
he is eighty, ninety or even one hundred years
old.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If a limit were
fixed as my honourable friend suggests, the
registration work would be far more cumbersome.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: No; the work would
be far less.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would be
necessary to have birth certificates produced
by those who claimed to be beyond the age
limit.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If I had the say, I
would limit registration to people up to
fifty. What is the use of having the records
cluttered up with a lot of useless information?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It has been
decided that a general registration would be
far simpler.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That will mean more
cards, more employees, more time and more
expense.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I should like
the committee to understand (that we are
now on section 3. I think that from now on
we should confine our remarks to the section
under discussion.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: A point that is
bothering me is this. What is going to
become of all these ministers, deputy ministers,
assistants and other officials after the war
is over?
Hon. Mr. COPP: They will alI be superannuated.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
point raised by the honourable senator from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) is important.
Let us be frank. Just what is the reason for
requiring two deputy ministers in this department? The reason is that we have two races
in Canada. If anyone thinks I am trying to
keep a French Canadian out of the job, I will
say this: Keep the French Canadian and
dispense with the other one. One of the
curses of this country is the system of duplicate appointments. There are a great many
positions to which, if you appoint a French
Canadian, you must also appoint an Englishspeaking Canadian, and now it is getting that
we can no longer have only one deputy minister in a deparitment. We cannot have one

Justice Davis will draw his salary as judge,
but there was no need of appointing him to

to note the difference between nigbt and day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Who?

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What was the
sense of appointing another judge in Saskatchewan? We appointed him at $9,000 a year.
Now he is brought down here and we are
told it will not cost us anything. Of course
it will cost us something. We are getting two
deputies in this department, two in another.
We are just going to have two deputies in
every department. I plead with the Government to get away from this practice.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I want to thank the
rigt honourable gentleman opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) for his splendid gesture.
I do not share all the views he bas expressed
to-night, but I endorse most emphatically the
stand be took when, in subscribing to the principle implied in the suggestion of my honourable friend from Lunenburg, he stated that to
prevent duplication he would go to the extent
of sacrificing the appointment of an Englishspeaking deputy minister in this department.
If you look through the Civil Service list
you will find other departments with two
deputy ministers.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Shall the clause
carry?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No, Mr. Chairman, I
cannot let clause 3 pass without protesting
against the appointment of two deputy ministers. If we establish this precedent it means
that in future, wbenever opportunity offers,
two deputy ministers will be appointed instead
of one. A case came to my attention a few
weeks ago, and the honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) is also familiar
with it. A vacancy occurred in the deputy
ministership of the Fisheries Department and
continued for a year, when a deputy was
appointed. I do not know who recommended
him or what his qualifications were, but I
Right H'on. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Question!

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Not by any means. I
say there is no necessity for two deputy ministers for national registration. I do not care
who is deputy minister. In spite of what my
friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) bas said,
it seems to me one of the gentlemen suggested
is not doing so badly: he was deputy minister of another department for many years
and, I understand, he is drawing 100 per
cent pension. Unless racial considerations are
to govern, surely there are other gentlemen
in Ontario, Quebec or Nova Scotia who could
do the work just as well as he. As to the
gentleman from the West, whether or not he
is getting remuneration makes no difference;
the principle is wrong. This registration is
only for a short time, and once the work is
done what is there for the deputy to do?
Tben why insist on appointing two deputy
ministers? Let us economize whenever we can.
Though it is not possible for a Government to
economize as we would in our private affairs,
undoubtedly there is no room for two deputy
ministers in this proposed department.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-duty of the Minister:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A couple of hours ago
I rose to ask some questions. In the meantime there bas been a good deal of discussion,
and now I am back again. The right honourable leader on this side and the chairman
pointed out that this Bill is for national
registration. But under this section the Minister is to assist in carrying out the objects of
the National Resources Mobilization Act,
which is the conscription Act. The Mobilization Act provides for enlistment, not for
overseas, but for home defence. Under the
Act men will be called up for training and
then for mobilization as part of the army
for the defence of Canada. The six weeks'
training is as nothing compared with real
war work. In the old militia days you got
your threc weeks' summer training, and then
you trained two nights a week during the rest

JULY i2, 1940
of the season, which would be mucb more
than is proposed to-day. When the registration cards are ready you will need judges
in every district to decide the princîples on
which men shall be called up. I remember
under the Military Service Act une man was
appointed by the Government and one by
the judges of the province.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: None were
appointed by the Government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:- By a tribunal.
Right. Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By a committee of selection.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: And they selected one
man and the judges of the province seeted
another. There was an appeal from the
decisions of the tribunal to the Supreme
Court judges of the province. To my personal knowledge in Manitoba we must have
had a thousand appeals.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That concerned
exemptions.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Exactly; but this will
be the sarne. There will be no exemptions
from training, but when our men are mobilized
for the defence of Canada we have a right
to know what principles .will be applied in
deciding whether this or that man shall be
taken. Take two cases: first, a man on a
quarter-section, with four sons, aged respectively twenty-one, twenty-three, twventy-seven
and twenty-nine, ail single and living at home;
the other, a man on an adjoining section of
land with one son aged twenty-two. Prînciples must be laid down for the tribunals
to apply in dealing with these and other
cases. W/e have a right to, know what the
Government are going to do when this mobilization clause is put into, operation. I arn
worried not about registration, but about
mohilization.
I agree with the bonourable member from
Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon) that it is not
much use to register persons above fifty years
of age. My father is ninety-one. and under
this Bill he would have to, register. Once
men are called up under the mobilisation part
of this Bill, what principles are to be applied,
and what happens? The honourable leader
of the House does not answer my question
by saying, "We wiII lay the Orders in Council
on the Table, we will publish them in the
Gazette, and we will send you, as a senator,
copies of them." He told me that before. I
want to know what principles will be laid
down, such as you and I would approve
when the man-power of this country is called
upon to do its duty in the defence of Canada.
95832-21J

You, Mr. Leader, and I and every member
of Parliament are charged with responsibility
in this matter, and we have no right to say,
"Let the Government dýo it." Througb the
honourable gentleman opposite I suggcst to
the Government that it would be better
to defer consideration of this Bill until
Monday, wben be sbould be in a position to
say to us, "We propose to set up certain
exemptions, and when questions arise on
refusal to grant exemptions provision will
be made for appeal to a tribunal composed
of so and so." I tbink that is important.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But that does
not corne under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. Section 4 provides:
It shall be tbe duty of the Minister to assist
in carrying out the objects of the National
Resources Mobilization Act, 1940.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes, but
there are many things in that Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but one of the things
is to, caîl up men for the defence of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Department
of National Defence will do that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Minister of National
War Services will assist.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes, but he
wilI not draft the regulations.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He will be a party to the
drafting of those regulations.
He is so
.instructed by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Otberwise this section
would not be in the Bill. If the Minister's
work is to be confined to, national registration,
then clause 4 should be struck out. Under
clause 4 it shaîl be his duty "to assist in
carrying out the obj ects of tbe National
Resources Mobilîzation Act, 1940." I tbink
the words are well chosen. I suggest, Mr.
Minister, that you allow this Bill to, stand
until next Monday. We shahl be here for
tbree or four more weeks. You have power
to go on with your registration. Corne down
bere on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday,
whenever you are reaýdy, and give us a
general outline of the principles whicb will be
laid down, so when we vote for this or any
other section we shahl know what we are
voting for.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable frîend wants to take the responsibility of
delaying this Bill for three or four days, let
him vote accordingly, but I shaîl not be a
party to it. It will delay registration for three
or f our days.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How will it?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because that
work bas started and registrars are to be
appointed all over the country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are at
work now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But they cannot
be appointed until authority is given the
Minister.
He can
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
appoint them under the Mobilization Act.
Then if my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend thinks this Bill is useless,
let hirn vote against the motion for third
reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
the point. I was answering the statement
that they cannot go ahead appointing
registrars. Of course they can go ahead.
Everything they say they want to do under
this Bill they can do. They have gone ahead
already. Let them keep right on.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are preparing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Sure, they
The Mobilization Act
have gone ahead.
empowers them to do everything except create
this department.
No one has
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
been appointed but Mr. Castonguay.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All this provides for in a great hurry is training for young
men. Why are we being stampeded as if the
heavens would fall if we did not get this Bill
through to-night? You are going to register
men a month from now, and then call them
out for training for three weeks. Not onequarter of thern will be soldiers by that time.
You could do it all without this Bill. The
three weeks' training will advance the men a
little; but to represent to us that unless this
is thundered through Parliament at once we
shall be behind with our war effort is something we cannot listen to. It is not correctit is not true.
I move the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
adoption of the clause.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, Mr. Chairman. The
leader of the House has challenged me to take
the responsibility of holding up this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Do not worry
about that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not worrying about
it in the least, because I know the young men
of this country want to know what the
Government are going to do under this Bill
and the other one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You will know
it, but not under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Under section 4 you are
calling for mobilizationHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

the young men
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -and
want to know what is going to be done under
this provision. I am charged with the responsibility of finding out, and I am prepared to
stand here and assume that responsibility. I
think the Government ought to say quite
candidly what their policy is. An honourable
member has expressed to-night the feeling I
have had ever since I came into this House
on the 15th of May. The people of this country are not being told enough about what is
going on. We do not need to be afraid of the
Germans or the Italians learning something.
They know more than we do. Under the
mobilization clause the Minister is to assist in
mobilization, and I want to know what flows
from that mobilization. I speak for the young
men of this country. I know them as well as
my honourable friend. The mothers and fathers
of these boys also want to know the procedure,
and if it is necessary to hold up the Bill for
a day or two in order to find out, I am
prepared to assume that responsibility.
An Hon. SENATOR:

You are very brave.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, very brave, but I
will take the responsibility.
I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that for days,
for weeks, you have known that I was pressing
for this information. I asked these questions
when the Mobilization Bill was being considered, and I want to know, and the people
are entitled to know, not only the plan of
registration, but also the plan of mobilization,
and how it is to be carried out. To-day we
As the honourable senator
know nothing.
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) bas said, if
he goes home and is asked what the plan is,
he cannot answer. The honourable leader says,
"You will be notified by the Gazette, and personally."
This is something which is agitating public
opinion. When I was asked by young man
after young man what was the procedure with
respect to mobilization, I had to say: "For the
life of me, I don't know. We passed a Bill for
the mobilization of resources for the defence
of Canada, but what it provides I don't know.
It is a blank cheque to the Government."
They said, "Are you not going to find out what
the Bill provides?" I do not want to know
whether these young men are going to be
called on the 1st of September, October or
November; I do not want to be told anything that would assist the enemy; but I do
want the fathers and mothers and the boys
to know the principles under which the choice
is to be made.

JULY 12, 1940

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman knows very well that he is talking
as if he were addressing a meeting outside.
Hlon. Mr. HAIG:

Ail right.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman should know that the regulatians
will be published. That will be done, not
under this Bill, but under the Mobilization
Act.
Han. Mr. HAIG: 1 may misconstrue my
responsibilities, but I think one of them is to
pass .iudgrnent on these regulations. I think
that is the responsibility of every member of

this Bouse and of the House of Coýmmons,
and we owe it to the young men of this country ta see that this matter shahl not be left
tu the judgment of fifteen men, but shall be
passed upon by the three hundred and fortyone men and wonien who make up this Parliament.
I arn not going ta presumne ta tell the

honourable

gentleman what

he should or

should not say. I arn simphy trying ta indicate
what I think ought ta be donc, so that in
years ta corne people will flot be able ta
say ta me: "Why didn't you ask for that
information? Why were you so dumb as ta
sit there and let the Government put tha,
legislation through without raising your band
or voice?" 1 arn raising my band and my
voice now, and 1 say ta the Government, it
is your duty ta tell Parliament and the country
the principles under whidh these men are going
ta be mobilized for the defence af Canada,
because just as surely as my honourable friend
is leader of the House, just as surely as his
distinguished record will go down in history,
the men who are called up under the Mobilization Act will ultimately have ta go ta Europe
ta fight the battle for freed'om. The honourable gentleman knows it, and I know it.
Therefore we ought ta be very careful ta
let the people know what those principles are.
Do not be afraid of the peuple. Do nat
spring this thing on them without cansulting
Parliament while it is still in session. I plead
with the Minister ta give us this information.
I think I shal
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
be able ta give the information from the
Department of Defence within a few days.
But it will not corne under this Bill. This
Bill bas notbing ta do with it.

Section 4 was agreed ta.
On section 5--powers of Minister:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I just remind
the Minister that the Defence of Canada
Regulations passed under the authority of
the War Measures Act have been submitted
ta a committee of Parliament. Those regulations, though of very great importance, are
flot comparable in importance with the regulatians which the Gavernment intend to pass
under the Mobilizatian Act, and I warn the
honourable gentleman not ta give effeet ta
these regulations until they have been subrnitted ta Parliament for its approval.
Section 5 was agreed ta.
On section 6-other duties:
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Mr. Chairman, I submit that these clauses aught ta be read carefully, s0 that we may understand them.

7. The Minister rnay establish national, provincial, or local councils, committees or boards

Sections 11, 12

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I should like ito
know why section Il does not provide for
the same procedure as section 5 of the Mobilization Bill. Under that Act, if we are not in
session, the Orders in Council have to be
published in the Gazette, and copies have to
be sent to members of the House of Commons
and of the Senate. Why is that not done
under this Bill?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is because the
Department of Justice suggested that this was
a better form.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: It is not a matter
of form; it is a matter of information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That was the
reason given when the section was drafted.

SALARIES BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 90, an Act to amend the
Salaries Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill is consequential upon the one we have just passed.
With leave, I would move the second reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have not
got the Bill yet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill simply
amends the Salaries Act, chapter 182 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, by adding at
the end of section 4 of that Act the following:
The Minister of National War Services . . .
$10,000.
Of course Mr. Gardiner has been receiving
that amount as Minister of Agriculture, but
in future he will receive it as Minister of
National War Services.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have not
got the Bill, and I do not understand the
explanation. Perhaps the honourable leader
will tell us what will happen to this planet
if the Bill is not passed to-night.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill is consequential upon the Bill we have just passed,
constituting the Department of National War
Services.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The Bill has not
been distributed, has it? I have not seen it,
if it has.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
if it has. It is a very short Bill, which simply
amends the Salaries Act, chapter 182 of the
revised Statutes, by adding at the end of
section 4 the words:
The Minister of National War Services . . .
$10,000.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Does that mean
the Minister gets an extra $10,000?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He does not
get an extra $10,000?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not know
why the Bill is necessary. Why does there
have to be a measure entitling Mr. Gardiner
to draw $10,000 as Minister of National War
Services, when he is already drawing it as
Minister of Agriculture?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
When he is
sworn in as Minister of National War Services
he will cease to be Minister of Agriculture.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And then it
is itended to appoint a new Minister of
Agriculture, is it? Who will have the responsibility for the wheat problem of the West?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend knows what the responsibilities
of the Ministers are.

JUJLY 12, 1940
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is it the
judgment of the honourable leader that this
is a good time for the Minister to be getting
rid of the responsibility of deciding the wheat
policy of the West?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: My right honourable
friend probably realizes that the wheat problem is the responsibility of the Minister of
Trade and Commerce, not of the Minister
of Agriculture.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no, it is
the responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture, from Saskatchewan, the wheat province. No other Minister can take that
burden off his shoulders.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Mr. Speaker, this
Bill has never been distributed, and we have
never seen it. We know nothing about it.
Yet the honourable leader gets up and moves
second reading. I for one will object until
I see the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will show it to
my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I do not want to
see it now. I want to take it home and read
it. The honourable gentleman has no right
to move that a Bill which has not been
printed or distributed in the House should
be read a second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friendHon. Mr. McMEANS: I rise to a point of
order and I ask His Honour the Speaker to
make a ruling.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend-

My honourable

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I rose to a point of
order and I ask His Honour the Speaker to
rule on it.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At the opening
I moved that these two Bills, by leave, be
given the three readings to-night.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I object.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is too late.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: His Honour cannot overrule me, because I am only asking
that the rules of the Senate be followed. Two
days' notice is required for second reading of
a Bill unless there is unanimous consent that
the notice be dispensed with.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The point
raised by the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) is well taken, but
with leave of the Senate the Bill could receive
third reading at this sitting.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Mr. Speaker, I have
stated my point of order and I want your
ruling on it. The Bill was read for the first
time to-night, and two days' notice is required
before it can be read the second time. The
honourable leader has no right to move second
reading without the required notice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said that by
leave I would move the second reading, and
that was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Leave is not given
when one senator objects.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But leave was
granted to make the motion.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No; I objected to
it. And I want a ruling by the Speaker.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The Speaker has
ruled.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: This Bill has
already been given second reading.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No. Here is a Bill
that we know nothing about; that has never
been distributed to honourable members. Yet
the leader of the House moves second reading.
I object to the second reading being given
to-night.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Read the Bill.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No, do not read the
Bill. I want the Speaker's ruling.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The Speaker bas
ruled.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I want a ruling by
the Speaker on the point I raised.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps I
can compose this difficulty. Even if I am
wrong in saying that leave was not given to
move the second reading, any honourable
member could object to the third reading
to-night. I have no desire, not the slightest,
to postpone the second reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Second reading.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I object.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am afraid
our record will be wrong if we put through the
second reading in this way.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The honourable
leader no doubt has great power over this
House, but he cannot dictate to everybody
and ask for this, that, and the other thing in
violation of the rules of the House. I want a
decision by the Speaker.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When these two
Bills came before the House I suggested that
leave be given for second and third readings.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: My honourable friend is wrong. He may have suggested
that leave be given, but, until the vote for
second reading is taken, any senator can
object to the motion. Why go ahead in the
face of the objection which has been recorded.
1 have flot encouraged the objection, but it
seems to me that the Bill would flot be
advanced vcry mucb even if it were held
that leave Lhad been given to move second
reading and the motion were passed, because
objection to the third reading to-night would

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The decision
of the Chair is that the second reading of a

not think he should have forcod second reading in the circumstances. I myseif will obj oct
to the third reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will movo that
the rule requiring- one day's notice between
second and third readings be suspended, and
that the Bill be now read a third time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: That motion
cannot ho passed except unanimouslY, because
no notice was given. What is the terrible
hurry about getting the Bill through to-nigbt?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I can sce the
joke which is being perpetrated on the other
sîde. and the pique ag-ainst the Minister who
a pparently has sucepeded in mieriting the rancour of the opposition in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is very

unf air. I have flot the least objection to
passage of this Bill. In fact, I rather pleadcd
with my bonourablo friend behind me (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans) flot to press bis objection.
But Le bas a right to press it if Le so, dosires.

The beavens will not fali if the Bill stands
over until Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In a few minutes
the Deputy« of the Governor General will be
bere to give Royal Assent to, a couple of
other bills. Will my right honourable friend
take the responsibility of asking the Governor
General to send bis Deputy bere next week

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Suppose the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The objection

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: None whatever.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A motive, wbich

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The bonourable gentleman is wrong there, and I wish ho
would take my assurance on that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why sbould a
group of serious men stop the passing of a
consequential Bill like this?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: The honourable gentleman is wrong in saying there is
some special motive. Tbe bonourable senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMcans) bas
taken bis point very mucb to heart; more
deeply than I should. We ougbt to respect
bis rights as a member, whether we sympathize

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Mr. Speaker, I want

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 90, an Act to amend the
Salaries Act.
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable senators,
I have heen severely criticized because I took
objectionHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Criticized by
whom?
Hon., Mr. McMEANS: By ail the members
of the House. They accuse me of being
responsible for the calling of this special sitting
this morning.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That is true.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Yes, that is true.
There is no doubt about that. But if the
calling of a special meeting of this House
will revive the principle that the rules of this
House must be more strictly observed, I shaîl
be satisfied, and shaîl feel justified in my
belief that the criticism is not well founded.

SENATE
What does this House amount to? Is it to
be just a rubber stamp? Is it here merely for
the purpose of signifying its approval of bills
that come from the other House? Are we
to put bills through the first, second and third
readings without any question and without
any delay? Why do we have rules in this
House? We have them so that we may proceed with our business in a regular and uniform
manner. And I doubt very much whether,
.even with the leave of the Senate, those rules
can be abrogated. They were promulgated
for the government of this whole body, and
some attention should be paid to them. I
am the last man in this House to criticize

make one more remark, and it will be a short
one. The other day I was astonished, amazed,
when the honourable leader of the Government in this House got up and told the members on bis side they could vote as they pleased.
Otherwise, apparently, they would have had
to vote as he wanted them to. He got his
instructions, no doubt, at a consultation with
the Prime MinisterHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Since my honourable friend is a stickler for the rules, I
would ask him to speak to the question before
the House, which is the third reading of this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: All right. I was
trying to explain why I was severely criticized
for objecting to the third reading last night,
and I went on to say that I thought it was an
amazing thing that the leader of the Government in this Chamber should have got up the
zther day to tell the members on his side
they could vote as they pleased on the measure
then under discussion. Otherwise, it would
appear, they would have had to vote as be
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

told them, or as the Government asked him
to tell them. I think that is going too far.
What is the use of the Senate under such
conditions? There is no dictation on this
side of the House. We listen to our leader
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), but are free to
vote as we please. That the honourable leader
on the other side should get up and say to
his followers, "You must vote as I tell you,"
is something beyond my understanding.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend knows his leader has more than once
said, "I speak for myself, not for my colleagues, who may vote contrarily to me."
He was simply stating what I said in another
form. I had been asked by some of my colleagues if the measure we then had under
consideration was one to which the Government attached special importance, and because
of that query I wanted to state that everyone
could exercise his own judgment and vote
according to his inclination.

I am just as much interested in the orderly
procedure of the Senate as you are, honourable members, and if you desire me to insist
on a strict observance of the rules I shall
act accordingly.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

The Hon. the SPEAKER: As I understand
this to be your desire, I declare the honourable gentleman is out of order.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

All right.

Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
now it is understood that we must comply
strictly with the rules, and, as I shall not be
in attendance for the remainder of the session, I trust the House will permit me to
make a few observations which, while pertin-

JULY 13, 1940
ent to general legislation, may not be quite so
pertinent to this particular Bill.
I agree with some other senators in deprecating the introduction of party politics into our
discussions. And undoubtedly party politics
have been too much in evidence during this
session.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: I hope my remarks will
be received in the kindly and non-partis'n
spirit in which I make them. I came here
this session realizing that, the Government
having been returned with a large majority,
responsibility for conducting the war rests
on them, but I was hopeful that in my capacity as a member of this House I might be of
assistance to them in their war efforts.
It was obvious to me, as I am sure it was
to all honourable members who have had
much experience in politics, that charges of
party favouritism were certain to arise, regardless of how careful the Government might be
to forestall adverse criticism. That is quite
natural. New departrnents have to be created
and staffs increased to take care of the extra
work resulting from this war. The Minister
in charge of a department looks around to
get the assistance of those in whom he has
the fullest confidence. When he reaches that
stage of life at which most of our Ministers
have arrived, to whom does he turn for this
assistance? As a matter of course he relies
on those with whom he has been associated
throughout his public life. I recall that in
response to a letter from the Minister of
National Defence advising me lie was endeavouring to restrain party patronage in any
form whatever, I pointed out to him that
while I whole-heartedly commended his attitude, I did not think it was possible under
our party system to avoid charges of party
favouritism.
In that regard I think the
Government should exercise the greatest care,
for under our party system the natural drift
is entirely towards patronage. And this applies
to both parties. It is frequently said this is a
Liberal war. That is something ithe Government should guard against. If we are to
secure the most effective co-operation in our
war effort, it is absolutely essential to get the
united support of our people.
Now, what have we found during this session? I have attended every sitting of the
Senate and almost every meeting of our committees, and I want to say to the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
and to my colleagues generally that I am going
home very much disappointed. I feel that I
have helped but very little, if at aIl, in the
prosecution of the war. Why is that? We

323

heard early in the session that there would
be secret meetings of Parliament at which we
would be given some information so that we
might know a little about what was going on.
I leave it to any honourable member of this
House to say whether lie knows any more
than I do-and I get my information by the
underground route, which is not very -reliable.
It does seem to me that honourable members
of the Senate should possess the details which
the public expect them to possess.
They
should have some information in addition to
what goes out on the radio, something substantial as .to the real progress of the war,
and upon which can be based a hope for
victory. I manufacture my own hope for
victory. It is inbred in me to do so. I
believe we are going to win the war, but when
I get home I should like to be able to give the
man in the street something -more authentie.
We have had nothing of that kind.
We have all heard the criticism referred to
by the honourable senior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans), that this House
is simply a rubber stamp. There is some
justification for the criticism. What opportunity have we had to look into any bill
of importance that has come to this House,
and to consider it and help to improve it?
Take the incidents of last evening. In my
judgment the blow-up occurred, as these
blow-ups always do, because of a feeling of
being curbed and restrained from participating in the affairs of the nation. I am certain that most honourable members on this
side of the House will agree with me in this
respect, and that not a few honourable members opposite feel equally strongly about
what has been imposed upon them this session.
The Bill we discussed last night could
easily have been here a day or two sooner,
even though it necessitated a short delay in
the discussion of the Budget. I am satisfied
that if the Bill had come here sooner and
had been referred ýto a committee, where
Hon. Mr. Gardiner could have sat down and
diseussed the situation with us, we should
then have had some idea of the plan in mind,
and had an opportunity to offer our suggestions. But we had no such opportunity, and
I and other honourable members will have to
go home lacking the knowledge and the
enthusiasm which would enable us to be
helpful. There has undoubtedly been too
much haste in this sessionHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I readily admit
that.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: -much
of which, I
think, was unnecessary. I have the greatest
confidence in the combined wisdom and experience of honourable members of this House.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
there is a suggestion I want to make, which
is not pertinent to the question before us. I
know I am out of order, but perhaps honourable members will not object. When we come
to deal with the Unemployment Insurance
Bill, labour and industrial organizations will
undoubtedly request to be heard. Might I
suggest to the Government that the Bill be
referred to our Banking and Commerce Committee for the hearing of publie representations, and that honourable members of the
other House be invited to attend the committee's sittings and even to ask questions?
I think that procedure would save time and
facilitate the work in both Houses. It occurs
to me that honourable members in another
place will be kept busy on the Budget resolutions and Supply, and that it night be more
convenient to have the committee work done
by the Senate. J make that suggestion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course, I
do not know what the Conmons will do.
If they send the Bill to a committee for
the hearing of representations, we might be
able to save time by obtaining for the members of our Banking and Commerce Committee the privilege of attending sittings of
the committee of the other House, with the
right to put questions. Representations made
before that committee would be printed in
its rcord, which would be distributed to
us, and I think it would be somewhat unseernly
if they were repeated over here.
While on this subject I have a suggestion
to make, and I hope it will be given sone
publicity. It is that if any associations or
groups desire to make repre-entations, after
becoming acquainted with the text of the
Bill, they should communicate with His Honour the Speaker, or either of the Houses,
saying they wish to be heard and giving a
sumnary or outline of the representations
they would like to make. On previous
occasions we have had inquiries-my honourable friend was a party to one of them-from
groups who had no mandate whatever. Organizations of that kind should not ask for a

PRIVATE BILL
CONCURRENCE IN COMMONS AMENDMENTS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, a message has been received from
the Bouse of Commons returning Bill E, an
Act respecting The Detroit and Windsor
Subway Company, with several amendments,
to which they desire the concurrence of the
Senate.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to
concur in the amendments?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Wait. Honourable members, I do not like to concur
until I have at least a slight knowledge of
what the amendments are.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: The honourable member from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) is going to speak on the amendments.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable members, if I have your permission
to do so, I am about to move that these
amendments be considered forthwith. If there
is any objection, I would move that consideration of the amendments be placed on the
Order Paper for the next sitting of the House.
The whole matter is one that can be explained
in a minute or two. and it is merely a question
of whether to go on now or to wait until
another occasion.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Now.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am prepared to hear the explanation now.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: The
Bill as passed by this House on the 13th of
June was an Act to amend the Act of Incorporation of this company. That Act of Incorporation was passed in 1926 or 1927 and
provided that the whole of the company's
shares, consisting of one million in number,
should be issued as of no par value. What
is desired by the company, and what was
enacted by the Bill we passed a month ago,
is simply that the whole capital stock of the
company may, by the unanimous consent of
the shareholders, be changed into one million
shares of the value of $3 each. And provision
is made by the Bill that the original existing
shares of no par value may be exchanged for
the new shares of the value of $3 each.

327

The House of Commons has amended the
Bill to provide that this exchange of shares,
to be effective, must be made before the
first of February next. There is no objection
whatever to that amendment.
The only other amendment made by the

Commons provides that not some alone, but
all, of the existing no-par-value shares must
be exchanged. In other words, the second
amendment is simply to strike out of the Bill
as passed by this House the words "any or.
As it left this House the Bill provided that
any or all of the existing no-par-value shares
might be so exchanged. The Commons amendment would seem to follow from the provision of the Bill that consent of the present
shareholders to the exchange should be
unanmous.
I do not know whether the amendments
that I have described could be considered,
in the language of our rule on the subject, as
merely verbal or unimportant, but there they
are. The company has no objection whatever to them. In fact, the company's representative, with one of the members of the
House of Commons committee, prepared these
amendments. They are entirely acceptable,
and, with the consent of the House, I move
that they be adopted.
The motion was agreed to.
FERRY SERVICE, WOOD ISLANDS,
P.E.I.-CARIBOO, N.S.
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the Government:
1. When will the proposed ferry service
between Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island,
and Cariboo Harbour, Pictou county, Nova
Scotia. be in operation?
2. Is it intended that when that ferry service
is in operation the steamer service now operating between Charlottetown and Pictou will
be discontinued?
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I have the following answer to the
honourable gentleman's inquiry:
1. It was proposed to commence the ferry
service about the end of June, 1940, but the

car ferry steamer Sankaty, which was being
made ready for this service in Halifax, has
recently been requisitioned by the Depart-

ment of National Defence, and is no longer
available. It is therefore not expected that
there will be any ferry service over this route
this year.
2. Yes.

the consent of the House, I should like to give

to the honourable gentleman that he may
give notice of bis question on the Order Paper,
and I may answer it. Just now there is
nothing before the House.
I may say that Canada will not attend the
Conference, perhaps for various reasons, but
one is that Canada bas not been invited.

JOINT DEPUTY MINISTERS

Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
before the House adjourns, may J have your
permission to raise a question of privilege?
Hon. Mr. HORNER:

Louder.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I was surprised, not
to hear my honourable friend from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner), but to read
in the newspapers of last Saturday a wrong
interpretation of the stand I had taken in
this Chamber the previous night with respect
to the appointment of two deputy ministers
in the new Department of National War
Services. My surprise was increased when I
discovered that the Hansard report was incomplete. What I meant to say, and what I
did actually say, was that the words of my
right honourable friend the leader of the
Opposition (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) expressing bis willingness to forego the appointment
of an English-speaking deputy minister and
have only one deputy appointed, in the person
of Colonel LaFleche, were a proof of his fair
play and of his earnest desire for economy.
But I explicitly added the following remarks,
which constituted my main point:
When one looks up and down the list of all
the deputy ministers or assistant deputy ministers, one is astonished to find the names of
but tbree or four French Canadians, and to
discover that in every case an English-speaking
deputy minister bas to be appointed simultanecusly.
Honourable members will readily understand
why I deliberately refrained from commenting upon such a condition at the time, but
I do believe, with all deference to the Government, that I was fully justified in at least
mentioning the fact.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

SUSPENSION

0F THE

PROPOSED

RULES

MOTION

On the notice of Hon. Mr. Dandurand:
That he will Inove:
That from and inclusive of to-day until the
end of the session rules 23 (f), 24 (a), (b),
(d), (e) and (h), 63, 119, 129, 130 and 131 be
suspended.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, when I placed this motion on the
Order Paper I felt that conditions which had
prevaihed in the Senate since 1921, and especially since 1932, when my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) entered this
Chamber.' nu longer existed. No doubt honourable members have noticed that since I became
Goverument leader in 1935 I have neyer taken
ajey action that did not carry with it the
goodwihl and assent of my right honourable
friend.
Very often rules have been set
aside, or ignored, in order that the work
of this Chamber might be prornoted.
Last
week there seerned to develop around my
right honourable friend a sentiment of revoît,
which he could neither stem nor control, and
I have been wondering whether we should
not do as was dune yearly before 1921, that
is, suspend the rules with respect to legisiation
that cornes to us in the last days of the
session. I thought that by su doing we might
strengthen the banda of my right honourable
friend as regards his own supporters, and
enable him to continue to direct the procedure
of this Chamber, in conjunction with mysef.
I have refiected over this procedure. As in
the past, I wish to take nu action during these

329

final days of the session, or at any future
time-if fate should allow us tu meet again
in this Chamber-in which I shaîl flot have
the goodwill and assent of my right honourable friend.
This being su, I thought I
would suspend this motion, to subrnit it
again to the House when my right honourable friend is agrecable and thinks there is
cause or reason for su doing.
I would ask that the motion stand.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Hunourable members, I amn not objecting to the motion
standing, though I would much rather that it
feli. I was surprised to see it on the Order
Paper. I do not think it is at ailnecessary.
If it is intended, as the leader of the House
bas suggested, to fortify me in rny command
of this division of Parliament behind me, I
would say the character of commrand which
this motion seeks to fortify is not sucb as I
desire to hold. On this side of the House a
measure of independence is very often in
evidence. It was not shown just last Friday.
What happened then amounted to nothing.
For my part I have neyer discouraged such
independence, and do not intend to discourage
it. Sornetimes it would even appear that the
following departs while the leader heroically
stands; but that I do not mind at aîl. We
have got on very well. Frequently it is the
part of wisdom and of commun sense to ask
for the approval of the entire House, both
aides, and almost universally it is grantedvery rarely is it 'refused. Su far as I amn concerned, if it were refused, the reason for refusai
would be one which I know would appeai to
my honourable friend opposite. I arn anxious,
as I know he is, to have the individual rights
of each member preserved. These have been
exercised across the fluor as well as on this
side. Consequently I think it would be a
grave mistake to pass this motion at any tirne.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For my part, I
may say to my right honourable f.riend that I
always favoured independence and thought that
a senator's freedom of action should not be
impaired. My right honourable friend was
not here in 1922, but I would draw his attention to a statement I made in January of
that year, when I was given the responsible
and honoumable post of leader of this House,that I recognized nu followers and I shunned
the party whip. I doubt if to this day I have
called a caucus of my friends. We have met
once or twice in the hast ten years, but not te,
direct the course that any senator shouhd take
in this Chamber.
I should also like to say tu my right honourable friand that a motion such as now
stands in rny name was made as a matter of

SENATE

0

practice towards the end of every session up
to 1921. On May 18 of that year a similar
motion was moved by Sir James Lougheed,
and Senator Bostock said:
I do not want to stand in the way of the
Government proceeding with necessary business,
but I do think that the rules should be maintained, and not suspended, until it is absolutely
necessary to suspend them.
To that Sir James Lougheed replied:
T would point out to my ionourable friend
that it is very desirable, for the purpose of
expediting the business before Parliament, to
pass the motion which I have placed on the
Order Paper, inasmuch as there are a great
number of private bills that have come or will
come before the House, and the probabilities
are that they will have to be dropped unless
this motion is passed. I have been informed
this morning that tiere is a probability of
Parliament proroguing at an earlier date than
we anticipated: from all I eau learn, there is
every probability of Parliament proroguing next
week. Even if the motion passes, it cannot be
subject to abuse, because if it becomes apparent
that any injustice would be doue or that the
publie business would suffer by the suspension
of the ruies, any honourable gentleman will have
the opportunity of moving that this shall not
apply to any bill in question. I think it is very
desirable that this motion should be passed.
The motion was passed. Incidentally, Sir
James Lougheed was wrong in his expectation
of an early end to the session, as we ourselves
often are, for prorogation did not take place
that year until the 4th of June.
I would suspend this matter until next week,
and tlen I may diseuss with my right honourable friend the desirability of bringing it
forward. I ask that the notice stand.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, I understand it is the desire of both
leaders that this notice stand for the time
being.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Just one's
desire, in which the other acquiesces.
PAN-AMERICAN UNION AND
CONFERENCE
INQUIRY

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Hughes:
That lie vill inquire of the Government:
1. Will Canada be represented at the PanAmerican Conferences that will open in Havana
on Saturday next?
2. If not, will Canada becorne a member of
the Pan-American Union in the near future?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have an answer
for the honourable gentleman.
Hon.

Mr. MURDOCK:

just now.
T

Ion. Mr. DANDURAND.

He is not here

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps I should
give the answer, and it may dispose of the
matter. To the first question: "Will Canada
be represented at the Pan-American Conferences that will open in Havana on Saturday
next?" I have already answered: No. To the
second question, "If not, will Canada become
a member of the Pan-American Union in the
near future?" my answer is that this is not a
matter to be considered at the present time.
PRIVATE BILL
REFUND OF FEES

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN moved:
That the parliamentary fees paid upon Bill R,
an Aet to incorporate Sisters Servants of Mary
Immaculate, be refunded to Messrs. Ewart,
Scott, Kelley, Scott and Hloward, solicitors for
the petitioners, less printing and translation
costs.

He said: Honourable senators, this Bill has
now passed both Houses. The work of the
Sisters in the Prairie Provinces is religious
and charitable. That is the ground upon
which I am asking for the refund.
The motion was agreed to.
ANTI-BRITISH PROPAGANDA
On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I find myself compelled
again to bring up this question of the circulation in Canada of American newspapers which
militate against the war effort of this Dominion, more especially with reference to the
two I have repeatedly brought to the attention
of the Government, namely, the Saturday
Evening Post and the Chicago Tribune, but
particularly the former.
The honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has been good enough to
show me an opinion of certain officials who,
from the censorship standpoint, argue against
a prohibition of those newspapers. I am not
at liberty to give their reasons. If I were,
I should not need to answer them; they
answer thsemselves. I can only say that the
reasons have not impressed me in the slightest.
We have had a committee of this House
endeavouring to recommend to the Senate a
course of activities in which every senator
could participate with a view to stimulating
in our people a sense of the realities, and a
firmness of resolution to sec this war through
and to keep in their proper place any elements
in this Dominion which would attempt to
impede our activities. While we are endeavouring to do that and our programme is
under way-we are listening to it almost day
by day-we permit our whole work to be

JULY 18, 1940
destroyed by profit scavengers from across the
line. An article has just appeared in the sheet
that I named first, under the heading, "Wings
of Atonement," designed deliberately to pour
ridicule on the capacity, the sense of duty
and the manliness of the British people, and
to undermine the war spirit of this country.
Now, I want to know: Are we at war or
are we not? If we are at war, do we permit
this condition to continue? Do we permit
the poison to permeate? If it originated in
our own country, it would be immediately
suppressed and the poisoner punished or
hanged. I cannot impress on the Government
with sufficient earnestness the imperative need
of immediate action. I cannot permit my own
feelings any further expression, or my language
would be away past the limitations imposed
by Parliament.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I may say that my ire has not
been aroused nor my blood stirred by the
newspaper articles referred to. They do not
reach me nor my home. If they did, I
should probably show as much indignation as
my right honourable friend now displays. I
will bring my right honourable friend's statement to the attention of the Minister in
whose department the Board of Censors
funetions.
It will be recalled that last month, when
my right honourable friend brought, this
matter to our notice, I stated thait in view
of a situation of high political order which
had lately developed, and the amicable relations existing between the United States and
Canada, it would be necessary to consider the
effect which a ban on these papers would
have in certain circles in both countries. In
view also of their somewhat limited circulation in Canada, it was considered inadvisable
to give them the additional publicity Which
would follow our taking radical action against
them. Be that as it may, I am sure that
when apprised of the situation the Government
will not hesitate to take drastic action, regardless of what its political effect may be.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I am wholly in agreement with the
remarks of the right honourable gentleman
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). In this connection I would refer specifically to the Montreal
Standard of Saturday last, the front page of
which contains this striking headline: "CupidLooming Draft-Exhaust Marriage Licences."
In the article itself it is said that "a certain
marriage licence operator who normally on a
Saturday morning sold no more thant ten
licences, to-d!ay sold twenty within two hours
and had to turn away thirty prospective
customers." The Ottawa Journal of last Monday contained a striking article indicating the

331

number of marriages which had taken place
the preceding day in Hull and other cities.
May I ask the honourable gentleman from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), who is
chairman of the C.ommittee on War Co-operation, whether his committee will not take
this particular phase as it affects Canada's
war effort under consideration with an eye to
the future, in order, if possible, to prevent a
further exodus to the woods or hills when
the draft is put into operation? Notwithstanding what those anti-British papers are
saying, I think they can find in our Canadian
papers of the last few days considerable
ammunition with which to go farther than I
have read of any -of them going yet.
Hon. L. COTE: I quite agree with what the
honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) has just said. The other day our
Ottawa papers contained an announcement
that Ontario's revenue from the issue of
marriage certificates had risen from $3,000 to
$12.000, indicating a great increase in marriages.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
coming back to the issue raised by the right
honourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen), may I make a suggestion for
what it is worth? I happen to be more or
less connected with the publishing business.
Ever since the censorship board was constituted I have been at a loss to understand what
the board really intended to bar from the
columns of Canadian newspapers. Any editor
in Canada to-day asks himself just how far
he may go with respect to this or that item
of news. My right honourable friend took
exception, and rightly so, to what is contained
in the Chicago Tribune and the Saturday
Evening Post. As a test case, I would suggest
that a Canadian newspaper reproduce one
or two articles from each of the two papers
referred to, in order to ascertain how far a
Canadian publication may go in helping to
spread anti-British propaganda-propaganda
which appears in those two papers with apparently the indirect blessing of our censorship
board. This test case would bring to a head
the question whether or not a ban should be
imposed.
I take it for granted that if certain articles
in foreign newspapers are allowed to be distributed throughout the length and breadth of
Canada, those same articles should be allowed
to appear in our Canadian Press. It seems to
me there is nothing illogical in this view.
If, on the other hand, such articles should be
barred from our own Press, I submit that
logically the publications themselves in which
those articles first appear should be barred
from circulation in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

332

SENATE

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE-UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I would draw attention to the fact
that we have no business before us on the
Orders of the Day. I have made diligent
inquiry to ascertain when we may expect any
bills from the House of Commons, and I find
there will be nothing to submit to us either
to-morrow or Monday.
In these circumstances I am disposed to
move adjournment of the Senate until Tuesday evening, but before I do so I desire to
state that the most important piece of legislation which remains for consideration by both
Houses is the Unemployment Insurance Bill.
It is now before the House of Commons, and
the Prime Minister has stated that after second
reading it will be referred to a special committee. That special committee will organize
to-morrow and may take up the Bill on Saturday, if not on Friday. I am informed by the
chairman-to-be of that committee, the Minister in charge of the Bill, that an invitation
will go out to members of the Senate to attend
the committee's sittings and to participate in
the examination of witnesses and in the debate
on the various clauses.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
ings be printed?

Will the proceed-

Yes. I have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
asked that the proceedings of the committee
be printed and copies be distributed to members of the House of Commons and the Senate.
I have donc this because I have felt that,
without in the least prejudicing the jurisdiction
of this Chamber, we might take advantage of
the representations that may be made from
outside, and might thus dispense with their
repetition before this honourable body. That
is the only idea I had in mind. When the
Bill comes before the Senate it will be my
duty, if it passes the second reading, to propose that it be sent to our Committee on
Banking and Commerce to be examined and
to be subject to all the rights appertaining
to one of our standing committees. In informing the Senate of the hearings to be held by
the special committee of the House of Commons, my sole purpose is to have honourable
members of this House who remain here over
the week-end attend the Commons committee
and participate freely in the examination and
cross-examination of parties who may appear
before it.
There is one more thing as to which I desire
to inform the Senate. I said last week that the
Senate should have as much leeway in time
as the House of Commons for the examination
of this Bill. I felt that in claiming equality
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

I was getting a certain advantage. for in the
other House there are two hundred and fortyfive members, whereas we are ninety-six. This
does not mean, however, that if the House of
Commons takes a week or two to examine the
Bill the Senate may not take three or four
weeks, if it so desires. In view of the work
to be donc on that Bill, I am convinced that
we shall not prorogue before the 3rd of August,
and if the time at our disposal between now
and then does not suffice, we shall continue to
sit. I will deprive myself of the few days
that I might enjoy in the countryside. I believe
it is my duty to do this, and, besides, it is
far casier on us to deprive ourselves in this
way than to go into the trenches.
Now I should like to impress upon honourable members of the Senate the necessity of
their attending during the last days of the
session. Last year we were, shall I say, somewhat humiliated, by reason of the fact that
during the final days of the session, when
we had important legislation before us, but a
handful of members were present. We must
accept to the full the duty which devolves
upon us as senators and members of Parliament, particularly in war-time, when we
should be doubly ready to make all necessary
sacrifices.
With these remarks, I move that when the
Senate adjourns to-day it do stand adjourned
until Tuesday evening next.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, with what the leader of the
House says as to the urgent duty of honourable members on both sides to attend, particularly towards the end of the session, I am in
complete agreement. I cannot think of anything that reflects more sadly upon us than
an attenuated attendance at such a time, when
really the most important bills are here.
As to the remainder of what I have to
say, I want it understood that I am not
reflecting on the leader of the Government. I
have reason to believe that he as striven to
his utmost to avoid the condition of affairs
about which I am going to complain. But I
am going to make a complaint, and I wish
to register it most emphatically, against the
studied contempt to which this House has
been subjected during the tenure of office
of the present Administration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Since 1867.

Bight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. Perhaps
tie same condition existed before under another
Government; but that does not make it right,
nor does it relieve us of the duty of protesting.
This House can really be of but minor service to Canada unless the. equality of our funetions with those of the House of Commons

JULY 18, 1940
is recegnized in respect of ail legisiation, save
financial bis; and the recognition of such
equality invelves the introduction in this
House of Government measures which, in
their volume and in the onerousness of the
treatment they require at the hands of
Parliament and its committees, would equal
those measures jntroduced in the other House.
What have we witnessed since 1935? We
have had since then, 1 believe, seven sessions
ini ail. To two of themn, these remiarks wouid
flot appiy, because they produced virtualiy
no legisiation. During five important sessions
there have been introuced into this bouse
In 1936
only four Government measures.
there was one Bill, merely an amendment
te the Canadiani and British Insurance Cernpanies Act, 1932. In 1937 there was one, the
Transport Act. This was really an am;endment under a new name, but we shall cali
it an original bill. In 1939 there were two
Government measures, the first being merely
an amendment te the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacific Act, 1933, and the other the
Small Loans Act. The whole aggregate of
measures introduced in this
Government
bouse was four, and two of these were enly
amendments.
Now let us go over the past. 1 have traced
the history back to the time when I entered
this House in 1932. In that year six Government buis were introduced here, and those
bis were by far the most enercus, in point
of cemmittee treatmeînt, of ail the buis introduced in either bouse in that session. I
give their names. First there was the British
and Foreign Insurance Companies' Status and
Powers Bill. Honourable members who were
here at that time will recaîl the careful and
thorough-going treatment accorded that mealure on the part of ail honourable members of
the Sonate who were here, especially by the
Second, there
members of the committee.
was the Dominion Insurance Companies'
Status and Powers Bill, and, third, the Canadian and British Tnsurance Companies Bill.
These two were new bills. The fourth was
the Department cf Insurance Bill, which
reconstituted the department. Fifth was the
Foreign Insurance Companies Bill, and sixth,
the Winding-up Bill. Six bis in one session!
We were cf some value to the country. At
ail events, we had an epportunity te be of
value. We were busy forenoon and afterneen, and in my judgment. we discharged our
duties thoroughly and carefully, and, I arn
sure, te the satisfaction net oniy of the
business community, but of all who took an
interest in our proceedings.

Coming te the foiiowîng session, 1932-33,
what do we find? First we had the Canada

333

Shipping Bil-an immense measure. As a
matter of fact, as honourable gentlemen will
remember, our Comamittee on Banking and
Cemmerce censidered that bill threughout
twe sessions. Its pur-pose was te iay down
a shipping haw fer Canada for the first time.
Until then we had been under the British
law, but the tirne had arrived when we
should have one ef cur own. When, after
working a whoie session, we found we ceuld
net finish with the measure, we asked that
it stand over te the next session se that we
might finish our work. In that same session
we had the Canada Shipping Biii cf 1933,
which was rnerely an amendrnent. Then we
had the Canadian and British Insurance Cernpaýnies Bill, another bill cf an amendatory
character, but nevertheiess very important.
The next was the Canadian National-Canadian
Pacifie Diii, which was by far the mest
important legisiation of that session. Follewing that came the Senate and House cf
Commons Biii. There were five Government
bills that session, including twe which were
by far the mcst important considered by
Parliament.
In the next year, 19M4, we had the Admiraity
Biii. Then came the Canada Shipping Biii.
1 his was the second session in which we toek
up that measure. Then ther3 were the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Bill
and the Foreign Insurance Companies Bili,
both cf which were arnendatory measures, but
very important.
In 1935 we had, first cf ail, the Admiralty
Biii. Then we had the amendments te the
Criminal Code, which foilowed the Price
Spreads Investigation in the Commons. Then
there were the Juvenile Delinquents Bill and
the Patent Bill. If my mernory is correct,

the Patent Biii engaged

cur attention for

alrnost the entire session, and was a very
important piece cf wcrk. This was a tetal
cf four hbis in 1935, or a total of 19 in four
years.

I may be excused, I think, for saying that
this bouse then had an epportunity te de its
dutv. to carry its fair share of the burden cf
Parliament, to earn the cest cf the upkeep
cf the Senate, and to give fully cf its experience, which, in the sphere cf business, as in
aim.ost any ether sphere, is doubtiess superior,
man for man, to that cf the younger lieuse
of Commons.
Since that time we bave had two sessiens
with one bill each, and one with twe small
bis. This is simply a struggie-and I fear
it is succeeding-to make the Sonate nothing
but a ruhber stamp. Last Saturday we had
the humiliation cf an heneurable member cf

this House simply throwing up bis senator-

M4

SENATE

shiip for the rest of the session and going
home.
Now-I speak only for myself in this-I
tlhink that this habit of introducing bills which
ierely authorize the Government to do the
legislating is bringing both Houses of Parliament into contempt, and that the country is
steadily losing its respect for them. These
are the very conditions which preceded Fascism in more countries than one.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Right H'on. Mr. MEIGHEN: Without any
doubt, Parliament became a byword. And
while we are being made a rubber stamp,
the other House-if it is in order to say sois also being deprived of its fuections and
dignity, without which it cannot command
the confidence and respect of the Canadian
people. I do net take pleasure in emphasizing this, especially because J know it has
been the subject of protest by the honourable leader of this House. But we have to
do more than merely make formal protest
in Council, for there are those among us who
do net feel we can continue, even under
compulsion, being highly paid truants to our
trust.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire simply
to state that thotgh at three or four sessions
important bills were introduced here, some
five or six of them had to do with one thing,
insuirance. But I do not want to minimize in
the least the importance of the work we did.
J only wish to add that I think my right
honourable friend is quite unjust in speaking
disparagingly of the work of the other House.
He can express bis opinion of the work of
this House. He complains that bills are passed
herc-of course, after they have been passed
by the Commons-which have for their object
simply the authorizing of the Government
to take action. Well, he was a member of
the Government in 1914, when the War
Measures Act was passed, and he knows what
could have been and can be done with that
Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
sions.

Between ses-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If he will
examine into the legislation that bas comne
from the Commons this session he may find,
a s I iyself could find in the legislation
brought down by his Government from 1914
to 1917, many instances where authority is
given to the Covernor in Council. Thougli
I could perlaps cite several facts in justification, I will mention but one: we are at
w'ar.
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable members
of the Senate, I quite appreciate, and agree
with, some of the arguments and suggestions
made by my right honourable friend opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) in regard to the
business of this House, but I do not know
whebher his remarks were intended by way of
criticizing or defending the valedictory address
made here the other day by the honourable
member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae),
whio stated openly that he was leaving to go
abott his own business. Instead of attending to his inportant duties as a member
of the Senate, he went to look after his
own private interosts. I wonder how the
affairs of the country would ever be brought
to a successful conclusion if we all took tîat
attitude, this session or any other session.
1 felt it was unfortunate that my honourable friend made that statement, for it seems
to me that if one honourable member is
given the opportunity to go to look after
his own concerns, because the public business
is net coming forward to this Chamber as
rapidly as he thinks it should, then other
honourable members whose homes and offices
are far away cannot be expected in these
trying times to remain here, under expense
as they are, when the House is sitting only
two or three days a week.

JULY 23, 1940
LOBSTER CATCH, 1940
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. DUFF inquired of the Government:
1. Has the Government, through the Fisheries
Department, arranged for, or does it intend to
purchase the 1940 catch of canned lobster, up
to 55,000?
2. If so, what is the reason for such an
arrangement?
3. What price will be paid per case, and what
is the estimated total expenditure involved in
the transaction?
4. Will the said canned and cased lobsters be
purchased direct from the original producers,
the fishermen, or from the regular commercial
dealers or fish buyers?
5. After said purchases have been made, what
is the Department of Fisheries' intention regarding the sale or disposal of said lobsters?
6. Under what item in the Estimates is the
amount for the purchase of said lobsters
included, or how is it proposed to finance and
pay the amount required?
I have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer for the honourable gentleman.

an

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Pardon me. There is a
mistake in the first question. It should read
55,000 cases, or boxes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: All I can give
my honourable friend is the answer I have
received. To question No. 1 the answer is
yes.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Pardon me. I should like
to know whether the department intends to
'purchase 55,000 pounds or 55,000 cases. The
department should know. I am afraid my
honourable friend has been given a wrong
answer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will transmit
the answers to my honourable friend. If they
give the information he desires, I shall place
them on Hansard.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Do I understand from the Order just read that the Public

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
SENATORS INVITED TO ATTEND

I move the second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

INCOME WAR TAX BILL

REPORTED INCREASE IN MARRIAGES

FIRST READING

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called, may I be permitted to refer to something which occurred here on Thursday, July
18 last. My honourable friend the senator
from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté) mentioned
a newspaper item of a couple of days before.
I take it that the item in question was the
following:
Vital Statisties Revenue Tripled
Toronto, July 17. Acting Premier Nixon said
to-day the demand for birth and marriage
certificates had tripled in the last few months,
and it lias beenii necessary to engage 10 additional
employees for the Vital Statisties Branch.
Revenue of the branch had gone from $4,000
a month to $12,000, because of war-time requirements of records and enlistments, family allowances and registrations.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 102, an Act to amend the
Income War Tax Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As there is very
little on the Order Paper for to-morrow, I
would move that the Bill be taken up for
second reading then.
The motion was agreed to.
FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
COMNIONS DISAGREEMENT WITH SENATE
AMENDMENT

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, a message has been received from the
House of Commons as follows:
Resolved, that a message be sent to the
Senate to acquaint their Honours that this
House disagrees with their amendment to the
Bill No. 25, an Act to amend the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, for the
following reasons:
(1) Because the findings of a board of review
are based mainly on questions of fact determined after consideration of the farmer's cirdumustances and the present and prospective
capability of the farmer to perform the obligations prescribed by the board, and the
productive value of the farm.
(2) Because the boards of review in the
provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba as now constituted, comprising a Judge of
the Supreme Court of the province, as Chief
Commissioner, a Commissioner representing the
debtor, and a Commissioner representing the
creditor, are considered to be in a better
position, after listening to all evidence, to render
a final decision than an Appeal Court with
nothing but the record of a case before them.
(3) Because the Courts now have jurisdiction
to hear appeals in cases where errors of law
are alleged to have been made by a board of
review.
(4) Because it is inadvisable at this late
stage of the operation of this Act to provide
for appeals from proposals whieh may have
been or may be confirmed by boards of review.
(5) Because the provision for appeals would
increase the costs of the administration of the
Act and delay the final disposition of a farmer's
application.
Ordered, that the Clerk of the House do carry
the said message to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I move that this message be considered
to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to.

I was so interested in what the honourable
senator said that I at once wrote to Provincial
Secretary Nixon as follows:
The Honourable H. C. Nixon,
Provincial Secretary,
Toronto, Ontario.
Dear Mr. Nixon:
On Thursday last, in the Senate, the question
of the great number of marriages in Montreal,
Hull, etc., was being briefly referred to, and
the Honourable Louis Coté made the following
statement:
"The other day our Ottawa papers contained
an announcement that Ontario's revenue from
the issue of marriage certificates had risen from
$3,000 to $12,000, indicating a great increase
in marriages."
Would you please let me have, if possible,
for use on Tuesday evening, the correct information in respect to this statement, and
oblige-?
I received to-day a reply from the Honourable Provincial Secretary at Toronto, reading:
My dear Senator:
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter
of 20th instant referring to a statement made
by the Honourable Louis Coté last Thursday
in the Senate.
This statement was quite in error. The article
in the papers referred to the number of searches
being made for birth and marriage certificates,
largely in connection with the arrangements for
separation allowances for families of men enlisting for active service.
Yours sincerely,
H. C. Nixon.
It is curious, may I observe, how new words
creep into our language. Annandale's Concise
English Dictionary gives us the reason for
the definition of a certain word: in North
Carolina the member of Congress for a certain place having on one occasion admitted

REVIsED EDITION

SENATE
that he was talking, not for any useful end,
but simply to please his constituents in Buncombe.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I wonder if they know,
anything about graciousness in the state of
North Carolina.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to say
that I have read in the papers that on and
before the 15th of July there were a great
many weddings throughout the whole of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

That is right.

ANTI-BRITISH PROPAGANDA
On the Orders of the Day:
Honourable
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
senators, I wish to make a few observations
on the subject of anti-British propaganda,
which occupied the attention of the Senate
last Thursday afternoon. I wish particularly
to refer to the speech delivered on that
occasion by the riglit honourable gentleman
who leads the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
in which
he denounced
in
Meighen),
unmeasured terms of scorn and contempt an
article called "Wings of Atonement," which
appeared in a recent issue of the Saturday
Evening Post of Philadelphia. The right
honourable gentleman said that this article,
to use his own words, was "designed deliberately
to pour ridicule on the capacity, the sense of
duty and the manliness of the British people.
and to undermine the war spirit of this
country"; and be used this as the basis
of a demand that the Saturday Evening Post
be banned.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourable
senators, I rise to a point of order. An
honourable senator may rise on the Orders of
the Day for the purpose of calling attention
to any question which, in his opinion, is of
sufficient public interest to justify him in
making a statement, but he .cannot answer
a speech made on some other occasion, nor
attack the arguments made in that speech.
If the honourable gentleman wants to raise
a debate on this issue, I am only too ready
to meet him, but for honourable members to
rise alternately on the Orders of the Day to
answer one another is not proper. The proper
procedure for the honourable gentleman to
follow is to put a notice on the Order Paperand if he will do so, I assure him I am ready
for the fray.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Then why is there
any objection to proceeding this evening?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Because I
have some regard for the rules of the House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The situation is
this. The right honourable gentleman made
a statement based upon facts alleged in a
certain newspaper article, which, as he now
realizes, is the subject-matter of the impending discussion. If any honourable member
finds that he can controvert the facts upon
which a statement is based, is he not entitled
to do so?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly he
may do so, but the proper way of doing it
is to give notice that he will call the attention of the House to the matter. If that were
donc, I should have my material ready.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When the right
honourable gentleman made his statement he
did not give us a chance to have material
ready. As I said then, I was not awareRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was not
attacking the position of any honourable
member of this House. I was calling attention
to a matter of publie importance, and I made
my statement on it. If an honourable member desires to refute that statement he should
do so at a time when I am in a position to
defend myself.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am calling attention to a matter of public importance-a
statement made by the right honourable gentleman, in which he made a deliberate and savage
attack upon a publication published in a
friendly country. That, it seems to me, is a
matter of public importance, and one upon
which I am entitled to speak on the Orders
of the Day. I ask your ruling, Mr. Speaker.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
will continue.

The debate

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, the principle involved here is one
which has received consideration more than
once. During the ten years that I have been
a member of this House there has been considerable leniency in permitting honourable
members to place matters before the Senate.
I am quite aware of the rules governing debate,
and I am prepared to enforce them, if necessary; but in view of the practice which has
prevailed in the past, it seems to me we should
not seek to enforce the rules too strictly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) were to bring the matter up to-morrow,
I should be prepared and have the article
here.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable senators-Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is my honourable friend discussing something else?

JULY 23, 1940
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The whole thing is
out of order. Last week I tried to make a
statement when the Orders of the Day were
called, and the Speaker ruled I was out of
order because on that occasion there was no
business under the Orders of the Day. Well,
on this occasion there is no business under the
Orders of the Day, and I humbly submit
that in view of the ruling made last week we
cannot have a directly opposite ruling made
now.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Honourable senators,
I often was placed in the same position as
His Honour the Speaker is in to-night and
has been in before. It seems there is a usage
in ýthis House that the Senate can disregard its
own rules so long as no senator objects.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear. That is
the whole point.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I followed that usage
as often as possible and would interfere only
if a senator objected and asked that the rules
be observed. I have complained once or twice
that the Speaker is often placed in a difficult
position because on some occasions the Senate
is pleased to allow certain matters to be
discussed out of order, and later a senator
is refused permission to discuss something and
complains that the rules should not be applied
to him if not to all honourable members. To
my mind it comes to this: anything can be
done with the permission of the Senate, but
if any senator insists, the rules must be strictly
observed.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that if we agree to the procedure that is proposed now, there will be
no end at all to it. A general debate on any
subject could be initiated without notice, and
every honourable member could join in it.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is what happened last Thursday.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There would be no
end to it. I have been in this House for some
twenty years, and I think the way the rule has
been applied is that a debate may go on
without notice, provided no senator objects,
but once there is any objection the rule must
prevail.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, so as to place myself in order, I give
notice that at the next sitting of -the House
I shall draw attention te the speech delivered
last Thursday afternoon by the right honourable leader on the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) on the subject of anti-British
propaganda.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Will the honourable senator be kind enough to put his notice
in writing?

CHEESE AND CHEESE FACTORY
IMPROVEMENT BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 89, an Act to amend the
Cheese and Cheese Factory Improvement Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, I have just had a word with the Law
Clerk, and we have one or two matters to
straighten out with regard to some of the
phrases in this Bill. I would move that second
reading be put down for to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to.
NATIONAL WAR SERVICES-REGISTRATION AND MOBILIZATION
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, a
few days ago I asked the honourable leader
of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) some
questions regarding the ages at which men
will be called up and the procedure that will
be followedi under the Mobilization Act, and
the honourable gentleman assured me that
before Parliament prorogued he would be
able to place the rules and regulations before
us. This afternoon I heard the same questions
asked in another place, and the Prime Minister
stated that he would be able to give the
information to that House in a day or two.
I am wondering whether I may expect the
same information to be given here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should take
it for granted that *my honourable friend
would be satisfied with the Prime Minister's
statement.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; I want it from you.
I have great confidence in you.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot go
further than i did before, when I said I hoped
to be able to give the required information
or bring down the rules and regulations before
Parliament prorogued. Since we had that
discussion I have busied myself about the
matter in an endeavour to get the regulations
as soon as possible, and I am glad to hear of
the declaration made by the Prime Minister
in the other Hous'.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I read in the Press to-day
a statement to the effect that complete classification of returns under the forthcoming
registration will take six months and require

340

SENATE

a regular staff of 1,200, and that for the
purpose a temporary building is toe erected
I do net know that
at a cost of $110,000.
these details are correct, and I am net asking
for any definite statement on that point; but
I do want ta say a word about the registration,
in the hope that it will in some way be
simplified and its portentous dimensions
contracted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend allow me? His preliminary
remarks apparently bear on something else
than the suggestion he intends to make as
to registration, for he spcaks of what may
follow the registration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, cortainly.
It is all one subject.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
anything about the first part of his statement,
nor upon whose dictum it was made.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do net
know, either. I am simply stating what I
read in the Ottawa morning papers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
doces it emanate?

But from whom

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may net
be correct, but I should think it was, because
it does net appear ta me to be an exaggeration.
I am pleading that a serious attempt be made
to contract the scope of this registration. The
questionnaire which is being submitted contains, I understand, eighteen headings, and
under each heading the subdivisions are considerable. I went through them to-day and
I should say that each questionnaire would
require a minimum of fifty answers. In the
subdivisions there is room for all sorts of
answers, depending upon the persons making
then. 'I should think it quite possible and
even likely that in many cases the answers
will exceed fifty in number, and, frn, my
experience of correspondents, I should expect
that some of the answers would net be brief.
I have no official statistices as to the number
of persons who will be required to register
under the present regulation-that is, all those
of sixteen years and upwards-but I should
give it as my best estimate that about twothirds of our population are within that age
group. Assuming such to be the case and
that eight million persons will be registering
and making an average of fifty answers, there
xwill be 400 million answers. All these will
have to be classified. The human mind can
hardly comprehend the immensity of that
task in mere tediuim and tine. If 1,200
employees are to complete it in six months,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

J should not think they would be idle, by
any means. And the minimum cost, it seems
to me, would be $12,000.000.
I have not opposed the registration at any
time. On two occasions I did rise here to
intim'ate that I had not very great faith
in the value of the thing. I know there were
quite a number of demands in the country
for it, particularly from newspapers, but I
cannot sec how a scheme involving the classification of 400 million answers could be of
any value. If after all the answers were
classified you could cet officially on them, the
v-alue would be apparent; but clearly it
would not be possible to take action on the
basis of these answers alone. Ex-en if you
assumed every answer to be bona fide and
true at the time it was made-and of course
it would be absolutely impossible and absurd
ta assume that-vou would not be able to
say that any particular answe;r was truc
six months afterwards, because circumstances
might have changed in the meantime. So
when the time came to take action you could
net act on the answers alone. Besides, you
could not assume at all that the answers were
truc when made. Even if you took them as
intended ta be true by the persons registering, that would net mean they were true.
For example, a man is asked what else he can
do besides what he is now engaged at. Well,
I can imagine letters of several pages being
written in re-ply to that question. Would it
be suggested that because a man imagines he
can do some other kind of work he should
be moved froin his present job? You could
net safely act on any answer, even at the
time it is given; mucli less could you act on
it six months afterwards.
If the call is to be for military service, of
course the judgment of an independent judge
or tribunal has te be brought to bear on the
individual case. The Government, I know,
bas not the slightest intention of anything
else. But if that has to be donc anyway,
what is the value of this registration? After
you have all the information compiled, yon
know the number of persons between certain
ages, whether they are married, and a hundred other particulars which are net of much
value. You can get the information now from
the statisties of the last census, for the proportion is pretty much the same to-day-at
any rate it is near enough for your purpose.
If yen think yeu can use this questionnaire
for calling up your men, you are mistaken.
Further, I do net see how you could use it
for the assignment of men to other work. If
it can be done. I should like to know how.
I have tried to put myself in the position
of the Minister, and for the life of me I

JULY 23, 1940
cannot see *howyou can use the questionnaire
to assign a man to a single task unless, as
well, independent judgment is applied to his

case.

Because a labourer thinks he ought ta

be writing editorials, you cannot say you will
transfer him to a position as editor. You

cannot call anybody to any task on the basis
of his reply to these questions; you have ta
apply independent judgment of someone on
the ground who hears the evidence.
So, no matter what the purpose may be,
I really cannot see that we are going ta get
much out of this registration. We are in it
now, and I beg the Government to consider
simplifying the questionnaire. I have not the
British form before me, but I believe there
was one. I know we had one during the last
war. It was infinitely simpler than this questionnaire, but, even at that, I stand here and
say I do not think it was worth the trouble
we went ta.
Has the right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman seen the questionnaire?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have seen
only a copy in the Press. It is cumbersome
ta an incredible degree. True, the questionnaire can be answered, but it makes the
classification sa portentous and ponderous
that it is frightful ta contemplate what it
will be. The very immensity of the whole
thing would make it valueless. As I have
said, each case will have to be dealt with by
independent judgment of someone on the
ground. Knowing that this will have to be
donc, I should like to see the six months
eliminated. If you need it, get some information of the exact number of men between
certain ages and whether married or not.
That is all the information I can think of
which is really of any value. Get that information quickly. As I sec it now, we are going
to waste precious money and still more
precious time and get no commensurate
results.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I think there is in the House of
Commons a tradition that when a member
desires ta draw attention ta certain matters he
must give notice of his intention to the
Minister concerned. It seems to me that in
this Chamber, where there is but one Minister,
and he without portfolio, notice of such intention should be given at least twenty-four
hours in advance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is very
fair. The honourable leader is now informed
of the matter and can take all the time he
wants to give me an answer.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say that
because often the newspapers seize upon a
question as if it were a positive statementI am not referring to this particular question,
I am speaking generally-but the answer
containing the facts may not be published
until a day or two afterwards.
All I know about this matter is that we
have enacted legislation which lays upon the
Government the responsibility of conducting
a national survey. If my memory does not
fail me, a committee, presided over by Dr.
Coats, the Dominion Statistician, has been
diligently engaged on the questionnaire. I
heard that it contained a number of questions,
and at once I suggested to my colleague who
is in charge of the matter that, as probably
it would take each registrant an hour or two
to furnish answers, the questionnaire should be
distributed in order that it might be studied
at leisure and completed and then delivered
personally to the registrar. I was led to
believe that my suggestion would be adopted,
but I notice in the Press to-day that someone
connected with the registration work has stated
that the questionnaire must be answered in
the presence of the officials who will carry
out the registration. That statement, I may
add, did not come from the Minister himself.
I will get a copy of the questionnaire and
ascertain the actual position of affairs.
Undoubtedly the committee will make every
effort to get as much information as possible
from the questionnaire. I am inclined to

think that information as to age and qualifications of men to be called up for training,
which information is essential for the purposes
of the National Defence Department, will be
readily available from the inquiry. However,
I will transmit my right honourable friend's
remarks to my colleagues, and I hope to be
able to furnish a satisfactory answer to the
suggestion which he has just made.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
I have always been under the impression that
the members of this House have two very
clear duties to perform. One is to veto whatever legislation may be considered detrimental
to the national interest. The other is to offer
constructive suggestions. I think that is a
fair statement of our responsibilities.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: In discharge of the
second duty, I wish to offer a suggestion for
whatever it may be worth. I think the last
census was taken in 1930.
Hon. Mr. EULER: In 1931.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I would suggest that
the Government anticipate by one year the
taking of the next census and modify it to
meet present needs. This would permit one
staff to combine the two operations of national
registration and census, and make the
combination fit present requirements.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I repeat
to my honourable friend that a decennial
census contains so much information that the
statistical office requires three or four years
to tabulate it. His suggestion would save
considerable expenditure, but I doubt whether
it would be feasible.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

contempt an article which appeared in a recent
edition of the Saturday Evening Post of
Philadelphia. I quote his words about it as
they are reported on page 331 of our Hansard
for July 18:
An article has just appeared in the sheet
that I named first, under the heading, "Wings
of Atonement," designed deliberately to pour
ridicule on the capacity, the sense of duty and
the manliness of the British people, and to
undermine the war spirit of this country.
The right honourable gentleman made his
attack the basis for a demand that the Saturday Evening Post be banned from this country.
Now, honourable senators, I am net a reader
of or a subscriber to the Saturday Evening
Post. I sec it only oc.casionally, if I happen to
pick it up in the course of a railway journey,
for instance. But in view of the very strong
statement made by the right honourable gentleman about this so-called article, I felt it my
duty to buy the copy of the Post in which
it appeared, so as to be able to ferm an
independent judgment upon the matter. Well,
bere it is. Here is the issue of the Saturday
Evening Post of July 13, 1940, and beginning
on page 16 of that issue is the offending
story, headed "Wings of Atonement." I
naturally assume that my right honourable
friend bas read that story very carefully. I
bave read it very carefully, three or four times,
and J can only say that I am amazed at the
importance wh ich he appears to attach te it,
and that I can find little, if any, justification
for the bitter attack of which lie lias made
it the object.
To begin with, lie is quite wrong in
describing "Wings of Atonement" as an
article. It is net an article at all, in the
ordinarily accepted sense of that term. It
is a story. It is fiction. And anyone who
reads it would know at once that it is an
imaginary story. The author bas assumed al]
the privileges which a writer of fiction does
assume, even though be is dealing with
present-day conditions in Great Britain. He
paints about the blackest picture he can of
conditions in Great Britain, entirely imaginary
conditions, conditions which, if his story were
supposed to be truc, would be very wounding,
as I frankly admit. He refers, for instance,
te England as being "close te defeat, insufficiently prepared te defend itself....bombed
and blasted and shaken, like a fat old
champion of the ring who bas forgotten how
to train and fieds himself smashed, bleeding
and reeling from the first punch delivered by
a hungry young opponent."
Well, the author bas every right, seeing
that this is a fiction story, to make any
assumption that he likes, te paint the picture as
black as he can, for the purposes of his

JULY 24, 1940
story, Vo add to its pathos. H1e makes one
.assurnption, for instance. Hie assumes that
the German Air Force bas obtained a far
greater mastery over the air of England than
it has ever yet obtained, or than, thank God,
it ever will obtain.
In stories of fiction about the war, that sort
.of exaggeration is not at ail uncommon. Sorne
honeurable senators probably have seen the
recent moving picture called "An Englishrnan's
Home." That is an English picture prepared,
as 1 arn given Vo understand, at the instigation
ýor witli the 'help of the British authorities.
Honourable senators who have seen it will
recaîl that it paints, for the purpose of the
.story and for that purpose alone, a most
exaggerated picture of the power of the
'German Air Force over Great Britaîn.
Now, wbat is this story, "Wings of AtoneIt is the story of a middle-aged

class from wbicb, if bonourable members will
allow a personal reference, I arn myseif sprung.
His namne is Sir Hubert Wyndmondham. H1e
is a baronet living on bis ancestral estate in
the eastern counties, and is member of Parliament for bis division. In the last war bie
served with great distinction in the Royal
Air Force, gained tbe DS.O., and became an
air ace. H1e still keeps in a corner of bis
stables tbe old airoplane in wbicb bie won
bhis victories twenty-two years ago. H1e is a
widower wbo bad one son. Tbat son, following in bis father's footsteps, joined the Royal
Air Force and bas recently 'been killed,' figlitïng witb great gallantry against trernendous
,odds in Norway.
In bis political career Sir Hubert Wyndmondbam was, no doulit, a follower of Mr.
Neville Chamberlain. Hie believed in appeasement. H1e refused for many years Vo believe
in the Nazi menace, and be supported a
Government in Great Britain wbich, as is now
-universally admitted, made insufficient preparations to meet tbe Nazi menace in the air.

and realizing that in the lack of prîparatien

That, honourable senaters, is the stery in a
few words. As -te its menit as a story, opinions
may differ, and I offer none; but I do direct
the attention of the flouse Vo the fact that
this story in anme respects beans a most
striking analogy te something wbicb actually
did bappen enly a very short time ago. I
wonder if honourable senaters know the stery
of Sir Arnold Wilson. Sir Arnold Wilson, after
a distinguisbed career in the East, returned te
England, and was elected member of Parqiament for tbe Hitebin Division of Hertfordsbire, about ten years age. fie was in some
respects what one miglit caîl an extreme
reactienary. Hie openly believed in Fascism.
fie was a friend of Hitler, witb wbom lie went
to stay on at least one occasion. fie was an
ardent supporter of Nazi-ism, and even advocated an alliance betweîn Great Britain and
Nazi Germany. Wben the present war broke
eut, Sir Arnold Wilson realized bow fundamcntally wrong lie bad hein. Tbough over
age-be was fifty-five yuans old-he insisted
upon .ioining up in the Royal Air Force and
training for a post of great danger, 'that of
gunner in a bombing plane. fie served as a
gunnen in a bombing plane for many montbs,
and every new and again, in intervals between
raids, bie came back and took bis place in the
flouse of Commons at Westminster. A few
weeks ago lie was reported as missing, and I
think tbîne can hi ne deulit, unfortunately,
that bie lias now been killed.
Lut me ruad te the flouse what bis fellow
member of the British flouse of Gemmons,
Mr. Beverley Baxter, says about Sir Arnold
Wilson in bis London letter, appearing in
Maclean's magazine of July 1:
For more than twunty years 1 have enjoyed
the friendship of Sir Arnold Wilson, fermer
fligli Commissiener in Mesopotamia, a colluague
in the flouse ef Commons and an aerial gunner
in the lait war. For a long time lie buliived
in Hitler and worked opînly for friendship
with Germany. Whien this war came lie was
fifty-fivî years of age, and ene day lie took me
aside in the House ef Commons. "I was wnong,"
lie said, "and bicausi of my pro-Hitlîrism I
may have played some part. liowîver small, in
lielping tlie Nazis. There is only one thing
I cao do. 1 shaîl nejein the Air Force as a
gunnur, and I shail do what 1 cao te make
restitution."

SENATE
I repent, the ceai. actuai case *of Sir Arnold
W'ilson bears soose striking analogies to the
hypothoticai case of Sir flubert Wyndmcndbain in this stors-. As tho flouse wili have
heard, Sir Arnold Wiison. in spoaking to Mr.
Beverley Baxter, made uise of the word
'riestitution." In tlîis story the word used is
"atonement." But thoy mean the saine thing.
Both Sir Arnold Wilson, in ceai life. and Sic
Hiubert Wyndmondham, in this story, feit
that tiîey would have to mokoe restitution, by
sorving again in tho air, for tise wcong thoy

his constituents: the butcher, the chemist, the
local bank manager, and so forth. What the
story does criticize is the leadership given to
the British people by men of the type of Sir
Hubert Wyndmondham. And as to manliness,
there is no single word in the whole story
which can be said to reflect upon the manliness of the British people. On the contrary,
the chief character of the story, as honourable
senators know, was a man of great valour, an
air ace, and so was his son..
Now I come to the most surprising part of
the right honourable gentleman's denunciation. He says that this article, as he wrongly
describes it, is designed deliberately to undermine the war spirit of this country. Let us
ponder over that statement for a moment.
Here is a story, published in the Saturday
Evening Post, a popular journal with a circulation of many millions in the United States
and probably several thousands in Canada.
Does anybody seriously believe that when
the author of this story sat down to write it
he rubbed his hands and said, "Now I am
going to undermine Canada's war effort"?
Of course not. Very likely the author got the
germ of his idea from the true story of Sir
Arnold Wilson, which I have retailed to the
House. I venture to suggest that the thought
of Canada and Canada's war effort never
entered his mind. And, in point of fact, this
country is never once mentioned in the story,
from beginning to end.
I venture further to suggest that if the
author had any basic idea in the back of his
mind when writing this story, it was the idea
of warning his own people in the United States
of the danger of military unpreparedness.
But let us suppose that by some miracle my
right honourable friend's accusation is right
and that this story was written for the -purpose
of undermining Canada's war effort. Has it
I should say, most
achieved that object?
emphatically, no. So far as I am concerned,
this story could be read without harm by
every man, woman and child in this country.
I should think that instead of undermining
the war spirit of the country it would have
precisely the opposite effect. It points the
moral of the deadly danger of unpreparedness
and the supreme need of being properly
equipped for defence in the air. Anybody
reading this story, if he did not already have
that idea in his mind, would immediately come
to the determination that henceforth the Air
Force of this Empire must be supreme.
To sum up, when my right honourable friend
says that this story was deliberately designed
to undermine the war spirit of this country,
he is saying something which I think is totally
incapable of proof, and the balance of probabilities is overwhelmingly against his state-

ment being correct. As I have already said, there
are parts of the story which make painful
reading, sad reading, for us of the British
Empire. But my right honourable friend is
making a great mistake if he thinks that the
people of Canada are unable to hear unpleasant
truths and to profit frorm the errors of the
past. No, honourable senators. It is the
people of the dictator-ridden countries to
whom the truth cannot be told.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: To us of British
stock, knowledge of the past is but an
incentive. a challenge to do better in the
future. And that challenge, thank God, we
are taking up in this day and hour.
So, honourable senators, I come back to
the point from which I started, and say that
I am utterly amazed that my right honourable
friend should have made such a commotion
about this story, "Wings of Atonement," and,
in view of the great position which he occupies
in this House and in this country, I am grieved
that he should have made this story the basis
of what I consider to be a totally unmerited
attack upon the journal in which the story
appears. As I have said, I am not a reader
of the Saturday Evening Post. Therefore I
am not in a position to judge whether previous attacks which he has made upon that
journal in this House are justified or not. But
I will say this. I do venture to suggest to
him that as a public man, conscious of his

great responsibilities, before indulging in
bitter attacks upon great organs of public
opinion published in the friendly country to
the south of us, he should make certain-yes,
he should make doubly and trebly certainthat his attacks are fully justified. And I
repeat with all the force that I can call to
my command that in this instance such justification has been absolutely and conspicuously
lacking.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators as becomes all humble men
chastened through long years of public life, I
am grateful to the young and ambitious for
reading me lessons in ethies and behaviour
and showing me, even though it be late in life,
the path where only righteous men may tread.
I was puzzled yesterday when the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Hr. Hugessen)
rose to deliver a philippie against me. He got
far enough to make clear that was his object.
I thought I had in a very modest way, certainly in no spectacular way, done what was
a small service. I had attacked no one in
Parliament or in Canada, but only the Saturday Evening Post, and I had urged the Government, because particularly of this article or

JULY 24, 1940
is attributed to him is attributed to Britain,
and the scorn poured on him is sborn poured
on Britain by an American journalist.
Now, keeping that in mind, let me do a
little reading. The author indicates his intent
very early. Wyndmondham is pictured flying
a crock plane over English soil.
That earth, Sir Hubert knew, he woild never
walk again. Was he flying to escape his bitter
failure or to atone before he died?
In the next column Gallico tells about all
that Britain had when the war came on. Put
in the words of Sir Hubert, the "all" was as
follows:
These-fthe gune. the drums and the tiny
plane-weoe Sir Hubert's salvage from the old
World War, the war to end all wars, the war
forever and for the last time to secure the
British Empire.
To these, final]y, le liad matie his last retreat.
For of the beliefs, the philosophies, the doigmas,
tlie views and tenets and, above all, the illusions
of Sir Hubert Wyndmondham, Bart,, M.P.,
D.S.O., there remained not so much as a shred
or vestige beyond his inborn and romanticized
belief in the character of an English baronet
and gentleman.
This, Gallico says, is all that is left of
England. The next paragraph is the scurrilous
diatribe already quoted by and read fromn the
Kingston W.hig-Standard. I need not quote
it again. Then Gallico says:
In the morning sky lie climbed bis old ship
to expiate the sins of greed and dullness and
stupidity in the pattern of the old chivalry and
tradition that were his by inheritance.

And will honourable members listen to this?
For Austria and Czechoslovakia and Poland
were long-past history.
The innuendo anyone after three in the
morning will sec. Their conquest was Britain's
facult. But take the next sentence:
Norway was a page of shame.
"Norway was a page of shame"! Such is the
utterance of the Saturday Evening Post,
championed now by the honourable senator
Where was the "page of
from Inkerman.
shame" for Britain in Norway? Britain was
under no obligation to protect Norway, under
no treaty, under no duty, express or implied;
she was not one whit more under any obligation than was the country from which Mr.
Gallico comes. Where then is the "shame"
of Britain? Britain at least tried. "Norway
was a page of shame." A page of shame.
was it?
Because the security of Norway
was important to the security of Britain,
it might have been the part of wisdom,
were the capacity immediately present, to
save Norway; but I cannot refrain from
saying this, that the security or integrity of
Norway was not in fractional part as important to the security of Britain as to-day is
95832-23J

347

the security of Britain to the integrity and
permanence of the United States. From that
truth comes a lesson that American critics
should take home.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: "Norway wa%
a page of shame.
Again the whole spirit,
the current, the teaching in every paragraph
and every line, is a strain of contempt and
to the last degreeridicule-defeatism
defeatisin driven home by contempt. But
this typical Englishman, Wyndmondham, had
a vision:
He had vision, now that it was too late and
the scales had been torn from his eyes. He
looked past themThat is, some five tall chimneys which Gallico
spoke of before, reaching up like the fingers
of a hand.
He looked past them down through the slate
roof into the rooms and halls, the chests and
chairs and tables of heavy oak, the dark old
hangings, the polished suits of armour and the
burnisheed silver plate. He saw down into and
through them, these possessions that had possessed hlm, each thing a gift from the glorious
past. They had obsessed him with their ageless solidity as victors over time and antiquity,
to dull bis wits to the endless pitfalls of the
future.
Then Gallico comes to the aeroplane itself,
the old Bristol. He describes it in the language of humorous ridicule, and he adds this
fine touch at the end:
on the cockpit headrest where lie had been
nicked, and the insignia of the squadron, a
cocktail glass in a circle, boldly painted on
the fuselage.
This is lovely! And it is all right, says the
senator froin Inkerman, because it is "fiction."
The insignia of the British Air Force in France
in the last war, fromn which this plane is a
relie, is described by this writer as "a cocktail
glass in a circle." He omitted to tell us what
was the insignia of the Air Force of his own
land in the last war in France. While he was
in a humorous vein it was an excellent time
for him to disclose to us what that insignia
was.

His son-the fictitious son-was killed in
Norway, and Sir Hubertas he climbed to carry out bis
-wondered,
act of immolation, whether RichardThis is the son.
--was watching him and approving, and whether
he would understand that his father was trying,
in the only way he knew, to make good for
the damage that had been done. He wanted
to raise bis helmeted and goggled head, look
up at the lead-coloured ceiling and say, "I'm
coming, Dickie!"

JULY 24, 1940
Talk about the United States being a
friendly nation if you will; there are none
over there, above the submerged tenth, who
will for a moment complain if this Dominion,
in the hour of her trouble and her blackest
struggle, looks after herself and the morale
of her own people. What do they care whether
we shut out the Post or not? None of them
do that are worth talking about. The more
we look after the fundamental, basic necessities of this nation in its sore trial, the more
they will respect us.
Yes, those were the words of Mr. Gallico,
who added this last beautiful touch:
This was the England of his makingThe making of the Sir Huberts.
-and England was lie, a Don Quixote of the
sky, tilting at the irrevocable windmills of
future history with weapons as ancient and
useless as his class.

He ends by telling us that the Englishman
"sold" his son!
What did I say about this article on Thursday? I said that as literature circulated in
Canada it was poisonous. Can any honourable gentleman listen to one of the quotations
I have read and say it is not poisonous?
Does any man rise from a perusal of this
story with a confident and manly resolution to
fight this war through? There will be many
who will; but not the weaklings and the middlings, whose spirits must be stirred and
strengthened and not poisoned when war is
on. I said that this article poured ridicule
upon the capacity, the sense of duty and the
manliness of the British people. That it pours
ridicule in bucketfuls upon the capacity of
the British nobody able to whisper will dispute; that it pours ridicule upon their sense
of duty, their manliness, is so plain that he
who runs may read. "Norway was a page of
shame." Is no sense of duty there impugned?
"Criminal! Traitor! Breaker of faith! Murderer of liberty!" Is that no slur on the manliness of the British nation and the British
people? And all these things are said at this
hour when, more than ever in our lives, we
look for something better. We look for something in the nature of the words spoken by
the real people of that great country to the
south, by vast millions of them, by all who
really think-words which proclaim that on
the faith, the courage, the resolution, the
tenacity, the resourcefulness of Britain, the
whole structure of civilization rests at this
hour. And this is the Britain which these
gossipers ridicule, whose honour they impugn,
and on whose character and mission they
cast their slimy slurs.
I read the language of the New York Times
this morning:

349

Words falter to describe British fortitude....
This unparalleled spectacle of the nation rising,
as by a single impulse, to defend "this blessed
plot, this earth, this realm, this England."
Words falter. There are no phrases for the
obscene ambition that attacks,This is the very conduct which Gallico
delineates as a symptom of manliness and
activity.
-for the magnificent mobilization of a people
that defends. unshaken and unafraid. We can
only pray that soon the time will come when
the vultures no longer defile the British skies
and the cry goes out from John O'Groats to
Land's End: "Twelve o'clock and all's well!"
That is the language of thinking, manly
Americans. That is the language of their great
President. Did he call shame on Britain
because of what happened in Norway? "Ah,"
ha said, "if the gods of force prevail over there,
this America of ours will be a prisoner on this
planet, handcuffed, hungry, and fed through
the bars by the pitiless masters of other continents."
One cannot take his seat at this moment
without paying tribute to another great
American, Dorothy ThompsonSome Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -who, three
or four nights ago, directed a message to the
people of Canada, and apostrophized the Old
Land in its magnificent struggle for human
liberty-a message of such dignity, power and
beauty that it will ring down through these
thunderous years and long after the little
Gallicos are forever forgotten.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I can only say that I have been
most interested in the two statements that
we have heard: one most direct and clear in
dialectics, the other one strong in eloquence.
My present duty is to answer the question
put to me by the right honourable gentleman
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) as to
the reason why the Saturday Evening Post
has ,not been banned from Canada. In accordance with the custom of sending questions to
the department concerned, for answers, this
matter was referred to the Press Censors,
from whom I now have the following statement:
In response to your request for a statement
about the policy of the Press Censors concerning
the Saturday Evening Post, and in particular
a short story, "Wings of Atonement," by Paul
Gallico, which appeared in the issue of July 13,
1940, we beg to submit the following:

member of our staff in an advance copy of
the Saturday Evening Post. The Censor reading it considered it objectionable in nature..

is the best answer to occasional defeatist
articles in American magazines.
(5) On June 29, 1940, the Montreal Gazette,
under the heading "Censorship-A Dangerous
Weapon," argues strongly against Senator
Meighen's proposal to ban the Saturday Evening
Post and other United Sta.tes publications. It
began by accepting "Senator Meighen's motive"
as "obvious and laudable" and "a natural
impulse" being "to refuse admittance te the
offenders, and think no more about it". The
editorial continued: "However, there is more at
stake here than any Canadian's opinion of an
American publication; the question must be
considered realistically, and ansvered in the
light of Canada's best interests and nothing
else." The editorial continues:
"First, it is unlikely that these papers have
done any serious harm within the Dominion.
True, they have caused much anger-but the
greater the resentment, the smaller the damage
wrought by their allegedly anti-Allied material.
Canadians themselves are net very susceptible
to anti-British or defeatist propaganda; there
may be an audience for that sort of thing in the
U.S., but a ban by Ottawa would be more
likely te increase than to diminish it.
"On the other hand, it is well that Canadians
know who are their friend's and who their
enemies, and have oppor.tunity te gauge the
strengtlh of each in the United States. At the
present time Canada is relying heavily on the
conviction thaf the power to the south of us is
a strong friend, one which is helping us now
and nay help us still more in the future.
Every Canadian hopes this conviction may
remain well-founded, but wishful thinking is of
no use to anyone. There bas been enougli
wishful thinking in this war already.
If
extreme isolationism, even pro-Germanism, appears te have the backing of large and responsible United States papers, we should know it.
"Most important of all, however, is the
reaction that a ban by Ottawa might cause in
the United States. The goodwill of that
country is among the most precious assets we
have at the moment; anything that might
jeopardize it should be well considered, and
acted upon only if it is certain the benefits will

outweigh the disadvantages.
blames Canada for banning propaganda sheets,
many of them subsidized by foreign agencies,
which are known to use any device of falsehood
or sedition to ýadvance their aims. It is quite
another thing to ban journale of national
reputation, whieh have always enjoyied the
prestige of independent views and which wield
influence over large groups of American readers.

351

Exclusion of such papers would bc viewed as a
just grievance by many Americans who do net
agree with the isolationist or anti-Allied
position, and would presumably have weight
with many more who might be undecided.
"As a final consideration, we should remember
that it is easy to se disagreement as sedition.
Whatever the merits or demerits of the present
case, a free press is one of the liberties we are
fighting for; any restriction thereon should be
imposed for sound reason and with due consciousness that the need is serious and the
action exceptional."
Yours sincerely,

like to put on Hansard a return which was
tabled in the House of Commons in response
to the following questions asked by Mr.
Church on June 28 last:
1. What action bas been taken by the
Government since the session opened to prevent
the use of the mails and circulation of certain
American and other publications containing
subversive articles in war time?
2. Will the use of the mails be denied to the
"Chicago Tribune" and "Saturday Evening
Post" and other weekly publications for continued articles detrimental to the cause of
Britain and Canada and the prosecution of the
war, and to prevent their circulation in
Canada?
The answer is contained in this return,
which I desire to place upon Hansard, so that
when we continue this discussion we may have
it before us:
June 28, 1940.
Memorandum
1. Since shortly after the outbreak of war
last September, a:Il incoming publications from
American and other sources have been subjected
to careful examination by the Postal Censorship and the Examiner of Publications, under
the direction of the Press Censors for Canada.
All publications containing subversive material
have been drawn -to the attention of the Press
Censors, and steps have been taken to exclude
aIl of those publications which appeared to
contravene the Defence of Canada Regulations.
Publications in all leading European languages
have been examined in this search for subversive material. Altogether, since the beginning of the war about 180 periodicals and a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not wish
to debate the matter now, for the leader of
the House has been quite fair, but the communication which he read from the censorship

board gives further advertisement and favourable notice to this paper. I do not want to
be positive, but, speaking from memory, I
am pretty certain that it was banned during
the last war. It had to be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, I do
not know.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As a result
the heavens did not fall. Against these
eulogies of the paper let me say that at this
time of danger the whole tenor of its articles
is debilitating and debasing, as a source of
intelligence it is worthless, on the score of
information it is deceitful, and as literature
it is frothy and befouled.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should not
care to pass judgment generally on the
publications of the United States. It is too
wide a field for me to enter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am just
speaking of this paper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I very seldom
read their publications. I confine myself
chiefly to the New York Times, to which I
have given anore attention than to any other
American paper.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is worth it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
how much longer we shall be in session, but
we may have an hour or two of leisure, when
I shall be quite happy to discuss this matter
further.

applicable to persons other than corporations
and joint stock companies. If anyone wants
a comparison, I shall have te call the representative of the National Revenue Department
to state the former duties. I suppose, however,

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, as this is a very important
Bill, I think the third reading should be
deferred. While we have no important jurisdiction in connection with tax bills, I do
not think we should unduly rush them through.
I am worried about the board of referees. It
looks to me as though the board of referees
were going to have about as much to do as
the Government itself. It comes under the
Income War Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; the Excess
Profits Act. I thought that when it came my
right honourable .friend would need some
explanations about that board.

War Tax Act is just the price we are paying
for the Montreal terminals, I understand.

FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
SENATE

INSISTS

ON

ITS AMENDMENT

The Senate proceeded to consider a message
from the House of Commons with respect to
an amendment made by the Senate to Bill
25, an Act to amend the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, 1934.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I an not sure if the Commons' reasons
for rejecting our amendment to the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Bill were read last
night by His Honour the Speaker or by
myself.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Yes, they were.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Unless honourable members desire that I read these reasons
again, I will move forthwith that the Senate
do not insist upon its amendment to this Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I am not at all impressed
by the Commons' reasons for disagreeing with
our amendment. Those reasons were thoroughly argued out in the debate here and
fully answered. They certainly were fully
answered by the honourable senator from

357

Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). Indeed,
much of the argument made in the other
House would not have been put forward if
the honourable gentleman's speech had been
read. The Minister contended that if right
of appeal were instituted there would be no
end to this litigation; that one creditor might
appeal one day and another the next day,
because the Bill did not set any time limit
to appeals. Well, the Bill does, for it
empowers the Governunent to make full
regulations respecting appeals, including the
time within which they may be entered. Of
course the period for lodging appeals would
be stated in the regulations, and no decision
could be appealed after the expiry of that
time.
One of the Commons' reasons is amazing.
It says that it is too late now in the operation
of this Act to provide for appeals. How does
anybody know how late it is in the operation
of the Act? If the reasons advanced in the
Senate Committee-the reasons upon which
the Bill was sustained-were sound, we shall
never get rid of this Act; it will remain in
force always. Those reasons are that the
farmer still finds it difficult enough to sell his
grain, and the outlook for selling in the future
is black. It certainly is. Markets are closed
or being closed all over the world. How dare
anyone say that this is late in the operation
of the Act, and that for the short time longer
the Act will remain in force it is inadvisable
to provide for right of appeal? The thing is
absurd.
The very reincarnation of this Act in
Manitoba discourages everyone who has the
credit of Manitoba at heart. It is heartbreaking. We shall never get back to the
basis of credit between man and man while
this law is in effect. I repeat with all urgency
that this legislation was intended to be but
temporary. And I have often admitted my
conviction that even as temporary legislation
it was a mistake. As permanent legislation
it is awful-an assault upon a principle underlying civilization, the principle of the duty to
pay one's debts.
I do not think there is any hope whatever
of defeating the Bill. If I thought there were,
I should vote against it. But I do feel that
this House should adhere to that measure of
reform which we inserted to give a right of
appeal. The Commons say that a judge and
two commissioners sitting as a board of review
are in a better position to determine facts
than a court of appeal would be. Maybe so,
but it was established, and never contradicted,
that separate boards of review often interpret
similar sets of facts in an entirely different
way. In one case, say in Alberta, if a farm

358

SENATE

is valued at $6,000 and there is a first
mortgage of $5,000 and a second mortgage of
$3,000, the board might reduce the first mortgage to $4,000 and the second to $1,500, wiping
out the rest; whereas in Manitoba, on the
same facts, the board might not disturb the
first mortgage, seeing that the property is
worth more than that, but would order a
reduction in the second mortgage. In my
opinion the Manitoba decision would be
clearly right. But it is only by a court of
appeal whose judgments are binding upon all
boards of review that decisions can be harmonized and laid down as a basis for the legal
interpretation of facts. And in practice the
judgments of a court of appeal in any one
province would be followed by all the boards.
These were reasons for our amendment.
The end that I had hoped for-defeat of
the Bill-will probably not be attained. But
let us not weakly give up our stand in favour
of the right of appeal, which would concede
to all persons affected by this law, not only
in Manitoba, but also in Saskatchewan and
Alberta, the old right to go to the courts for
the determination of facts in which they are
deeply concerned. Let us sec to it that
everyone to whom this Act applies, whether
debtor or creditor, need no longer have his
case decided finally by an arbitrary tribunal
against whom there is no appeal. Let us, in
short, restore, as regards this legislation, that
basic principle of jurisprudence which was
recognized at least two centuries ago: the
right of access to our courts.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, it is difficult indeed at times to take
a stand at variance with that of one's
respected leader. As I view the question that
is before us now, it seems te me like this.
Here we are, as part of the British Empire,
figbting for democracy, and the other day we
undertook to put into the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, which has been in force a
number of years, a democratic principle. Now
we are told-let us see what it is we are told.
The first reason given by the House of
Commons for disagreeing with our amendment is:
Because the findings of a board of review are
based mainly on questions of fact . . .
Where are the questions of fact? There is no
record of them. There is simply a judgment
of a-if I may use the term without offencea penny ante dictator, who for the time
being is receiving compensation for determining what alleviation shall be afforded to some
farmer who is in bard luck.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The question is:
Wbat is his capacity to pay?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The capacity to
p*ay, in the judgment of the official receiver,
may be one thing, whereas the actual capacity,
indicated by the record of what is involved
on both sides of the case, may be something
else.

What have we here? What brought this
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act into
being? The prosperous farming days of the
1920's, when many of the farmers of the West
were singing that well-known tune. 'Happy
Days Are Here Again," and taking a chance
on any old thing in the way of liabilities
for the future, placing mortgages upon this,
that and the other thing, rcally and conscientiously believing they would be able to
pay if the high price of wheat werc maintained.
But the depression came and-again I use
the term without offence-penny ante dictators
determined questions, and we denied te the
parties concerrned that right which we bad been
taught from our youth up belonged to the
humblest citizen. the right of access to the
foot of the Throne. Under this legislation
there was no right of access to anything but
the judgment of some individual wbo was
paid a salary for getting work. We have
heard our friends from Prince Edward Island
tell of offiacial receixvers going about canvassing
for business, looking for compensation. At
the expense of whom? The Government.
iNow then. if we consrientiously believe that
wxe arc fighting for democracy, as I know
we are, and that we are going to win and
in future vears continue to live under a
democratic form of government. let us give a
practical demoostration of our faith by insisting on the amendment to this Bill providing for a right of appealSome Hon. SENATORS:

that the reasons given by the House of Commons for rejecting the amendiment should be
entertained, and I hope the Senate will stand
by its amendment.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, when this Bill first came before this
House I supported the amendment. and I
still hold the same view. I do not think the
reasons given by the House of Commons
for disagreeing with our amendment are at all

JULY 24, 1940
It strikes me as an alarming
impressive.
situation that, as we are told, the chief commissioners of the boards of review in the
Western Provinces are opposed to appeals,
and the reasons on which they found their
opinion are substantially those which have
been brought to our attention. It is almost
akin to a trial judge, after delivering judgment in a case, rushing to the legislature and
urging that there be no appeal from his decision. It seems to me that from the point of
view of the proper administration of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act it is
essential that the chief commissioners should
show absolute impartiality, and their present
attitude is to my mind one of the strongest
reasons why we should insist on our amendment, for it shows the state of mind in which
they may, and, in view of what we have been
told, do enter into consideration of the cases
which come before them.
Most of the reasons given by the House of
Commons for disagreeing with the amendment we have already heard either in committee or in this House. One of them, in
my opinion, is not entirely accurate. We are
told that this amendment is not necessaryBecause the courts now have jurisdiction to
hear appeals in cases where errors of law are
alleged to have been made by a board of review.
As a matter of fact there is no provision for
such appeals. As we all know, when there
has been arbitrary exercise of an excess of
authority, a subject has the right to apply to
the courts for a writ of certiorari to lift the
proceedings up to the Supreme Court; but
the right is limited to that one issue.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: In the cases which
come before the boards of review that is not
the question. The question is whether in the
exercise of the authority conferred upon them
under the statute the board have proceeded
upon proper principles of law. The appeal
provided for by the amendment would establish principles of law which afterward would
guide the official receiver, and in that way
render unnecessary so many references to the
boards of review, and instead of increasing
the costs of administration, as suggested in
the fifth reason, it would correspondingly
reduce them.
On the question of facts, I suggest that in
the first instance the board of review is in
no better position to judge than a court of
appeal would be. It is a well recognized
principle that where the trial judge bases his
judgment of the facts on the credibility of
the witness as determined by his demeanour.
and so forth, the court of appeal will not
interfere with his finding as to credibility.

But on the facts the judges constituting the
court of appeal are at least as intelligent as
members of the board of review, and they are
in just as good a position to form a conclusion -on those facts. I believe the mere
right to appeal would have a very salutary
effect upon boards of review.
The first two reasons deal with the point
that the findings of the board of review are
based mainly on questions of fact, and therefore the board is in a better position to render
a final decision than an appeal court. We
have heard this point before. It is not new
and does not agree with our understanding
of the situation as it applies to ordinary proceedings in court. There we have an appeal
on facts as well as on law. Why should we
not have it here, where such an important
consideration as the taking away of contraetual rights is in issue?
We are also told that it is inadvisable at
this late stage of the operation of the Act
The honourable
to provide for appeals.
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) told us when this Bill was last under
consideration that in a statute of this kind
you cannot make a right of appeal retroactive
without specifically saying so. Therefore the
adoption of the amendment would not involve
opening up all past decisions. Further, the
amendment provides that the rules governing
appeals in the various provinces where the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act ,is in
Those rules unforce would be applied.
doubtedly prescribe a time limit within which
notice of appeal must be given. In Ontario
the limit is fifteen days. What is required
in the Western Provinces I cannot say, but
presumably it would be a reasonable period,
say fifteen or thirty days. It is apparent
therefore that the right of appeal under this
amendment would apply only to findings on
applications which may be made from this
time forward. I repeat, in my opinion this
right of appeal would be a salutary check
upon the possible exercise of arbitrary power
by boards of review.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I confess that my reactions to the
various Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Bills
which have come before us have not always
been the same. For example, in committee
I realized that interference with the contractual
rights of lender and borrower would not entail
such dire results as I had thought. I learned
from Mr. Justice Richards that in thinking of
the first mortgagee, then of the second, and
again of the unsecured creditors, the board of
review charged with the duty of examining
the -capacity of the debtor to pay had to bear
in mind that in the absence of intervention

SENATE

the assets would bc so diminished that the
creditors would have to accept a compromise
agreement.
If the legislation had been applied in the
other provinces as apparently it has been
applied in Manitoba, I should have fewer
qualms of conscience than I have had at times
in relation to this type of legislation. I know
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) bas lost a few hours' sleep during
the operation of the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, which lie sponsored in this
House; but so have I, for I felt that by virtue
of the legislation Paul was being favoured to
the detriment of Peter, who had an instrument
guaranteeing his loan.
We have a saying in French, "Là où il n'y a
rien, le roi perd ses droits-Where nothing
exists, the King loses his riglits." There must
be a similar maxim in English. In the unfortunate situation described by my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
when the bottom was knocked out of the
prosperity of the Northwest, mortgagees and
other creditors found their debtors were unable

creditors, if not all, were ready to see what
they could save from the wreck.
Together with my right honourable friend,
I should like to see some prospect of bringing
lo an end the operation of this legislation in
the Western Provinces. Now we have put
Manitoba on the same footing as Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Not yet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have passed
the Bill in its amended form. I would point
out that those who have favoured extending
the legislation to the farmers of Manitoba and
thus granting them relief. may bc justified by
sorne law of equity.
It is for honourable senators to say if they
will insist upon the amendmenit. I now give
them the opportunity of saying they will not,
1' moving that the Senate do not insist upon
this ameodment.

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 31, an Act to amend
the Soldier Settlement Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I think the
explanatory note to this Bill indicates its
purpose:
Section 57 of the Soldier Settlement Act as
it stands specially reserves mines and minerals
underlying soldier settlement lands, and no
provision is made for their disposal.
The purpose of the amendment is to enable
the Director of Soldier Settlement ýto grant to
the original soldier settler the mines and
minerals acquired with the land, and also te
enable the Director, with the approval of the
Minister, to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of
mines and minerals relating to lands not under
purchase eontract by an original soldier settler.
A distinction is made as to the soldier
settler being entitled to the underground
resources. If the land passes into other hands,
it will be for the Director of Soldier Settlement to dispose of these mines and minerals
under clause 57, as amended:

362

SENATE

(1) From all sales and grants of land made
by the board, other than land acquired by the
board by purchase for resale and sold and
granted to settlers, all mines and minerals shall
be and shall be deemed to have been reserved
whether or not the instrument of sale or grant
so specifies, and may with the approval of the
Minister be sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of by the board under such terms
as may be determined by the Minister, and
the moneys realized thereby shall be remitted
to the Receiver General to ,the credit of the
Soldier Land Settlement Assurance Fund.
I trust this explanation is satisfactory to
honourable members.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourabler senators, I think there is a little
more in the Bill than bas been revealed, the
omission being of course unintentional. Under
the Soldier Settlement plan, which was purely
a farming enterprise, soldiers might become
owners of lands which at the time were Crown
lands in the right of the Dominion, or they
might become owners of private lands bought
by the board for resale. Under the original
Act, ail land of which the soldier was to
become the owner through the board was, as I
have said, to be land for purely farming
purposes, and there was an express reservation in favour of the Crown of all mineral
rights. It will be understood that the purpose of the whole scheme was to enable the
soldier desiring to farm to de so under
spceially favourable conditions of purchase and
As the explanation was given
supervision.
in the other Chamber, it appears that the
Minister had an idea that the original intention might have been that in the case of
private lands, as distinguished frem public
lands, the soldier should get the mineral
rights. I do not know how the Minister
came to that conclusion. The definition of
"lands" in the original Act was perhaps a
litule vague, but this did not matter, because
in tiat Act there was an express reservation
of mineral rights applicable to ail conveyances
frou the board, whether of Dominion or of
arquired private lands.
Now, under this Bill the soldier, if he is
uicky enough to have land that was private
land acquired by the board for sale to him,
bec-oies entitled to oils and any other minerals
that may happen to be under his land, and
this right is made retroactive to 1919. As
respects the other soldier, who bas acquired
through the board what were Dominion lands,
the reservation to the Crown of the mineral
rights still applies. I think I have made clear
to honourable membersHon. Mr. EULER: Did the Crown have the
miineral rights in this private land?
Hin. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. As
I explained at the opening, the original Act
reserved in all cases mineral rights. The
Minister expressed a doubt as to that, but
I want to go on record as saying there was
no room for doubt. The Act expressly
reserved the minerai rights to the Crown.
In the first place, why should the soldier
whose land happens to have been private
land, which the board acquired and sold to
him, have the mineral rights granted to him
now, while the other fellow, whose land was
net private land, bas no such luck? It is
unfair as between them.
The
But my main objection is this.
original scheme was a farming enterprise. It
was not something of the nature of pure public
beneficence in which there might be an element
of gambling. The only intent of the Act, the
whole plan from the commencement, was to
help in building into the basic structure of
the nation's agriculture as many returned men
as chose to enter that field under the assistance
which the Act provided. Under the reservation
of mineral rights every one of the purposes of
the legislation would have been served, but all
the speculative feature would have been held
in the Crown in the hope that it might thereby
get some compensation for the cost of carrying
out the plan. It might be a very trifling
subtraction from the great cost, or it might
be not so trifling. But why at this stage these
rights should be given away I do not know.
I say the reservation is sound to begin with,
and should still apply. I do net think the
soldier in Alberta under whose land there
is an appearance of oil-oil which is now the
property of the Crown-should at this stage
be granted the right to it. We started out,
not to make him an oil operator, but to
help him along the hard, wearisome course of
farming; and, as it turns out, we have helped
him at enormous cost. The lands were
originally acquired for him with great care
and at a high price, and, unfortunately, the
Crown bas lost tremendously by reason of
the reduetion in the value of those lands.
This being so, there is no reason why we
should select one class of soldier and say to
him: "The gods have favoured yen. By good
fortune, the land you got was originally private
land; so we are going to give you the mineral
rights under it." Then we turn to the other
fellow and say, "Yours was public land; it
was never intended that you should get the
minerai rights, and you don't get them."
I do not think the Minister appreciates the
situation. He must have had a memorandum
on the subject from some officer, and I think
the officer is wrong, and the step proposed is
entirely wrong.

JULY 25, 1940
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I looked at
the Bill I saw the distinction made between
the original soldier settler who had acquired
mineral rights with his land and the one who
had not acquired such rights under his purchase contract. I had not read the statement
of the Minister, whieh should be made available to this Chamber as well as to the House
lere it is:
of Commons.
There is a curions anomaly in the Soldier
Settlement Act of 1919 respecting the disposition
of minerals that may be found in or under the
land; I think that is the descriptive phrase
which is usually employed. This applies chiefly
to the three Prairie Provinces. These areas
were under federal control entirely until the
Western Provinces were set up. In the early
days, when land was alienated from the Crown,
the first alienations paid no regard to the
minerals. Later on, the precious metals were
reserved by the Crown; that is, the title to
precious metals in or under the ground did
not pass to the purchaser. Later still, that
reservation was extended to all minerals.
When the Soldier Settlement Act came into
operation, lands for soldier settlers were
acquired not only from Crown granted lands,
but from lands held by private owners. In
some instances the land purchased from private
owners carried with it title to the minerals.
In other instances the minerals were not transferred, being reserved by the private owner.
The amendment proposed here seeks to make
clear that where title to minerals was received
through the acquisition of land for soldier
settlers, it can be passed on to him now.
The question may reasonably he asked why
it is necessary some twenty odd years after
the passing of the original Act to bring in a
measure now to clear up this point. It is
due mainly to the fact that in certain parts
of Alberta oil has been discovered, and it is
expected that, in the future, oil may be discovered in other areas where soldier settlers
have acquired lands.
At the time of the passing of the original
Act, land or lands were defined as follows:
"(i) 'Land' or 'lands' includes granted or
ungranted, Dominion, provincial or private
lands, and real or immovable property, messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments of
any tenure, and real rights, easements and
servitudes, streams, water courses, waters, roads
and ways, and all rights or interests in, or over,
or arising out of, and all charges upon, land
or lands as herein defined."
From a reading of this, I think it will be
clear-I am so advised-that if a soldier settler
came into possession of land from a private
owner who under his title owned the minerals
and was willing to pass that title on to the
soldier settler, he was entitled to receive it.
That is made clearer still, I think, if an examination is made of the discussion in Parliament
at the time the Act was passed. It was net
intended, and it never happened, where the
soldier settler acquired land direct from the
Crown, that the minerals passed with it, because
the general reservation .that was put into effect
years before, governed such alienation.
That is as my right honourable friend has
stated.
Curiously enough, section 57 of the Soldier
Settlement Act, which section is now being
repealed, reads

363

From all sales and grants of land made by
the board, all mines and minerals shall be and
shall he deemed to have been reserved, whether
or not the instrument of sale or grant so
specifies, and as respects any contract or agreement made by it with respect to land it shall
not be deemed to have thereby impliedly covenanted or agreed ýto grant, sell or convey any
mines or minerals whatever.
The definition of lands I read a moment ago
indicates the intention that the Soldier Settlement Board should pass on to the soldier settler
what it received from the purchaser from whom
it bought the land. The section I have just
read throws doubt upon the power of the board
to do this, and it is to clear up that doubt that
we ask the repeal of the section.
There is one other point to which I should
like to draw the attention of the committee for
a moment. The resolution states, in part:
. . . "and also to authorize the Director to
dispose of mines and minerals underlying land
net under purchase contract by an original
soldier settler." A good many instances have
arisen where the soldier settler bas passed out
of the picture. That is, the land bas come back
to the Director of Soldier Settlement. We are
making it clear that in such case where the
land reverted to the Director of Soldier Settlement, and is again resold to a civilian, the
mineral rights do not pass. In other words,
the mineral rights pass only to the bona fide
soldier settler who acquired them through the
board by purchase from seme private party at
the time he made his selection. I hope I have
made clear to the committee the purpose of
the amendment.
Of the discussion that followed I need read
only the Minister's statement bearing on
mineral rights:
Mr. Crerar: Those who are familiar with
the early railway history associated with the
building of the Canadian Pacifie Railway will
recall that there were considerable grants of
land to that railway to assist it in the building
of its transcontinental line.
And the
(York-Sunbury):
Mr. Hanson
mineral wealth passed with those grants?
Mr. Crerar: Yes; the mineral wealth passed
with the grants prior to 1883. In the time
between 1885 and 1887 only the precious
minerals were reserved; in other words, coal
and oil were not reserved. During that period,
of course, lands passed to companies and to
individuals who resold, and in those resales
there were occasions when the owner reserved
the mineral rights, while in other cases the
mineral rights passed.
That brings us back to the amendment we
propose here; where they did pass, and went
along with the land, and such land was later
acquired by the Soldier Settlement Board for
a soldier, we are attempting .to make it clear
beyond doubt that we can pass on to him all
that we received when the land was purchased.
. . Several instances have arisen where soldier
setlers desired to dispose of mineral rights.
They had thought they had the right to dispose
of those rights. Certainly as I read the definition of the term "lands" in the Soldier Settlement Act-and I believe I am supported in this
by the law officers of the Crown-it was evidently intended that the mineral righlis in such
case should pass to them.
I assume that this explanation by the Minister justifies the Bill.

JULY 25, 1940
The fact that a shopkeeper or a landlord had
authorized the Dominion to collect and that
Parliament had authorized, say, the Department
of Trade and Commerce to do the collecting
vould not confer legislative authority upon
Parliament to enact concerning the civil rights
of delinquent debtors in a province, and with
relation to a debt arising in and necessarily
continuing to be located in the province. Likevise as to a debt owing to the province, and
if the Income War Tax Act purported to do
more than authorize Dominion officials to collect
uînder authority of provincial law that Act
itself would be, pro tanto, invalid.
In my opinion the Bill amounts to a proposed
expropriation by the Dominion of the moneys
of citizens of the provinces who are (in a
logical sense) accidentally in the employ of the
Dominion Crown. Its purpose may be laudable,
but laudable purpose cannot confer legislative
jurisdiction upon the Dominion or justify a
breachiof the civil rights of provincial citizens.
Their civil rights are no less constitutionally
inviolate because they happen to be officers,
servants or employees of the Dominion Crown.
I submitted his opinion to the department
w'hich has charge of collecting income tax,
and I have a statement from the Commissioner
of Income Tax, Mr. Fraser Elliott, explaining
the situation. I will now read it:
The proposed amendment is occasioned by the
fact that a number of Dominion civil servants
in the province of Manitoba are unwilling to
pay to the provincial Government the provincial
income tax imposed in respect of their salaries.
Some 1,300 civil servants in the province of
Manitoba have failed to pay their provincial
income tax, and there are also some in Ontario.
The question of liability was litigated through
the courts in Manitoba and the Supreme Court
of Canada and the Privy Council. The Privy
Council held that the Dominion civil servants
resident in the province of Manitoba were
subject to provincial taxes and the same should
be paid.
Although legally liable by the decision of the
Privy Council, these Dominion civil servants
have failed to pay, on the ground that they
are immune from any provincial action against
their salaries because they are servants of the
Crown in the right of the Dominion.
This immunity from legal process bas precluded the province rfrom collecting taxes
overdue.
Acoerdingly Bill No. 99 is proposed as a means
of effecting collection of a debt due to the
Crown in right of the province.
Remember, this immunity bas precluded the
province from collecting taxes from employees
of the Federal Government.
It is not a tax-imposing Bill. It is nothing
more than the collection through the medium
provided in the Bill of a debt due the province
of Manitoba.
There are certain limitations on such action
provided in the Bill, namely, there bas to be
in existence an agreement between the province
and the Dominion whereby the Dominion is
administering the tax-imposing laws of the
province, but that is an incident only and does
not touch upon the question raised, namely, bas
the Dominion the power to deduet from the
salaries payable to its servants sums of money
owing by the civil servant and pay the same
over to the creditor, namely, the province.

365

This, clearly, is the question before us.
It is generally accepted that the Crown in
the riglst of the province cannot enforce judgments by order of garnishee addressed to the
Crown in the right of the Dominion. Therefore
the power of collection is not within the conmpetence of the province of Manitoba.
The B.N.A. Act bas never been regarded as
anything other than wholly comprehensive in
extending to the Dominion and to its provinces
full scope of the law in every direction, by
giving to the province or to the Dominion the
power to carry out the law in all its phases.
Inasmuch as the province bas not the power
to enforce its judgments against civil servants
it is not to be lightly presumed that there is
a hiatus or casus omissus under the B.N.A. Act.
Therefore the Parliament of Canada is the
legislative authority in Canada which bas the
power to authorize the Dominion Government
to make such deductions from the salary of its
own employees.
Such a power would not rest in the legislative authority of the province and it is
presumed to be inherent in all law that the
legislation pertaining to the miatter exists in
either the Dominion or the province.
If it is excluded, as lias long been recognized,
from the power of the province to garnishee
the salary of a Dominion civil servant, then the
power belongs te the Dominion. Consequently
the subject-matter of Bill 99 is thought properly
to come within the Dominion legislative field.
Furthermore I am advised that any doubts
upon the constitutional validity of this Bill
may be put at rest by enabling legislation which
the province of Manitoba lias undertaken to
enact.
There remains therefore but to reiterate that
Bill 99 is not a taxation measure and therefore
does not fall within the purview of section 92
of the B.N.A. Act relating to "direct taxation
within the province in order to the raising of
revenue for provincial purposes". Again it does
not interfere with property and civil rights
within provincial jurisdiction, because the
Dominion action is .against a Dominion civil
servant in relation to a debt owing by the
Dominion Government to its servant, namely
the withholding from the civil servant a portion
of that debt and paying it over to the province.
Therefore it is not a matter falling within
property and civil rights as that term is used
in the B.N.A. Act.
In conclusion, therefore, realizing that deduction or garnishee proceedings against Dominion
civil servants is not within the competence of
the provincial legislative body, and realizing
the comprehensiveness of the B.N.A. Act as
granting to the Dominion and the province
complete jurisdiction over all phases of the
law, what is excluded from the province falls
within the competence of the Dominion, particularly in relation to its own civil servants
and any debt which they nay owe.
This 'opinion is concurred in by the Department of Justice.
C. F. Elliott,
Commissioner of-Income Tax.
The Senate will clearly recognize the situation. Hundreds of employees of the Dominion
of Canada residing in Manitoba refuse to
abide by a judgment of the Privy Council
which orders them to pay income tax to the
province. This Bill assumes that, the province

366

SENATE

being helpless, the power rests with the
Dominion. Under these circumstances, backed
as I am by the opinion of the Department of
Justice declaring the Bill to be constitutional,
I think there should be no hesitation in giving
the Bill second reading.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the opinion of Mr. Fraser
Elliott is indeed interesting, and carries with
it, as the last sentence says, the judgment of
the Department of Justice. Under these circumstances, even thougli our Parliamentary
Counsel expresses a contrary opinion, I do
not think I am justified in voting against the
measure. Nevertheless, I want to put this on
record. Having carefully read the opinion of
Parliamentary Counsel, and having carefully
listened to the opinion just read, which, in
fact, is tie opinion of the Department of
Justice, strongly supported by a very able
man, the Commissioner of Income Tax, may
I say, with all the deference due to them
and to the fact that the opinion of the Department of Justice has only now come before
me, I am more impressed with the judgment
of our Parliamentary Counsel.
The opinion just read proceeds on the
assumption that unless we have power to make
ourselves judges of the amount of the debt,
to decide that a citizen of Manitoba owes
a certain amount, and then to take the money
which otherwise is bis and pay the debtpower which is disputed by our Counsel-there
is a hiatus, and no way whatever exists by
which the Government of Manitoba can collect
the debt. I cannot follow that.
Needless to say, not only have I no sympathy with these employees of the Crown,
but I carnestly hope a way will be found
to show them what citizenship means; and if
no other way is found, I would let them try
their luck in applying for another job.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The memorandum states that the Government of Manitoba cannot sue and garnish. Perhaps it cannot
garnish. I am not so sure. If it cannot,
then we ought to exhaust our power to enable
it, and others, to garnish. Why should a
civil servant be protected beyond other citizens
in the non-payment of his debts?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have never
been able to understand it. Provinces and
citizens should have the fullest access to the
courts against civil servants, ministers of the
Crown or members of Parliament if they fail
to pay their debts. I am not sure, but I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

do not believe there is any prohibition on the
provinces against garnishment. What prohibition is there to prevent Manitoba from suing
every one of those one thousand two hundred
persons?
They are not exempt from suit
simply because they are employees of the
Crown.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The province has sued
and got the judgment of the Privy Council.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If that is
the case, I would amend the Bill to provide
that whenever a certificate of judgment from
a competent court is furnished to the Department of Revenue, the Department of Finance,
or the appropriate department, the money
may be deducted. It would be a judgment
of the court, and not our judgment, which
is the basis of objection of the Law Clerk of
this House. I cannot see the slightest objection to amending the Bill and saying that,
if a certificate of judgment is forwarded, the
money may be deducted in a certain way. I
think I have made myself clear.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, without discussing the legal aspect of the
case, I think I can tell you what caused this
"row," if I may use that term. About 1932
or 1933 the Legislature of Manitoba passed
a bill which, like our National Defence tax,
imposed a two per cent deduction from income.
Certain Dominion civil servants refused to
pay this tax. They were sued by the province,
and the case went to the Privy Council, which
gave judgment in favour of the Government.
In spite of that decision, the Government of
Manitoba bas never been able to collect the
money because of its inability to garnish
the salaries of Dominion civil servants.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
taken into the courts?

Were they not

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Some of them were.
Speaking from memory, I would say there
were two or three cases taken into the courts.
They dealt with all phases of the question,
and were combined in one suit which went
to the Privy Council.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: In other words,
the province bas not got judgment in all the
cases.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They have not got judgment in all the cases, but in view of the
decision of the Privy Council they can secure
judgment in every one of them.
Right Hon. Mr. M'EIGHEN: And they eau
make these people pay the costs too.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Yes.

JULY 25, 1940
Hon. Mr. EULER: Could not the property
of these people be attached?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That would cause no
end of trouble. Some of them have their
property not in their own names, but in thé
names of their wives or some other persons.
The merits are all in favour of these people
being compelled to pay. Their refusal to pay
is a straight defiance of the right of the
province to collect. I do not like the income
tax law-I voted against it-but it is the law,
and should be observed. I agree with the
right honourable leader on this side of the
House. I think it is a shame that a man should
be able to run up a grocery bill, call in a
doctor, or have his children's teeth attended
to by a dentist, and then, simply because he
works for the Dominion Government, be able
to evade payment for the goods or services
he has received. Such is the law in Manitoba
-I
do not know whether it is in other
provinces or not-and I do not think it should
be the law. You can garnish the wages of
railroad employees or any other persons
except Dominion civil servants. I am not
certain as to the constitutionality of this Bill,
but I am going to vote for it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable members, to adopt the
motion for the second reading of this Bill?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was about to
draw the attention of the Senate to a statement
in the memorandum which I read:
Furthermore, I am advised that any doubts
upon the constitutional validity of this Bill
may be put at rest by enabling legislation,
which the province of Manitoba bas undertaken
to enact.
I hope that this enactment of the Manitoba
Legislature will contain a statement which will
satisfy my right honourable friend and those
who feel as he does, that the exact amount of
the debt should be clarified and mentioned.
Of course, these debts exist in virtue of an
Act of the Legislature. It is quite easy to
find exactly what any civil servant owes,
because his salary is known and it ls only
necessary to figure the tax on that.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.
MOTION FOR THIRD READING POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With leave of
the House, I would move third reading now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
mermbers, I should like, in fact I think I should
insist, that this motion stand until -the next
sitting. The reason is that this is as good an
opportunity as we shall ever get to set right
the law which now stands in the way of

collection of the money by Manitoba.
I
formerly held the opinion, and it now is
supported by information on which I rely, that
prohibition against garnishment can be wiped
out. Wipe out all prohibition against garnishment and you will solve the whole problem.
Even better than that, you will enable others
to collect where hitherto they have been forbidden by class legislation of the worst type,Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: --legislation

kinds.

Mr. HARDY:

Garnishment

of all

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: .- of all kinds.
Then there would be no question of jurisdiction, and these fellows would be put in their
place, as would hundreds more, who ought
to be.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I quite agree with the
right honourable gentleman opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen). I think that any member of this House who has had any business
connection in the city of Ottawa, which of
course is very largely a civil service city,
will understand what the lack of the power
of garnishment means to hundreds of business
men here. I venture to say that at least thirty
to forty per cent of the failures amongst a certain class of merchants in this city are largely
due to the fact that the salaries of civil
servants cannot be garnisheed. I believe that,
as the right honourable gentleman has said,
this is an opportunity to make a new law
covering the whole wide subject. Anyone who
has a proper claim against a civil servant should
have the privilege of garnishing the debtor's
salary. There is no class in Canada who
should pay their debts more readily than civil
servants. They are paid regularly, right on
the dot, once or twice a month, as the case
may be, and when they retire they are given
a reasonable superannuation allowance. The
right honourable gentleman's suggestion strikes
me as a very good one, and I believe that if
the Senate spent a few hours dealing with it
next week the Government might listen.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I had not intended
to speak on this matter, but I do want to say
a word in support of the suggestion made by
the right honourable gentleman opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) a few moments ago. I
support it not only for the reason he gave, but

hcause it seems to me that from a general
point of view this kind of legislation is
vic1usHon. Mr. CALDER:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: -quite apart from
the question of whether the civil servants in
Manitoba owe this money or not. On that
point I have no knowledge whatever. It seems
to me a vicious principle to have one legislative
body acting as the collection agent for a totally
different authority. Ea h taxing authority
-hould stand upon its own feet and have its
own means collecting what it considers te be
due to it. I entirely agre that anyone who
bas a just claim against a Dominion civil
senant should be able te collect by the ordinarv course of law and judgment. And I feel
that the Bill as it stands now embodies a bad
principle in the appointment of one authority
as agent for enforcing collection of taxes due
to another authority.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I have no objection to the motion
for third reading of this Bill being postponed
until the next sitting. The point raised by
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) and supported by other senators
has to do with an important and difficult problem. It is a problem that has engaged the
attention of every government for a considerable number of years-namely, how to
give creditors a fair right te collect debts
from civil servants. I do net know why it lias
not been solved in the very easy way suggestcd to-day. It will be for the Minister of
Finance and the Government te decide
whether the proposal can be dealt with in the
short space of time which remains before prorogation.
But I want te say something in favour of
the Civil Service. Its members have felt
that the situation was net a very satisfactory
one for the body as a whole. They have an
institution which tries to see that the proper
thing is done by the debtor towards his
creditor. I know of one case in which this
institution was interested, that of a man who
had got deeply into debt. Before he retired
he withdrew the whole sum standing to lis
credit in the Superannuation Fund and paid
off everything he owed, so that he left the
Service debt free.
The third reading will be set down for the
next sitting of the House. In the meantime
-I shall draw the attention of the Minister of
Finance to this afternoon's debate.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 103, an Act te amend the
Special War Revenue Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
provides for increases in the tax on a large
number of articles. So many articles are
affected that I should call it an omnibus Bill.
I do not know whether honourable menmbers
bave gone through it, and whether they desire
to ask questions now or in Committee of the
Whole.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
meembers, I have no objection to the second
reading, but I am confident that the honourable leader will want to go into Committee
of the Whole. Twelve amendments have been
suggested by our Parliamentary Counsel.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.

The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair in the Chair.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Is it the intention of the Committee to discuss the Bill
elause by clause?
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So far as I
know, the amendments are altogether clerical,
making the wording uniform, except an amendment on page 6, whi-ch is of a more or less
substantial character.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say I am
advised that these amendments, which my right

acceptable to the department, except the

narrow. and would like te retain "automotive,"
which is much broader in its scope.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
that all the amendments are accepted but
the last two, which substitute "automobile"
for "automotive." There has been placed in
my hand a quotation from Webster's dictionary, in which the word "automotive" is
defined. Automotive vehicles are said to
include lawnmowers, farm tractors, station
tractors, station baggage trucks, and the like,

deep-rooted objection to "auto>motive," but

a man to be a very eminent counsel and yet

hesitation I accept -cancellation of the last
two amendments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I need
flot take the time of the Senate to discuss the
matter further. We will retain the termn

Hon. Mr. EULER: I move, seconded by
Hon. Mr. Murdock, adoption of the following

Hon. Mr. HAIG: What is the position of

The Bill was reported as arnended.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bull as amended.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill wau
read the third time, and passed.
PENITENTIARY BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received. from the House of
Commons with Bill 30, an Act to amend the
Penitentiary Act and the Penitentiary Act,
1939.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second readmng of the Bill.
He said: This is a short and simple Bill.
Subsection 5 of section 1 is new and provides
authority to reach agreement with a province
for confinemnent within the province of prisoners convicted in the Yukon Territory or
Northwest Territories.

The subsection reads:

The Minister may, subject to the approval of
the Governor in Council, arrange with the
Lieutenant Governor of any province for the
confinement in gaols of that province of convicts convicted in -the Yukon Territory or the
Northwest Territories and the compensation to
be made by Canada to that province for the
care -and maintenance of such convicts while
s0 confined.

As teo subsection 6, this is the explanatory
note:

The section as redrawn purports to authorize
the transfer of prisoners within or out of the
Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories
to perntentiaries as heretofore and to provincial
gaols. The latter provision is desirable as the

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, it is the
same bird, but reincarnated for a peculiar
purpose.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Did my right
honourable friend say "jailbirds"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. The jailbirds are just the same as they were, but
the Bill has a sort of twin application.
Section 1 reads:
Subsection five of section forty-seven of the
Penitentiary Act, chapter one hundred and
fifty-four of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1927, and subsection five of section fifty-two of
The Penitentiary Act, 1939, chapter six of the
statutes of 1939, are repealed and the following
in each case substituted therefor.
Now I shall have to explain what this
hydra-headed monster is. As I look into
the faces of honourable members I wonder
if I can detect the smile that would arise
if they knew the tale that hangs thereby.
They should remember it. Two years agoover that now-just as hot summer was upon
us, we had a heavy, ponderous looking, new
Penitentiaries Bill thrown at us as the hour
for the expiry of Parliament drew nigh. On
going 'through the Bill I wondered why it
was of such portentous dimensions. A careful
study of it disclosed that, though it was as
thick as your hand, all it did to the old Act
was to change the word "superintendent" to
"commission". The change could have been
made by simple amendments, but in order
that there should appear to be something
larger than a mouse coming out of the
mountain of the Penitentiary Commission, a
Bill was brought in which, while actually a
mouse, had all the appearance of an elephant.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
consolidation of the Act?

Was it not a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There was no
consolidation. It did nothing whatever but
change the word "superintendent" to "commission" and make consequential changes in
the old Penitentiary Act. This was the mouse,
in the guise of an elephant, that came out of
one of the most expensive commissions this
country ever authorized.
Well, the Bill was so lengthy that we did
not have time to examine it; and I, who had
gone into it personally, did not see any need
of it at all, and urged its rejection at that
late hour of the session. The House agreed,
and it was rejected, not because all, or nearly
all, were of my opinion that the original
superintendent was sufficient and the substitution of a commission just a waste of the taxpayers' money, but because we had not time
to go into the whole problem.
Hon. Mr. EULER.

This was followed by one of those customary fulminations of the Government in
the other Chamber against the sinful Senate,
and the imprecations of the Mini.ster of
Justice, which were hurled at us. Even our
pure and undefiled motives were impugned.
But .that was not what was most in the
mind of the Minister. What was in his mind
was the sacred administration of the penitentiary service, for without the means and
machinery that this new Act was to give him
he stood appalled at the prospect of having
to keep quiet, and free from riot and rebellion, the inhabitants of our penitentiaries.

his Penitentiary Act, he could not appoint a

important beneficial effects on the treasury of
Canada.
The note which accompanies this Bill gives
the principal changes in the Excess Profits
Tax.
Under this Bill a tax of seventy-five per
centum is levied upon the annual excess profits
derived from carrying on business in Canada.
As an alternative, a minimum tax of twelve
per centum is levied upon the total annual
profits. The larger of the two taxes is to be
paid.
Excess profits are tihe difference between the
profits of the taxation year and the profits of
the standard period, being the four years 1936,
1937, 1938 and 1939, or fiscal periods ending
therein.
Provision is made for adjustment of the
standard profits by the Minister te have regard
to changes in the length of fiscal periods, to
have regard to increases or decreases in the
capital employed in the business, or in the case
of gold mines and oil wells, tu have regard te
increases or decreases in the volume of production.
Provision is also made for the ascertainment
of standard profits by a board of referees in
cases of new businesses or businesses depressed
during the standard period.
Exemption is given te professional activiýties,
small businesses with profits less than $5,000
before salary or other payments te proprietors,
personal corporations, non-resident-owned investment corporations and varions institutions net
taxable under the Income War Tax Act.
The determination of profits for this Act is
upon the same principles as under the Income
War Tax Act, but certain deductions are
allowed under this Act which are net allowed
under the Income War Tax Act. For instance,
in the case of corporations a special deduction
is allowed for that portion of the income tax
which is payable upon the excess profits, and a
special deduc-tion is allowed for such reasonable
provision as the Minister may allow as a reserve
against future depreciation in inventory values.
In the case of taxpayers other than corporations
the excese profits tax is first imposed upon the
profits and then the excess profits tax is to be
allowed as a dedurtion for purposes of assessing
the income tax. Consequently the deductions
allowed to such taxpayers under the Excees
Profits Tax Act include the ordinary business
expenses such as depreciation, depletion, expenses laid out 'to earn income as vell as a
special deduction in lieu of salary paid te
proprietors, not to exceed $5,000 per proprietor
working full time, and the aforementioned reserve against future depreciation in inventory
values.
The Bill is draftted to apply to all profits
earned or deemed to have been earned since
January 1, 1940, and in the case of fiscal
periods net coinciding with the calendar year
the profits shall be -apportioned.
I am quite sure my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) has examined this
Bill closely and that the note I have just
read will satisfy him.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I shall owe an explanation to the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) for
the remarks I am about to make. He was good

Mr. DANDURAND.

enough te ask me if I had any objections te
the measure, and I replied te him in the
negative. I did not feel there were any
we could urge, and I gave him to understand
that se far as I personally was concerned
the Bill could go through te third reading.
Since he was speaking te me, though, I have
found that this Bill contains a clause which
I should like te have discussed in committee.
I will state now what that clause is, and say
frankly it is one in which I personally am
interested. Therefore my words will have
far less effect than they otherwise would have
had. It is a clause imposing another tax on
companies which are solely co-operative in
nature, namely, purely investment companies.
Such companies should be exempted. just as
other co-operative companies are. They are
not profit-making; they cannot be. They
may gather and distribute profits, but they
earn no new ones. The added tax which is
imposed here would make it the duty of
every one of these ceompanies te dissolve in
justice te their shareholders. The companies
In fact,
could not justify their existence.
I want te say frankly, they cannot now. All
the existing taxes have heen put on since the
companies were created. But the difficulty
is that if you dissolve, as in justice you ought
te do, you will have to face such charges
imposed against distributees in the way of
transfer taxes and the like that you will be
murdered anyway.
However, this is net a subject which should
be argued at length here. I am net going te
oppose the second reading, and even if the
Government do not see the situation as I
believe they will see it, I will not oppose the
third reading. We ought not to do anything
about this without the Government's approval.
I would ask that the Bill be sent to the
Banking and Commerce Committee and considered there in the presence of officials of the
department, because I cannot believe that
after they understand the situation they will
be unable te find a way out. I am an officer
of one of these companies and I suppose that
in a sense I too am a sufferer, but in a
relatively small sense. The persons who bear
the brunt, who are doubly, trebly and even
in saime cases quadrupledly taxed-I am
thinking of provincial as well as federal
taxes-are the shareholders of these companies,
which are unable te make any earnings of
their own, but merely distribute the earnings
of others.
I should like us te consider this matter in
committee, to see if a remedy cannot be
found. If we conclude that the only remedy

JULY 25, 1940
is dissolution of the companies, I shall be
thoroughly content. It would be too had, I
think, to dissolve them, because I sincerely
believe there is menit in the idea underlying
them. They exist in every modern country.
They will continue to exist here, but I repeat
it is unjust to the shareholIders that they
should.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that we take second reading now, and suspend
the sitting of the House for haîf an hour or 80
while we consider the Bill in the Banking and
Commerce Committee. The Commissioner of
Income Tax is here, and I may be able to have
another officiai present.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
I do flot
like to object to that, but the honourable
senator from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
who bas now gone, strongly desires to be
present when the Bill is taken up in coinmittee. Therefore I should very much prefer
'that the committee's sitting be postponed
until next week. 1 will undertake that the
discussion shahl not be long. We are absolutely in the hands of the Government. It
would be folly for this flouse to amend on its
own initiative any Bill of this kind.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: 1 should like to ask
just one question. Is it not incorrect to say
that the excess profits tax is only 75 per cent?
The 12 per cent is deducted first, and it seems
to me that the excess profits tax would figure
out at 80 per cent instcad of 75 per cent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend could get that information at the
committee.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: AlIl right.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second tume.

Bill be referred to the Standing Committee

TREACHERY BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 73, an Act respecting
Treachery.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: When
shal this Bill be read a second time?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, as we are rapidly approaching the
end of the session, I move, with the leave of
the House, that this Bill be read a second
time now.
In the absence of the honourable Minister
of Justice, in whose name the Bill stood,
Hon. Mr. Ilsley, who acted as chairman of the
committee which recommended this Bill to
the other House, gave the following explanation on the motion for second reading:
Honourable gentlemen may remember that the
honourable member for Parry Sound (Mr.
Slaght), speaking in the debate on the proposal
to set up a committee to review the Defence of
Canada Regulations, advocated the establishment of the death penalty for treachery. Perhaps the word "treachery" was not used at
that time, but the honourable member for
Parry Sound brought very forcibly to the
attention of the House what all of us knew
,and had considered to a greater or lesser extent,
namely that in this particular war there is
danger of immense damage being donc by the
activities of saboteurs, and what are called
"fifth columnists", and traitors in every sense
of the word. Damage of that kind was done in
the small and neutral countries of Europe which
were invaded by Germany; the way was thus
paved for the rapid conquest of those countries;
and it was felt that the committee which had
been set up by Parliament should give special
and immediate attention to the question whether
our own law was -adequate to meet situations
of the kind.
Therefore the first duty to which the committee addressed itself was the consideration
of that question. We found that Great Britain
had considered the same question, that the
Parliament of the United Kingdom had passed
an Act called the Treachery Act, in which there
was an accurate 'and precise definition of the
offences which should, in the opinion of that
Parliament, be regarded as so serions as to
deserve the punishment of death. The committee gave its attention to the existing provisions of the law. The provisions which relate
to acts of this sort are those of the Criminal
Code relating to treasonable offences, those of
the Criminal Code relating to mischief, tie
provisions of the Official Secrets Act, and the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

provisions of the Defence of Canada Regulations
themselves. If honourable members have read
the second report of the committee set up to
consider and review the Defence of Canada
Regulations they will find a concise statement
or a reference to the previously-existing law, a
brief analysis of the situation generally, and a
brief statement of the reasons which led the
committee to make the recommendations which
they did.
The Defence of Canada Regulations are passed
under the provisions of the War Measures Act,
and the maximum punishment which can be
inflicted under the War Measures Act is five
years' imprisonment. Five years' imprisonment
is not adequate to meet offences of the kind
under consideration.
The provisions of the Criminal Code relating
to treason are not sufficient to cover what we
have in mind. To begin with a person cannot
be convicted of treason unless he owes allegiance
to the Crown. That does not mean that necessarily he must be a British subject, but he
must have accepted or adopted in some way the
protection of the Crown so that he owes
allegiance to the Crown. It was the opinion
of the committee, and I think it is the opinion
of the legal profession, that persons who came
here temporarily, clandestinely, with the idea
of being here a short time-perhaps coming
here from the United States, if such a thing
might occur, with a view of doing damage by
vay of slabotage or otherwise and then returning to that country-could not be convicted of
treason, because they would not come within
tie purview of the present sections of the
Criminal Code. Besides, treason is not clearly
defined in the Code. It permits of a great deal
of argument as to what is and what is not
treason. Further, there is a curions option
with regard to punishment for treason. The
best legal advice that the committee could get
on that point was this, that the judge bas the
option of imposing death as the penalty or of
letting the accused go altogether; he has no
discretion to do anything between those two
extremes.
Mr. Hanson (York-Sunbury) :
That is an
astonishing statement.
Mr. Ilsley: It surprises my honourable friend?
Well, it surprised every member of the committee with a possible exception of one, who,
to his great credit, raised the point.
The
provisions of the section relating to treason
are that the person who is convicted of treason
shall be liable to suffer death. It is different
from the provision relating to murder, where
be muist suffer death if he is convicted of
murder. The provision of the Code which gives
the judge a discretion to reduce the penalty
provided by the section does not extend, it
would seem, to the section relating to treason;
it extends only to the sections relating to
imprisonment. If the penalty is life imprisonment, the judge imposing the sentence can make
it anything less than life, but in the case of
treason he apparently lias an option, either to
send the accused away with a warning or
otherwise, or to sentence him to be hanged.
That is not a satisfactory condition in so far
as punishment is concerned.
I do not think
that this is the position in England, either.
I believe that in England, treason, if established,
must result in capital punishment.
Tlese are some of the defects in the existing
law both as regards proof and as regards
punishnent. The "usiscliief" sections are not
appropriate te the conditions which may arise.

JULY 29, 1940
They are not complete; they were not designed
with a war or apprehended war or anything
of the kind in view; they are what might be
called peace-time criminal sections.
The Official Secrets Act, while dealing with
spying, wrongful communication of information,
unauthorized use of information, and other
things of the character under consideration, is
not complete for the purpose in mind. It does
not authorize imprisonment for more than seven
years, a maximum which the committee deemed
inadequate in some circumstances. After due
consideration we decided that there should be
enacted in this country a provision such as the
United Kingdom enacted with regard to certain
serious offences. The offences I have in mind
can be very shortly stated.
The provision respecting the offence which
it is thought proper te punish with death is
that if, with intent to help the enemy, any
person does or attempts or conspires with any
other person to do any act which is designed
or likely to give assistance to the naval, military
or air operations of the enemy, to impede like
operations of His Majesty's forces, or to endanger life, lie shall be guilty of an indictable
offence and shall on conviction suffer death.
There is another provision of the Act; it
relates to somewhat less serions offences. This
other provision of the Act is not found in the
Treachery Act of the United Kingdom. It is
found in the Defence Regulations of the United
Kingdom.
But it is a
Mr. Hanson (York-Sunbury):
new offence in Canada.
Mr. Ilsley: Yes. It may be included among
certain existing offences or many acts which
would be offences under this other provision
to which I have referred. But in this form
it is not in the law of Canada at the present
time. In that sense it is new in this Act. It
is taken from the Defence Regulations of the
United Kingdom. Defence Regulation number
2A reads:
"If, with intent to assist an enemy, any person
does any act which is likely to assist an enemy
or prejudice the public safety, the defence of
the realm or the efficient prosecution of war,
then, without prejudice to the law relating to
treason, he shall be guilty of an offence against
this regulation and shall, on conviction or
indictment, be liable to penal servitude for life."
With the proper change in terminology necessary by reason of our practice here we have
adopted that section exactly as it is. These
are the two main sections of the Treachery Act.
That is the substance of the Act. It may be
thought that the capital offence section is pretty
severe. The committee fully considered the
desirability of providing a discretionary power
in the judge to make the punishment either
death or life imprisonment, and after very full
consideration it was their opinion that no discretionary power of that kind should be vested
in the judge, although it is fair to say that the
committee were not unanimous. One member
and perhaps others felt that there should be
that option on the part of the judge. It is
fair, however, to add that these members do
not feel too strongly on that point, knowing
that it is a debatable matter.
The large
majority of the committee were of the opinion
that, these offences being extremely serionsbecause they must be done with intent to help
the enemy-once the intent and the act are
proved, there should be no option but that the
person convicted should suffer death.
The usual safeguards are thrown around the
accused. There should be some control in the

375

institution of a prosecution of this kind. It
cannot be begun without consent of the
Attorney-General of Canada. In the second
place, the accused bas the usual protection of
the grand jury in those provinces in which there
are grand juries. First, there is the preliminary inquiry before the magistrate and later
lie has the protection of the jury, if one can
call it protection; at any rate, he bas the right
to go before a jury. And then there are
provisions for appeal. I should add, hoWever,
that appeals are expedited. There is a section
designed to expedite the hearing of appeals
so that cases will not drag on for any length
of time. Finally, there is the power of the
Governor in Council to commute a sentence
if it is felt in exceptional cases that this should
be done, just as in the case of murder. There
are same subordinate provisions of the Act,
notably those relating to courts martial and
their jurisdiction. They are given concurrent
jurisdiction over persons subject to the military
law and over alien enemies in cases where alien
enemies are sent to them for trial, or it is
deemed advisable that they be tried by court
martial. The punishment in case of conviction
by court martial is not by hanging, but by
shooting, and that is probably the universal
rule in most countries with which we are
acquainted.

I think I have given a fair statement of the
reason why this Bill has come before Parliament. It is the result of an inquiry made by
a special committee of the House of Commons,
and was adopted either unanimously or with
only one dissident.* I commend the Bill to the
Senate.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
MOTION FOR THIRD READING POSTPONED

The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: When
shall this Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think we
might take the third reading to-morrow.

Yes.
Third reading

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I suppose the
honourable leader has taken cognizance of
a memorandum presented to him by Parliamentary Counsel.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Parliamentary
Counsel bas stated that, although ordinarily
be would feel inclined to present amendments, in this case he is abstaining from
doing so.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I have a number of them here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He says:
This Bill follows closely the Treachery Act,
1940, of the United Kingdom. I have no
amendments to propose to it. I would ordinarily propose that the first two lines of clauses
3 and 7 be limited to laws now in force, but,

in view of the kind of legislation that this is,
and of its temporary character, I refrain in
this case from so advising.
I confess that I did not read the notes
which followed, but I observed that Counsel
had taken pains to show a concordance of
this Bill with the United Kingdom Act, as
my honourable friend will see. That does
not bear on the present legislation, except to
inform the leaders here as to the source from
which this Bill comes.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
He does say,
in addition, that certain clauses headed
"new" do not appear in the United Kingdom Act.
Oh, yes. Some

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 112, an Act to amend
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of the Bill.
Honourable senators, this Bill
He said:
contains a number of amendments, which we
might discuss in Committee of the Whole.
The explanatory notes, on the right-hand pages
of the Bill, are very full, and, to me at all
events, satisfactory.
If second reading is
given now, I shall move that we go into
Committee of the Whole, where I think we
could make more rapid progress.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Coté in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I desire to
inform the Committee that I have a statement from our Law Clerk that he hias no
amendments to propose ta this Bill.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Shall we consider the Bill clause by clause?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, this
measure will extend the scope of the Act
considerably. Should the honourable leader
not give an outline of the general scheme of
the Bill before we deal with it clause by
clause?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: If the honourable
gentleman will allow me, I may say I have
glanced through the Bill and I doubt very
much whether anyone could make a comprehensive statement on a multiplicity of amendments, such as we have here, all dealing with
different things. The various sections can be
discussed when we reach them. I should think
it would be better not to proceed with the
measure now, but to postpone consideration
for some time, so that we may have an opportunity to read the amendments. I doubt if we
should make much speed by trying to go
ahead before we read them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I agree with my
honourable friend that this Bill deals with a
great many things. It is what we call an
omnibus Bill. But may we not take it up
clause by clause and see if in each case the
accompanying explanation printed opposite
the amendment is not satisfactory?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think that would be
all right, so long as it was undersbood that we
may agree to sections itentatively and that any
honourable member who desires to discuss any
of them further may do so.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: That is, before
the preamble carries.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Yes.

On section 1-arrangements with local
governments or municipalities for the use of
the Force:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is the
explanation given on the right-hand page of
the Bill:
The words underlined in the proposed section
5, on the opposite page, are new and provide
for agreements with municipalities for the
services of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
There is no intention at present of enlarging
the seope of the Force, but as the R.C.M. Police
is already operating in the municipalities of
Flin Flon, Man., and Melville. Sask., it is
considered best to have definite statutory provision therefor.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I presume that agreements would be made with municipalities only
in those provinces which themselves have made
agreements with the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Force.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

This statement

was made by the Acting Minister of Justice
in another place:
The Bill will give authorization to the
Mounted Police authorities to negotiate agreements with the municipalities. At the present
time the Mounted Police may make agreements
with the provinces for the policing of those
provinces. The proposed legislation will empower the Minister, under authority of the
Governor in Council, to msake arrangements with
municipalities.
It is intended to extend to

JULY 29, 1940
municipalities the advantage of having the
Mounted Police replace local police systems.
I am informed that already the Mounted Police
are operating at Flin Flon, and in another
Western town. This legislation, therefore, will
provide the necessary authority to permit the
making of agreements not only with the provinces, but with the municipalities. At the
saine time it will provide for taking into the
Mounted Police Force those police forces already
existing in municipalities, and it will provide
for the pensions of those provincial or municipal police officials.
I am informed by the Department of Justice
that it is not the intention to develop to any
great extent the policy of making agreements
with the municipalities.
However, in view
of the fact that in one or two localities the
Mounted Police are giving service, it is desired
to have the power to extend those facilities to
other municipalities when it is thought advisable, and when circumstances justify.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, it is
all right to empower the Governor in Council
to make an arrangement with a municipal
government for the policing of the municipality, but this section goes further. It provides
that any officers and men of the municipal
police may be taken over by the Mounted
Police force and that the Mounted Police
pension benefits may be extended to such
officers and men. I am afraid that is going too
far.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend has the Bill before him, and he will
see what words are new in section 5 as
amended by the Bill. The section would read:
5. (1) The Governor in Council may enter
into arrangements with the Government of any
province of Canada or with any municipality
for the use or employment of the Force, or any
portion thereof, in aiding the administration
of justice in such province or municipality, and
in carrying into effect the laws of the legislature or municipality thereof respectively; and
may, in any such arrangement, agree upon and
determine the amount of money which shall be
paid by the province or municipality, as the
case may be, for such services of the Force.
(2) There may be included in any such
arrangement provision for the taking over by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Force of
such officers and men of any provincial or
municipal police force, respectively, as may be
required and for the extension to such officers
and men of the pension benefits provided for
officers and constables of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Force, upon such terms and
conditions, including recognition of priar service,
as may be approved by the Governor in Council
and agreed upon between the Dominion Government and the Government of any province or
between the Dominion Government and any
municipality, as the case may be.
The new words in the section give the
Governor in Council power to make with
municipalities arrangements such as hitherto
it has been permissible to make with provinces

only.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what I am objecting to. I can understand how an arrangement
may be worked out with regard to pension
benefits for a provincial police force that is
taken over by the Mounted Police. Manitoba
was, I think, the first province to have its
police force taken over, and in that case the
federal and provincial authorities were able
to figure out exactly what the province should
pay or be .paid in order ta make members of
the provincial body eligible for Mounted
Police pension rights. But this Bill widens
the scope of the Act by enabling the Dominion
Government to absorb the policemen of any
municipality into the Mounted Force and
bring them under the Mounted Force's pension
fund. If this permission applied only with
respect to new towns, like Flin Flon, where
the Mounted Force could take over virtually
from the beginning, it would be different,
but under this section the Government could
take over the police force of the city of
Winnipeg. That would mean a pretty large
pension undertaking.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It requires two
parties to make a contract, and naturally the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police would not
force the hand of any municipality. The
transfer of any municipal police body to the
Mounted Force would be done by mutual
agreement.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The feature I do not

like is the wide range of possibilities under
this section. Let us look at the picture. Suppose Ontario entered into an agreement with
the Dominion Government for the taking over
of the entire provincial police force by the
Mounted Police.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That may be done under
the law now.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But this Bill would

enable

the Dominion

Government

to

go

farther-to enter into an agreement to do
the policing for any municipality in Ontario.
That would include policing in all its details,
not with respect to criminal law alone. We
all know how varied the ordinary duties of a
policeman in a city, town or village may be.
Well, under this Bill, all such duties could be
assigned, by agreement, to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. I say the possibility is there.
The honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
states the intention is, not to widen the
activities of the Mounted Police to any such
extent, but to take over the policing in two
municipalities only, Flin Flon and one other
place.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Melville.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: That arrangement is
all right if we are assured it will remain
there, but some day you may have in charge
of the Mounted Police an officer who is
desirous of having as many thousand policemen as possible all over the country, and he
will exert all his energies to expand the Force.
I realize, of course, that the Government
stands in the way of such expansion, but you
may have a Government eager to do the
same thing; you cannot tell. It seems to me
there should be some restraint imposed on the
possible scope of this Bill.

Bill, I understand that it would not be possible
for arrangements to be made to handle the
policing of any municipality in Ontario,
because Ontario is not one of the provinces

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It docs not say so. That
can be done under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
under the old Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

That can be done

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is not so stated.
That is the conclusion I draw. The point
should be cleared up.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Under the existing
law the Government of Canada has power to
enter into an arrangement with the Government of any province, whereby the provincial
police may be taken over by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This Bill, by the insertion of the words "or with any municipality,"
extends that power so as to enable the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police to take over not
only the provincial police, but as well. the
municipal police. I think we should have
time to study this provision and ascertain
its implications and possibilities.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Flin Flon and Melville are municipalities within the provinces
that now have an arrangement for the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police to handle their
police work. Could a similar arrangement be
made, let us say, at Kirkland Lake or Sudbury?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not unless the
Dominion Government has entered into an
agreement with Ontario for the Royal Cana-

dian Mounted Police to take over the work of
the provincial police.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is that right?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Do not forget that
in every case the word "municipality" follows
the word "province."
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN "Or municipality."

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I am quite certain that
in New Brunswick the same condition exists
as in the other provinces where an arrangement has been reached between the Federal
Government and the provincial Government
under which the Mounted Police have taken
over the provincial police. In those provinces
which I have mentioned every incorporated
town employs one, two or three uniformed
policemen, and the municipalities also have a
police force. It seems to me that ultimately,
under the provisions of this section, the police,
let us say, of Moncton or Saint John or
Sackville may all be taken over and become
incorporated in the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Force. If so, it is quite possible that
the strength of local opinion would cause the
police of the various cities, towns and munici-

palities to be taken into the Mounted Police
Force and to become eligible for pension.

Brandon or any other municipality; but I am
afraid that, say, in the case of Brandon, when
the municipality makes an agreement with the
Dominion to put its police force under
the Mounted Police, members of that local
force who could not qualify under the age
limit will be exempted from the requirement
as to age and will become Mounted Police.
Apparently the Government is of the same
view, for in the very next section the amendment makes an exception as to age of such
new personnel.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Which section is that?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Section 2, on page 2. It
is because of that double set of circumstances
that I have raised the question to-night. I am
not objecting at all to the Government being
allowed to enter into an agreement with a
municipality, but I do object to its taking over
the municipal police force. I am positive those
men would not be able to qualify under the
Mounted Police regulations as to age; otherwise section 2 would not be in the Bill. With
all due respect to the men in the local police
force in any municipality or small town, my
experience in Manitoba teaches me that those
men certainly could not come within the age
limit applicable to Mounted Police.
An Hon. SENATOR: It might lower the
standard too.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, and the standard
might be lowered very materially. My objection would not apply to the police of Vancouver, Montreal, Winnipeg and other large
cities, for they are subject to certain age limits.
For instance, the members of the Winnipeg
Police Force enter at the age of twenty and
are superannuated at forty-five. I know many
municipal policemen in Manitoba who are
more than forty-five years of age; in fact
some of them have been forty-five years on
the force.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why should they not
be?
Hon. Mr. HALG: But why should they get
the benefit of superannuation provided for by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police regu-

lations?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: They would only
get the benefit of superannuation from the
time they entered the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Force.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It does not say that, and
in section 2 there is a specific exception as
to age.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Surely the standard of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is
primarily in the hands of the Government
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

and its officers, and there is no reason to
assume that that standard will be lowered
under the proposed power.

Hon. Mr. HAIG:

My honourable friend

does not get my point. When, for instance,
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police took over
the provincial police of Manitoba, some of

the provincial police had been only two or
three years on the force. They are superannuated now as Mounted Police. Why should
such an additional burden be put on the
Mounted Police pension fund? I object to
it. I arm afraid it will obtain under this
section. Týrue, if you take over the policing
of Flin Flon, where there is no local police
force, what I object to cannot happen. I
believe there are about four or five members
on the Melville police force.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If my honourable
friend will turn to page 4 he will see this
safeguard is provided:
Notwithstanding

anything in this Act, any

pension, gratuity or allowance provided for by
this Act shall be granted only with the approval
of the Governor in Council, and upon the further
condition, in the case of a member of the Force,
that it shall be granted only in consideration
of good and faithful service during the period
in respect of which it is calculated.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the other section says
that prior service on the local force must be

taken into consideration. A man may have
been on that force for forty years.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It does not say they
must take it into consideration.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But they may. I presume
they will be compelled to do so by the local
member for the constituency.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask
that these first two clauses be postponed, and
that we pass on to the ether clauses. Then,
if there are special objections to them, I shall
have the benefit of knowing what they are.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I was going to
suggest to the honourable leader that we
could discuss this Bill more profitably in the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, with
the officials of the department before us.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am afraid that
if we try to deal with the Bill in Committee
of the Whole, the process will be lengthy and
confused.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I quite agree. While
this may not be a contentious measure, our
lack of knowledge is such that we cannot deal

with it satisfactorily unless we have before us

JULY 29, 1940
proper officers of the police and of the department to inform us as to the situation. In my
opinion we can deal with this Bill better in
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will follow the
suggestion made, and will move that the
committee rise, report progress, and ask leave
to sit again.
Progress was reported.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON
BANKING AND COMMERCE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the Senate, I would move that the Bill be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
TARIFF BOARD BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 114, an Act to amend the
Tariff Board Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
a very simple one, and does not call for
lengthy discussion. Perhaps the explanation
found in the Bill itself will be sufficient. It
says:
The Bill's main provisions are as follows:
1. The salary of the chairman of the board
is reduced from $15,000 to $12,000 per annum.
The present chairman of the board agreed to
accept office at this salary. Accordingly, the
Act is made retroactive to March 25, 1940, the

date of his appointment.
2. A new provision is inserted to cover the
case of a person who was a civil servant at the
time of his appointment as a member of the
board. He is permitted to elect to continue to
be a contributor under the Civil Service
Superannuation Act, but his contributions and
benefits are based on the salary lie was receiving
in the civil service immediately before his
,appointment to be a member of the board. If
such a person makes the election lie is not
entitled to the pension provisions in subsection
one of section eight of the Act.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I just wish to say that, on the basis
of his past record, the chairman of the board
will make a very excellent officer, and his

action in accepting a $3,000 reduction of
salary is most commendable.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By leave of the
House, I move the third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL

Honourable

senators, before we adjourn, I must express
my regret at having neglected to bring to the
Senate on Thursday last an answer which I
had to a question put to me by the right
honourable 'the leader on the other side. I
had the answer on my desk, but it became
lost among other documents. It bears on the
National Registration questionnaire, which
the right honourable gentleman thought was
too cumbersome.
Instead of reading the three or four pages
I have in explanation of the situation, I would
ask leave to have it extended on Hansard as
read.
As to the matter of national registration and
the questionnaire that bas been prepared, I
desire to say that a committee representative
of every branch of government was set up under
the chairmanship of Dr. Coats, Dominion
Statistician.
This committee produced the
questionnaire which will be submitted to the
Canadian people to be answered.
The Government bas examined closely into the
work of the committee, and has adopted it.
After consultation, the Government is confident that any type of information secured as a
result of this registration can be made readily
available to any branch of the Government,
or to any industry in Canada, on short notice.
Instructions have been issued to the registrars by the Chief Registrar. Instructions by
the registrars to the deputy registrars have
also been issued. These instructions are now
all in printed form, and copies may be secured
from the Chief Registrar, Mr. Jules Castonguay.
The military departments apparently had it
in mind to conduct a registration of man-power
of the nation along lines practically identical
with what, according to the public press
announcements, the United States is going to
do at once. This would have caused two
national registrations in Canada within a short
space of time. It was felt that the two jobs

382

SENATE

could be donc simultaneously, and in less time
than would ordinarily be required to conduct
either registration.
Copies of the cards of all single men between
the ages of 19 and 45 will be available in each
province as soon as the registration is complete.
These will be kept in the provinces. They will
be broken down into military districts, so that
we shall have a list of all single men between
these ages in each of the military districts in
Canada. Ontario and Quebec each have more
than one military district, but the boundaries
of most of the military districts are the same
as the boundaries of the provinces. These cards
will be put forthwith into age groups in the
military districts, so that we shall know how
many single men of the ages of 21, 22, etc..
there are in Canada. This information will
be available to the military authorities, for use
in pursuing their policy of calling up these men
for periods of military training in Canada.
A committee is working on the formulation
of regulations with respect to the calling up,
and these regulations will be tabled as soon as
possible.
This job of registration, when viewed as the
registration of all people above the age of
16 years-male and female-in Canada, looks like
a tremendous one, but when it is broken down,
as bas been done, into local registration units
of the same size as polling divisions in a general
election, it is reduced to what should be workable proportions.
The Government is satisfied that the national
registration will be of untold benefit to the
G-overnment and to the industries of the nation.
The information secured, as outlined, will certainly be of immediate and practical use to the
military authorities.
The national registration bas nothing to do
with the military branches of the Government
nor with the military service. It is purely a
civil undertaking. The information gathered
will be used by all departments, including the
military.
Everything is being done to reduce the cost
of this undertaking to a minimum. Part of
the cost will be the expense of printing the
questionnaires, certificates of registration, advertising and other details, but the only paid
officials will be the registrar and his assistant
in eaci constituency, and the deputy registrars
in each poll. The bulk of the work is to be
clone by voluntary organizations, and literally
hundreds of thousands of voluntary workers
have to be secured.
The members of the House of Commons have
agreed to co-operate.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I move that for the time being we
suspend the first three Orders of the Day and
proceed to the fourth Order, for the second
reading- of the Unemployment Insurance Bill.
Tbe motion was agrecd to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 98, an Act to establish an
Unemployment Insurance Commission, to
provide for Insurance against Unemployment,
to establish an Employment Service, and for
other purposes related thereto.
He said: Honourable senators, I should
perhaps preface my remarks with a statement
explaining how it is that, the Bennett Gov-

383

ernment having passed an Unemployment Insurance Bill in 1935, we are now presenting a
Bill of the samne nature; and perhaps 1 should
also explain the delay which bas intervened
between 1935 and this year. 0f course, most
honourable members of the Senate are familiar
with the situation. When the 1935 measure
was introduced it was stated there was a pressing need for such legisiation. That measure
was passed, and later declared void by the
Supreme Court of Canada and the Privy
Council, on the ground that it was unconstitution-al. After the Privy Council's decision
was handed down, the Government busied
itself in an attempt to obtain support from
the provinces for a resolution addressed to
the Imperial Parliament asking for an amendment to the British North America Act whicb
would permit the Federal Government to
bring dlown a Bill of this kind. It took some
time to get the provinces to agree to that. I
think three of them stood aloof, and it was
not until recently that they ail agreed to
transfer to the Federal Government the right
to legisiate on unemploymient insurance. Then
a resolution asking the Imperial Parliament
to amend our Constitution so as to give the
Federal Government power to legisiate on
this subject was adopted in the Huse of Comnmons and the Senate, and as soon as the
Imperial Parliament passed the necessary enactment the present Bill was initiated in the
Commons.
Tbe last five years have yielded to the
parties interested in drafting this measure
considerable experience which was not available to those who had to do with the 1935
measure. Great Britain had already passed
an Act, whîch was amended more than once,
and the experience in that country and in the
United States could be drawn upon in the
preparation of this Bill. I may say that a
great deai of study bas been given to the
pro.iect, both before and since 1935. Experts
in the Department of Labour -and in the Insurance Branch bave worked togetber in trying
to perfect a statute wbich would meet the
needs of this country. As I bave already
intimated, unemployment insurance was not
a new thing in some other countries. And in
tbis country, if I am flot mistaken, my right
honourable friend (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meigben)
was instrumental in having appointed in 1919
a royal commission to study the questions of
unemployment insurance and old age pensions.
After tbe 1935 Bill was received from the
Commons it was in due course referred to
our Banking and Commerce Committee, who
gave it considerable study. The principle of
the Bill had been unanimously accepted in the
other House, and on second reading it was

384

SENATE

accepted by both sides in the Senate, though
there was a difference of opinion as to the
Dominion's right to legislate in this matter.
Outside of the constitutional question, we were
all agreed upon the importance of putting on
the Statute Book an Unemployment Insurance Act.
I will deal now with the main difference
between the 1935 measure and this one. Under
the 1935 measure there was a so-called flat rate
scheme, which provided that male adults
should contribute 25 cents a week and female
adults 21 cents a week, and the insurance
benefits for men who became unemployed
were $6 a week, and for women $5.10 a week.
This feature has been replaced by the graded
scheme and ratio rule.
Inasmuch as this
change is of some importance, I should like to
read an explanation given before the special
committee of the other House by Mr. Stangroom, of the Department of Labour. It is
to be found at page 26 of that special committee's report:
As you know, the 1935 Act adopted the flat
rate principle for contributions and benefits.
This was based pretty much on the particular
experience which grew up from the British Act
of 1911; which, in turn, grew up from trade
union experience.
Since that time there has
been a large body of experience in the United
States. South Africa and Norway adopted
graded schemes, and Germany and Italy also
had a graded scheme. All these recent plans
adopted benefits in proportion to earnings, and
therefore in proportion to the normal standards
of living of the workers. There is a fundamental problem ýarising in ýany scheme of
unemployment insurance: Can you compensate
need, or can you only compensate for something
that relates to the normal standard of living of
your worker? A man with ten children may
be earning $10 a week and a man with no
children may be earning $50 a week. It seems
that you cannot find any system of benefits that
will relate olosely to the needs of both these
groups. What you can do is to relate the contributions and benefits to the normal standard
of living of these people. In Great Britain the
Ministry of Labour in 1931, speaking before the
Gregory Commission, stated they had investigated the problem of changing their system to
a graded system. The officials of the ministry
said that they approved of it in principle, but
because of the rather distressing condition of
their fund at that time they thought it was
unwise to make the change then.
Under the 1935 Act there were eight classes
of contributions and eight of benefits, with the
addition of dependant benefits. These are just
as difficult to administer as, in fact they might
be said to be more difficult to administer than, a
scheme of contributions related directly to
benefits. Any flat benefit must be fixed at the low
earnings of any worker in any part of the country; otherwise the benefits would exceed wages.
If the benefit exceeds wages you get a tendency
to malingering; men will prefer unemployment
benefits to a job. Granted that under any ratio
rule he would decrease bis right by so doing;
but, nevertheless, there would be many who
might prefer the benefit where they could draw
Mon, Mr. DANDURAND.

it. The problem of over-insurance in Great
Britain is still very serious, and it remains
perhaps -the principal administrative difficulty.
As the cost of living rose and changed, they
had to increase their contributions and benefits,
to make their benefits total something reasonable under the circumstances; and with each
change they have found that they immediately
create in varions parts of the country, in the
low wage areas, over-insurance; that is, the
benefit is more than the normal wage of the
insured person. Some attempts have been made
to apply a "ceiling" in Great Britain, but
pressure from various groups has made it
impossible. For instance, at present there is a
Bill before the British House which suggests
an increase in contributions and benefits for
the simple reason that the cost of living bas
increased. Since the war started in Britain it
has risen soe 25 points. During the last war
they had the same experience. Benefits and
contributions were adjusted several times during
the war as the cost of living rose, so the real
value of the benefits changed considerably.
Weighting for cost of living, and the wage
index, the ratio of benefits at the 1930 rate was
eighteen and ten pence for a family of four,
lu 1914; and 47 shillings in 1919, and then later,
in 1928, it went down to thirty-one and four
pence. Thus, the flat rate bas to bo continually
adjusted to the movements of the cost of living.
If benefits are related to earnings, the average
benefit would be higher than the flat rate,
because the above-mentioned restrictions would
be removed. You have no danger of overinsurance where you never pay the full amount
of the earnings. Under the present Bill the
benefit grades from about 88 per cent of a
man's earnings in the low wage group to about
40 per cent in the high wage group. The low
wage earner is favoured in that way.
1 have said that this grading principle, which
replaces the flat rate scheme, is accompanied
by the ratio rule, which also is of considerable importance. It is to be found in section
34 of the Bill. This is the explanation of
the rule as given by the same witness:
There is one point you might care that I
should enlarge on, and that is section 34 of the
Bill, the ratio rule. Some people might feel
it looks a little complicated. The ratio rule
permits an insured person to draw benefits in
any benefit year-that is, at the time hie begins
to be unemployed--directly
related to his

employment history during the preceding five
years, and bis claims for unemployment benefit
during the preceding three years. The purpose
of extending this formula beyond the employment history of the benefit year is to make it
possible to level out fluctuations that would
otherwise occur in the period of benefit to which
he would otherwise be entitled. The benefit,
you will notice, in 34(a) is one day of benefit
for every five days' contribution paid by him
in the preceding five years, less, as in (b), one
day for every three days' benefit drawn in the
preceding three years. For example, suppose a
man worked thirty weeks during the first year
that he was covered by unemployment insurance.
He would be entitled at the end of that period,
if unemployed and if he fulfilled the other
statutory conditions, that is availability for
work and so on, to oue-fifth of the period in
insurance benefit; that is, six weeks. If he
worked thirty weeks in the following year of

JULY 30, 1940
his coverage and again became unemployed lie
would have accumulated sixty weekly contributions, one-fifth of which would be twelve weeks.
But from this would be taken one-third of the
number of benefits whichli he enjoyed the
previous year, that is two weeks. Therefore the
period of benefit to whichli he would be entitled
the second year would be ten weeks. If he had
the same employment experience of thirty weeks
the third year the benefit paid would run to
seventy-six days, and in the fourth year eightyseven d'ays. If over a period of years lie was
normally employed for thirty weeks he would
be entitled to fifteen weeks' benefit; that is,
half the time of his employment. At first
glance it looks as if lie is entitled to only onefifth of the time, but actually lie relies on
employment experience which entitles him to
one-half of his unemployment history in benefit
duration; if lie worked thirty weeks on the
average over a period of years lie would still
receive fifteen weeks' benefit, as if lie had
worked thirty weeks exactly each year. Similarly
if a man worked twenty-four weeks either
exactly or on the average lie would be entitled
to twelve weeks' benefit, if lie had built up five
years' employment history. If a man worked
thirty-six weeks in a year lie would accumulate
more benefit rights than he would be able to
use. Thirty-three weeks is about the balance.
I think I can give no better general explanation of the Bill than by reading the explanatory note, which is to be found opposite the
first page:
The Bill provides for the setting up of a
commission to administer unemployment insurance throughout Canada, for the establishment
of an Employment Service and for related
purposes. One commissioner is to be appointed
after consultation with organizations representa-

tive of workers and one after consultation with
organizations representative of employers. The
chief commissioner is to hold office for ten
years and each of the other commissioners for
five years.
The benefits of the scheme apply to all persons employed under a contract of service or
apprenticeship, with certain exceptions which
are listed in part Il of the first schedule.
Young persons under 16 years of age and persons
earning less than 90 cents in a full day cannot
draw benefits, but may accumulate benefit rights
at no cost to themselves. The Bill provides for
the inclusion of some of the excepted employments under the Bill on the recommendation of
a national advisory committee to be set up
under the Act.
An unemployment insurance fund, with the
Bank of Canada as fiscal agent is to be created.
The contributions by employers and workmen
would bring approximately equal totals over
the country. Parliament adds a grant of onefifth of the aggregate contributions made 'by
employed persons and employers, and also
assumes the cost of administration, which
moneys are to be provided through annual votes
of Parliament. Benefits are paid as of right
on fulfilment of four statutory conditions:
1. The payment of not less than 30 weekly
-or 180 daily-contributions within two years,
while in insured employment.
2. Proper presentation of the claim, and proof
of unemployment.
3. That the contributor is capable of and
available for work.

385

4. That lie has not refused to attend a course
of instruction if required.
Disqualifications for benefit include: loss of
work due to misconduet or a labour dispute in
which lie is directly involved: unwillingness to
accept suitable employment: receipt of an old
age pension: being an inmate of a public institution, or earning less than ninety cents a day
while in employment.
Contributions are graded in wage groups.
The amount of daily or weekly benefit is 34
times the average daily or weekly workman's
contribution for insured
persons without
dependents, and 40 times the average contribution for married persons mainly or wholly
maintaining one or more dependents.
No benefit is payable during the first nine
days of unemployment in a benefit year. After
that a worker may draw one payment for every
five contributions made in the previous five
years, less one payment for every three benefit
payments received in the previous three years.
The commission is to set up regional divisions
under insurance offices, and create courts of
referees, representative of the interested parties
to handle claims. Umpires and deputy umpires
appointed by the Governor in Council from
among the judges of the Exchequer Court and
the Superior Courts of the provinces, are to be
final adjudicators of claims. Provision is made
for the appointment of inspectors with power
to make examinations concerning compliance by
employers and others concerned.
The advisory committee, appointed by the
Governor in Council, will advise and assist the
commission, report on the conditions of the fund,
and make recommendations if the fund is, or
is likely to become, insufficient to discharge its
liabilities. The committee is to consist of a
chairman and from four to six members, some
of the latter being representative of the
employers and organizations of workers respectively.
This is one of the most important clauses
of the Bill, for upon the satisfactory working
of that advisory committee will depend the
maintenance of the fund in fair condition.
The commission is to organize a National
Employment Service with regional divisions and
local offices. The regional office of each division
is to be used as a clearing-house for vacancies
and applications for employment, making the
information available through local offices and
elsewhere. Loans may be granted to workers
travelling to places where work has been found.
National, regional and local committees, representative of workers and employers, are to
be set up to advise and assist the commission
on employment problems.
It will be seen from this short statement
that an effort is to be made to keep men
employed so far as there is a demand in
Canada for labour through the National
Employment Service and its local offices.
Now I come to the objections that may be
levelled at the Bill. I may say that I took
it upon myself to read the whole three days'
proceedings of the special committee of the
other House which considered this Bill, and
I have annotated the objections which were
there made. I find that most of them come

386

SENATE

from the action of the Senate in 1935. Naturally, we heard them in our own committee at
that time. My right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) then moved to enlarge
or broaden the basis of the scheme so as to
have the good risks help the less advantageous
risks. This proposed amendment created a
stir among those trades and companies who
claimed that their employees did not need
unemployment insurance, as their positions
were stable, and in consequence we had a
procession of such interested parties. We heard
the insurance companies, the trust and loan
companies, the banks, the merchants, the
departient stores, the retail trades, and the
railways, for their head office employees, who
could be counted by the thousands. The
same argument daily came to our ears: "There
is no unemployment with us. Our employees
under this scheme will pay for unemployment insurance without any corresponding
benefits to thei." My right honourable friend,
jointly with us all, listened to all those
representations, but was adamant, and I think
justly so, as the scheme, I believe, could not
be maintained by the insuring of bad risks
only.
I soon realized the necessity of the scheme.
We were told that thousands of employees in
sheltered positions were unconcerned as to
others, out in the rain, and most of them
failed to realize at the time that they were a
privileged class. While others lived in fear,
they enjoyed security; they did not know what
it meant to be turned out penniless with a wife
and children. I met many employees at that
time who, after thinking the matter over,
realized that their duty was to help carry on
the scheme by making their contributions to
it. I believe that more and more will see the
light and will do likewise in a spirit of
solidarity.
The objectors of 1935, the life insurance
companies, the Bankers' Association, the
Manufacturers' Association, the Retail Merchants' Association, the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce, drawn to our committee by
the action of my right honourable friend, all
came back last week to the House of Commons
committee, and they used the same argument
They want
that they advanced in 1935.
exemption because employment with them
is permanent.
The Canadian Manufacturers' Association
and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce
were, I think, the only ones to offer an alternative. In outline their plan is to deduct
75 cents weekly from the wages of each
employee and have the employer make a
weekly contribution of 25 cents. The dollar so
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

collected every week would be invested in
war savings stamps, and when these had
reached a value of $100 the stamps would be
exchanged for a war savings certificate bearing
interest at the current rate of 3 per cent.
Contributions would then cease. That scheme
of individual contribution was recommended
as a substitute for the pooling arrangement
under the Act of 1935 and the Bill of 1940. As
Mr. Coulter said, in speaking for the Manufacturers' Association, "All contributions by
an employee would be earmarked for that
employee." It would be everyone for himself; there would be no help for one who had
faltered through no omission of his own.
There would be no collective insurance;
simply a gradual saving by the employee himself of $100, on which *be could draw in days
of distress.
Now, I call the attention of honourable
senators to the fact that these gentlemen, the
employers, desire to have a collective scheme
replaced by the individual action of their
respective employees, who would each save
75 cents a week towards accumulating, with
the help of 25 cents a week from their employer, a fund of $100. The contribution of
25 cents a week by the employer would be
just about the average lie is called upon to
contribute under the group scheme. If 75
cents a week is paid by the employee, who
under the Bill would pay only 21 cents, the
employers are ready to pay 25 cents weekly
in order ta effect a saving for the Government
in administration; but when the $100 has
been accumulated, the employer's contribution
stops and the employee is left with a certificate entitling him to $100. Now, I aski honourable members of the Senate, what will
happen when unemployment comes upon
us and the $100 has been spent in covering the
cost of the first weeks of unemployment? I
confess I am somewhat d.isturbed at the idea
these gentlemen seem to have, that when
unemployment comes, after the war, for
instance, this $100 would be a satisfactory
stop-gap. When the accumulated $100 is
gone, who will step in? Their scheme ends
with the $100 which has been accumulated.
There will be no fund, but there will be need
for relief from some source, and that source
will be the State.

that unemployment insurance

JIJLY 30, 1940
admit that even after such a postponement
lie would still lie opposed to, unemployment
insurance. This being so, what would lie the
use, in bis case, of waiting for one, two, or
tbree years? To do so would bring him na
nearer to seeing any advantage in such a
sceeme as that brought forward in 1935, whicli
lie then candemned, or the present one, whicb
lie now condemns.
We ail recognize that when the $100 lias
vanished someane will have to corne ta, the
rescue. And the employers will lie large contributors. I admit that under the insurance
scheme they will receive no direct return
for their outlay. Nevertlieless tbey stand to
gain enormously. The depression from 1929
to 1940 bit themn very bard. They have liad
the experience of the last ten years. Unemployment affects the purchasing power of the
people, and of necessity tbe wheels of industry
slow down. Divjdends are reduced or are no
longer declared. After ten years of depression
we are now making a stupendous war effort,
and men are being enýgaged in war industries
to belp forward that effort. Wbat will the
end of tbe war mean to Canada? We are at
present at the peak of our war activity. Is
not this a time to ask these men to contribute
to a protective fond? Should not the employers
strain every nerve to meet tbe impact whicb
will follow the close of the war? If no fund
is accumulated during these years wben the
going i'i good, wages are high, and tbousands
and tbousands of men, previously unemployed,
are at work, it goes witbout saying that wlien
the war ceases there will lie no fund.
If no sucli fund exists, wbere sbali we lie?
The State will necessarily intervene as a
cusbion. Employers represent capital. The
capitalists wiIl have to furnisli the State, by
way of taxes or levies, witli tlie means to
meet sucli a contingency. I liad occasion ta
say at tbe beginning of tlie depression, in
1929 or 1930, that capitalismn was on trial.
It is still on trial. To survive under aur
system it must assure a subsistence ta all.
Its tools are bhuman beings wbo must be taken
care of. Sbould flot employers prepare for
the inevitable marrow and make the necessary
sacrifices now? 1 would urge the importance
of proceeding witliout delay. I repeat the old
saying, "Ta govern is ta foresee."
The advisory cammittee -whicb is planned
under this legisiation may suggest ta bave it
modified. I confess that, altbough we are
benefiting by the experience of many countries
wbich bave been proceeding abead of us, we are
stili in the experimental stage. Modifications
may have ta came before Parliament next
session, and perliaps the session after. But we
mu.st take time by the forelack. Tbe organiza-

and I suggest and urge tbat no time lie lost in
starting ta set up an organization ta provide
for aur unemployed when aur war industries
stop. We sbauld naw ask the employees in
stable employment, wba do not at the marnent
see that tbey stand ta gain, ta, jain in witliout

and do their duty towards tlieir neiglibour.
We sbould ask the employers, for their awn
protection, ta look farward a littie and recognize tbat it is in their own interest ta

so, and, in preparation for the day of reekaning, ta put tbeir shaulder ta the wlieel and
lielp ta carry tbe sclieme ta fruition.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Riglit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members,' this is a piece of legislation
nat only of front-rank importance, but of a
cliaracter which calîs for thorougli, conscientiaus, and tberefore prolonged cansideratian on aur part. It is not merely an
autborizing Bill; it is legisîntion whicb, if its
purpose is proper, is presented ta Parliament
as it ought ta, be presented, its principles
all plainly expressed, the machinery definitely
described, and tbe wbole selieme of aperatian
stated riglit in the liody of the measure. As
sucli, it certainly makes demands uapon aur
attention beyond anything yet presented tbis
session. Sa far we bave had natbing of
consequence, save ane or two autliorizing Bills
wbicli really were not legislation at alI. This
Bill, embadying as it does a subject and a
praposal ta whicb this House is peculiarly
suited ta give adequate and tharaugli consideration, cames ta us about the lst af August,
in about as liot a seasan as the nation lias
ever known, and wlien, necessarily, everyone
is in a liurry ta retreat from this torrid city.
My first word is ta pratest against the
treatment of this House and of Parliament in
general wbicli tlie presentation of a measure
of this character at tliis time implies. We
bave been sitting naw since thie l6th of May,
about two and a haîf montlis. For a great
part of that time this House and its cammittees, whicli are its working machinery, bave
been idle. It was a plain duty, if ever there
was one, ta initiate tbis Bill bere, and at the
beginning or near tbe beginning of this session.
It is only a few days since I reminded the
Huse that in the four sessions wlien I was,
under the late Government, leader of the
Senate, we bad nineteen bills initiated bere.
Tbe Employment and Social Insurance Bill of
1935 was not one of those, but it came ta us
fromt the utber House before the middle, of the
session, while ample time remained ta deal

388

SENATE

with it. It would have reached here earlier
but that we had before use other very important measures, which had been introduced
here. We were busy from the beginning of
that session to its close.
Why the Government should persist in the
humiliation of this House, I know not. In
five sessions we have had initiated in this
Chamber but four Government measures, two
of which were merely amendments. This one,
too, they saw fit to keep to themselves in the
other House, and it went before a committee
of that House. I have heard it suggestedI earnestly hope, net seriously-that we should
read the evidence given before that committee,
accept it as though presented to our own committee. and thus absolve ourselves from the
duty of questioning witnesses, studying their
case in their presence, dealing in minute detail
with every phase of this business measure,
hearing all interests, and intelligently deciding
all points raised.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill contains mostly a repetition of the sections of
the 1935 Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And that is
why it comes to us at the end of July instead
of in May? That is no excuse at all. To say
that because we considered this subject five
years ago we can slight it now is surely not
We
worthy of the leader of this House.
cannot slight it. Five years ago there was
serious difference of opinion as to the soundness of the measure as applicable to Canada.
I took the affirmative side. Many persons,
just as capable of coming ta sound conclusions
as I, took the other side. But even those
who took the affirmative then might sec good
reason now to take the contrary. Are we
living in 1935? We are in 1940. In 1935 we
were ascending the hill from the valley of
depression, and in Canada the outlook for
agriculture, particularly, was rather promising.
Now we are in the blackest phase of the
blackest war the world has known, and the
future outlook for agriculture is gloomy
indeed. 11e who says that because we thought
this thing through as best we could in 1935
we must now, without reconsideration, adopt
the same conclusions as we did then, is surely
not doing justice to the trust reposed in us.
Some days ago, before the Government had
given any indication they intended to bring
in an unemployment insurance measure this
session-I had no knowledge that they so
intended, but had simply read a newspaper
report that they might bring one in-I
expressed the hope that they would net do so,
and I gave my reason. It was not that I was
opposed to unemployment insurance per §e,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

even in Canada. I should not be opposed to
an unemployment insurance measure to-day if
conditions were anything like normal, or if we
could foresee the future with no more than
ordinary clearness. But at this time to proclaim that we are entering into a burdensome
new scheme of social reform is to indicate,
particularly to the United States, that we are
not very serious about the present life-anddeath struggle-that our last effort is not
being thrown into it.
However, the Bill is here, and we must do
the best we can with it. The principle of unemployment insurance and the general principle of
the Bill I ordinarily approve of. Unemployment insurance is perhaps not an exact title,
for the reason that you can really insure only
against risks ascertainable by actuarial calculation based upon the past, and unemployment is not something with respect to which
you can make actuarial calculations in the
light of experience. Yet you can at least
roughly approach an actuarial basis and do
something towards providing insurance. Insurance is a means of eliminating from this
life struggle some of that element of hazard
which man, with all his genius, has not been
able entirely to remove. Hazard enters into
the lives of us all, and there is not a day but
we have to take chances. There are the fortunate and the unfortunate. There are those
whose feet, by what appears to be, and is in
considerable measure, mere good fortune, seem
always to be in pleasant places, and there are
those who through one adversity and another,
or one perversity and another, seem to have
the hand of everybody against them. The
object of legislation should be to remove that
element so far as possible. Never can it be
wholly driven out. But legislation which has
for its purpose the reduction of the incidence
of chance and hazard in the lives of men and
women is absolutely sound. To a small degree
only can the present measure be said to provide
insurance, for in the main it imposes taxation.
However, that taxation is for an insurance purpose, which is the first and outstanding principle of the Bill, and as respects this principle
it has my support.
I am not going to suggest to the Housethis applies certainly to all those around and
behind me-that this Bill should be defeated
on the motion for second reading. I do not
think it should be. It is one of those many
measures respecting which we can give a
much better and more intelligent opinion and
render far sounder judgment after we have
been told in committee about the incidence of
their application, and their complicated effects
on various sections of the people. It is a Bill
which, above all others, should be studied in

JULY 30, 1940

committee, and thoroughly studied. My first
appeal to this House is that, notwithstanding
the season and the weather, we do not run
away from this big task which now is placed
before us. Though we believe and feel certain
we should have had an opportunity to perform
the task sooner, let us at all events perform
it now. There has not been much which we
could do this session. Let us do this, whatever
the inconvenience and the apparent hardship
to ourselves. Let us not say: "The Commons
committee found this and that. We will take
it." You might as well say: "The Commons
found such and such a thing. We will accept
their judgment." Surely we are not to be
merely a tail to the Commons kite. We are a
co-ordinate branch of Parliament, and as such
we must act at all times-early in the session,
in the middle and at the end of the session.
All that I shall say at 'the moment will
have to do with the phases of this question
which to my mind should be carefully considered in committee. I have in mind at the
moment what the leader of the House said
just before he sat down. There are many who
feel we should enact this legislation, not at
the present time, but when the war is over
and we can see the kind -of future which
appears to be ahead of us for at least some
three or four years. To this the leader of the
Government says: "No. The time to enact
unemployment insurance is when employment
is good." It is fairly good to-day. Personally, I wonder it is not better, but it is fairly
good. His argument is that if we pass the
measure now we shall create a fund. That is
true. But inasmuch as at the moment there
is a peak, a bulge, in employment, the absolute certainty is that when the cause of the
bulge is removed a cavity will appear. We
shall go from the convex to the concave, and,
however large the fund may be, it is sure to
disappear, because the larger the number of
persons employed to-day the larger will be
the number of those unemployed later. If
you establish your fund when employment is
low you do not gather in so much, but you
will not face the same drain upon the fund
later, because the proportion of contributors
who will be unemployed later will be smaller.
From the point of view of finance the argument is just as strong one way as the other.
But taking the larger view, I think this is
a time when we should well consider
whether the duties of the citizen to the
State should not be stressed, rather than
the obligations of the State towards the citizen. If democracy has failed-and certainly
in many countries it has gone down-it is
because the citizen has got the notion that
the benefits of all obligations accrued to him
and none at all to the State; that they all

389

went in the one direction. If he suffered,
it was for the State to relieve him. If he
exercised bad judgment and found things
hard, he applied at the door of the State for
help. Many a time the State, represented
in the Parliament of Canada, has come to
the rescue of people whose plight was solely
due to their own neglect and bad judgment.
To-day the burden on the State is the heaviest
in our history, and undoubtedly we ought to
consider whether we should not devote our
efforts ;to building up a healthy attitude of
the people towards the State, instead of going
further, in the face of the darkness of the
future, to convince the citizen that if he is
in need we are ready to see him through.
I should like to have seen this Bill deferred.
Who knows what will be the condition of this
country when the war is over? Distance is
the greatest master of illusion in all the
universe. We are distant from the scene of
war, our immediate surroundings are much
as they were in the days of peace, and we
think not of the consequences of these extraordinary events which are thundering and
smashing at humanity at this time. Who
knows where we shall be when we are through
this conflict? I should like to see 100 per
cent attention given to the conflict itself.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: After that is
finished, the result will be a good deal better
than if we give 95 per cent attention, and
still better than if we give only 50 per cent.
I should like to see the whole nation's energy
and mind centred on the struggle, and not
diverted by great new strokes of policy which
have really no relation to that struggle and
its results.
Other phases of the Bill will corne before
the committee. How the committee will
weigh the arguments pro and con, and the
question of time, I know not now. I hope
they will give consideration to the reflections
I have just sought to express.
The honourable leader of the House calls
attention to the resemblance between this
Bill and the measure of 1935. He does so
quite properly. It is a copy-not wholly so,
but in its main features. This Bill is on the
basis of making the fortunate in employment
assist the unfortunate. Companies, industries
and spheres of life which have very little
unemployment to contend with are required
to help those which have greater unemployment to contend with: they are all asked to
make the same contribution. That principle,
which is adopted here, we adopted in the
measure of 1935. Then we had to turn a deaf
ear to the appeals of various sections of
industry and finance who said to us: "We

390

SENATE

have hardly any unemployment.
In our
banks, for example, we have virtually none.
We keep our staffs through bad times; we
have to; and we pension them if by chance
they have to retire or are unfortunate in
health. Why should we be made to pay into
an unemployment insurance fund when we
receive no benefits?" To that kind of appeal
we have to say: "No; for no insurance scheme
can possibly exist if only the bad risks are
taken. We admit you will pay vastly more
than you will ever receive; but another
industry, the automobile industry for example,
and many seasonal industries in Canada, will
receive far more than they will pay."
On this principle was founded the Bill of
1935; on this principle the present Bill also
rests. Generally, I am in favour of it. I do
not think you can adopt a system whereby
you rate assessments in proportion to risks of
the individual sphere or section of industry.
But it is worth considering whether or not
you can modify the present principle in
such a way as to make it in the interest of a
section of industry to minimize unemployment
in that section.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You can do
that and still hold to the general principle
upon which this Bill rests. If it can be worked
out, it is very important to make it worth
while, say, for the automobile industry so to
run its factories as to maintain something like
a standard number of employees at work
throughout the year, rather than a large
number for a short time; to make it worth
while for the lumber industry, regularly a
seasonal industry, to extend its period of
employment; and the same in regard to
business. Many businesses throughout this
country-their name is legion-retain emplovees, not because of needing them at all,
but from a sense of duty towards them. If
you can embody in this Bill some sliding
scale of assessment which will make it worth
while for an industry to maintain the highest
standard of employnent, then you will have
removed one of the gravest and actually one
of the most serious objections to unemployment insurance.
I do not think it is
impossible.
I should like to have seen this Bill examined
with something like the thoroughness with
which the Workmen's Compensation Act of
Ontario was studied before that legislation was
passed. I think for two years very able men
were in contact with all labour and employer
organizations, until finally a Bill emerged
which has been a model for bills not only in
this Dominion, but also in other sections of
the world, and which undoubtedly has worked
to the great advantage of all concerned.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

So far as I can see, there is nothing impracticable about embodying a sliding-scale provision. Evidence before the committee may
show me to be wrong, but I think honourable
members will agree that we ought to explore
the situation to see if it cannot be done.
There is another feature about unemployment insurance which bothers me, and which
should be considered by the committee. All
these things are good to those immediately
affected; but I am afraid there is another
side to this question: there will be less desire
to be continuously employed and more of a
struggle on the part not only of employers
but also of employees to get out every cent
that they ever put in. All this will add to
the cost of production. It cannot possibly
do otherwise. Besides having to pay bis share
of the insurance, the employer will also have
to pay the cost of administration within his
own concern. which cost will be vastly greater
under this Bill in the respect in which it is
altered from the 1935 Bill, the employee contributing according to his wage. The employer's
bill for the taxation itself will be very great.
The employee's will be as well. Wages will
be affected by that deduction; at all events
the tendency will be to demand more. The
cost of the article produced will be increased.
The effect on cost cannot be otherwise, no
matter how we may hope.
What will happen then? First, we have to
consider consequences in our export markets.
Without export markets Canada dies. No
other country in the world depends upon them
to quite the extent that we do. Therefore
we have to be careful about adding to cost
of production. We may be able to stand some
additional cost. and if we can we ought to, for
the benefit of the Treasurv, looking to conditions of unemployment 'which may come.
But from another standpoint I want to present
the incidence of this added cost. There is one
great ciass of our population which gets
nothing out of this insurance fund at all, and
that is agriculture.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You cannot
insure agriculture. Agriculture bas to pay its
share of all that the State supplies: $6,000,000
for administration-I shall be happy if it is
kept within that figure-and $14,000,000 for
the insurance fund. That $20,000,000 is spread
over agriculture as over every other section
of taxpayers in this Dominion. But more, the
augmented cost of production is added necessarily to what the agriculturist pays for
products of the factory. There is no escape.
So in two ways you are making the burden
of agriculture heavier at this time. In this
respect the Bill differs in its incidence from

JULY 30, 1940
the Bill of 1935. Then agriculture faced
a more promising time. Now, 1 thinc, the
universal judgment of the House is that it
faces a blacker time. We depend upon
exports, but no other section of our people
depends upon exports so vitally as do the
people engaged in agriculture. Where shall
we be if our wheat exports cease, if the absorbing power of the world disappears, if-which
God forbid-the British market for our bacon
is eut off ? There is danger at least of a
severe contraction of the farmer's market in
this Dominion. At this moment we come along
and add to bis burden in a very important
way by a scheme of social reform.
Ail these subjects should be considered
by the committee, and considered very carefully. I do not think the country generally
is in a hurry for this measure. I know
my communications have been varied. I have
had some in favour of the Bill, but I have
had two or three against it for every one
in its favour. With other members probably
the proportion would be different. But there
is no appeal that is universal or anything
like unanimous for its immediate passing. I beg of the Government-I know it
intends to submit the Bill to committee-that
it invite and thoroughly review submissions
to that committee by earnest, conscientious
men, whether they appeared before us in 1935
or flot, and whether they were before the
Commons Committee recently or were not.
I know ail will be given a courteous hearing
at the hands of our committee. I suggest
that we do not hurry our consideration of
this Bill merely because we are hot and are
eager to be at home. As respects flot only the
fate of the Bill, itself, but also the various
phases which I have sought to expound, and
those which others will think of, let us
approach the decision not in any party spirit.I know we shahl not-but as citizens entrusted
with a grave duty, and as parliamentarians
who have at heart the honour of the body
to which they belong.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move, seconded
by the Right Hon. Mr. Graham, that this
Bil be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
In making this motion I would point out

to honourable senators, for perhaps the hundredth time, that those who, are not members
of the Banking and Commerce Committee
should feel as much at home in the committee as those who sit around the table,

391

because aIl may participate in the discussions
and put questions.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the leader
of the Government if it is possible to get a
larger room for the committee? The one in
wbich we regularly meet is smnall and the
ventilation is not good. If all who want to
hear the evidence are to attend, I would
suggest there should be a bigger room.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
what we can obtain, but I shahl make an
effort to meet the wishes of my honourable
friend.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I am informed that the representatives of
three different organizations are already either
here or on their way here, and desire to be
heard on this Unemployment Insurance Bill.
If that is the case, as I am assured it is, we
might make some progress by sitting to-night.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I give my assent
to that idea.
DEBTS DUE TO THE CROWN BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING-BILL
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND

moved the

third reading of Bihl 99, an Act to amend
an Act respecting debts due to the Crown.
He said: Honourabie senators will remember
that we had this Bihl before us last week. I
need not refer to the discussion we had on
the Bill, which asks for authorization to colleet
fromn Dominion employees residing in Manitoba amounts due by thema to the province.
Two or three questions arose. The question
of the constitutionality of the Bihl was one
which brought an opinion from our Law Clerk
and another from Mr. Fraser Elliott, Commissioner of Income Tax. Another question
raised was as to the possibility of the Government allowing creditors to garnish Dominion
employees for their debts. This question was
referred to the Minister, from whomn I have
the following statement:
The Government bas given consideration to
the suggestion made in the Senate that the
exemption from garnishee proceedings enjoyed
hy civil servants he removed. The removal of
this exemption could flot be effected by alteration of the Bill, whieh bas passed the House of
Commons and is now before the Senate. A new
Bihl would be required.
The abolition of a long established principle,
sucb as the one that the Crown is not answerable to a garnishee summons, should not be
taken without further consideration than je
possible at this stage of the session. It is, I
think, admitted that the situation which the

SENATE
Bill is desoignel to meet is an acute one which
It is therefore sugested
mrust be remedied.
that without trying to cover the nuch broader
field. Parliamsent should pass the Bill.

It was. I thinik, suggested that conditions in
Ottawa were unsatisfactory and that merchants
should be afforded the remedy by way of

garnislee which they have against debtors other
than civil servants. The newspapers contained
the reports of several interviews with Ottawa
merchants at the end of last week which would
indicate that they have not much fault to find
with conditions as they exist.
Moreover, the information I obtained is that
there is a procedure known as judgment sumomons which can now be used against civil
servant debtors, whicl is virtually as effective
as proceedings by way of garnishment would be.

I do not know whether my right honourable
friend is familiar with that procedure.
What the situation is in other provinces, I
do not know. In this day of high-pressure
salesnanship

and

encouragement

to the publie

to load themselves up with debts as a result
of instalment buying not only of durable goods,
but of non-durable goods as well, there is
something to be said for the view that merchants
should be careful in the degree of pressure
which they exert on civil servants to buy on

credit. If garnishee proceedings would give
then a more certain way of getting thiemselves
paid ont of their salaries, it might be in this
way undesirable. It must be remembered that
civil servants are different from most employees
in that there is a high degree of certainty about
their tenure. The Crown, whom they serve,
is a good paynaster, and a method by which
the Crown wouil become virtually the rollector
for the private creditor would remove all brakes
upon the efforts of those selling goods to get
civil servants into debt to them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would prefer it, however, if, instead of
going into these details, the Senate be invited
to pass tise existing legislation, as it meets a
particular sitnation and is good as far as it
goes, leaving the broader question to be considered when there is more time for giving it
consideration.
Regarding tie other point raised by certain
honourable senators, that the Crown Debts Act
should not be applied at all unless a judgment
is first obtained against debtors, I may say
that the amount owed by way of taxes is a
little different from most other debts in that
it is susceptible of exact determination, and
most taxing statutes place the amount beyond

dispute after a certain stage.
The Crown Debts Act bas

always

been

administered with the greatest care and sense

of responsibility by the Department of Justice.
In the thousand odd cases in Manitoba, it
would involve tremendous expense to require
writs to be issued and judgments obtained before
application of the Act.
To amend tise Crown Debts Act in this way
woul1d be rendering a great disservice to the
debtors, without, so far as I car see, benefiting
anybody. except possibly the legal profession
and perhaps some officials connected with the
courts.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The conclusion to be drawn is that, since
we admit the obligation of the employee of
the Crown to pay his debts, we should allow
this Bill to pass, thus alleviating the situation in the province of Manitoba, and leave
the question of garnishee generally throughout
the country to be raised in the future.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: May I ask what department this cornes from?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Department
of Finance; Mr. Ilsley.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the name of J. L. Ilsley is
appended to that memorandum, but my regard
for his clear mind is such that I cannot believe
he is its real parent.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Let us analyse it. Honourable members of this House
who spoke the other day could sec no reason
why these delinquents in Manitoba should
refuse to pay their honest debts, as established
by the courts of the land, and be protected
frorn garnishment. Nor could they sec why
other debtors among the civil servants of
Canada should be protected from garnishment.
The memorandum says the reasons are these:
First, the subject is too big for us to deal
with at this stage of the session. In other
words, to decide whether a civil servant
should be in a privileged position, and thereby
helped to get out of paying his debts, is too
big a subject for us to review now, though
unemployment insurance is just an ordinary,
trivial measure and we can put it through.
What is so big about this garnishment
question I do not know. It affects a lot of
votes. So far as I am concerned, they are
gone anyway, and I do not need them. But
as a matter of right or wrong, what is big about
this question, or what is difficult?
The next reason given is this: Unless, by
shutting off garnishment proceedings, you
protect the civil servants from having to pay
their debts, these poor civil servants will be
victims of high-pressure salesmanship. That
is to say, the civil servants of Canada are
particularly incompetent to look after themselves. They are particularly vulnerable to

fear .the salesman may get near its wards,
these poor civil servants. The memorandum
actually sets them aside as less competent to
manage their own affairs than is the average
citizen of Canada. If I thought Mr. flsley
was the author of the memorandum, I would
not use the expression: what utter nonsense!
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What utter
nonsense! The civil servants are in a preferred position in that their creditor always
pays. In that respect they are in a better
position than any other citizens of this
country. They run no risk at all. Yet the
Minister of the Crown tells us, or rather he
permits another to tell us through him, that
we cannot expose these poor chaps to the
rigours of high-pressure salesmanship. We have
to stand around them and protect them, and
if they do fall victims we must save them
from being forced to pay debts they themselves incurred.
What is the last reason? It is that it will
be expensive for the Manitoba Government
to take out judgments against these men.
Does anyone imagine that if the right of
garnishment is established it will ever be
necessary to take out judgments? Why, a
civil servant would be a fool to continue his
resistance to that point, for he would only
have to pay the costs in addition. It will not
be necessary to serve garnishments if we
remove the protection which these people
have forfeited and to which they have
definitely shown they have no right at all.
It is also said, by way of parenthesis, that
the change in the law might be of some help
to lawyers, as it would lead to more lawsuits.
Why any lawyer would defend an action to
which there is no defence, I cannot imagine.
The Privy Couneil has said there is no defence.
Our Parliamentary Counsel has prepared
amendments to this Bill which would remove
any protection now existing. I think I should
say to the House that he doubts whether the
assumption that the Crown cannot be garnisheed is correct. But assuming that it is
correct-as I think we should, for that has
always been assumed-the present measure
offers a fitting opportunity to make a step
towards equality of rights throughout our
Dominion-towards the removal of privilege,
the placing of all citizens on the same basis
and the making of every man answerable for
his own obligations. Why should we not do
that now? I suggest to the leader of the
House that this Bill be referred to a committee-to the Banking and Commerce Committee, if it is not too busy-and that we try

393

to make a good job of amending the law. Let
us have at least that to our credit this
session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend has not noticed the expressed
opinion that we should have to prepare another
Bill; that we could not achieve his object
with this one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no;
Parliamentary Counsel does not seem to be
of that view, for he has provided amendments
which he says will do what we have in mind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is something that surprises me in this discussion. My
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) and other able lawyers have in the
past been in charge of departments and must
have had occasion to learn of claims being
made against employees under them, yet until
the present time it never occurred to them
that every creditor of a civil servant should
have the right to garnishee. In the tradition
which bas been uniformly accepted since
1867, to the effect that the Crown should not
be sued, there must be some principle that
should be respected. I know that occasionally
we have discussed the question of the right
to sue our Board of Transport Commissioners,
our Harbour Commissioners and other such
bodies. I have the impression that without a
fiat no suit could be brought against the
Intercolonial Railway when it was administered
directly by the Government. It is easy to
picture what it meant to someone living
hundreds of miles away from here, who had
grounds for a small suit against the Intercolonial, but could not bring action in the
courts of his own district, because it was
necessary to obtain a fiat. For fifty years it
has seemed to me that in this principle of the
State refusing to be sued there is something
which we have to look upon with awe.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On a garnishment the State is not sued.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tically it comes to that.

No, but prac-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think the same
principle is involved in refusing to permit a
creditor to garnishee a civil servant.. I have
no objection to examination of this Bill by
a small committee, but I wonder what it will
lead us to. I have an impression that we
should first try to get the Government to
consider this new request which has been made
here. It is not at all certain that we should

SENATE
get very far if we amended the Bill in the
way indicated by rny right honourable friend,
for the Government has authorized the
Minister of Finance to declare that the proposed change in the law is a matter that could
not be taken up at this time. I leave it at
that. My right honourable friend is free to
move, if he so desires, that a committee be
formed for the purpose of amending this Bill
in the sense he indicates, but I cannot accept
the responsibility of so moving.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators,
would it be possible to refer this Bill to our
Railway Committee? I noticed in the Press
[hat an honourable member of another place
complained bitterly of an attack on civil
servants of this country. There is no such
attack. If a man works for the Canadian
Pacifia Railway or the Canadian National
or any other large corporation and does
not pay his bills, his wages can be garnisheed.
A large number of people in Winnipeg are
employed on the railways, but I doubt if
there are more than two or three garnishments
against railway workers there in a month.
They all know they are not protected; so
they make their payments.
I have no grudge at all against civil servants,
but I strongly protest because people employed
by the Crown-including senators, if you
will-are not required to pay their debts to
the extent of their ability. I come from the
very place where the row over this thing
started, the city of Winnipeg, and it started
on account of the two per cent wage tax in
Manitoba.
Hon. Mr.. HUGESSEN: They like a fight
out there.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I admit we are a fighting
people.
I suggest that in all fairness this Bill sehould
be referred to the Committee on Railways.
Most of the members of that committee are
not on the Banking and Commerce Committee,
which is busy with the Unemployment Insurance Bill. We shall be here for a couple of
days more, in any event, and in that time
the Railway Committee could hear representatives of the Civil Service. Even if the
committee reported the Bill just as it is,
something would have been gained by that
reference. I am persuaded that 95 per cent
of the civil servants of the country pay their
debts on the nail. I move that the Bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs aud Harbours.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable senators, I
am not a member of that committee, and
there is one thing I should like to point out
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

here. If the principle of the Bill is to be
adopted, as it
now is, there should be, I
ihink, an amendment to provide against a
contingency, which I shall explain. The Bill
sets no limit to the proportion of a debt that
the Minister may deduct from the weekly or
monthly wages or salary of a civil servant.
Suppose in a certain case the debt was $100.
If that were deducted in one surn from a
civil servant's monthly salary, it might leave
very little for hirm to live on until he got
his next cheque.
In every province of
Canada, although garnishment of wages and
salaries is allowed by statute or by rules of
the court, a limitation is placed on the amount
that can be taken from a man's weekly or
monthly wages.
I think that in Quebec,
under the Lacombe law, up to fifteen per
cent of the weekly or monthly wages can be
garnisheed, but I am speaking only from
amemory. I know that in Ontario there is a
definite limit to the amount that can be
garnisheed.
If we do change the law to
remove the present immunity of civil servants from garnishment, it would be very
unfair that any of them should be liable to
a large deduction from salary in any one
month, and I think an amendment should be
inserted to provide against that contingency.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

the Railway Committee would be the proper

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 73, an Act respecting Treachery.
He said: Last night we discussed this Bill,
and, in case my right honourable friend

JULY 30, 1940
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) might desire to
make some remarks on it, we postponed the
motion for third reading until to-day.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I have
studied the Bill, but not with the thoroughness
1 should have liked. Instinctively I am all
for the Bill. It would be a pretty severe Bill
that would be too severe to suit me at a time
like this, and the better it provides for prompt
but judicious examination of the guilt or
innocence of an accused person, the better the
Bill will be. It is some weeks since I read the
Bill, and I am not clear whether it is
permanent or is applicable to the war period
only.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The last section
says:
This Act shall expire on the issue of the
second of the two proclamations specified in
section two of the War Measures Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was under
that impression. In the circumstances I do
not wish to offer any opposition at all to the
measure.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from July 25 the
adjourned debate on the motion for second
reading of Bill 31, an Act to amend the
Soldier Settlement Act.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, last week we discussed this Bill at
length. I do not know whether my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
recalls that we have a grown-up child called
the Soldier Settlement Act, which for a
number of years has reappeared before us
periodically. This Bill purports to amend for
the tenth time the Soldier Settlement Act by
repealing section 57 of chapter 188 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, and substituting therefor this section:
From all sales and grants of land made by
the board, other than land acquired by the
board by purchase for resale and sold and
granted to settlers, all mines and minerals
shall be and shall be deemed to have been
preserved whether or not the instrument of
sale or grant so specifies, and may with the
approval of the Minister be sold, leased,
exchanged or otherwise disposed of by the
board under such terms as may be determined
by the Minister, and the moneys realized thereby
shall be remitted to the Receiver General to the
credit of the Soldier Land Settlement Assurance
Fund.
The provisions of this section shall take
effect as on and from the seventh day of July,
1919, and shall be deemed to have been in
operation on and from that date.

The explanatory notes follow:
Section 57 of the Soldier Settlement Act as
it stands specially reserves mines and minerals
underlying soldier settlement lands, and no
provision is made for their disposal.
The purpose of the amendment is to enable
the Director of Soldier Settlement to grant to
the original soldier settler the mines and
minerals acquired with the land, and also to
enable the Director, with the approval of the
Minister, to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of
mines and minerals relating to lands not under
purchase contract by an original soldier settler.
I have obtained from the Department of
Mines and Resources a memorandum explaining the situation. As my right honourable
friend was at the head of the department
when this legislation was enacted in 1919, the
memorandum may refresh his memory.
When the Soldier Settlement Act was passed
in 1919 Mr. Meighen set out (see page 3859
of Hansard, 1919) the method adopted in buying
and reselling lands to soldiers as follows:
Then the writer cites my right honourable
friend as he spoke in the House of Commons:
"We do buy land and resell it to soldiers,
but the plan of operation is to allow the soldier
to select his land first-not from the land we
own, but wherever be wants it. He selects his
farm, ho comes to an arrangement as to what
he is prepared to pay, and then the office of
the board is, through its inspector, to see that
he is not paying too much, and, if necessary, to
have the price reduced before the board will
itself pnrchsase the land. The price having been
brought down to a satisfactory basis, the board
buys the land for the soldier and accompanies

the purchase by a resale agreement to him."
That is the situation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
common sense.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
as agent for the soldier.

And it is

The Board acts

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Section 2, subsection 1, defined "land" as
follows:
"'Land' or 'lands' includes granted or ungranted Dominion, provincial or private lands,
and real or immovable property, messuages,
lands, tenements and hereditaments of any
tenure, and real rights, easements and servitudes, streams, watercourses, waters, roads and
ways, and all rights or interests in, or over,
or arising out of, and all charges upon, land or
lands as herein defined."
Section 16 of the Act authorized the board
to sell and dispose of lands acquired for the
settlers and provides as follows:
"(a) Where the parcel to be sold bas been
separately acquired the sale price shall be the
cost of the parcel to the board."
That is, when the soldier has repaid to the
board he gets all that the board got in purchasing the land for him.

SENATE
Section 57 of the Act, which is now being
repealed, reads as follows:
"From all sales and grants of land made by
the board, all mines and minerals shall be and
shall be deemed to have been reserved, whether
or not the instrument of sale or grant so
specifies, and as repects any contract or agreement made by it with respect to land it shall
not be deemed ta have thereby impliedly covenanted or agreed ta grant, sell or convey any
mines or minerals whatever."
There is undoubtedly a conflict between sections 16 and 57.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
think there is.

I do not

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The memorandum continues:
Keeping in mind that in 1919 the lands in
the Prairie Provinces were still being administered by the Dominion and that the title to the
minerals still remained in the Crown except in
those cases where the early grants included
thein, it is fair to assume that section 57 applied
to such lands only and not to those private
lands where the title to the minerals had passed
from the Crown. It is suggested that section
57 was put in the Act for the purpose of making
sure that in all conveyances of lands which had
not been alienated by the Crown previously, the
under-rights would be reserved, thus conforming
to the policy adoptedi many years before, when
the mineral rights were reserved when Dominion
lands were granted.
To give section 57 a different interpretation
woul be to defeat the intention of section
16 (a).
It is interesting to note
ic following
clauses in the standard fonn of Agreement for
Sale of land (adopted shortly after the Act
was passed):
"14. Tiis agreement of sale is given and
received under the provisions of The Soldier
Settlenient Act, 1919, and any amendments now
made or which may bereafter bie made thereto,
and of any Soldier Settlement Act of Canada
hereafter passed and of any regulations made
or which may be made under any Soldier
Settlement Act of Canada which can or may
be applicable hereto, shall apply to and form
a part lereof as if actually incorporated and
embodied herein and the board and the purclaser shall be entitled to the benefits and
privileges conferred and subject to the duties
and liabilities imposed by the said Act and
amendnents thereto, or by any subsequent Act
supplanting or supplementing the said Act or
by any regulations made under such Act.
"15. In consideration whereof, and on payment ta the board of the said sums of money
and interest thereon punîctually at the times
fixed, and on performance of the conditions
aforesaid, the board agrees with the purchaser
to immediately thereupon convey te the purchaser, in fee simple, the said land, free from
all encumbrances, but subject to the reservations,
limitations, provisions and conditions contained
and expressed in the original grant from the
Crown."
"In

the original grant from the Crown."

Right

Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The

Yes.
memoran-

The above clauses should be compared with
clause 14 of the standard Agreement of Sale
of lands which had reverted to the board and
were being resold.
"14. It is agreed that upon punctual payment by the purchaser of all moneys hereby by
him agreed to be paid, and upon strict performance of all and singular the aforesaid provisions,
conditions and agreements, and upon the surrender of this contract, he shall be entitled to
a conveyance of the said land in fee simple free
from all encumbrances other than such as may
have resulted through the act and neglect of
the purchaser, but subject to all reservations,
limitations, provisos and conditions contained
or expressed in the original grant from the
Crown and excepting and reserving thereout
and therefrom all mines and minerals (which
without restricting the generalities thereof shall
be deemed to include all gas and petroleum)."
It would seem to be quite clear uîpon reading
section 16 of the Act that it was never the
intention of Parlianient that in connection with
the sale of lands purchased by the board and
resold to soldiers, the Crown should reserve
any interes-t for its own benefit. In the case
of private lands selected by tle soldier, the
transaction between himself and the board was
in flic nature of a loan by the latter. If the
board, inîstead of taking title in his name, hai
taken a mortgage from the soldier and the
soldier hîad paid up his loan, the question of the
reservation of mineral rights wouîld not have
arisen.
If, for instance, the soldier hîad borrowed the money, say from the Canadian Farm
Loan Board or from any private lending coinpany, when ihe hîad paid up bis loaii lie would
receive back all his equity in the property.
Ta put it another way, tc Bill is to perinit
the board to give to the soldier all the security
it held for the repayment of the loan it had
made.
While it is true that soldiers for whon the
board puirchased private lands, the title to
which included the mineral rights, were more
fortunate than those wlho acquired land without
the amineral rights, it is suggested that they are
no more fortunate than other soldier settlers
whose lands, by reason of their locality or
otherwise, may have greatly increased in price.
If the board should now retain all the mineral
rights, it would in some instances be making
a profit out of the lands purchased for soldier
settlers, which is clearly not the intention of
section 16. because in suci instances it would
not be selling to the settler the land at the
price it cost the board.
The policy of the board in carrying out the
spirit of section 16, namely, of conveying to
the settler all tue land it acquired for him, is
not a new policy and was recognized as far back
as the year 1935, whîen the Government of that
day issued a Crown grant of mineral rights to
a soldier settler for a nominal consideration.
Several other grants have been issued since

possible to deal with all thc other mineral rigbts
in the same way. However, the Bill will permit
the board to transfer them by means of a simple
conveyance:
(a)
to the soldier settler when
entitled, and (b) when not entitled, to anyone
who may wish to purchase them. In such cases
the board will get the benefit of the sale.
It is estimated that there are 1,200 cases
where soldier settlers have repaid their loans
and the board has reserved the mines and
minerals, which now stand in its name.

JULY 30, 1940
Yet it would seem as if they belonged to the
soldier, since the land was bought for him.
There are 8,606 active soldier settler accounts,
and of these there are approximately 2,700 cases
wbere the board acquired by purchase the mines
and minerals with the land. In perhaps only
a very few instances bas the value of such
mineral rights been raised or become an important issue. In fact, it has been found that
within the boundaries of the proven ail area in
Alberta tlere are only two active soldier settler
accounîts. 'lie reservation of the mineral rights
by the board has in some cases, however, caused
the soldier a definite hardship. In one particular
instance in Ontario a soldier settler who had
paid his loan in full and acquired his titile to
the land, the minerals having been reserved,
entered into an agreement of sale to sell the
land to a third party. The latter found out
that the settler did not own the mineral rights,
and is endeavouring to rescind the contract on
the ground that the settler cannot convey the
full and complete title.
If my right honourable friend desires to
examine more closely the fairly long statement
which I have read, I will not move that second
reading be given now.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I have
listened to the statement, which is really an
excellent one, and argues the matter from the
standpoint of the measure as thoroughly as it
could be argued. But I still do not agree
with it. I cannot see the slightest contradiction in the legislation. The legislation defines
land as including easements, hereditaments,
roads, streams, and so on, and rights in the
land. Rights in the land do not necessarily
include properties under the land. I would
say that even though the word "in" is used,
the principle of ejusdem generis must apply;
it includes everything of the nature of these
things which have been described. Then the
legislation says you are conveying to the
settlerHon.
settler.

Mr. DANDURAND:

The

original

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes-it says
you convey only the land named and you
reserve the mines and minerals. So, though
the board may have got them, it does not
convey them. It is forbidden by the Act to
do so. The Act does not restrict the board
to the cases of Dominion lands; it makes this
prohibition apply to every single case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But what does
my right honourable friend say to this argument? The soldier selected a piece of land.
Then, instead of buying it outright, being
unable to do so, lie went to the board and
said, "I want this piece of land and will pay
so much for it." The board protected him
by seeing that the price was fair, and proceeded to arrange with him for repayment.
The board was then acting as agent of the
soldier.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: But under a law that

contained a certain provision.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But wait

a

moment. The board bought the piece of land

for the soldier. When he had fulfilled his
obligation and repaid to the last cent, he
asked for his title.

The board takes it for

granted that it cannot take away from the
title, but must give him anything that it
received for him. It received for him a piece

of land. The board says: "So much was paid
for that piece of land. The soldier has repaid
the amount the board paid for him, and has
fulfilled all his obligations." Is there anything which would indicate that the board was
to make any profit out of that transaction?

If it is to retain the subsoil-the oil and the
coal-and transfer only the surface of the
land, then the Crown has made money, or
has not returned to the soldier the piece of

land lie bought from the party who had the
full rights of the subsoil. The board says:
"We are acting as agents. We buy for this
soldier, and we tell him that he can repay
under certain conditions, and when lie has
done so, lie will be entitled to the piece of
land that lie bought." But when that point is
reached you would have the board say: "Oh,
no, we will not give you back all that we
bought for you. There is a valuable oil field
under your land.

We will retain it and will

not hand over the property as we bought it
for you."
I do not like to press my right honourable

friend to accept this amendment without his
full concurrence, but I think that if he will
ponder over the situation lie will come to the
conclusion that the amendment is a fair one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
doubt the good faith of the officer who wrote
that memorandum. He is an able officer, whoever lie is. But I do not think the Minister
has the history of this thing right. As a
matter of fact, the Crown bought the land
and paid cash for it, for the purpose of sale
to the soldier. The object of the procedure
followed was simply that the soldier might
be satisfied with the special piece sold to him.
That is why the method was adopted of having the soldier select the land. The Minister
says that the soldier bought it, the Soldier
Settlement Board acting for the Crown, and
that the soldier can say to the board, "I want
that land and everything I bought." But
the soldier did not buy the land. The Crown
bought it and resold it to him, and he cannot
say to the Crown or to the Soldier Settlement Board-the two are synonymous: "I

SENATE
want everything you bought. You bought that
as my agent." That is not true. He selected
it for the Crown to buy, but under a special
law which said, "Whatever the Crown may
buy, it shall sell to the soldier only the land
itself and not the mines and minerals."
Now, why did the law say that? It was
for this reason. We knew the soldiers would
be selecting some Crown lands, and in such
cases, we knew, they could not get the mines
and minerals.
the

That is
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
true, but we knew some soldiers would be
selecting Crown lands and would not get the
minerals. None of them would be thinking
about mines and minerals at all. We did
not want to be in the position of conveying
mines and minerals to one class who happened
to pick this land or that, and of having to
deny them to another class; so we provided in
our law that nobody should get the mines and
minerals.
The Minister says, "We make money out
of that fellow." We do not. He bought under
a special law, and knew what he was buying.
If we do make something out of the mines
and minerals reserved, it will be a mere bagatelle compared with what we lose on the whole
plan. I cannot be certain, but I think this
very subject was discussed in the House of
Commons long years ago, and I think I took
part in the discussion and showed that there
might be some recovery along this line.
lowever, if other honourable members do
not feel as I do, I am not going to press the
matter further. I think the Crown is giv ing
up as a sheer gift something which the soldier
never intended to buy, and did not buy, and
which the Act forbade him to buy; and the
Crown has now very little of the treasures
of this world to give up.
I realize that

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But we are discussing it from this narrow point of view.
A soldier selected a piece of land that had
left the possession of the Crown and was in
the hands of an individual, and the Crown
had abandoned its right to the minerals. One
could fairly argue that the Crown had been
paid for them, or had got an enhanced value.
The Crown had dispossessed itself of the
land. The land had passed to A, and the
soldier, B, said, "I will take that piece of
land." That carried with it the minerals, and
if he had paid out of his own ,pocket there
would have been no question. He got from
a private individual the rights that had been
abandoned or sold by the Crown. I think that
under those circumstances he was entitled
to treat the board as an agent that bought
for him, as was said by my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) when he
explained the situation to the House of
Commons, and that handed him, when he
had discharged all his obligations, the property
so bought.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In my judgment there
is no question at all as to what the intent
of Parliament was, so far as these mineral

rights were concerned.
would show very clearly what that intent was,
and it might be worth while to have the matter
inquired into further. It is not correct to
say that the soldier actually bought the land

the law,
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -because
under which the soldier was buying, specifically
provided that when he got his title the
mineral rights should be reserved to the Crown.
So it is incorrect to argue that the board was
merely the agent of the soldier and bought
for him everything above and below the
ground. In actual practice, what happened?
The soldier never thought of the mineral
rights at all. He was interested in the soil

JULY 30, 1940
out -of which he intended to make a living.
The Act provided that the board should
buy a farm for him to work, and, I repeat, it
specifically stated that when the time came for
him to get his title he should not get title to
the minerals. I know that the thing can be
argued pro and con, ad infinitum, without
our reaching any conclusion. The department
takes one view and some of us take the other.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: When
shall the Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. COTE: Does the House not think
this Bill should go to a committee? If what
has been said by the honourable senator from
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) is true, a rather
strong argument made by the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) falls to the
ground. The matter is one which I think
many of us would like to see investigated
before third reading is given. The honourable
senator from Saltcoats has said that when the
board purchased land for a settler the mineral
rights were not included, because the vendor
did not own them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes, the
vendor owned the mineral rights. The Crown
had divested itself of them.
Hon. Mr. COTE: In some cases it did, and
in some cases it did not. The vendor could
not sell the mineral rights if they were reserved
to the Crown. Under the proposed amendment, in the case of purchase of land from a
vendor who could not sell the mineral rights
because they were held by the Crown, it would
seem that the board could now transfer these
rights to the settler. This certainly would
not be right, because it is not possible to argue
that the settler expected to have the mineral
rights.
Here is another point. Even if we agree
with the honourable leader's argument that
in the case where the board purchased land
with its mineral rights for a certain price
and resold the land to a settler at the same
price, the settler could expect to get everything the board bought, including the mineral
rights, that argument would apply only to
the original settler.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That is what
the Act says.
Hon. Mr. COTE: But it would not apply
to a resale. I understand that in a great
many cases the farms have been taken back
by the board and resold, and the original
settlers are no longer on them.

399

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is the
original settler who has paid all his obligations.
Hon. Mr. COTE: The law uses the term
"settlers."
It is not limited to original
settlers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
You will find
that expression there.
Hon. Mr. COTE: If it is there, my second
point is answered.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I hesitate to
move third reading now. I am agreeable to
having the Bill sent to a committee. to give
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) an opportunity to meet the legal
adviser of the department. I have read with
considerable interest the statement from the
department, and it seemed they had made a
very clear case in favour of the original
settlers for whom they had acted as agent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They did
not act as agent at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think that
is what my right honourable friend himself
said.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, I did
not. They did not act as agent at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Here is what
my right honourable friend said in 1919:
We do buy land and resell it to soldiers,
but the plan of operation is to allow the soldier
to select his land first-not from the land we
own, but wherever he wants it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He selects his farm, he comes to an arrangement as to what he is prepared to pay, and
then the office of the board is, through its
inspector, to see that he is not paying too much
and, if necessary, to have the price reduced
before the board will itself purchase the land.
The price having been brought down to a satis-

faetory basis, the board buys the land for the

soldier and accompanies the purchase by a resale
agreement to him.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Surely this
means that the settler gets exactly what the
board bought for him, not merely haIf of it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He gets what
the Act says.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The board supplies the money for the purchase of a farm,
because the soldier settler has not the necessary
amount in his pocket, and it says to him:
"You may reimburse us by instalments, and
when you have completed them, the property
will be yours." Surely it was not in my right
honourable friend's mind that the board
should make any money by the transaction.

Arrangement Act, 1934.

to Bill 25,
Creditors

This is a question on which there was a
division of opinion in both Houses.
The
House of Commons, in appointing managers,
chose all three of them from among the
majority in that House, a very considerable majority, which was opposed to the
amendment. That seemed to me to make it
essential that the three managers to be
appointed by the Senate should all be chosen
from among the majority in this House.
Otherwise there would at once be a division
in the conference of four to two.
This
accounts for all three managers for this House
being chosen fram the majority.
As to the majority in this House, I think
every member but one on this side voted for
the amendment. as did also a substantial
number of the other side. The three chosen
are all from this side. I simply want to make
it clear that I was quite willing, and so
expressed myself to the leader of the House,
that one be chosen from among those on the
other side who supported the amendment.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: In the House of
Commons were the managers chosen from
both sides?

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved:
Resolved that a message be sent to the House
of Commons to acquaint that House that the
Senate accedes to its request for a Free Conference with the Senate for the purpose of
considering a certain amendment made by the
Senate to Bill 25, intituled: "An Act to amend
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934,"
to which the flouse of Commons has disagreed,
and upon which the Senate insists.
That the Senate has appointed the Honourable
Senators Calder, Beaubien (Montarville) and
Haig as managers on its part at the said Free
Conference, and
Also that the managers of the Free Conference
on the part of the Senate will meet in Senate
Committee Room No. 258, at nine o'clock, p.m.
And that a message be sent to the House of
Commons accordingly.
He said: Honourable members, it will be
recalled that the three managers on behalf
of the Senate voted in favour of the amendment. It is the opinion of my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) that
therefore they are entitled to represent the
views of the majority in this Chamber. I
might have suggested an honourable senator
on this side who voted against the amendment,
but I will leave to the honourable gentlemen
named the responsibility of presenting to the
managers for the House of Commons the
point of view of the Senate.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. That is
what I have just explained. I have read the
debate, and if I remember rightly, no vote
was taken, but all three members chosen were
from among those who opposed the amendment.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, there are two points to
which attention might bu called, both of which

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, the Unemployment Insurance
Bill was just about ready to corne out of
committee at one o'clock, but we postponed
the conclusion of our labours until after the
sitting of the Senate this afternoon. It has
now been suggested that we suspend our
proceedings in the House and adjourn during
pleasure, so that the work of the Banking and
Commerce Committee may be completed and
the Bill or Bills before that committee may
be reported to the House around four o'clock.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Could we not
deal first with the Bill to amend the Prairie
Farm Assistance Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
senator from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall), who
is in charge of the Prairie Farm Assistance
Bill, is under the impression that it is unobjectionable, and he would like to move the
second reading now. I therefore defer moving
for adjournment during pleasure.
PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

403

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have been trying to study
this measure in the very brief interval between
its receipt and the present time. Parenthetically I may say that if I am a little late
in arriving here in the afternoons it is always
because I am trying to learn something about
the legislation before I come in. I do not
know how honourable members are able to
study the bills before getting here; I cannot
do so, even though I am late.
This Bill is not merely a clerical amendment
of the legislation now in effect. It extends
the Minister's powers very substantially.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It transfers
them to a board.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But he selects
the board. Keep in mind the history and
you will always know ýthat. The Bill also
limits the unit of Alberta and Manitoba crop
failure areas to which, when once established,
the benevolent provisions of the Act may
apply-and dear knows they are needed, so
far as wheat is concerned. There are, as we
know, two classes of areas eligible for benevolence, 'the crop failure area and the emergency
area. The Bill enlarges the powers as to
both.
I am not going into -the merits of the matter
now, I do not know what honourable members think of the direction in which we are
travelling. We are setting a premium upon
what might be called artificial increase of our
grain products, and at a time when for the
life of us we cannot see what we are to do
with the products we have. I know the plight
of those engaged in production in some areas
has been serious, and in many instances it
is serious still. In days when we are at our
wits' end to know what to do with the stored
and unstored volume of grain which now is
in our Western country, I should like to see
Government assistance trend towards encouraging a wider variety of products rather than
continually bonusing grain production. A
little is being done by private enterprise in
the West to encourage beet and beet-sugar
production.
As respects the form of the Bill, it is the
worst I have ever seen. I do not know who
drafted it.

Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL moved
the second reading of Bill 113, an Act to
amend the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, 1939.
,He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
amends the Prairie Farm Assistance Act. There
are only a very few changes proposed. One
is the substitution of a board for the Minister.
It was explained in another place that the
board would consist of permanent officials of
the Department of Agriculture who are connected with the department's grain branches,
particularly in Western Canada, and who would
therefore be familiar with what is being done
there. Another change is that all the applications from now on are to be made by the
provinces; so that each province will take the
responsibility for its applications. Another
amendment provides for action to be taken
with respect to part of a township in places
where half a township has a crop failure while
the other half has not.
The Law Clerk of the Senate has presented
some considerable amendments to this Bill.

interpreted as showing a lack of sympathy

bligits of nature. Far from being unsympathetic, I am closer to them than most honourable memsbers.

provide the amounts necessary to meet capital
expenditure in the year 1940 for the purposes
I have mentioned.
The financing Act of last year was entitled
"The Canadian National Railways Financing
and Guarantee Act, 1939." The amount
authorized under that legislation was $25,821,707. The amount actually advanced by way
of loan from the Government was $12,442,522,
while $6,500,000 was made available to the
railway company under authority of that legislation from the proceeds of the sale of
36,500.000 worth of equipment trust certificates.
This issue was dated July 1, 1939, and matures
serially in ten annual instalments. The certificates bear interest at two and a half per cent
per annum, and were sold at an average of
100-428, the annual cost being 2-46 per cent.

an expenditure of $15,104,000.

of $9,075,000 for equipment retirements, but
there is $13,724,000 going into additions and

Then there are new equipment purchases,

INSlxURANCE

BILL

HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, I move, seconded by the right
honourable senator from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham), that this Bill be now
read a third time.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, this subject has now been
up for review on three occasions, on the first
two of which I expressed certain views, not
as to the merits of the Bill, but as to the time
at whici it was proposed to put it into effect.
Speaking only for myself, I stressed on each
occasion that I could not reconcile my duty
with the support of such a measure to come
into effect at the stage we have now reached
in the war. In consistency with the stand I
took, first before I had any knowledge that
the Covernment intended to bring in the
mseasure at this time, and afterwards on the
second reading, I have now an amendment to
move, seconded by the honourable senator
from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte), reading
as follows:

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

That this Bill be not now read a third time,
btît that it be aiiiiendd hy adding as section 104
thereof the following:

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Comnmittee on Banking and Commerce on Bill
98, an Act to establish an Unemssployment
Insurance Commission, to provide for Insurance against Uneinployient, to establish an
Emplo
sment
Service, and for other purposes
related thereto.

104. This Act shall comse into force onithe
tcrmsination of the present war.
Because my reasons were given as forcibly
before as I could repeat then now, I shall not
detain the House at all. First J want to make
this statement. I cannot believe the Government intend actually to operate this law vhile
the war is on.

Hon

Mr. EULER.

AUGUST 1, 1940
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In that I may
be wrong. But, having been in administrations and knowing the pressure of finance,
knowing also the confusion which inevitably
follows if duty is even approached in such a
time of awful strain as this, I cannot believe
the Government intend to launch what is in
effect a taxation measure, of a kind entirely
novel to Canada, in addition to the essential
general taxation already in force.
Though geographically we are 3,000 miles
away, yet as to the practical, ultimate result
we may consider ourselves right in the heart
of England. I should like honourable members just to imagine they are there for the
moment and ask themselves this question:
When the armies of 120 million warlike
people, under the charge of dictators undoubtedly the most sinister the world has ever
seen, are gathering on the Channel, twenty
short miles away, and aiming at the heart
and life of the great Commonwealth of which
we are a part, would you launch a great social
reform enterprise of this kind? Would you
announce to the world that we were doing our
last bit in this struggle, that we were concentrating on victory, none too certain, by giving
our attention to a great new experiment in
this Dominion? I know that if we were in
England you would not. I know that if the
pressure of these times weighed upon us as it
does on those who are in a position
geographically but not otherwise different
from ours, you would not be taking this step
at the present time.
There are other reasons as well why the
legislation is inopportune. "Inopportune" is
but a faint word to express the feeling of
criticism I have for this measure.
It is
foreign to the thinking of the hour for this
further reason, that we have not the faintest
notion, we cannot formulate a conception, of
what our condition will be within a relatively
short time from the present. For that time
we are legislating to effect a markedly radical
change in our economy. We could do it
vastly better if we waited until that time
arrived.
With the principles of the measure I have
no disagreement. We have gone over it in
committee in a spirit of friendliness and cooperation. We have put it into the best forn
we can. But, speaking for myself-and, I
hope, for many more in this House from all
sections and all parties-I beg the Senate not
to enact the Bill now. I never represent myself
as able to speak with authority as to just what
all the people are thinking, but I do know
many in all classes who are amazed that we
should be considering this subject at this time,

407

particularly when we do not know what will
be the future of almost half our people, those
who cannot get even the remotest benefit
from this measure, but who share in very
heavy degree in the onus which it imposes,
namely the agriculturists of this Dominion.
In their share of general taxation, increased
heavily by this measure, and in their purchases of essential supplies, the cost of which
must inevitably be augmented by this measure,
the farmers will contribute, and contribute
heavily. If ever the future was unknown to
agriculture, it is unknown at this very moment.
So far as we can pierce the future at all,
indistinct though it be, it indeed is anything
but inviting-it is dark. Where the main
agricultural exports of Canada are to find a
market in any future that we can now even
imagine possible, it is difficult indeed to
descry.
Because of that overriding general reason
which I have sought to emphasize so often,
because particularly of the unknown into which
we must step in the next few months, or
perhaps weeks, and because especially of the
darkness of that unknown as respects at least
half our population-for whom we seem utterly
unable to find a remedy in the distresses which
now surround them-I ask that giving effect to
this measure be postponed. When the day of
peace arrives, which we all hope will be a
happy day, it may well be that we shall think
a good many thoughts before we enact this law.
If conditions then are as we hope they will
be, this measure will find no more friendly,
no more active supporter than myself.
I have given my reasons. I have nothing
further to say.
Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
senators, it is moved by Right Hon. Senator
Meighen, seconded by Hon. Senator Marcotte:
That this Bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be arnended by adding as section 104
thereof the following:
104. This Act shall come into force on the
termination of ,the present war.
Is it your pleasure to adopt the amendment?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, this country quite rightly boasts of
a large majority of Canadians of British stock.
k confidently believe that the transfer of
heir activities from the Old Land to Canada
has not impaired their courage nor their virtues.
I am convinced that they are as strong-hearted
Britishers as their kin on the Island. And
what have we seen there? Great Britain
passed through the exhausting war of 19141918. Unemployment insurance was in effect,
employers and employees contributing to the
fund during the days of prosperity, and when

408

SENATE

the war ended a large reserve had been accumulated. Then came the aftermath of war, with
steadily mounting unenployment and the
added burden of re-establishing demobilized
soldiers in civil life. It was said in our conmittee, and I think it is on record in Great
Britain as well, that without the considerable
unemployment insurance fund accumulated
during the years when British factories were
turning out war supplies in tremendous volume
very critical days would have confronted
Great Britain. The country was saved from the
uphoaval that might have followed had the
people been forced to clamour for bread.
Indeed, some men high in the council of Great
Britain have said that unemployment insurance averted a revolution.
To-day Canada, in common with the other
component parts of the British Empire, is at
wiar. Mv right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) brought before this House in
1935 the Bennett Bill, based on the principle
of unemployment insurance.
The present
menasure, in great part, is based on the Act
of 1935. He bas endorsed the principle of
this Bill, bas studied its whole fabric in conmittee, and finds it very satisfactory; yet he
asks that the measure be postponed till after
the war. I would point out to him that this
war may last many months, perhaps several
years; no one can tell; and meanwhile more
and more men are being employed in our constantly expanding war industries and are earning good wages. It is recognized that, should
present conditions of ernployment continue,
the fund will in two years exceed $100,000,000.
When the war ends, what will be the situation
in Canada, with all our war industries shut
down and tens of thousands of workmen thrown
out of employment? They will have to turn
to relief. It must also be borne in mind that
upon demobilization we shall have to reestablisb our fighting men in civil life.
This problem bas been uppermost in the
minds of the Government and of those who
support this Bill, and they are convinced that
now, in prosperous days, when the wheels of
industry are turning at full speed, an effort
should be made to accumulate as large a fund
as possible to meet the days of unemployruent.
My right honourable friend thinks that the
operation of this legislation will detract from
the efforts we must all make towards winning
the war. I would remind him that Great
Britain, profiting by experience of the aftermath of the war of 1914-1918, bas within the
last few days been re-organizing unemployment insurance in such a way as to give the
highest results for the days when it will be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

needed.
Yet the British Government are
carrying on the war vigorously, and they do
not say, "We will content ourselves simply
with taking measures to prevent the enemy
from reaching our shores." They are thinking
of the welfare of the people at large, and
they feel that, as in 1914-1918, they must
during war prepare for peace.
I do not know whether my right honourable friend bas read this statement by the
Minister of Finance, bearing on the beneficial
action which this measure may have on the
war itself. I am quoting from the statement
of Hon. Mr. Ilsley, Minister of Finance, made
on July 30, 1940.
The second new development is the provision
this House lias made for unemployment insurance. This is a far-reacing measure of social
security for our working classes.
It is also a
vitally necessary preparation for the post-war
situation. I lo net believe, however, that even
memnibers of Parliament, let alone the public
generally, realize how useful this unemployment
insurance may be from the point of view of
aar finance.
Once it gets in operation it will
result in the collection of about $4,000,000 a
monthHe night well have said S5,000,000.
-I think that is the estimate-in the forni of
employers' and employees' contributions. Since
the amount likelv to be paid out in unemployruent benefits during the war will be small, most
of these contributions vill be accumulated in
the insurance fund. This fund will be invested
in Government securities and will therefore
assist indirectly in financing the war. Secondly,
ani this too is important, it will involve the
setting up of an active, national system of

employment offices, which will serve as a placement service enabling all unemployed persons,
whether or net they are covered by the unemployment insurance, to be brought into touch
with those needing additional labour.
This
will he of great usefulness as labour becomes
more

and

more

difficult

to find,

and

as

it

becoies more and more important to transfer

what unemployed labour there is to the places
where it is most needed. In fact, I should not

be surprised if the employment service set up
nder this insurance scheme proves to be just
as important, from the point of view of mobilizing our labour force, as national registration
itself. For these two reasons the war makes
it more desirable than ever to establish uînemployment insurance and a thoroughly efficient
system of employment exchanges.
That is the view of the Minister responsible
for providing the means of financing this war.
Now I ask my right honourable friend to
ponder over this situation and to consider
the responsiblity that Parliament would assume
if it accepted his point of view and postponed
the operation of this measure until the day
after the war, particularly if the situation
then were such as to make the people at large
feel that the country should have provided
heljp for the men demobilized and for workers

409

AUGUST 1, 1940
in war industries and elsewhere who will have
lost their jobs.
I said the other day that to govern is to
foresee. The Government has the responsibility of carrying on this war. I say that the
Government, with the assistance of all
patriotie citizens, is doing this as effectively
as it can be done. J say also that it is the
Government's duty to think now of the people's
welfare in the period following the war.
Everyone admits that that will be a sorrowful
day if men have nothing to do but walk the
streets and are forced to return to relief.
I know my right honourable friend heard
in our committee, and bas read in the report
of the Commons committee, the suggestion
of some employers that this scheme should
be postponed. Some have said we should
postpone the legislation for a few months to
allow employers and employees to get together
to see if they cannot help in framing a Bill
that would be satisfactory to both. J am
glad my right honourable friend did not make
use of that argument. I think be weighed it
and left it to one side. Just imagine what
would be the result of leaving a difficult,
technical measure like this to be discussed
with the employees by manufacturers, industrialists and financiers. The Bill had to be
prepared by scientific men. It was prepared
by scientific men. Yet some people have said,
"Let it wait until the war is over." I noticed
that some who made that suggestion were
not very ardent supporters of unemployment
insurance. My right honourable friend, perhaps unconsciously influenced by voices he
heard in committee, has said it would be
well to suspend action. I would draw the
attention of employers to the fact that if
no fund is accumulated, millions of dollars
will be required the day after war ends,
and the employers are the ones who, in
large part, will have to provide them. To-day
we are asking employees to subscribe. They
are meeting the request gladly, although many
of them who are in sheltered positions know
they will never receive any benefit from the
Act. In all walks of life they are showing a
readiness to bear their share. With this
goodwill on the part of the vast majority of
those who represent labour, apart from the
agriculturists, I say to the employers that if
they co-operate under this Bill there will be
a fund available for the day of reckoning.
My right honourable friend has said that
the agriculturists will receive no benefit, and
yet will have to pay. I doubt very much
that the agriculturists, as a class, will be
called upon to pay very much. Their only
contribution will be to the share which the
Government pays. If my right honourable
friend will look at the reports which come

from all parts of the country, from the
Atlantic to the Pacifie, as to the financial
organization, he will see that the agricultural population will not contribute very
largely. The farmers will, of course, do their
bit as purchasers and as consumers; but, as
my right honourable friend knows very well,
the employers are the ones who will bear the
bulk of the burden.
I say that in the
interest of the employers themselves, and
in the interest of Canada and the good
government of Canada, we should take
advantage of this opportunity.
My right
honourable friend asks if the Government
will dare to establish such a scheme during
these troublous times.
Well, I am quite
sure that it is animated by sentiments as
patriotic as those of my right honourable
friend and that it will do its best to give
effect to the legislation if it is passed by this
Parliament.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is pretty
careful.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, owing to the pressure of time I shall
confine my remarks to just a point or two
referred to by the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), particularly the one
regarding the farmers.
There is no need for me to stress the effect
of war conditions on the working man and
on the farmer, especially the farmer of the
West. What these conditions will be three
months, five months, a year hence, nobody
knows. We only hope that victory will crown
our efforts. At the same time we must not
ignore the possibility of trouble, or of our
being confronted by a situation which will
virtually ruin us for a long time to come.
The honourable leader says this legislation
will not affect the farmers at all.
We
know very well that so far as taxation is
concerned business has reached the saturation point. We know, too, that if business
has to provide millions of dollars to help
this scheme, the employees and the Government will have to do likewise; so in the
long run the public will have to pay. We
know from experience that when the cost
of production increases the Western farmers
have to pay more for what they buy. The
honourable gentleman says, "Oh, well, when
it comes to that, the farmers are not so badly
coincide with
situated."
This does not
what Premier Patterson, of the province of
Saskatchewan, says in the correspondence,
which was tabled, in relation to the question
of amending the Constitution. If one peruses

9%32-27
REVISED EDITION

410

SENATE

that correspondence one will find, at page 24,
the following paragraph:
Because of the large proportion of our people
dependent upon agriculture, and particularly
in view of the experiences of the past few
years, there has been, and is likely to be, a
growing demand for some form of crop insurance. The institution of a national system
of unemployment insurance will undoubtedly
increase advocacy for some form of national
crop insurance, and the fact that the Federal
Government has taken steps to provide for
the protection of those employed in industry
will be advanced as an argument why some
form of protection should be provided for the
farming community.
There is absolutely no doubt in the mind
of anyone who has studied conditions in the
Western Provinces that such a demand will
be made upon the Government. If there

are to be $50,000,000 or $70,000.000 for the
working man, liow many millions are there
to be for the farmer? This is something to
be considered, especially at a time like this,
when we have to provide hundreds of millions
of dollars for war purposes.
At another place in the correspondence I
find a resolution passed by the Legislature
of the province of New Brunswick on the
l4th of February, 1938. I read only the last
paragraph. It says:
Be it therefore resolved that in the opinion
of this Honse the Government of this province
should respectfully urge upon the Government
of Canada the advisability of deferring further
consideration of the said proposal until the
report of the said commissioners-that

is the Sirois commission-

-is
available, when the whole field of social
services and any re-allocation of legislative
powers in respect thereof may be given fuller
study and consideration in the light of the
findings and recommendations of the said commissioners.
It is truc that we have had the report of
the Sirois commission, but it has never been
studied. Conclusions have been drawn, but
we have not yet had the exhibits and the
references which were placed before the commissioners. Why not wait until we have had
time te study this report and sec what proposals it contains, and the reasons for those
proposals?
I have just read a resolution passed by the
Legislature of the province of New Brunswick. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council
of that province changed the resolution. Had
he the right to do that? I doubt it very
much. The Legislatature of British Columbia
also pised a resolution. These were the only
two who did so.
Honourable members who read the correspondence between the former Premier of the
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

province of Quebec, Hon. Mr. Duplessis, and
the Prime Minister of Canada, will be
interested in the fact that although the Legislature was in session when the succeeding
Premier, Hon. Mr. Godbout, gave his consent,
he was very careful not to submit the matter
to the House. Why?
I leave it to honourable senators to find a reason.
Though I have further notes that I should
be only too pleased to use, I do not want to
take up too much of honourable senators'
time. The honourable leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) says we must prepare
for the future. Surely no one would be more
inclined to take that point of view than the
Prime Minister. Yet what do we find? The
following appears in the House of Commons
Debates of June 18, 1940:
On the Orders:
Government notices of motion. The Prime
Minister:
That a select committee of the House be
appointed to study and report upon the general
problems of reconstruction and re-establishment
which nay arise at the termination of the
present war, and all questions pertaining thereto; with power to such select committee to
appoint, from among the members of the committee, such subcommittees as may be deemed
advisable or necessary, to deai with specific
phases of the problems aforementioned, with
power to said select committee and to such
subcommittees as may be formed therefrom, to
call for persons, papers and records, to examine
witnesses under oath, and for such select committee to report from time to time to the
House; and that the said connittee shall con-

sist of the following members.

There you see evidence of the Prime Minister's eagerness to create ways and means of
providing for re-establishment of our people
who may be in need after the war. Yet that
very day he asked for permission to withdraw
that proposal. Why? Because, as honourable
senators will remember if thev bear in mind
the date, the 18th of June, that was the day
France was asking for the terms of the armistice with Germany and Italy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: If because of the
bad situation then existing the Prime Minister
was justified in withdrawing his notice of
motion for the appointment of a committee
to prepare for conditions that might arise after
the war, surely we have an equal right to ask
that this measure be not put into effect until
after the war.
I think it is unnecessary for me to say more
on the subject. I have been interested, as I
alvays am, in the arguments advanced by
the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), but they have failed to convince

AUGUST 1, 1940
me. If I may say so, I find them no more
convincing than those made by the Right
Honourable the Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of my honourable friend to the fact that
it was the Right Honourable the Prime Minister who initiated the Unempliyment Insurance Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not very
consistent.

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: He changed his
mind. We have often accused the Prime
Minister of doing that, and we need not
hesitate to accuse him once more.

For the reasons stated, I am seconding the
motion proposed by the right honourable leader
on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), and
I ask honourable senators to give it their consideration.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Question.
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable senators,-

Some Hon. SENATORS: Six o'clock.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Honourable senators, I
am one of the members of this House who.
throughout this session, have endeavoured to
hold strictly to the war mandate manifestly
given by the people of all the provinces to
the Liberal party Government, which had
requested full administrative responsibility in
Canada for the conduct of the war.
I do not oppose the principle of the measure
submitted to us. In 1935 I was a member of
the Government which made that principle
the basis of an enactment founded on a
decision of the League of Nations. At that
time the economic situation was not as serious
as it is to-day.
Before the Government could have been said
to have proper authority to bring in this Bill,
should the measure not have had the prior
approval not only of the Premier of each
province, but of all the legislative assemblies?
I believe it should. The lack of such approval
constitutes, in my humble opinion, a violation of provincial autonomy, and I submit,
therefore, that the Government of Canada
has not sufficient authority to bring in such
a measure. Why is it brought in at the very
end of the session? Why not have waited
until the legislatures had time to study the
report of the Rowell-Sirois commission, as
well as the text of the Bill itself? I am
informed that the Rowell-Sirois report was not
laid on the tables of our provincial legislative
assemblies. Postponement of the Bill until
next session would give both the legislators
and the public time to examine it thoroughly
95832-27j

and from all angles, with due regard to lessons
of the past, conditions of the present and possible difficulties of the future. That would be
in the interests of all, employees as well as
employers.
Though good in principle, a law may be bad
and fatal in practice. That was truc of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, whose
worthy object was to keep the efficient farmer
on the land. Generally the registrars understood the spirit of the Act very well, but some
of the judges applied it incompetently,
ridiculously and in such a manner as to make
it odious. The object of the law was excellent,
but the hasty, ill-prepared and ill-organized
administration ruined honest retired citizens
who had lent their modest savings, and it
spoiled many previously honest farmers.
So it was also in the case of the Unemployment Relief Act, which was intended to assist
the industrial worker who had lost his employment because of the depression. When it was
passed we were at the height of the crisis.
The spirit of this Act was perverted, and the
author and benefactor, the Canadian Government, was grossly and cynically exploited,
with the terrific consequences we sec to-day.

will involve an expenditure of how many
millions? And what obligations? And with
what ultimate consequences? These are points
that we should carefully examine.
The Government has requested authority
to spend $1,148,000,000, made up of $448,000,000
for ordinary purposes and $700,000,000 for the
conduct of the war. Seven hundred million
dollars! And it will be more, as the Minister
of Finance frankly stated.
Less than fifty years ago our expenditure
was not more than 40 million dollars. To-day
our net debt is more than three billion dollars,
and our gross debt exceeds four billion dollars.
These figures are alarming, even after deduction of our active assets of slightly more
than 757 million dollars.
In spite of new taxation, the Minister of
Finance foresees a deficit of over 700 million
dollars. This is enormous for a country of

considerably, and therefore conserve as far
as possible our productive resources, our labour
and so on.
It is well to reflect that our five billion
dollars of federal, provincial and municipal
debt will be repaid in great part by future
generations, whose population and production,
we are told, will be at least twice as great
as those of to-day. It is well to dwell on that
thought, in order to avoid pessimism and
discouragement.

By taxing salarics and wages, already
reduce-d because of depression, and imposing
a -ales tax, the Government is complicating
still further the workcr's budget, without
givinig bin the slightest hope of any decrease
in cost of living. It is said that this Bill, if
en cted, will net only tax directly all empl yers. but also indirectly all employees as
consumers. This is probable. But we must
do somaetbing to solve tbP problem of unemploy-ment. in this regard we shall in a few
months be better able to judge cor position,

foresight and its improvidence will

For these reaons I would faveur the
proposal to postpone consideration of this
meas ure until next session, but not until after
the, war. of wlhich we cannot foresee the end.
I have no grudge against working men. AIl
mv public life bears testimony to my efforts
on their behalf. I have always protested
against the abuses of capitalism, and have
ever sought to further the interests of labour.
I am still animated by the same sentiments.
I repeat, I am opposed to postponing the
opration of this measure until after the war,
for in my opinion to do so would be equivalent
to deferring unemployment insurance indefinitely.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE.

Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, if I
thouglt that by putting this legisiation into
effect immediately we were te the slightest
extent interfering with our war effort and our
chances of defeating the enemy, I would without hesitation vote to postpone its operation,
because, after all, the important thing is to
save the present; if we do not, there is no
u-se in trying to preserve the future. But I
beliexe the immediate application of this
mîeasure will not interfere with our war effort.
Tbough J look upon the collection of contributions to unemplo'ment insurance as just so
miih more taxation-and, Heaven knows, we
require plenty of taxes to carry on the warI an confirmed in my belief by the argument
that the vast fund represented by these contributions will be available to the Government
for the purpose of further financing the cost of
the- war.
In committee this afternoon I moved an
amendment which did net carry. I do net
intend to more it again now, because I do
not think that at this stage it would imcet with
any better luck, but in view of the suggestion
I made in committee I do think it is important
that I should bring it to the attention of
honourable senators. There I raised opposition
to the schedule of rates of beînefit, which of
course is the most important feature of this
legislation. Unfortunately this schedule is net
wortly of al] the work. study and effort we
have given it. I pointed out that there is net
sufficient difference between the wekly rate of
benefit payable to single persons and that
payable to persons with dependents. Instead
of giving these rates in detail, I will ask
permission to put on Hancard the table at the
end of the third schedule te the Bill.
This is the table referred to:
Weekly Rate of Benefit

Single

As will bc observed, there is a difference
of only 15 per cent betwee'rn these two sets
of rates. Under class 3, as an example, $6.12
is the benefit payable to the contributor who
is single; whereas it is increased to only $7.20
if the contributor is a married person with,
say, three or four children. One cannot resist
the conclusion that the small difference of
$1.08 is net nearly sufficient to take care of a
wife and three or four children.
My fear. as I expressed it in committee, is
that the slight extra amount will net be sufficient to provide a fanaily with the bare

AUGUST 1, 1940
necessities of life, and consequently those who
become unemployed will be in the same
position as the unemployed are to-day: they
will be reduced to the humiliating necessity
of seeking either public or private charity to
keep body and soul together.
I hope my remarks will be read by the
officers of the department and by those who
are to be appointed to the commission to
administer this legislation, and that upon
further study and consideration of this question the commission may be able to recommend a modification of the schedule in order
best to achieve the purpose which we, and,
I have no doubt, the Government, have in
mind, that is, to provide at least a minimum
measure of social security for those in our
midst who from time to time become unemployed, not through any fault of their own,
but entirely by sheer pressure of circumstances.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, replying to the observations of the
last speaker (Hon. Mr. Coté), I would respectfully suggest to him that he is directing his
protest to the wrong quarter. If the allowance is only $4.80 for a married man who is
unemployed, it means that, when employed,
his salary or wages represented a minimum of
$20 or a maximum of $30 a month. If the
laws of any province permit men with families
-I think my honourable friend in committee
suggested a family of ten-to work for $20 or
$30 a month, I suggest that he address himself
to the Premier and other ministers of that
province and urge that the abuse be rectified.
After all, this legislation is based on the principle of a direct ratio between the amount
of salary or wages a man earns and the allowance he is to receive when unemployed.
I come now to this Bill and the amendment
proposed by the right honourable
leader
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). I recall
that when this measure was last before us
he intimated that we were forced by the Government to consider the subject in about as
hot a summer as the nation has ever known.
Fortunately the elements have since come to
our assistance, and I am glad to say the discussion has been as temperate as the weather.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: This afternoon the
right honourable leader opposite has referred
to our desperate situation in this war, and on
a former occasion he said he feared the
impression that might be created, particularly
in the United States, by the introduction of
this measure during war-time. But I am
strengthened in my desire to vote for this
Bill because across the Atlantic ocean has come
this message, "Cheer up America!" I should

413

hate to thinik that any voice in this House
calling attention to the 120 million threatening
warriors on the continent of Europe had so
paralysed us in Canada that we were afraid
to carry on our ordinary government funetions. I am fully in accord with the declaration
which comes every day from England that
confidence in our ultimate success in this
war can best be demonstrated by refusing to
deny to ourselves the right and privilege of
carrying on our daily duties and occupations.
No matter what in the last analysis may be
the need to provide for unemployment when
the war is over, we all agree that we must
droip everything which interferes with the
prosecution of this war; and if tho right
honourable leader opposite could convince
any of us that the enactment of this legislation
at this time would in any way hamper or
cripple us in doing those things which to-day
are essential to victory, then without question
this measure would have to go by the board
But in this connection I would ask honourablesenators again to consider the statement which
the Honourable Minister of Finance made only
last Tuesday, and which has already been
quoted by the honourable leader of this
House. It is this:
1 do not believe, however, that even members
of Parliament, let alone the public generally,
realize how useful this unemployment insurance
may be from the point of view of war finance.
Those are the words, honourable gentlemen,
of the man who has the primary responsibility
of providing funds and resources for carrying
on the war.
Once it gets into operation, it will result
in the collection of about $4,000,000 a monthIt has been observed that this figure might
more accurately be placed at $5,000,000.
-I think that is the estimate-in the form of
employers' and employees' contributions. Since
the amount likely to be paid out in unemployment benefits during the war will be small,
most of these contributions will be accumulated
in the insurance fund. This fund will be
invested in Government securities, and will
therefore assist indireotly in financing the war.
That is not an idle statement, not a statement made on any political platform. It is
a statement of the man with the greatest
financial responsibility of any man in Canada.
In figuring out how much taxation there
shall be, he bas calculated that $50,000,000 a
year will be provided by this legislation.
Now, honourable senators, what does that
mean? It has been said here that the burden
is going to fall on employers of labour and the
agriculturists. If I can read anything into that
declaration, it means that if the Minister of
Finance is deprived of the $50,000,000 to be
provided by this legislation he will have to seek.

it elsewhere. I do not want to push this
argument too far, because it might be embarrassing without being of any tise. But you and
I can readily understand that under this legislation a revenue is being secured which very
likely would not be secured from any other
form of taxation. Therefore, in view of the
unanimous support which the Bill has received,
and the solemn declaration of the Minister
of Finance, it would be a drastic step for the
Senate of Canada to come in at this time and
interfere with the calculated plans of those
responsible for our financing.
In conclusion let me say that if this measure
is not inconsistent with our war effort-I think
I could put it far more strongly than thatif it is not inconsistent with our war effort,
I know of no form of legislation that is more

essential and
Though we are confident of victory, we cannot but recognize that victory will be a long
time coming, and we know that next to winning the war the greatest effort the citizens
of Canada have to make is to provide for the
grave conditions that will arise after the war.
We were told in our committee to-day that a
high authority in England said that legislation
of this kind contributed very largely to the
prevention of a revolution in that country after
the last war. We must not deceive ourselves.
As time goes on, conditions will be far worse
than they were after the last war, and if we

considered attempt of those responsible to
make at least some provision in anticipation
of the situation we shall have to face in the
future, we should be assuming a grave responsibility indeed.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Ilonourable senators,
wish to say but a few words. I am in favour
of the amendment for a reason which is
different, perhaps, from any advanced here so
far. I am in favour of it because unemployment insurance, as I see it, will not cure conditions, but is very likely to make thrm
steadily worse. What I mean is this. In this
great country we have suffered by reason of
the fact that too many people have left the
land to seek employment in urban centres
In this measure I see an encouragement of
that sort of thing, which is a hindrance to the
welfare of this country.
I have no apology to make for supporting
the measure of five years ago. Conditions

have to take over life insurance as well. We
have no idea what kind of insurance may be
suitable a year from now, or five years hence.
So far as the creation of a fund is concerned,
the money is here now. Under this scheme
the farmer would pay an increased cost for bis
goods, because the tax on industry would
compel it to raise the price of whatever it
sold to the farmer.
I do not intend to take up any more time.
I shall have no difficulty in supporting the
amendment.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, the question is now on the third
reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I am sorrier than I have ever been
to rise to speak again, even if for only a
moment or two. I have the right, though,
to speak on the main motion. When I spoke
first, having arranged with the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
that we should facilitate an early vote, I confined myself within the narrowest limits. It
was felt necessary by no fewer than four
honourable members to make an animated
and vigorous, and on the part of two a belligerent reply to what I said. I will say something on the main feature of the reply, and
only on that. I will not take a moment
to answer such an argument as that our
launching at this time upon some great
new venture will be an evidence to the
world that we are thoroughly confident of
winning the war. I will alilow that argument,
unanswered, to have its full effect. But from
both sides we have heard the contention that
this new taxation-which is exactly what it
is-levelled against two classes, industrial
workers and employers, for the purpose of
raising a fund to take care of those at present
employed, over short periods when they are
unemployed, willl place in the hands of the
Minister of Finance four to five million dollars
a month, and that this will help him finance
the war.
Let me say just a few sentences about that.
The Minister of Finance tells us we are
taxing two classes for a definite purpose, but,
as that purpose will not have to be served for
a while, he will be able to use the money for
another purpose altogether, that is, to spend
it on the war, and therefore this money will
help finance the war. He will be able to do
that only because he acts for the Government
of Canada, which has not the trusteeship
responsibilities imposed upon others who
collect money for specifie purposes. He can
use it, I know. But I want to ask this: Must
not every dollar of it be replaced later? Of
course it must. Ultimately it all will have to
be found again, and used for the purpose for
which it was originally collected.

415

I submit this. When this war is over we
shall be faced with the problem of taking
care of a vast army-I wish it were a dozen
times vaster-of returned men, some twenty
to thirty thousand. of whom stand over there
now with their lives at stake for us. If the
war lasts any considerable length of time, that
number will be increased, no matter what
Government we have here, to two, three, four
or five hundred thousand. Now, if we can
collect more money, if we can get more taxes
from 'employers and from wage earners, as
the Government assume we can, would it
not be wiser and more directly in line with
our war effort to ear-mark such taxes for the
benefit of those who will be most in need
when the war is over-the men who, because
they threw up their jobs and went over there
to fight for us, will come back with nothing
and have no means of earning a living?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would
seem to me that if we can stand more
taxes, it is to the benefit of these men that
we should direct them first. They are the
first charge of this war, not the men provided for within the limits of this Bill, who
will be employed for the duration of the war
here at home. When the struggle comes to
an end, the civilians benefited by this measure
will not be in nearly as distressful conditions
as the soldiers who had gone to the front.
Here we are making no provision at all for
the men who, when they come back, will be
unemployed, and we are directing the fund,
gathered at the ultimate expense of all classes,
but particularly of agriculture, to the men
who need it least instead of to those who
need it most. Yet, because the Government
will be able to spend the money for one
purpose, though it was collected for another,
we are asked, on the authority of the Minister
of Finance, to regard this as a great measure
of finance, to throw our hands in the air and
get behind it. It does not add to my confidence in the Minister of Finance, which
ordinarily has been very high.
When we have looked after the interests
of our men who fight-the first mortgage on
this country-and taken care of the vital
requirements of the war itself, we may well
turn our attention to those who because of
unemployment are worthy of our support.
But apparently we are not greatly concerned
about the diversion of our efforts away from
the men whose claim upon us will certainly
have to be given priority, and from the
war itself.

DEBTS DUE TO THE CROWN BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: On Tuesday,
July 30, Bill 99, an Act to amend An Act
respecting debts due to the Crown, was before
the Senate, and a special committee consisting of the two leaders and Hon. Senators
Buchanan, Calder, Coté, Haig, King, Marcotte, Murdock and Raymond were appointed
to consider the Bill. The committee met this
morning in pursuance of the order of reference,
and I have the honour to present the following report:
The special committee to whon was referred
the Bill 99 from the House of Commons,
intituled "An Act to amend An Act respecting
debts due to the Crown," have in obedience to
tie order of reference of 30th July, 1940,
examined the said Bill and now beg leave to
report the same with the following amendments:
1. Page 1, line 23.
Add to the end of the proposed section two
the following:
Provided that the Minister of Finance may
not so retain in any one month out of such
sum or sums so due or payable by His Majesty
in such right an amount greater than that
which is seizable per month by the law of
the province where the concerned officer,
servant or employee of His Majesty in such
right resides.
2. Add to the Bill at the end thereof, as subsection two of the proposed section two, the
following:
(2)

This section shall come into force upon

proclamation of the Governor in Council.
3. Add to the Bill as clause three the
following:
3. The said Act is further amended by
adding thereto as section three the following:
3. (1) In any case where any officer, servant or employee of His Majesty in the right
of Canada is indebted to any province, municipality or person in any specific sum of money
on a judgment recovered for or on account of
(a) any income tax, special tax or wage
tax (including interest and penalties) or
(b) any other manner of debt not sounding in damages, whether such debt be or be
not of the genus of a debt for taxes,
the like recourse by the judgment creditor
against third parties by way of garnishment
of judgment debts, as applies against garnishees, generally, in and by the law of the
province in which the judgment has been
recovered shall be available to such judgment
creditor against the Minister of Finance as
a third party garnishee, but subject to the
subsequent provisions of this section.
(2) The Minister of Finance shall not be
subject or required to answer in or to attend
at auy garnishment proceedings; be shall be
liable as a third party garnishee in his
representative capacity only and he shall be
subject in matters to which this Act extends
to orders and directions, specific or general,
of the Governor in Council.
(3) The judgment creditor shall produce to
the Minister of Finance a certificate of the

417

judgment, the garnishee order and an affidavit made by some person having knowledge
of the facts stating the amount due on the
judgment and for what it was recovered and
establishing the identity of the judgment
debtor as an officer, servant or employee of
His Majesty in the right of Canada.
(4) The Governor in Council may authorize the Minister of Finance to retain by
way of deduction out of any sum or sums
of money which, from time to time, may be
due or payable by His Majesty in the right
of Canada to any officer, servant or employee
of His Majesty in such right (such deduction
to be by instalments or otherwise as that
Minister may, in the interest of the efficiency
of the public service, determine) the amount
of any judgment debt due or payable in any
garnishment proceedings instituted under the
authority of, and in compliance with, this
Act, and to pay out such sum or sums of
money so deducted to the provinces, municipalities and persons who are, pursuant to
their respective garnishee orders and to this
Act, entitled to be paid it or them.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I would add simply that this Bill,
which was sent to a special committee, has
been returned virtually in its original form,
with the few amendments as read. These
broaden the principle of the Bill by making
it possible for creditors to garnishee the salaries of Dominion civil servants. This is a
matter to which the committee gave considerable attention. I have no mandate to speak
for the Government, but I shall gladly join
in sending the committee's report over for
consideration by the other House.
The amendments were concurred in.

DUKHOBORS, MENNONITES AND
SUDETEN GERMAN SETTLERS
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Honourable senHon. R. B. HORNER:
ators, I wish to draw attention to an item
appearing in the Ottawa Citizen of yesterday,
headed, "Member would deport Dukhobors,
Mennonites," and reading:
Dukhobors and Mennonites who refuse to
accept Canada's war responsibility should be
deported, George Black (Con., Yukon) said last
night in the House of Commons.
There were people in Canada who were not
amenable to Canadian laws, Mr. Black said,
naming the two sects. Yet other Canadians
were being called upon to enlist and fight to
protect such people.
"TPe Government should expropriate the
property of such people and deport them -and
the sooner the better," Captain Black said.
The honourable member who made that
statement has never had the privilege of living
among or associating with these peoples. As
we all know, they came to Canada under an
agreement exempting them from military
service. I think one of the Orders in Council giving them this exemption was passed in
1873, and another in 1898. The wisdom of
granting them that exemption I do not intend
to dehate, but, since nobody can tell what
lon. Mr. DANDURAND.

eventualities there may be in the future, I
have sometimes wondered that any Government would take on itself the responsibility
of extending permanent exemption of this
kind to any people coming into this country.
For thirty-three years Dukhobors and Mennonites have been my neighbours and fellow
farmers. It may be that they were of the
better class, and, if so, I have been fortunate.
But I am in duty bound to say that by far
most of these peoples in the West are firstclass farmers, good neighbours and good
citizens, though they have bad ones among
them, as bas every other nationality.
At a time like this we should make it a duty
to talk enthusiastically about the honour
and privilege of being a Canadian citizen.
Without boasting, I may say that in my
associations with Dukhobors and Mennonites
it has been my endeavour to show them that
Canadians were just. The right honourable
leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
will remember an occasion in the last war
when J bothered him. I regretted having to
do so, for he was very busy. An attempt
had been made to stir up trouble by saying
that the Government intended to force the
Dukhobors and Mennonites to do this and
that, but I am glad to say they were informed
that the Government would respect the agreement under which they entered the country.
One of the Mennonites recently told me
that their church had met at, I think, Winkler,
Manitoba, and decided to ask the Government to continue honouring the agreement
with them. But he said they were encouraging
their young men to enlist, and if any of them
were called upon to assist they would do so
in any way they could, without taking part
in actual fighting.
Of course, at a time like this we have
to be very careful. We are in the midst of
a serions situation, and any persons, no matter
what their nationality, who show disloyalty
to the State or endeavour in any way to hinder
our war effort must be ta1ken in hand. But my
whole-hearted sympathy goes out to people
who nay be perfectly loyal, yet, because of
their nationality, are suspect. If wars are ever
to cease we must strive towards the ideal
that men to men should brothers be, the
whole world over, regardless of their racial
orign.
During the recent adjournment of the
Senate I drove some two hundred miles to
reach the Sudeten settlement at St. Walburg,
Saskatchewan. about which we have all heard
a great deal. The treatment of those Sudeten
people is deplorable, and it is a serions reflection on the good name of Canada. Nothing
short of a thorough investigation will satisfy
the people at St. Walburg. They were induced

AUGUST 2, 1940
to come to Canada, which was described to
them as a great, free country. I want to
know who was responsible for sending them
to St. Walburg. I understand it was a man
by the name of Sinclair, in the colonization
department of the Canadian National Railways. A Mr. Schneider acted as colonization
agent for the system, over which he was given
the privilege of a pass. I have made inquiries
and find that this man was using his position
as colonization agent to make money out of
those immigrants, who were quite ignorant
of the ways of this country. He made $5,200
cash on commissions on sales of land to
them. He was also an implement dealer
and made exorbitant profits on the sale of
implements. I was told by a gentleman, at
one time Liberal member of the local Legislature, whose word, I am sure, the honourable leader of the Government would not
doubt, that he had met loads of old wagons,
puttied and painted to look like new, which
had been sold and were being delivered to
these poor immigrants at most unreasonable
prices. These people had been placed on
land of such poor quality that earlier settlers
had been starved off it. Those settlers had
taken off the leaf mould and sod, and my
informant told me that a whole farm was
not worth five cents. A little Czech fellow,
who spoke very good English, said that
Schneider bought horses at $50 a team and
sold them to the Sudetens at $160.
If this scandal is not thoroughly investigated
and the people are not given back the money
of which they were robbed, 90 per cent of them
will leave Canada and say they were placed
amongst a pack of robbers. This will give
Canada a bad name. It is the duty of the
Government to see that a thorough inquiry
is made.
Schneider also had the appointing of the
two supervisors of the settlement, and the
people say those two should be where he isin an internment camp. A responsible citizen
in the village who had just returned from
the faim of one of the settlers, told me that
the man was cutting hay in a slough with
an ordinary pair of bouse scissors, the women
were packing it in sacks and the boys were
carrying it a quarter of a mile to a barn.
Those supervisors, it seems to me, are simply
endeavouring to make a farce of the whole
scheme and cause the settlers to be dissatisfied with the country and its laws.
I intend to make it my business to visit
the settlement again, and in the meantime I
ask the Government to make a thorough
investigation of this distressing state of affairs.
Hon. Mr. COPP:

Hon. Mr. HORNER:

I think it was last

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I am sorry
the honourable gentleman has waited so long
to draw this matter to our attention. He has
been with us for some time since his return
from the district which he mentions, and,
had he informed me, I should have been
happy to submit the matter to the department. The honourable gentleman now asks
for an investigation. I will put his request
before the Minister in charge of the department and I promise him that to-morrow I
will furnish him with a prompt answer. If
an inquiry is necessary, it will undoubtedly
be made.
I know nothing about the parties who
brought these immigrants to that part of
Saskatchewan, nor do I know who is responsible for their coming to that particular
district, or for looking after their welfare.
I was under the impression that the provincial
authority had a certain responsibility in
respect to the reception of immigrants. I
shall make inquiries in the hope of being
able to give an answer to-morrow.
I notice my honourable friend has a good
word for the Dukhobors. Some twenty-five
years ago we had in our midst a delightful
old gentleman, Senator MacGregor, who came
from Nova Scotia. Sir Wilfrid Laurier used
to speak of the Scots of Nova Scotia as the
salt of the earth, and the phrase applied most
happily to the Senator. Senator MacGregor.
in company with a nephew, who also happened
to be a member of this House, spent a few
weeks in a Dukhobor settlement, visiting
from bouse to house, and on his return he
gave us a very favourable report of the hospitable and Christian spirit which appeared
to animate them.
That was before the
Dukhobor trek to British Columbia.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: In the statement
the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) is to make to-morrow, I would
ask him to cover the respective positions of
Mennonites and Hutterites in relation to
military service. There is a distinction between
the two groups. It would be well to make
clear whether Mennonites who have immigrated to this country in recent years are on
the same footing as Mennonites who first came
to this country and who enjoy immunity from
military service under either an Order in
Council or a statute of 1873.
The later
Mennonite immigrants have come from Russia,
and there are several settlements in southern
Alberta. All Mennonites are individualists.
The Hutterites live in communal settlements
and, I suppose, might be called Communists.

420

SENATE

I an receiving every day messages protesting
against the privileges these people enjoy:
thougli other citizens are being called upon
to render military service, the Hutterites are
not called upon to do anything. That is the
feeling in Alberta, where many Mennonites
and Hutterites have settled.
I think the
Covernment
hould state what assurances
were given these people on their entry into
this country, so that their status will be
known to those Canadians who, as I say, are
very nuch dissatisfied -with what to them is
disriminiatory treatment in favour of these
people with respect to nilitary service.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Mennonites first
settled in Manitoba in 1874 under an arrangement which was effected by Mr. Hespeler, at
that time the German Consul in Winnipeg.
Though the Mennonites live in a sort of
community village, they are individualists
and own their own farms. They were granted
exemption from military service in 1917, when
the Conscription Act was passed. Whether
the Mennonites who have cone out here since
the Russian revolution share that exemption
is another question.
The Hutterites entered Canada from Dakota
after the United States joined the Allies in
the Great War, and they came here on the
distinct understanding that they would not
be subject to military service. They are good
farmers and mind thieir own business. They
speak the language of instruction of the province in which they live. In Manitoba. English
is the language of instruction. I am sure
that my colleagues from Manitoba, the honourable senator from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Molloy), the honourable senator from St.
Jean Baptiste (Hon. A. L. Beaubien), and the
honourable senator from Manitou (Hon. Mr.
Sharpe), will bear me out when I say that
we have no better workers and citizens than
our Mennonite settlers. I 'think there is
less crime among them than among even our
own French-speaking
or English-speaking
citizens. I would impress on the Government
that it should go very slow in drafting our
Mennonite and Hutterite settlers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Could the honourable
gentleman inform us regarding a
large group of Mennonites who years ago left
Canada for one of the South American
republics? I hope they returned.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. The trouble was over
language of instruction in their schools. In
1915 the then Minister of Education in
Manitoba insisted that English, and English
alone, be taught in the schools, with the result
that a certain percentage of the church
Mennonites migrated to South America. and
Hon. Mfr. BUCHANAN.

are still there. They are.bitterly disappointed
and would like to return to Canada. A few
have come back, but the great majority still
remain there because our Immigration Department-I think quite properly-will not let
then re-enter the Dominion unless they bring
back sufficient money and settlers' effects to
enable them to carry on. I may say that the
Mennonites were willing that English should
be tanght in their schools, but they wanted
part of the day devoted to instruction in
German, the language employed in their
homes.
The Mennonites are followers of
Menno and the Hutterites are followers of
Hutter, both contemporaries of Luther.
NATIONAL WAR SERVICESREGISTRATION AND
MOBILIZATION
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Before the Orders
of the Day are called, I would ask the honourable
leader of the House
(Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) whether the rules and regulations
with respect to mobilization have yet been
tabled.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I was under
the impression that they had been set out in
a speech which the Minister of National
Defence delivered in the other House a few
days ago. I will make inquiries.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I read the statement to
which the honourable gentleman refers, but
from that I cannot tell what the set-up is.
I was hoping the Government would give us
this information before Parliament prorogues.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have been
promised it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I should like to have it if
possible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a vague
recollection of seeing in the Press that such a
statement would be presented to the House of
Commons. I will find out and inform my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In this connection I may say that outside of the Supply
Bill there are but two measures which can
reach us before the end of the session. One
concerns the wheat situation in the Western
Provinces. In respect to this I might draw
the attention of my honourable friends to the
statement of Hon. Mr. MacKinnon, Minister
of Trade and Commerce, which appears in the
House of Commons Debates of July 24 last.

AUGUST 2, 1940
I do not think anything has happened in the
meantime to vary it. I am quite sure that
all my Western friends are au fait. On reading
the statement last evening I found that this
measure, which is perhaps the most important
piece of legislation we may now expect, and
which will affect our treasury to a considerable
extent, was designed to give help te the
Western Provinces. In view of existing conditions, I feel that we must assume responsibility
for any action which will alleviate the situation in the West. As this Bill is still being
debated in the House of Commons, I would
suggest that the Senate adjourn until nine
o'clock this evening, so that the Bill, if it
reaches us by then, may receive first reading
to-night and be ready for second reading
to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock.
Before we meet again I shall try to obtain
the information my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has asked for.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Thank you.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Another Bill,
which may net have reached honourable
members of the Senate in even first-reading
form, is Bill 123, an Act respecting the payment of compensation for the taking of certain property for war purposes. I shall ask
that this Bill be distributed to the members of
the Senate without delay, even though it be
in first-reading form, for I think that when it
reaches us in its final form it will be altered
but little. I see in a marginal note that there
may be a slight change in one of the clauses.
It is true that these two measures will come
to us somevhat late, but it is the hope of the
House of Commons-and I think the hope
is shared by a number of honourable members of the Senate-that it may be possible
for us to conclude our labours by to-morrow
evening. We can of course extend our sittings
into next week if we so desire, but if it is no
inconvenience to the Senate to deal with these
two Bills to-morrow, we shall then have only
to await the pleasure of the Commons in
sendin: us the Supply Bill, which is usually
the hset measure to come to us.
With these few remares, I suggest that we
call it six o'clock.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, the honourable member from
Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has just asked, certainly for the third time
if not the fourth or fifth time, about the
regulations under the Mobilization Act. I
have been trying to find in the Senate Debates
the first discussion which occurred here after
that Act was passed. It will be recalled that
on its passing I took the strongest exception
te. and levelled the most definite protest

against, the general authorization provision
contained in that Act. It really was net legislation; it was just authority given to the
Government to legislate in respect to that
most sacred matter, the rights of the subject.
I do not recall in precise words the final
answer of the leader of the Governnent,
but it certainly was such as to lead everyone
to expect that the regulations under the Act
would shortly be laid on the Table. He mentioned the following Monday, but I do not
think he stated definitely that it would be
done on that day.
Subsequently the matter was brought up
again. I took part in the discussion, and
again a promise to answer the inquiry, and so
forth, was made. To-day the most indefinite
of all replies has been given, and it is as
clear to me as anything can be that the Government has no intention whatever of submitting these regulations to Parliament. I
feared that such was the case when the Bill was
before us. Evidently this is to be entirely a
ma-tter for the secret conclave of the Government. Parliament is to be shut out from all
consideration of these regulations, in which,
from their very nature, every subject of this
country is vitally concerned. If the regulations permit, that Act can be operated in
such a way that under it the Government
can direct who is to be summoned and who is
not. What is in the mind of the Government I do net know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Has my right
honourable friend read the statement of the
Minister?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. There
is no indication there of what the regulations
are to be. What the intention of the Government is, I do net know. All we know
is that we have been promised that after
registration is complete, and no doubt after
it is sifted. analysed and reported onwhich will be I know net when-a call will
be made, and then there will be a system
of postponement. The "call" means mobilization, or conscription; "postponement" is a
new word for exemption. Those words can
have no other meaning. This House is entitled to know, and to insist upon knowing
before we prorogue, what will be the system
of calling, and on what principle or system
postponement or exemption will be allowed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Net necessarily.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. I
have never seen anything about which there
bas been a more evident desire to keep away
from unpleasant facts and unpleasant factora

SENATE
After men are called they are going to be
trained for a month. When they are called,
unless they are "postponed," they are liable.
We have been given that information. They
are then conscripted for the purposes of the
Art; therefore "postponement" is exemption.
For the time

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
being only.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes, for
the time being only. So it was under the
old Act.
But in this
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
case it is to enable them te handle the crops.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The old
exemption was just the same; it never was
permanent. "Postponement" is only another
name, which seems to sound better to the
people.
Now, here we are. We do not know how
the "call" is to be exercised, or on what
principle "postponement" is to be granted.
We do not know how the tribunal which will
determine the exemption is te be constituted. \We know nothing about it. We are
asked to go home and leave that to the
Government. We are told that after the men
are called and after exemptions are granted
them postponenents. or whatever you
-call
lik.e-the men are te be trained for a month,
and that three hundred thousand can be
trained

within

a

year.

That

information

comes from the other House. I want te know
what is the value of a month's trainingSome Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -especially
a month's training without equipment. Unless
the exemptions are to be all sifted and
cleaned up thoroughly before the training
starts, we are going to train three, four or
five men for every one we use for war purposes. Have we the money for that? Have
we the equipment? Have we the clothing?
Even to-day we have not equipment necessary for the training of the Second Division.
In fact, although J cannot speak of the
situation up te to-day, I know that until
a comparatively few day s ago the First
Division was net fully equipped, much less
was the Second, and still less the Third.
Now all these other men are to be called.
and they will be trained for thirty dayswithout equipment. Does this really mean
anything for war purposes?
We do net
know what is te be done with them afterwards.
We do net know when the postponing, the exempting, is to be done. If it
is net all done first-and it will take a long
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN.

time to do it properly-we are going to
train two, three, four or five men for every
one who will be used.
I have said many times since the beginning
of the session, or near it, that I place very
little value upon this registration. The more
I hear about it and the more J think about
it the less value I place upon it. I cannot
imagine how it will b of any value for military
purposes. True, it will give a more accurate
fund of information to the Government as
to the number of married and the number
of unmarried persons between certain ages.
Beyond that I cannot sec that it has any
value. Perhaps it will give the Government
more accurate information than it now has on
the number of persons engaged in farming,
or in this occupation or that; but the extent
te which the proportions will differ from what
is shown by the last census returns will
necessarily bo so small that it cannot at all
affect any judgment of the Government in
respect of the Mobilization Act. Suppose the
number of persons between the ages of twentyone and twenty-three amounted to 2 per
cent in 1931, and is now 2·03 per cent-it
could not change more than that-what difference would it make? It would make no difference at all. We cannot take nearly all of
then anyway. The compilation of all this
other data about whether one can milk a
cow, or can do this, that or the other thing,
is just so much waste of money so far as
the war is concerned.
When the most crucial Act Parliament has
ever passed is to be put into effect and
operation, does the Government expect the
members of Parliament to go home without
one word having been said on the regulations
under the Act, or without one particle of
light shed on this important measure? If it
does, it is guilty of an act of autocracy
unparalleled in the history of any democratie
land. Imagine doing such a thing, first of
all. without specific authority, and, worse still,
without Parliament being given even a chance
to see and review the regulations, much less
a chance to discuss them and make suggestions
with respect to them. We come here from
all parts of the country. Presumably we are
in touch with the people of all parts of the
nation. Yet we are told te go home-that we
shall hear about these matters through the
Press.
Only to-day the Government has laid on the
Table certain Orders in Council. I strongly
protest against delay in submitting such
documents. What use can we make of thern
now, when we are expecting to prorogue to-

morrow?

This country has been kept entirely

AUGUST 2, 1940
in the dark about every feature of the war.
We have no information about what is or
ought to be going on, or what is not or
ought not to be going on. The control of
propaganda is such that the country is just
blacked out, and so is unaware of the condition
it is in and the way it is being governed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It just happens
that my right honourable friend is not administering the country. If he were, he would
be posted from A to Z on all these details.
He rises in this Chamber and starts criticizing
the Government for what it has or has not
done, and suggests that something is being
hidden from the two branches of Parliament.
Well, I have just laid on the Table a formidable array of Orders in Council, bearing for
the most part on the war.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But they have
not to do with the Mobilization Act, which
is what we want to know about.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend knows the Minister of Finance
presented a well-prepared statement to the
other HouseRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Even if the
documents laid on the Table to-day did have
to do with the Mobilization Act, no human
being could read one-tenth of them before
prorogation, if it should come to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They indicate
that somebody is working on the matters in
which the country is most interested.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But we cannot
find out what is being donc.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I could have
risen in my place here and read the statements that were made in the Commons by
the Minister of National Defence, the Minister for Air, the Minister of National War
Services and the Minister of Munitions and
Supply.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
want them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
These were
official statements. But I felt that my right
honourable friend was following everything
that occurred in the House of Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
However, he
may say that we are entitied to have the
statements presented here. If he had asked
to have that done, I should have been glad
to comply with bis request.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable leader knows I have not asked for those

statements at all. What I want is the law
which the other House and this House
authorized the Governor in Council to pass
under the Mobilization Act. I have a right
to see that law, and to review it, but I am
forbidden to do so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will read
from now until 9 o'clock the statement by
the Minister of National Defence andRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would
only bore me. That is not the law of the
land at all, and it is the law I want.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not understand what my right honourable friend means
by the law.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The regulations passed under the Mobilization Act.
They are what we want, and we should have
them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Authority for
making these regulations has been delegated
to the Governor in Council.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The regulations should have been presented to Parliament long before this. There is no reason
why we should not have had them weeks ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
why something is donc or not done at a
certain time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have been
asking for the regulations for weeks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the question
were put to the Minister of National Defence
in the otiier House, an answer would be made
right away. But my right honourable friend
fires out his questions here to one who has
nothing to do with the department concerned, and he indicts the Government and
the Minister because the information is not
given to him at once.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If my memory
is correct, it must be at least a month ago
that the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) first asked for these
regulations. The request has been repeated
several times since, and is being made again
to-day. I was told by a man who was
present in the other House that the same
information was asked for there, but was not
given.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is the Governor in Council who prepares these regulations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And keeps
them hidden.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand the
Minister of National Defence has given a

424

SENATE

fairly full outline of these regulations. That
information bas been made available to the
public, of which my right honourable friend is
a member. I am not sure just what bas been
given out, but between now and 9 o'clock
I shall see what bas been done up to the
present, and inquire why it was not donc
earlier. That is all I can say.
Hon Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is one
point on which I should like to receive a little
more cnlightenment. I am concerned about the
slow progress being made in recruiting units
autborized for overseas. In the long statement that he presented in anotber place, the
Miniscter of National Defence said the recruiting for overseas was prorceding satisfactorily,
and previously the Prime Minister had made a
similar statement. lu my own city there are
certain units with which I am very familiar,
and, speaking as to them, I can say that
recruiting for overseas bas been bad indeed.
The ceonmanding officers are so exercised about
it tbat tley have called on private citizens
for financial aid in order that posters may be
printed and erected on billboards, that advertisements may be published in the newspapers,
and se on. As to Ontario, also, I have accurate
knowledge that overseas recruiting is far from
satisfactory.
I recall that in the last wvar the recruiting
under the voluntary system, especially when
we got along to 1916, was very difficult.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier addressed many large
recruiting meetings, enthused the citizens and
encouraged them to enlist for overseas. Sir
Robert Borden did the same thing, as did
othmer Ministers of the Crown and prominent
citizens. In fact, great recruiting meetings
were held all over this country, the bands
were playing, flags were flying and the people
were really aroused. But to-day, as one walks
through the streets of any large city, one
feels depressed. There appears to be no keen
enthusiasm or desire to join the overseas
forces.
J should like to ask my honourable friend
the leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) if he does
not think this is an opportune time for the
Prime M\inister, the Minister of National
Defence and other menbers of the Cabinet
to address the yoth of this country over a
national radio hook-up, to tell them about
the seriousness of the war and urge them
to rally to the colours in mnuh larger numbers
than they are now doing. Our people are
rather confused about the enlistment question.
It has been said over and over again by those
in authority that the Non-Permanent Force,
the militia units, are being rapidly filled up.
Of course they are. But there is a reason for
that. Young men are joining the Non-Permanent Force in such large numbers because
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND

they do not want to be taken into the draft.
And I know the forestry unit is being rapidly
filled up. But when you come to look at the
infantry. the artillery and machine-gun units,
you find a great lack of recruits for overseas.
The First Division bas been authorized and
sent overseas. The Second Division bas been
sent to certain places-I need not specify
where-instead of going to England as an
unbroken unit. Third and Fourth Divisions
have been authorized. Well, you can ask
any honourable rnember of this House what
lie thinks about recruiting, and, no matter
vhat part of the country he comes from, he
will have to report to about the same effect
as I an doing now.
My only objeet in rising is to urge that
the Prime Minister and those associated with
hin in the Governement give the lead in a
movement to speed up recruiting for overseas units. I hope that in the near future
wxeshall see nuch more vigorous action along
this line than there bas been in past months.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend has probably net seen the Evening
Journal, which reports that the Second Canadian Division bas landed in England.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Most of it
bas, I hope. However. landing in England is
one thing, and being in shape is another.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right bonourable friend is not suggesting that he should
he put at the head of the Second Division?
Somebody is at the head of it and bas the
responsibility for deciding what work it
shall do.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And that
somebody is all right. But he cannot equip
the division.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
may I be allowed to correct the right honourable leader on the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen)? In his enthusiasm for despair he
stated that we had been waiting for details of
the regulations for weeks, and I am not sure
that he did not say for months.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
for a month.

No; I said

Hon. Mr. LITTLE: The notice of motion
for the establishment of a department to
conduct national registration was given in the
other House on the 9th of July, and the first
inquiry about registration and mobilization
by the honourable junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) was made in this
House on the 12th of July.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I am sure we are all very much
interested in this question of enlistments.

AUGUST 2, 1940

425

Everybody knows that the conditions in this
war are much different from those in the last
war. Then the great need was for more and
more man-power, and men were encouraged
to enlist. As a Canadian, a much interested
Canadian, I do not know as much about
existing conditions as I should like to know,
but I have in mind a couple of striking
incidents. A friend of our family, a young
man who has been employed for many years
in a Canadian bank at New York, came here
two or three weeks ago on his holidays. He
enlisted, passed A-1, and was told just a few
days ago to return to New York, to carry on,
and he would be advised when wanted.
Another, a son of a distinguished clergyman
in Toronto, passed his examinations there and
came here, and is working in the Bank of
Canada until he is called up. To me this
indicates there is not the same necessity in
this war as in the last for man-power. Rather
it is a question of munitions and mechanized
equipment to carry on the war, particularly in
the air. I am just as much interested as any
honourable gentleman opposite in this very
question, and, with what information I have
been able to secure, I have come to the
conclusion that even though young men are
not being required to enlist as they were in
the last war, everything is being carried on
to the best possible advantage for Canada.

commander to form a corps that will stand
on the front line. Though I doubt whether
Great Britain needs those two divisions, yet
they are there. We must attend to what will
help win the war; that is, in the air and on
the sea. Canada is doing wonderfully well in
those spheres. But all this brings not a word
of commendation from my right honourable
friend and his neighbours; no, nothing but
dissatisfaction. They say that everybody is
attending to his own business and there is no
recruiting. The Minister of National Defence
says that recruiting is very satisfactory and we
have all the men we need responding to the
call to service; but that does not satisfy my
right honourable friend.

Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): I should like to ask the
honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) this question.
If, as he says,
conditions are such that we do not require
more men, why are we conscripting men in
Canada?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend has not the direction of affairs.
From 1914 to 1918 he had, such responsibility
to a certain extent. To-day he is not at the
helm, and he thinks everything is going to
the dogs.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will answer my
honourable friend. Let me remind him of
what the Minister of National Defence said
last week, that he did not intend just now
to organize a Third Division for Great Britain,
because Great Britain did not need it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What about the
Near East?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is a statement of considerable importance. "We have
sent a completely equipped Second Division
to Great Britain, and now we are attending to
matters that Great Britain deems essential,
more especially air training and naval units."
My honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) says, "Let us have bands playing
in every town and city to stimulate recruiting." We do not need to do so, for Great
Britain does not need the men. The Minister
of National Defence has said that Great
Britain has all the men she needs. But we
have sent over two divisions under a Canadian

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He is pessimistic
and says the Government is not doing its
duty. The Government is certainly doing a
job that takes eighteen hours of work a day,
and is doing it with first-class men. When
I think of the organization of national defence
under the late Sam Hughes and the men with
whom he surrounded himself, in contrast
with the men at the helm to-day, I ask: Is
there any comparison between them?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Oh, oh.

An Hon. SENATOR: Shame!

An Hon. SENATOR:

Nonsense.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, it is
a source of great strength for a man to
believe in himself, to think he can do that
which others cannot do. I have considerable
admiration for my right honourable friend's
talents, but I say that to-day we have as fine
a group of men at the helm as can be found
anywhere, and they are doing what is needed.
Now my right honourable friend says: "I
want to see those regulations. Parliament is
entitled to see them. I want te see work
donc first that will help carry the war to a
successful conclusion." I confess I am somewhat tired of hearing only recriminations when
Canada is doing its job splendidly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
know what idea the honourable leader of the
House has of recriminations. "Recrimination"
is harking back to the conduct of someone
else as being worse than your own. Really

SENATE
it is be who is guilty of recrimination. I am
criticizing. Am I to be held up as unworthy
of my place if I offer criticism?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There
question of the spirit behind it.

is the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is it laudable
conduet on my part merely to sit in silent
admiration, or to stand up and wave my hands
in glorification of a Government that already
glorifies itself?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is the complaint of my right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So far as the
management of the last war is concerned, I
am going to say something that I have not
said before: I ask the leader of the House
and the leader of the Government and all those
who keep harking back to the past, just keep
in your minds that the last war was won.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
other conditions.

Yes, but under

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Do not forget
that, please. I do not intend to make comparisons. I could do so. We should never
get anywhere by reviewing the conduct of the
last war. Just keep in mind the ultimate
result.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: After the United
States came in.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shall not
say anything further on regulations. We have
had a promise from the Minister again to-day,
and I stop there for the time being. But the
gist of the reply of the honourable leader
of the House to my friend on the left (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) is tîat Britain does not want
men. Of course we all know, as the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) bas said, this is quite a different
war from the last, and men without equipment are not of great value. But let it not
be stated in bald terms, "Britain does not
want men." I ask the leader of the House
and honourable members generally to keep in
mind in days more crucial, which, I fear, are
not very far ahead, the words we heard this
afternoon: "Britain does not want men."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I was repeating the words of Hon. Mr. Ralston, Minister
of National Defence.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable membens, after th lionourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) had spoken I had
intended to say a word as to the necessity of
having men ready. I do not care what representations were made by the Minister of
National Defence himself or by the British
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Government so far as the necessity for men
is concerned. Is there anywhere in the world
to-day anyone who can say with any authority whatever what man-power may be
required? Nobody can. Let me for a moment
draw a possible picture. Suppose that in a
blitzkrieg the Germans get a safe landingplace in Great Britain. How many millions
of men could they pour into that country in
a comparatively short time, as they have done
elsewhere, most effectively, in days or at
most in weeks? Great Britain at the present
time bas a strong, capable defence force of
one and a half million men. We all hope it
will succeed in frustrating any attempt at
invasion; but again I ask, Who at this time
can say what the result of a blitzkrieg would
be? What was Winston Churchill's picture
of it? He said: "We will fight on our sands,
we will fight on our shores, we will fight in
our streets, we will fight on our hills, we will
fight in our valleys, until every man is dead;
and from England we will go to the shores
of our colonies and continue the fight there."

And will my honourable
not be necessary?

Yes, if necessary.
friend say it will

Hon. Mr. COPP: No, nor will I say at
this time that it will be necessary.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Exactly. The only
point I wish to make is this, that Canada
should exert every effort to prepare as many
men as she can for any struggle there may be
in the futureSome Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

-and
not simply
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
rest content with the getting together and
equipping of two divisions.
Hon. Mr. COPP: What evidence bas my
honourable friend that the Government is
not making tbat very preparation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Look around.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Where is the evidence? We have just had a statement that
the First and Second Divisions are overseas
and that the British Government wants no
more men.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And yet we
are recruiting and preparing to train three
hundred thousand more men.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Giving them
a month's training, starting in March.
My only point is
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
this: we must not get into our heads the idea
that in this struggle which the British Commonwealth faces men will not be needed, or

AUGUST 2, 1940
that men are flot needed now. I fear the
struggle will be very much harder than we are
anticipating.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Why try to give the
public the impression that we are going to lose
this war, as the honourable gentleman is trying
to do to-day?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is my honourable friend referring to?
Hon. Mr. COPP: To the staternent my
honourable friend has just made.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have only stated
wbat the bead of the British Government
stated in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. COPP: 1 say to my bonourable
friend, instead of having doubts about the
future, have confidence in what we are doing.
We are doing the best we can to assist the
Mother Country and also to protect and defend
ourselves if the war comes here.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:- I am afraid my bonourable friend is getting a littie excited.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I am not getting excited.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I ask my honourable
friend and every other member of this House
whetber it is not legitimate to inquire as to the
number of men who may be needed in this
life-and-death struggle which is going on at
the present time. Because I do so, my honourable friend suggests I am intimating to the
public of Canada that we are defeated, or
about to, be defeated.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable gentleman
has said hie is afrajd of it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
arn afraid of it at aIl.

I have neyer said I

Hlon. Mr. COPP: And hie has also been
intimating to the public that those in charge
of the affairs of this country are not carrying
ou as best they can to make proper preparations.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is the very thing
the bonourable gentleman has been talking
about.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It is a mild inference.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I did not. I was replying to a statement made by the bonourable
mcmber from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
and by the bonourable leader of the Ilouse
as well.

427

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
bonourable gentleman, does hie tbink the Gerrnans can land two or three million men
in a blitzkrieg invasion of England?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Do you think s0
for a moment?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should think not.
But we know wbat they have done elsewbere,
and donc in a cornparatively short time.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: By land.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Whether or not they
can do so in this situation I do not know,
and nobody else knows. I wish to make reference to only one part of what the honourable
member frorn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdoek)
said,' and that is about the necessity of preparation of men for the confliet ahead. In my
view, no matter what statements are made
by anybody, nobody knows what men will be
required if we are eventually to win out.
Nobody at the present time can possibly know
what form, this struggle will take. If we are
to exert our full effort in the struggle which
is bound to corne, then Canada must have
the prelirninary work donc in order to supply
what mca we think should be supplicd.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is just wbat is being
donc and bas been donc rigbt along.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has my bonourable friend any doubt as to the Minister of
National Defence and bis departmnent doing
the very thing wbich. he suggests?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I sirnply took the
statements that the First Division bas been
in England for sorne months and that the
Second Division bas landed.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: No.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Both papers this
afternoon, the Evening Journal and the
Evening Citizen, say yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And a Third and a
Fourth Division are in sight.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On paper.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: On paper. Yes, I
presume tbat is wbat it means. At the sanie
tirne the intimation was given that the British
Govcrnrnent did not require any more mcn.
That is wbat I was answcring.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: At the present moment.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Just at tbis minute.
But what may be required two weeks or tbrec
weeks from now?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Preparations are being
made for it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: All right. God speed
the man who is making the preparations.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to speak once, and very
briefly, when so many honourable senators
have been allowed to speak at length and
I do not want to say much;
repeatedly?
I do not need to, because there is very
little new in what we have heard to-day
as compared with what we have been listening to since the beginning of tbis session.
This kind of "oratory"-and I emphasize the
"Tory" end of it-will never dislodge the
Germans from Poland, which, after all, was
one of the primary aims of this war.
I am surprised, and almost amused, to
note the lack of confidence in and admiration
for the present Minister of National Defence
on tho part of our honourable friends opposite,
who w'rso gonerous in thoir eulogies of
1im when he was Minister of Finance. That
a man who was so efficient a few weeks ago
should become of so little use to his country
now is amazing.

I am more consistent than

my honotirable friends. I trust the Minister of
Nat1onal Defence to-day as I trusted the
Minister of Finanoe yesterdav. He is still in
the sorvice of bis country and is giving of bis
list efforts to win the war.
So far as information from the Government is concerned, J do not know why there
is so much complaint in this House-on one
side particularly. if not exclusively -about
the people at large and members of Parliament not being informed. As I stated before,
I happen to be in the publishing business,
and J may say that not one day elapses that
we publishers do net receive some information and documentation as to the progress of
the present Administration in fighting the
war. I hold in my band at this momentRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Just because
the Public Information BurcauHon. Mr. LACASSE: I did not interrupt
the right honourable gentleman wlien lie was
speaking, and I hope ho is net going to interrupt me now. I hold in my hand a long
document which was sent to the daily and
weekly Press of Canada a few days ago
for immediate publication. Believe it or not,
even this slow-moving Government is one
step ahead of the impetuous leader of the
present Opposition in the Senate. Believe
it or not, we have bere in this document
all the information wliich my right honourable friend is so eager to get, and for which
Hon. Mr. CALDER,

he bas been asking ever since the beginning
of this session.
I cannot read the whole
document. It would take too long, and it
is in French. I had an English copy, but I
cannot lay my hand on it just now. I shall
net therefore undertake to translate the
French version as I speak. I would gladly
do se, tbough, were we not at so late a
stage in this session.
May I be permitted to declare here, in
passing, that no force in the world, net even
Hitlerian tyranny. will ever silence the resousnding echoes of the "verbo de France."
The French language will continue to be
heard in Canada, where it is official, and
it will remain universaI thbroughout the world.
As I say, this comprehensive document is
in French, and because of its length I will
not attempt te translate it. But J bave all
the information here, and I beg my right
honourable friend to believe me.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
French.

He should learn

He made a very
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
laudalble offort to Io so in the past, and I
compliment bim on it.
I ask my right honourable friend to believe
that there is no man who is more interested
in the youth of the country than I am. I
do net say more. I do not wish to be more
personal than necessary. I ask him to believe
that I have an interest in these things at
this time as a true citizen of Canada and as
the father of a family. I ask him to believe
that I have read this document with the
greatest interest possible, and that after having done so I am fully satisfied that I have
been given all the information that is necessary or desirable. This is the only opportunity left me te speak on this subject in the
Senate, and J believe I am using it legitimately.
Everything is here. I will read it if the
right honourable gentleman wants it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Wbat is it?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Complete informationRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The regulations?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Complete information
from the department as to the means which will
be adopted to carry out the intention of the
Covernment as far as military training is
concerned.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
regulations, and nothing else.

I want the

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: This is the explanation of the regulations, the explanation in

toto of the intention of the Government.
If it were in English, I would read it at
lengthHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will get the
English version for nine o'clock.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the English
version has been summarized and has not
been laid on the Table before being given to
the Press, the offence is worse than ever.
We have a right to receive, contemporaneously
with the Commons, all the regulations; and
nothing else will answer me, no matter what
it is.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: You have here in
detail a statement of what will take placeRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I want the
regulations.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Of course, I am only
the father of a family, and I cannot claim,
when I do speak on such sacred matters, to
have the same authority as the vituperative
leader of a vituperative party.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Ever since the beginning of this session we have been listening to
an egging-on programme of: "Go on. You
never do enough in whatever you undertake.
More men are needed to be sent abroad," etc.
I may remind my right honourable friend
that there is still a country in the world by
the name of Canada, and that it happens to be
much larger and more difficult to protect than
England. It also happens to be the largest
Dominion in the British Empire, and I do
not think England's situation would be much
improved should this country go under first.
We have to think of ourselves and protect our
coasts. I do not think I am less loyal than
anyone when I make this statement.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I be permitted a
word?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He is not
through.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Oh, I beg pardon.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I could say much
more, but I have exhausted what I intended
to say to-day. In concluding I promise honourable gentlemen not to rise again and make
ten speeches in one debate, contrary to the
rules of the House.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I do not intend to contravene the rules of the House, but I think
I may be permitted a word of personal explanation arising out of the remarks of the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Copp).

I have no intention whatever of criticizing
the efforts made by the Government in
connection with the war. I have not done so,
and I do not intend to do so. As a matter
of fact-and I shall be brief-I think we are
very fortunate in having a man like the
Hon. Mr. Ralston at the head of the Department of National Defence at the present time.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Louder!
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I say I think we are
very fortunate in having a man like the
Hon. Mr. Ralston at the head of the Department of National Defence at the present time.
He is a very capable man, a man in whom I
have great confidence. I am sure he will do
splendid work in connection with the war.
To pass along to the gentleman who is in
charge of the Department of Munitions and
Supply, we all admit, without exception, that
if any man has worked hard and effectively
it is the Hon. Mr. Howe. He deserves the
greatest credit. In the first period of the war,
as we know now, he was hampered in many
ways; but when he has had a chance to do
something really worth while he has done it,
and done it splendidly. I say that without
any hesitation at all.
At the head of the Air Ministry is my old
friend whom we used to call "Chubby"
Power. He is a man we all respect. He is
very popular and very able, and I am quite
sure he is doing splendid work.
These are the three key men in our war
effort. I do not criticize them or their work;
I have not done so during this entire session;
and when an honourable gentleman on the
other side accuses me of doing that kind of
thing it arouses my resentment. All I did
was to speak on the question of the necessity
for men in the future, and some honourable
gentlemen have endeavoured to twist and
turn my words into a criticism of what the
Government has been doing. I had no intention of making any such criticism.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, my
honourable friend says he resents the remarks
I directed across the floor of the House. I
understood as clearly as I understand the
English language that he, along with the
leader of the other side, was criticizing the
Government for not making sufficient progress
in carrying on the war.
Hon Mr. CALDER: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
accept the charge.

for and confidence in not only the Minister of
National Defence, but other Ministers as
well. In this I agree with him.
My idea in relation to this war is the same
as it was in relation to the last one. During
that war I had the opportunity of sitting in
the other House and listening to a great deal
of criticism of the Government, and a great
many explanations by the Government of
what it was doing. I realized then that it was
impossible to give to the people all the information they were asking for. You cannot
make public all that the Government is doing
in time of war.
I should have every confidence in the
loyalty and ability of my right honourable
friend if he were in a position to help in
carrying on the war. Unfortunately for the
country, perhaps, he is not. I have an
outstanding respect for the present members
of the Government and all who are assisting
them. I believe they are doing their very
best, and are capable of carrying on.
I
believe they are loyal. Some of us, just
because we are not closely allied with them,
think that something may be wrong, or that
w e should do differently. I believe that the
Minister of National Defence, the Minister
of Defence for Air, the Minister of Munitions
and Supply, and all the others, with the
assistance of the advisers they have about
them, are doing the very best they can. In
the Department of Defence, which is largely
responsible for the conduct of Canada's war
efforts, there are generals, colonels and other
leaders advising the Government, and they
are largely responsible for directing the work
which is being carried on.
I did not intend to offer any affront to the
honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder), but I say that the least we can do
is to have confidence in those who are
carrying on, and to refrain from criticizing
little things, and asking for information to
which we are not entitled, and which would
do us no good if we had it. Instead of
instilling into the publie mind a sort of
despondency, I say we should be optimistic.
I believe we can win this war; but we can do
that only if we work together and avoid
indulging in carping criticism because some
little things that we think should be done
have not been done.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I do not think it is proper that whenever our
leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
criticizes the Government for what is or is not
being done he should be told that he is
critical only because he is not in power. We
all have a perfect right to urge upon the
Government that more men be trained and
Hon. Mr. COPP.

sent overseas as speedily as possible, regardless of what we are told the British Government says. It should be obvious to every
honourable senator that there is no other reply
England could make than that she bas men
enough. If I were conducting a battle out
here and hollered for help immediately it
started, that certainly would not make a good
impression. I repeat it is perfectly obvious
that England could not say anything but
that she bas enough men. And we, as a
partner, ought to be proceeding with our war
efforts faster than we are.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators,
early this afternoon I asked a question which
apparently stirred up a good deal of criticism.
However, I still have no answer to the question. When I return to the part of the country
in which I live, I want to be able to say
that such and such are the regulations under
the Mobilization Act, and that the policy of
the Government is this and that. I think that
my people out there would consider me a
very stupid fellow if, when I went home, I
said: "I do not know anything about the
regulations. You read the papers; so you know
more than I do."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has my honourable friend not read the statement of the
Minister of National Defence?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I put that question to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, I have. But the
trouble is that the Minister's statement does
not give the details about the regulations, and
tat
is the information I want. I saw in
one newspaper that single men from 21 to 24
would be called up first. I believe that statement was made on the authority of Hon. Mr.
Gardiner, the Minister of National War Services. But somebody else said the call would
be limited this year to single men of 21
and 22, and that no married men would be
called until a year hence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is my honourable friend familiar with all the information
given in the speech by Hon. Mr. Ralston, the
Minister of National Defence?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I heard most of it myself
from the gallery of the other House. The
greater part of what he said dealt with what
the Government has been doing. The thing
I am interested in is what it is going to do
in future.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tîat.

He told about

AUGUST 2, 194
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Let me make it clear that
I amrn ot crjticizjng. I simply want some
information. The people of France were told
by their Governiment that the country was
ready to defend itself against Germany. The
fact was, as we now know, that France
was not ready at ail. Holland was advised by
outsiders that it should join witb Great
Britain and France in a policy of offence and
defence, but the Government of the country
thought it was safer to remain neutral. Mr.
Chamberlain said that Hitler missed the bus
in going to Norway. Missed the bus! H1e
was tbe driver of the bus! 1 arn not questioning the sincerity of my honourable friend's
beliefs or of the Government's beliefs, but
there is a question in my mind as to wbether
the Government may not be wrong in the
policy it is pursuing. In my humble opinion,
which I admit is not worth much, the war
ultimately will be won, not on the sea nor
in the air, but as ail wars since the beginning
of Christendom have been won, on the land,
by men behind guns. It is they wbo have
aiways won wars and who, I think, always
will win tbem. We are told that Britain
does flot need men. Then wby bas she
cailed up one million men this montb?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Tbey are at
home.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ail right, but they must
be needed in the army there. Uitimateiy,
in a year or two years, whenever it may be,
we sball bave to go to Europe and defeat
the Germans by taiking to them in the only
language they understand.
Hon. Mr. KING: The Minister said that in
bis speech the otber night.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know, but that is not
what has been said in this House to-day. I
know the honourabie gentleman from Parkdaie
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) was speaking with good
intentions, but I disagree with his view that
men are not needed. We ought to Jet the
people know tbat men are needed.
Hon. Mr. KING: The Minister said so.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The impression I have
gatbered from officiai statements is that Britain
bas told us she does flot require more men
from us. I must say quite candidiy that
reeruiting in Canada at present indicates the
public do not reaiize the fact that we do need
men. The calling up of 300,000 men for one
month's training will not have very farreaching results. Six or nine months must
be the minimum of time in which a man could
acquire any familiarity with mechanized
metbods of modern warfare.

431

I repeat that I arn not criticizîng the
Government. My point is that I want the
Government to tell Parliament, of which this
House is a part, wbat the regulations are. I
want to know, for instance, what are the age
groups to be cailed up, 'what are to be the
grounds for exemption, and how the tribunals
are to he constituted.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: And who will
select them.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Exactly-who wili select
tbem. In short, wbat is the set-up? I want
to be able to say to the young men of Manitoba that the set-up is so-and-so; tbat, let
us say, those from 21 to 24 will be cailed
first, that farmers are exempt or not, as the
case may be, and that lawyers are exempt or
flot. I believe 1 arn entitled to that informnation, If the Government says, "Parliament is
flot entitled to that information," I shall be
satisfied with that answer.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shahl not.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I shail flot be satisfied
permanently, and I do flot tbink the country
wii11 be. You will not get the best effort out
of Canada in tbat way. You can get
Canadians to do their best only by telling
them tbe facts. Evýen if the facts were unfavourable, I should make them known. I think
Canadians can stand up to the truth. If the
fact is that uitimately we shall have to raise
baîf a million men or more to go to Europe
aod fight, the Government shouid state that
to the people. There would be no fainting.
There is more fear in Canada over wbat
people do flot know than there would be if
tbey knew everything.
On the i2tb of Juiy I first asked for details
of the regulations under the Mobilization
Act, and every few days since then I have
pressed for an answer. If the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) wiii say tbat
no answer can be given, I sbali be through.
But I submit the question should be answered,
and I do ask bim now to see that the rules
and regulations are presented to us, if possible,
before prorogation, which it now appears will
take place to-morrow. If hie says tbey will
not be ready then, I shall be satisfied-for I
amrnfot pressing as hard as my right honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) isto be toid that a copy of tbem wili be sent
out to every senator next Monday or Tuesday.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:- Then you
would not be able to say anything about them.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn not so concerned
about tbat. I think it is detrimental tu our
greatest possible war effort that we. members

SENATE
of Parliament, have not ail the information
we should have. If it were given to us the
people ail over the country would feel confident that we at least knew what was going
on and were doing our best to help make
a success of the Government's war policy. I
plead with the honourable leader to let us
have the rules and regulations by nine o'clock
to-night, or, should that net be possible, tomorrow. If the Government finds later on
thiat some changes are necessary, I shall not
criticize it for that. It is only human to
make errors. In the event that the regulations cannot be made public, then give them
to us in private, so that when we go home
we shall have basic information upon which
to advise our people.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the regulatinns are given to us in private, how shall
we be able to tell our people about them?
J think my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend from Winnipeg SouthCentre (Hon. Mr. Haig) already bas obtained
considerable information from the statement
made in the other House by the Minister of
National Defence.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That has nothing at ail to do with the regulations. I will
tell the honourable leader what I have in
mind. I have information to the effect that
the tribunals, which last time were chosen
in the fairest way the human mind could
deviso, are to be selected this time solely
by the Minister on the authority of the
Governor in Council. In every case where a
judge can be found, one member will be a

that is the fact, and I should like to be told

My right honourable friend is asking about

COMPENSATION (DEFENCE) BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 123, an Act respecting the
payment of compensation for the taking of
certain property for war purposes.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: I would refer honourable members
to the explanatory note contained in the Bill.
It reads:
The purpose of the proposed Bill is to lay
down rules for the fixing of compensation and
the payment thereof in respect of the taking of
ships and aircraft for war purposes under
section seven of the War Measures Act and
the application by Order in Council, if so
desired, to any other Act of Parliament.
The Bill is substantially the same as corresponding sections in the Compensation (Defence)
Act, 1939, passed by Parliament in the United
Kingdom, except that it is limited to the two
classes of property above mentioned. The Act
of the United Kingdom is, for obvions reasons,
much broader in scope and applies to certain
classes of property in addition to those above
mentioned.
As regards the basis upon which compensation
is to be payable, the Bill adopts the principle
of the Act of the United Kingdom, namely, that
compensation is payable on pre-war values. The
reason for the selection of pre-war values as the
basis of compensation for the taking of ships
is that, as a result of the disappearance of practically all European shipping other than British,
the requisitioning of all British shipping, the
partial requisition of Canadian shipping and
the elimination of American shipping from the

433

European trade, values now existing are purely
artificial. The same reasoning applies to the
taking of aircraft. The only real ascertainable
values are those which ships or aircraft had
before the war.
The legislation is of necessity very detailed.
Owing to the fact that at the time of the
requisitioning of a vessel or aircraft the period
of the requisition is uncertain, it is impossible
to fix a lump sum by way of compensation at
the outset. Such a lump sum could be fixed
at the end of the period, but in the meantime
the parties interested in the vessel would receive
no payment. The Bill is, therefore, drafted to
provide that compensation by way of rent or
charter of hire will be payable periodically,
that any expenses will be immediately repaid
and that any damage in excess of fair wear
and tear or due to special war risk will be
paid for at the end of the period. Further, as
different persons may be interested in the vessel
at different times during the period of requisition, provision is made to ensure that payment
is made to the proper person.
The proposed Bill, in its substantive provisions, follows very closely the wording of
corresponding sections in the Act of the United
Kingdom. The only changes other than the
limitation in its scope-that
is, the limitation ta aircraft and
vessels-.
-mentioned above, have been made to fit the
legislation of the United Kingdom into the
Canadian scheme of legislation contained in the
War Measures Act and the Orders in Council,
including the Defence of Canada Regulations,
made thereunder.
I think this gives a fair summary of the
scope of the Bill.
I have this statement from our Law Clerk:
I have no amendments to propose to this Bill
as introduced in the House of Commons, and
unless a further memo is presented after the
Bill is passed in that House, it may be taken
that I have no amendments to propose to the
Bill as so passed.
Right flon. ART.HUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, none of us has had time to
read this measure, and certainly it is one of
some importance.
At first I was rather
puzzled as to why a Bill should be necessary
now to enable the Government ta pay for
such things as aircraft and ships. It certainly
can take them and leave the matter of payment to adjustment or ta the ordinary process
of law. But I presume where compulsory
taking is necessary, that is to say, where it is
impossible ta arrive at terms with the sellers,
there may be some requirement in the way
of a basis of value on expropriation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
visional payment made.

say, the Government is not always taking it as
an asset, but may be taking only the use of
it for a time.
The Bill, as I am informed, follows in the
main the British Act passed last year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If so, it is
probably all right. The Minister says the
basis of expropriation-which, no doubt, means
the basis of taking the property, net of
taking the use of it-is the value prior to the
war. Would that apply where you take the
use of a vessel or a plane?
It is quite fair to say that values of ships
and aircraft are higher now. Ships are certainly higher in value. It is hardly fair to
say the value is artificially higher. It is
higher for a reason very well known. A conpany would find it exceedingly difficult to
replace its ships at this time. I have no objection to the measure, but I can see that its
provisions might be exercised very oppressively.
In this connection, I have more than once
had a complaint as to the passing of vessels
to Government use. I do not know whether
they actually pass to the Government or to
a board. The complaint comes from the employees. I am informed that it is not the
British Government which is concerned, but
just what the set-up is I do not know. The
complaint is that vessels passed over to the
Government or to this governmental board
are almost invariably old hulks which have
been laid aside, and that the Government is
undertaking to put them in shape, at a cost
of many thousands of dollars, and give

not assuming responsibility for this statement at all; I am not even saying the Government itself is actually doing the purchasing, or is responsible for the board; but it is
said these old hulks are being passed off for
war purposes at fantastic prices, and that
better vessels command no more than the old
hulks.
Honourable
Hon. N. M. PATERSON:
senators, as I am in the shipping business and
have had some of my vessels requisitioned by
the Government, I may be able to give some
information with respect to this matter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Requisitioned
by the Government?
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: By the Canadian
Government, acting for the Ministry of Shipping of the United Kingdom, as represented
by Sir Edward Beatty.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I understand it, the complaint refers, not to that case
at all, but to ships going to others.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

May I explain
Hon. Mr. PATERSON:
this in any case?
The British Ministry of Shipping asked for
some Canadian ships. The only ships we
could give them were of the inland water
type, suitable for canal work-two hundred
and forty-two feet long, and having a depth
of fourteen feet. They carry about three
thousand tons.
That refers

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
to the Welland Canal.

terms of bushels. The older type of vessel
was built heavy, with the engine aft, and

carried
through the canal. As these vessels did not
pay very well, we devised a type-what is
called the Calderwood design-which carries
up to ninety-seven thousand bushels on
fourteen feet draught. It is built differently,
and comes from England loaded with coal
or clay, goes through the canal, and does
not go out again on the ocean. Great Britain
required coast-wise shipping. She wanted to
replace ships running to France and releasse
another type of ship for other duties.
Certain ship owners met the British Ministry of Shipping, and while they had already
made a deal for eight obsolete ships, they
agreed that our ships could be requisitioned.
Some owners were willing to give a proportion of their ships; others were not. Under
these circumstances the only thing to do was
to force the owners, on a percentage basis,
and the Canadian Government requisitioned
those ships on a percentage basis and turned
them over.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
meant by a percentage basis?
Hon. Mr. PATERSON:

on most of the ships, it was necessary to give
some undertaking that the ships would be
insured; so the British Ministry of Shipping entered into such an undertaking for
a certain sum.
The question of the value of these ships
before the war, or after, is a very difficult one.

AUGUST 2, 1940
If you wanted fo find the value of a ship,
you would practically have to go into the
details of a dry-dock contract, and that takes
time. Furthermore. to-day it might take
three years to build a ship. The value of
a ship mighf. have been 32,000 pounds before
the war, and it might be 45ý,000 or 50,000
pounds to-day.
But you would have f0
wait three or four years to get delivery. So
the British Ministry of Shipping gave an
undertaking ta the Canadian Director of
Shipping f0 insure these ships at a certain
sum. and took them on a basis of $125 a
day, bare boat, for the time they are in
commission.
As these ships are now on the way out,
they have had to be altered considerahiy
f0 make thcm suitable for ocean work. For
instance, the hatches, which in fresh water
are about eight inches high, were increased
to twcnty-four inches for sait water.
The
strong-backs, which are the steel beams
across the ship, and which for fresh wafer
are of a certain size, were more than doubled.
As the vessels were buit for fresh water and
short trips, they were nlot as strong in the
bow and the 5f ern as they would be for ocean
t raffie, and had tri be reinforced.
As no
ships had been bujît for Canada for ten
years, they ail required overhauling, and
had f0 be placed in docks such as those at
Halifax, Quebec, Port Dalhousie and other
places.
My first ship, the Collingdoc, has now
arrivcd on the other side loaded with timber.
One vessel, I think, has been lost in Zeebrugge harbour with a load of cement. It
must give Canadians a feeling of pride to
know that Canada has been able fo contribute
some twenty-nine ships, I fhink if is, towards
the cause of Great Britain. These were flot
old ships. Most of them were in the canal
business, carrying grain, pulpwood and coal,
and the sending of them to Britain bas
meant a considerable sacrifice ta the trade
and fa Canada; but the owners, recognizing the necessify and the exigencies of the
case, have contributed their ships readily.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hear, hear.
Hlon. Mr. PATERSON:
The rentai -of
$125 a day is very small when one considers
whaf these vessels have ta earn in seven
months in the canais. Fortunately for us-and yet unfortunately-they will not be
badly needed in the grain business this fail,
because of the lack of movement of grain.
On the other hand, by reason of the shutting
off of Norwegian business, the ground woodpulp business and the coal business have
probably doubled or trebled, and a greaf dcal

NATIONAL WAR SERVICES-REGISTRATION AND MýOBILIZATION
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I was queried somewhat sharply

this affernorin by my honourable friend from

Winnipeg Soufh-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
hy the right honourable gentleman who faces
me jusf now, and who has been facing me for
some time (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), on
the question of the regulations emnanating
from the Minister of Nation-al War Services
as to registrafion and the calling up of varîous
classes for training. I now have a statement
of the basis of these regulations. They are
af present in the hands of Colonel George
H. Cassels (of Blake, Lash, Anglin and
C-assels), Brigadier Orde and Maurice Bois,
vert, Crown Attorney of Quebec, who have
been for some time and are now working on
them: I have been in contact wifh Colonel
Cassels and have asked him if the regulations

0-1:

436

which he bas prepared, and which we have
been in hopes of bringing to Parliament before
prorogation, were in reality based on the statement made on the 30th of July by the
Honourable Minister of National War Services. Colonel Cassels tells me: "That is
exactly so. These are the figures and the
enactments that we are now whipping into
shape." He added that if the Senate wanted
him to come before one of its committees, ho
would explain what he and his associates are
doing, and how far they are advanced in
their work.
I shall read the statement which is the
basis of the work they are carrying on. This
is the statement that was made in the other
House on July 30:
At

the

expense

of

repeatig

some

things

already contained in the regulations tabled in
the House, and statements already made in
this Bouse, I propose to review the whole
procedure to be adopted by the department in
registering our human resources, so that it can
be found in one place in Hansard.
The national registration takes place on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, August 19,
20 and 21. The geographical uits for the
registration are the electoral federal constituencies, whieh are, in turn, subdivided into
polling subdivisions, the boundaries of which
are the saine as the polling subdivisions in
connection with the Dominion election of
March last.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the
honourable gentleman permit me? That is
the procedure for the registration, and is
of very little importance. What we want are
the regulations for the calling up of men,
and the exemptions.
Then I will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
omit some of the statement and come te
that point. After stating that there will be
twelve boards, namely, one for each of the
eleven military districts and one for the
province of Prince Edward Island, the Minister went on:
Each board will be headed by a judge of a
superior court, or where deemed advisable, by
a judge of a lesser court, of the province in
which the appropriate military district is
situate.
The Chief Justice of the province will be
asked to noininate this judge, and lie will be
appointed by Order in Council. As a matter
of fact, these judges have practically all been
nominated in this manner already.
Each board will consist of three members
and, as I have said, a judge shall be the chairman of each board. The other two merbers
of each board will be representative citizens
of the district in which the board will have
jurisdiction.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend apparently thinks that somehow it may be possible through these boards
to have preference given to supporters of the
party in power. As I proceed he will find the
boards are to have only two simple functions,
in the exercise of which there could be no
political bias; so I hope his suspicions will
disappear. The fact is that no individual will
be entitled to appear before the boards.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The boards will not
deal with individuals?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Only with classes?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Somebody
will have to deal with individuals.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend bear with me? The statement is net very long.

It will be impossible, with a board of three,
to have all the various phases of the econormic
life of the country represented on the board,
but this will be kept in mind in the appointments, so that the members of the board will
he
fully conversant with the predominant
inidustries of the district in which the board
lias jurisdiction.
These boards will be located at the same
point as the headquarters of the military districts, except in the case of Prince Edward
Island, whero the iceadquarters will be in
Charlottetown.
Each board will have a district registrar
wliose duty it will be to look after the administrative end of the organization and who will
be answerable to the Department of National

War Services.
The registrars for the constituencies, after
tiey have classified the cards of al] the singl
mîen. 19 to 45, inîto age groups, will then send
tliese copies of cards in to the district registrar.
It willb h bis duty to direct the tabulation
and siilexing of these cards, so that he will
have in bis office a complete record of al]
single iiien between the said ages for the whole
territory unler tle jurisdiction of the board.
As
stated by the Minister of National
Defence, the military authorities vili indicate
the nmber of single men they propose to train
withinî a year in Canada, and the Department

AUGUST 2, 1940
of National Defence will advise this department
of the number of men it wishes to call up for
training at any one time.
All training of classes called up is to be
completed within a year, and it is the intention
to make eight calls within the year and to
space these calls equally as nearly as possible.
As soon as the national registration is over,
the registrar for each constituency will indicate
to the Department of National War Services
the number of single men in each of the age
groups in the electoral district over which he
is registrar, and thus we shall know at once
the number of single men in each group between
19 and 45 in Canada.
The Department of National Defence, with
this information, will advise the Department
of National War Services as soon as possible
after this information is available, as to the
number of men it wants called up on the
first call.
As soon as possible after it is ascertained
what year classes will have to te called to
meet the first demand of the Department of
National Defence, a proclamation will be issued,
warning all persons within such classes, conmencing with the 21-year-old class, that they
will be called for service within a certain
designated time.
This will be donc to give them a chance of
arranging their own affairs.
Every single person, male, who is medically
fit, between the ages of 21 and 45, in Canada,
may be compelled to take military training
within one year.
It is possible that the requirements of the
Department of National Defence will be satisfied by the calling up of single men from 21
to 35, and it may not have to go beyond this
in the first year.

This factor depends on the result of the
national registration and the number of men
the Department of National Defence can train
within the year. The only exceptions not subject to call will be as follows:
(a) Judges of superior, district or county
courts of justice;
(b) Regular clergymen or ministers of
religions denominations, members of the clergy
or religious orders;
(c) Members of the naval, military, or air
forces of Canada on active service;
(d) Those who, in the opinion of thé Minister of National Defence, have already received
military training, within the previous twelve
months, at least equivalent to that to te given
to men being called up under these regulations;
(e) Members of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police or provincial police forces;
(f) Members of the police forces and fire
brigades permanently employed in any incorporated city;
(g) Wardens and officers of all penitentiaries,
prisons, and lunatic asylums or mental hospitals.
Under an Order in Council passed in 1873,
certain privileges with respect to military service were given to a sect of persons known
as Mennonites, and under Order in Council
passed in 1898 certain privileges with respect
to military service were granted to the sect
known as Dukhobors.
It is the intention of the Government to
recognize these Orders in Council, and a method
of dealing with the individuals who feel they
are entitled to the benefits of these Orders in
Council will be worked out and duly announced.

437

Every employer of labour in the district,
under the jurisdiction of the board, shall be
required forthwith to furnish the board witb
a list of all single male employees between the
ages of 21 and 45.
Any industry shall be entitled to submit a
plan to the district registrar for the calling
up for military training, within the said period
of one year, of its single male employees from
the ages of 21 to 45.
The plan so submitted must provide for the
training of all their em.ployees within the year,
but can te adjusted by, the industries in such
a way as to enable all to te trained within the
year in a manner which will interfere in the
least possible way with the conduct of the
business of the industry. The men subject to
call from any industry shall be divided into
equal groups, so that the same number of men
will come up for training on each call.
The district registrar, on receiving this, shall
submit it to the board, and the board shall
fix a date for hearing, and shall hear a representative of the industry submait the plan, and

the board will have the right to either -approve,
reject or vary the plan.
That is one of the two functions of the boards.
After it is approved, either in the form submitted, or as varied, then the men therein listed
shall te called as therein provided.
Now I come to the boards' second function.
It will te seen they are to deal with groups
only.
The Department of National War Services
will submit to the board in each military district
a list of the main seasonal industries within
the jurisdiction of such board, and the periods
during which it is inadvisable to call men for
training from such industries, and it shall be
the duty of the board so to adjust the call of
men within its jurisdiction as to interfere as
little as possible with the conduct of such
seasonal industry.
The board will also have the right, in the
case of a student at a recognized college or
university, to postpone his call until the end
of the scholastic year, provided the college or
university has a system of compulsory military
training in effect in the institution.
The Lepartment of National War Services
will te charged with the responsibility of
having all men called up for training medically
examined, and will arrange for qualified medical
men to te located at points throughout the
district, under the jurisdiction of the board,
convenient to those to be called.
All men called up will have to pass the same
type of examination as they would have to pass
if they were volunteering for service in the
non-permanent militia.
The medical examiners will place all persons
examined in their proper medical categories
in accordance with the practice of the Department of National Defence. It is intended to
call up all men in the category of C-1 and
above that, in the classes from time te time
called.
After each call is made, the person to be
called up will receive a notice in writing telling
him where te submit to his medical examination,
and where to go for his period of military
training.

AUGUST 2, 1940
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These are treated
as seasonal classes, not as individuals.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Here is the

joke: the men called up are not joining the
army at all.

cannot train the men who are determined to

Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, many of them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. They are
going home as soon as their thirty days' training is over. They have to be taken back by
their employers. They are not sworn to be
servants of the Crown from that time on.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN.D:

They are when

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is only an
outing. To give the impression that under
compulsion of law these men we are to train

will be soldiers in the army from the day
they are called up, is to my mind absurd.

In the first place you could no more train
300,000 soldiers than fly to the moon. I happen
to know this-and there is no one who does
not: we cannot train the men we have now
authorized to be trained. It is impossible ta

equip them even to the extent the First
Division was equipped when it went over; and
that division was not trained at that time, but
only starting to be trained. We cannot provide
training and equipment to-day for the Second
Division; we cannot for the Third.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will show
my honourable friend a copy of the correspondence. A mere thousand men out there,
and we cannot get them trained! The fact
is the men of the Permanent Force were
taken into the First Division, and now we

This is for the

go over and join their brothers in the same
regiment in England. In face of that, what
moonshine it is to talk of training 300,000
men and calling up so many in this or that

division!

We have nobody to train men.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

What would

you do?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would get
so many men into the army, and keep them

there, and train them as fast as we can, and
not attempt to train 300,000 men. The
expense of training that number, even for

three months, will be terrific, and then you
will not have a fraction of those men permanently. You should get your men into
training to fight. I do not know how you are

going to clothe them.

With the thermometer

at 90 and over in Toronto, the soldiers were
in their winter uniforms. We talk about

training. Are you going to have the men in
mufti while training them?

I do not know

that it would be so very terrible, but it
would not be creditable to the country. The
point is, there are not facilities here for
adequate training. Why partly train 300,000
when you do not know whether you can get
10,000 of them in shape to fight? To my

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very good. If
there is no serious purpose, those fellows will
be no further ahead than when they started;

know a man in a city in Canada whose whole
heart and soul are in the war. He has begged
the Minister, of whom he is a personal friend,
to permit some of the officers of the First
Division to come back and help train one
of the regiments which are represented in that

division, because otherwise the regiment cannot get training even with the paltry equipment
we have here. He cannot get that donc. I
do not think the Minister's reasons are sound,
but they are perfectly understandable. The
Minister says: " We cannot take these men out.

It is not fair to them, nor to those over there."
The other man takes the ground: "That may
be, but this training is vital; we have to
reinforce those boys over there." But the
training is not being given.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I would respectfully
make this suggestion to the Government. A
large number of veterans who fought in the
last war have passed the age when they can be
enlisted or considered A-1 risks. They are
not physically fit, but I think they would
serve the purpose as fairly experienced trainers,
having themselves learned what war is. It
seems to me that the Department of National
Defence should give favourable consideration
to these veterans when they offer their services.
I think my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honourable friend has never served as a
soldier.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am on an equal
footing with him. I want to ask him whether
he or I would dare tell the Department of
National Defence, with its staff of men who

440

SENATE

have grown up in the army, that our judgment as to what they should do is superior
to their own.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
what I am doing.

That is not

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think it would
be fairer to him and to the Senate that when
we meet again-and we may meet much
sooner than we expect-we should have before
us, in one of our large committee rooms,
the Minister of National Defence, surrounded
by the men whose advice he seeks and accepts,
to explain to us the work they are carrying
on. We should be face to face with men
of experience who could speak with authority.
Surely my right honourable friend cannot
expect me to join him in saying that the
scheme which is being developed is all wrong.
I confess I should feel somewhat ridiculous
in making such a statement over the heads
of men in the department upon whom we rely
for administration of the military affairs of this
country.

I have presented the statement which will
form the basis of the regulations, and if my
right honourable friend desires I can have
Mr. Cassels, Brigadier Orde and his assistant
explain how far they are advanced in their
work, and how they are adhering to what I
have just read.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Cassels is
a lawyer. He is drafting what he is told to
draft.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, as to the
form of the regulations to be issued.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Brigadier Orde
is Judge-Advocate-General. I do not believe it
would be of much value to have him and Mr.
Cassels before cus. In view of the condition
we are in, taking 300,000 men and giving
them a little bit of training to fight in a war
like this would indicate to me that the Government is not following the advice of its Defence
Couneil.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why does my
right honourable friend surmise that?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If it is, we
should get another Defence Council.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I know nothing about
military matters.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
equal footing.

So we are on an

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Exactly. But my
common sense tells me that the training of
300,000 men within a year, giving them only
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

one month's training, will not get us very
far forward. According to all I have read in
connection with the situation, it takes anywhere from six months to a year to train a
man to go into battle. Our First Division
went overseas after fairly intensive training
here, but it took months of training in Great
Britain before it was fully developed as a
fighting force. I cannot but feel that the
effort is not being made in the right direction.
As I sec it, the thing to do is to give thorough
training to as many men as those in authority
think will be required for this situation, and
net to give a multitude of men only partial
training. I admit I may be entirely wrong.
We should have an opportunity of questioning,
not the lawyers who are preparing the regulations, but the men who will be carrying them
out in the way of training.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
When those
regulations are drawn up and the men have
been selected by classes, they will be turned
over to the Department of National Defence,
which does the training.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Of course I can
quite understand the probable basis for this
policy upon the part of the Government.
I listened with great interest last night or the
night before to what Priestley, I think it was,
or one of the other commentators, called
the "broomstickers."
It seems that at the
present time thousands of men-middle-aged
men, old men, crippled men-are training in
the Old Country. They are neither uniformed
nor armed, but they are preparing for homedefence service, and they go out on the football fields and train with broomsticks instead
of rifles. That is perfectly correct in England, because there thousands of Germans may
come from the clouds any day. But we have
not reached such a stage in Canada.
It
would be all right to train men here for a few
weeks if we were looking for an attack: then
We should have to train hundreds of thousands
of men to resist. But the necessity for Canada
at the present time is to get ready as quickly
as possible as many thoroughly trained men
as are needed for the job they have to do.
That preparation cannot be made in a month.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perhaps my
honourable friend forgets that this is a scheme
in preparation for the defence of Canada.
Hou. Mr. CALDER:

So far so good.

OF THE
ADJOURNMENT-BUSINESS
SENATE
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, the important Bill I was expecting this evening is still lingering in Committee of the Whole elsewhere. I have already
moved that when the Senate adjourns this
evening it do stand adjourned until to-morrow
at eleven o'clock. This motion has been
carried. I now move the adjournment of
the Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: From what
I hear, the Commons cannot be expected to
get through to-morrow. If that is so, we
may as well come back on Monday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have inquired
of one who follows the movements of the
House of Commons fairly well, and I am
informed that it is hoped the Bill will be
passed before midnight. I think that is the
only piece of legislation that would come
to us.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Midnight to-night?
Midnight toHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
night. The House of Commons sat past midnight last night. If we had the Bill at eleven
o'clock to-morrow morning, the hopes of those
who think we may prorogue tb-morrow would
be somewhat strengthened. At all events, we
shall meet at eleven o'clock.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
il a.m.

the House should meet at any earlier time
during the adjournment, Mr. Speaker may give
notice that he is so satisfied, and thereupon
the House shall meet at such time as the
Speaker may give in such notice, and shall
transact its business as if it had been duly
adjourned to that time.
Honourable members will see that this
motion is along the line of one passed by the
Senate on June 5, providing that in case of
emergency arising during any adjournment
this session His Honour the Speaker may call
senators to meet in advance of the date set.
If the motion I have just read is adopted by
the House of Commons, I shall move at the
conclusion of our business that we adjourn
until November 5, subject to recall at an
earlier date under the authorization in our
motion of June 5.

ADJOURNMENT OF PARLIAMENT
NOTICE OF MOTION

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, before we enter upon any discussion
which may last for some time, I hasten to
inform the Senate of a notice of motion by
the Prime Minister, which is now in the hands
of the Honourable Speaker of the other House,
reading as follows:

That this House, on the completion of the

business for which it was specially summoned,

do adjourn till Tuesday, November 5, 1940, at

three o'clock p.m., provided always that if it
appears to the satisfaction of Mr. Speaker,
after consultation with His Majesty's Government, that the public interest requires that

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, as there is no further business, I
move that the Senate adjourn during pleasure,
to re-convene at three o'clock this afternoon.
Before the motion is put, I should like to
refer to a statement the honourable gentleman
from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner)
made yesterday concerning the Sudeten
German community near St. Walburg.
The Minister at the head of the Immigration
Department, Hon. Mr. Crerar, has informed
me that two groups of Sudeten immigrants,
numbering about fifteen hundTed persons,
reached Canada difteen or eighteen months ago.
One group settled at Tupper, in British
Columbia, and the other near St. Walburg,
in Saskatchewan. Transportation and settlement of these people were arranged by the
Co'lonization Departments of the Canadian
National and Canadian Pacific Railways,
whose officers are still keeping in touch with
them.

Reports received so far by the Immigration
Department indicate that the two groups are
making satisfactory progress, but Mr. Crerar
suggests that if the honourable senator has
any direct information to the contrary in
respect to the St. Walburg settlernent, he
might, before leaving Ottawa, see Mr. Blair,
Mr.
the Superintendent of Immigration.
Blair will be happy to act on any such information and later communic&te with the honourable senator.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

senators, I desire to lay on the Table two
copies in French and two in English, of Proclamations and Orders in Council passed
between January 1, 1940, and June 30, 1940,
under the authority of the War Measures Act.
This is the printed volume to which I referred
yesterday when copies of the Orders in Council
were laid on the Table.
BUSINESS

OF THE SENATE

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, we have nothing on the Order
Paper, and are waiting for legislation to come
to us from the House of Commons. I have
been following the debate in that House and
am informed that the Wheat Bill-I may as
well name the Bill, because everybody knows
it is being discussed there-may be sent to
us about four o'clock. I have thought, therefore, that we should suspend our sitting until
after five o'clock, and then if the Bill has
reached us we might give it first reading and
place the second reading of it on the Orders of
the Day for Monday.
Opinion is divided as to whether we shall
be able to prorogue or adjourn on Monday
evening or on Tuesday. As I must prefer
the most prudent course, I would ask that
the Senate suspend its sitting till a quarter past
five this afternoon. Then I should be in a
better position to state what is the situation
in the other House. In the meantime, we may
turn over in our minds the question whether
our adjournment shall be until Monday noon,
Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Or Tuesday.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I stressed the
idea, and tried to obtain support for it, that
the House of Commons might spend the
whole of Monday on supply or the estimates,
for then, if the Wheat Bill had come here,
there would be a fair chance that both houses
would finish by Monday evening if they sat
from Monday at noon and in the afternoon
and evening. I am facing a difficulty such
as confronted my right honourable friend when
he was in the place I occupy here. Just
now I should like to be allowed a couple of
hours' delay in reaching a conclusion, and I
move that the Senate adjourn during pleasure,
to be called back at, say, a quarter past five.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, as it is possible that an important measure may be sent over to the
Senate later this afternoon, it is of course quite
right that we should meet again then. The
estimates are still before the other louse, a
very long list of them, and I should think it
very unlikely that that business would be concluded before late on Monday. ln such event,
there would net be much advantage in our
adjourning this afternoon until earlier than
Tuesday. However, at this stage of the session,
we should place ourselves almost unreservedly
in the hands of the leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). If it is thought best
that we should meet on Monday, I shall
be here.
I again urge, as I did a year ago, that we
ought to revert to the rule requiring attendance of senators at the latter part of a session
in particular. While it is always a duty for
honourable members to be present when the
Senate is sitting, that duty becomes more
important as we approach the final stages of
our work. The effect of a slim attendance
towards the end is not good, and I hope that
next year the honourable leader will move to
bring back, either in its original form or
modified, the rule which imposed penalties
upon honourable senators not present in the
closing days of a session.
Just now this House is under attack on two
grounds. One is that we defeat Government
measures. That is an old form of attack,
which occurs as regularly as the sessions and
will continue as long as partisanship lives.
The other ground is a new one, namely, that
we do not defeat Covernment measures. That
is considered a capital offence, justifying
capital punishment for this House. Perhaps if
one member of Parliament were more sympathetic than any other towards that criticism,
it would be myself. I think there is some
reason for it. Nevertheless the general situa-

AUGUST 3, 1940
tion does demand utmost attention to duty
on our part, especially at this late hour in the
session.
While I am on my feet, may I say that this
demand that Government measures be defeated
is made probably without calculation of the
strength of those on this side of the House.
Certainly, with defections we could defeat
nothing. For those I am not responsible. But
on account of the absence of one senator on
military service, and of others, not less than
four, all on this side, wholly incapable of
attending because of illness, we no longer
have a majority here. It may be well sometimes to consider simple arithmetic, even in
these complicated days.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
to what extent I should follow my right
honourable friend in discussing the effect of
our actions on the public. It is very hard to
estimate the judgment of public opinion on
what is done by either House of Parliament.
When someone differs strongly with the
Government concerning a certain measure he
naturally expects to obtain support for his
views in one of the two Chambers. I recall
comments from divers sources that were not
always laudatory with respect to actions of
Occasionally an editor of athe Senate.

the Commons or the Senate has "outraged

written by one man, yet he presumes to speak
for all the people of Canada. It is not the
first time I have heard of such an extravagant
presumption. Honourable senators are familiar
with the story of the three tailors of Tooley
street who addressed a petition to the British
House of Commons beginning, "We, the people
of England." It is most amusing at times to
see an article stating that outraged public
opinion resents a certain action of the Senate
or the Commons. Often, if the writer's narne
were at the bottom of the article, his readers
would be unable to restrain a smile. Unsigned
articles in newspapers carry considerable
weight because of the reputation of the men
directing the opinions and policy of those
newspapers. Once or twice it was feared that
the London Times might lose influence when
directors of outstanding political acumen and
unquestioned integrity departed from this life
and were succeeded by men of less repute.
Undoubtedly it is the reputation of the man
directing the policy of a newspaper that gives
authority to its editorials. The ownership of
newspapers changes hands. In the present
case we have the Montreal Gazette editorially
censuring the Senate and warning us that our
failure to heed the editor's views has "outraged
95832-29j

public opinion." Well, it suffices to say that
were the article signed "John Bassett," it
would bring a broad smile from every reader
of the Montreal Gazette.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, as a junior senator in such distinguished
company as that of the two leaders of the
House, I may be permitted to say a word.
At this very moment I have in my room a
copy of one of the leading newspapers of
Western Canada, containing an article criticizing this Chamber because we made certain
amendments to the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Bill. It goes on to suggest that the
leader on this side of the House and his
majority-which it says he has-will be able
to put the Unemployment Insurance Bill to
sleep in the committee or to chloroform it in
some way. When I was a member of an
elective body I was criticized, as many others
are, for being partisan and speaking on behalf
of party, but I have always understood that
in the Senate men and women could express
their opinions freely if tihey wished. True,
there are caucuses, and I have had the pleasure
of attending some of them, but I have never
been asked to follow the caucus ei'ther for or
against a measure. I do not know how members are to act if they are not allowed to
vote as they think best. On the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Bill I voted as I
thought best for the interests of the people
of Canada, and I very strongly resent the
attack of the Montreal Gazette at this time.
It is true that its view is contrary to mine,
and it may be right; but the senators here
come from and represent different parts of
Canada, and they have a right te express
their opinions as to what is best for the
country. I say that in the matter of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Bill we were
not playing politics, and I was not playing
politics so far as the Unemployment Insurance
Bill was concerned. Therefore I resent the
criticism directed at us by the Press of Canada
simply because we happen to hold ideas which
differ from their own. They have a perfect
right to hold a particular view, but they
should not attack others who do not agree
with them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot
understand the honourable senator from
Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) at
this hour resenting anything in the Manitoba
Free Press, which has its root in the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. I do not know
whether the honourable gentleman was in
the House or not-if he was not, he should

have been-when the honourable senator
from Provencher (Hon. Mr. Molloy) completely explained the situation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was here.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He expdained
that there was shortly to be a provincial
election in Manitoba.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Just as there was when
the original Act was introduced in 1935.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have, to
keep that in mind when we are thinking of
the Manitoba Free Fress.
As to the other newspaper article, I feel
no resentment; and perhaps that is only
natural; but there is one thing I should say
in fairness to the leader of the House. It is
stated by the Gazette that the examination
given to the Unemployment Insurance Bill
in committee was perfunctory. That is untrue.
I was afraid at first, from a statement made
by the leader of the House in the same committee before that Bill came to it, that there
was going to be an attempt to curtail the
presentation of evidence.
But indications
proved incorrect. There was no attempt on
the part of the leader of the House to curtail
the evidence in the slightest degree. Everyone
who intimated an intention to be present was
heard at whatever length he desired.
Speaking for myrself, I 'have never, either as
leader of the Government in the House or as
leader of this side, taken any other course
than that of encouraging the interests of this
Dominion, of every class, to come to our
committees, and of giving them the fullest
and most impartial hearing. I have never
failed at any time. In this case, particularly,
I got into touch with alil I could reach, and
urged them to come, and promised a fair
hearing without any curtailment of any
kind.
If there was anything perfunctory, it was
the failure of those opposed to this measure
to present their views.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One man
who appeared, and who had not quite finished
his case, although we sat on towards midnight, would not remain until the following
morning. I think the only company represented as such was the Bell Telephone Company. The representatives of the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association were heard. There
were only about two witnesses from each. Not
one of the financial interests even appeared.
No representative of the insurance companies
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

or of the bankers was present, although both
interests were strongly represented five years
ago and both were urged to come this time.
The same remark would apply to a considerable range of interests in this Dominion which
are vitally affected by the Bill. I do net think
the strength of the opposition to it throughout
the country was even approximately represented by the witnesses who appeared before
the committee. That is where the perfunetoriness was; and perhaps there is some consequence therefrom.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wonder if I may
ask the honourable senator from Winnipeg
South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) about this
caucus business. I have been a member of the
Senate for ten years and nobody has ever
advised me of any caucus to be held.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman is on the wrong side of the House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You do net need a caucus.
We do, because if we did not consult one
another we might vote in various ways.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I should not like any injustice to be
done any honourable member of this House.
The right honourable senator opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) said this afternoon that
the member from Provencher had stated the
reason why the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Bill was requested by the Legislature
of the province of Manitoba. In the list of
senators in the Minutes of the Proceedings of
the Senate J find the following: "Beaubien
(Provencher)." I hope that Hansard will not
attribute to me the statement of Honourable
Senator Molloy as te the reason why the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Bill was being
asked for.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was Dr.
Molloy who gave the reason. I remember
that.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: While I am on my
feet. I may say to my right honourable
friend that those who made representations
to this House in favour of that Act were not
confined to any political party in the province
of Manitoba, but included the leaders of both
parties in that province.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Correct, and
with similar political motives in the case of
both. J sincerely hope that time and the
gentle influences of maturity will have their
effect on the honourable senator (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) and that he will become as frank
as Dr. Molloy.

AUGUST 3, 1940

right honourable friend that he bas always

not of bis own party.

The bonourable senator's logic is not improving with the years.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I should like te, say a word witb
particular reference to the suggestion of the
right honourable the leader opposite about
imposing penalties during the last days of
the session; and I hope the honourabie senator
from Winnipeg Soutb-Centre (Hon. Mr.
Haig) will again voice bis views, as he bas
so often done, about tbe difficulties which
confront senators from the West, especially
tbose from the far West. I came down here,
and on one occasion I waited from a Thursday, ail tbrougb the next week and until
Tuesday of tbe following week, without
having anytbing to do. I am not used to,
idleness of that kind in working days. It
is very disturbing, particularly when one
realizes that in otber places there is work to
be donc.
1 do not know what the solution of tbe
problem may be. We must face the fact that
tbe public do not realize tbe truc situation.
Oftcn wc see in the papers, "~The Senate did
not sit to-day." The fact is overlooked tbat
there are 96 senators and 245 members of
the House of Commons, and we must in
some way put in enougb time to allow those
245 to talk not only about the merits of
bills, but sometimes, a listener migbt feel,
for other reasons as weli. From my experience
in this Chamber I am sure that honourable
senators as a wholc are capable of discussing
public questions on their mernts. I tbink
some system ougbt to be dcvised whereby,
whcn tbey bave accompiebed that task, which
is alh tbe public have a right to expect of
them, they would not be required to spend
rndeterminatc bours kicking their beels whiie

sbould be taken into consideration if the

consequences of icaving the important work
of the final days to a few senators are equal
for us.alI, and 1 earnestly urge that whatever
is necessary to assure attendance at the end

of anything whicb looks worse than a siim

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bihl 118, an Act to amend the
Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
The Bihl was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I cannot say what principie or principles are invoived in this measure, and I
wouid suggest that before expressing our views
on the Bill iteif we give it second reading
and refer it to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce for Monday afternoon. I
sbali bave in attendance tbe experts and, if
necessary, one of my colleagues, who may be
examincd and give us some explanations, so
that when the Bill is reported from committee
many points not cicar to us now wili have
been clanificd. Then we couid diseuse the Bill
on the motion for third reading. If that is
satisfactory, I wili move second reading now.
Rigbt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourabie members, 1 have no objection at ail
to the proposai, but it might be wortb wbiie
to offer a few commente on the Bill, direýcting
attention to the feature that to my mmnd
needs explanation.
As cveryooe knows, under the Canadian
Wbeat Board Act of 1935 controi of wheat
marketing is virtuaily taken by the Canadian
Wheat Board, a Govcrnment organization. The
wheat covered by the Act bas been the wheat
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and
British Columbia. As everyone aiso knows,
tbe purcbase price set by the board, doubtless
with Government approval, was 70 cents,
on the hasis of No. 1 Northern wheat. There
was an advisory committee to advise the
board, the committee consisting of seven mem-

SENATE
bers, four being wheat producers. There was
also a limitation of 5,000 bushels as the
amount to be purchased frop any single
farmer.
All these three features are altered. Under
this Bill "wheat" is wheat produced not only
in those four Western Provinces, bui also
in Ontario. The advisory board is now
appointed, not to advise, but to assist-whatever the difference may be-and is to consist. net of seven, but of eleven members,
of whom six, instead of four, will represent
wheat products. And the limitation of 5,000
bushels is abandoned. There is also some
alteration in the law so far as the Fort
William-Port Arthur basis is concerned.
Hon. Mr. IIAIG:
drawn.

That bas been

with-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I see. Then
have not the Bill in its last form.
I am not commenting on any of the features
I have mentioned, save this. We have come
for the first time into Central Canada in
respect of wheat control. As this Bill defines
"wheat" to include all wheat produced in
the four Western Provinces and as well in
tbis province, and makes that wheat subject
ro marketing through the board, and subject
to the processing tax, which is now inposed
for the first time, I am wondering wiat will
be the result of leaving out Quebec and the
Maritime Provinces. I suppose only an expert
can answer that question. At least, I am not
expert enougb to answer it.
The processing tax is fifteen cents a bushel
(if the Bill has net been amended in this
respect as well), and is te be paid when the
miller who has bought wheat from the board
for processing in Canada processes it and sells
the product.
Wien he selis any product,
whether it be bran, shorts or flour, he has
to collect the tax frorn the purchaser, and
remit it, as detailed in the Bill, to the Wheat
Board. The Bill does net say how much be
has to colleet from the purchaser of bran and
shorts, and how miiucli fron the purchaser of
flour. The tax of fifteen cents is on the basis
of the bushel of wheat which he processes.
There is. however, a clause which provides
that the Governor in Council shall bave power
to make regulations, and I think it is wide
enough to enable the Governor in Council
to say what portion of the tax shall be assessable against by-products and what against
fleur.
A substantial quantity of wheat is produced
in Quebec and in the Maritime Provinces.
That wheat, so far as I know, is of the same
character as the wheat of Ontario. but net
the saine as that of the West. While the
quantity of Quebec and Maritime wheat is

I

Right Hon. ?MIr. MEIGHEN.

substantial, it is net at all comparable with
the quantity produced in the West, and is
scarcely comparable with the quantity grown
in Ontario. Nevertheless it is there. I am
net certain whether it would be to the disadvantage of the farmers of Quebec and the
Maritimes not to come under the board. I
am not certain, but I presume that the miller,
wherever be buys the wheat, will have to pay
the board's price for it. Others mnay think
differently. But what is to be the result of
milling in Quebec and in the Maritimes without a processing tax-for, if I read the Bill
aright, the tax does not apply there-and with
the consequent reduction, corresponding to
fifteen cents a bushel, in the price of wheat?
What is to be the result of competition between the miller east of the Ottawa river and
I
the miller west of the Ottawa river?
should think the eastern millers would be able
to invade the whole Ontario market very
easily. On the other hand, this may be to the
disadvantage of the farmers of Quebec and
of the Maritime Provinces, and I should
certainly like some light on that particular
phase of the Bill when it goes before conmittee.
My right honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend's remarks will be transmitted
to the officials to appear before the committee, and they may be able te give him the
information he requires.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

WAR CO-OPERATION
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, the Special Comrmittee on War Co-operation beg leave to make their second report,
as follows:

AUGUST 5, 1940
Since the first report to the Senate, made
on the 25th of June last, the committee have
held five meetings, at which were heard the
following gentlemen:
Colonel Wilfrid Bovey, of McGill University,
Head of the Department of Extra-mural
Relations of that institution;
Colonel Mess, President of the Association of
Canadian Clubs of Canada;
Commissioner S. T. Wood, of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police;
Mr. Gladstone Murray, Director -and General
Manager of the Canadian Broadcasting Commission.
Valuable information and suggestions were
obtained from these witnesses.
As a result it was decided to request the
Association of Canadian Clubs to collaborate
in the holding of a series of meetings through
its ninety-three member clubs. These meetings
are to be held in the immediate weeks ahead,
and their object is precisely that outlined in
your committee's first report, namely, the bringing of the Canadian public to a clear view of
the dominating world facts and dangers by
which we are surrounded, and to a firmer
realization of the immediate and paramount
interest and duty of Canadians in the present
titanic struggle, and the stimulation of their
zeal to support the efforts of this nation and
to co-operate in maintaining its integrity and
freedom from subversive influences until final
The arrangement of
and complete victory.
these meetings will be under the direction of
the President of the Association of Canadian
Clubs, Colonel James Mess, and we are glad
to be able to advise that other service clubs
throughout the country have, with very creditable unselfishness, agreed to co-operate.
Your committee would respectfully urge upon
the Government the consideration of the erection, without delay, in this country of a powerful
short-wave radio station of 50,000 kilowatts.
It is considered that such a course is distinctly
advisable to supplement the present British
Broadcasting station, and to make more secure
the facilities now used from that station, which
are so vital to Empire co-operation and to the
general transmission of truth throughout the
world. It is believed that the expenditure,
which is estimated at $350,000 to $400,000,
and the cost of maintena.nce, can be used to
advantage in any event after the war for
advertising and for trade purposes, especially
throughout this continent and Europe.
In making this recommendation, your coinmittee have in mind an opportunity to secure
a most important section of the construction
material which is now, fortunately, available,
and which will enable construction to be completed in a fraction of the time which otherwise
would be necessary.
Your committee would further recommend the
organization of a series of broadcasts throughout Canada in certain foreign languages for the
purpose of removing the influence of false and
unfounded broad-casts through foreign-speaking
sections of Canada by enemy countries.
We are pleased to report that, owing to the
activities of your committee, a considerable
number of broadcasts have already been delivered by people of standing, which it is believed
have been of substantial benefit. It is earnestly
hoped and urged upon the honourable members
of this House that they will utilize every
opportunity, whether by platform speaking or

44,

by broadcasting, to contribute their very best
at all times to the objective set out in this
report.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Did the honourable gentleman and the committee consider
the advisability of calling the Mayor of
Montreal before the committee, to get his
advice?
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: As chairman of
the committee I may inform my honourable
friend that the incident with respect to the
Mayor of Montreal occurred after our meeting. If it had occurred earlier, perhaps the
committee would have been tempted, as my
honourable friend bas been, to refer to the
matter.
DEBTS DUE TO THE CROWN BILL
MESSAGE FROM THE COMMONS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honounable
senators, a message bas been received, from
the House of Commons reading as follows:
Resolved, that a message be sent to the Senate
to acquaint Their Honours that this House
(a) agrees to amendment No. 1 to Bill No.
99, an Act to amend an Act respecting Debts
due to the Crown;
(b) disagrees with amendment No. 2 for the
reason that it is desirable that Bill No. 99
should come into force on assent being given;
and
(c) disagrees with amendment No. 3 for the
following reasons.
These reasons, honourable senators, are
lengthy. I may say te honourable senators
that the reasons are given in No. 57 of the
Votes and Proceedings of the House of Conmons, and it might be more advantageous to
read them than to hear them read by me.
Shall I dispense with the reading?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Dispense.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
message be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Now.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I do net know what the
motion of the Government will be, as respects
rejection by the House of Commons of the
third of the Senate amendments to this Bill;
but whatever be its motion, and whatever be
the stand of this House, I think it well that
the reasons which the Commons present for
rejection of the amendment should be reviewed
here and such reasons given in answer as may
seea appropriate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In order that
honourable senators may understand the
scope of the third amendment, perhaps my
right honourable friend would give the Senate

448

SENATE

the reasons which actuated the committee in
preparing the amendment, and the effect
the committee thought it would have on the
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shall try
to do that. What first led the Senate to
think of turning the Bill into the form into
which the third amendment turns it, namely,
into a measure which enabled the Crown to
be impleaded in garnishment proceedings as
a third party where the claim was against a
civil servant or was such as to sound otherwise than in damages, was that, first oif all,
our Parliamentary Counsel assailed the Bill
as ultra vires in the form in which it came
to us.
The reasons which he gave seemed to me
very difficult to answer, and I do not think
I am overstating the fact in adding that they
were similarly regarded by all other members
of the committee. I cannot recall that any
member of the committee undertook in any
way to question those reasons. The Bill as
drafted seemed very vulnerable in its constitutional aspect and likely to be the startingpoint of another entourage of litigation on
the part of those people who love litigation
so much better than the paying of their debts.
Then to honourable members there appeared
no good reason why ordinary garnishment
proceedings should net be the natural remedy,
rather than erecting the Minister of Finance
into a quasi-Minister of Justice and, as such,
enabling him, by legislation, to determine the
merits of claims on the part of the Crown in
the right of Manitoba against certain DominThe enabling of the
ion civil servants.
Minister to decide on the merits of the claims
seemed implicit in the Bill. Such legislation
is extremely difficult to defend, whether from
the standpoint of the Constitution or any
other standpoint. Therefore the members of
the committee felt that the legislation should
be in this form: first, leave the main clause
as it was, except for the provision that the
Minister of Finance, after deciding on the
merits of any claim by the province of
Manitoba against a civil servant, should take
into consideration the exemptions allowed by
the province, or such exemptions as in tis
judgment would enable the civil servant in
question, whose salary was being reduced
month by month, to give efficient services to
the Crown in the right of Canada. We
thought it well to leave that clause and only
added that it should come into effect on
proclamation of the Governor in Council. The
idea in the mind of the committee was that
the legislation in that form might have the
effect of bringing those in question to a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

realization of their position and of what was
impending over them in the second part of
the Bill as we would amend it, and the purpose
might thus be served without the necessity of
bringing the second part into effect. The
committee took this rather moderate view
because of the late stage of the session.
We then proceeded in amendment No. 3,
what I call the second part of the Bill, te
provide, in terms which we thought were
defensible from the constitutional standpoint
as well as every other, for garnishment proceedings against the Crown in the same way
as against any other party, except in cases
sounding in damages.
Now, the House of Commons has accepted
the first two amendments. The first authorizes the Minister of Finance to deduct what
he deems necessary to enable the civil servant
to do his work-call it an exemption or what
you will; and the second brings that section
into operation only by proclamation.
The second part of the Bill, which is amendment No. 3, the Commons totally reject. For
this they give reasons which, I am sorry to
say, I am compelled to read in order that I
may place on Hansard as briefly as possible
what I conceive to be the answer to each.
The first reason is:
1. Because the proposed amendment is of
doubtful constitutional validity. The province
tas exclusive authority in relation to the
jurisdiction and procedure in civil matters in
provincial courts. By the provincial statutes
the garnishee must be 'within the jurisdiction
of the court" or "withii" the province, or
"resident in" the county. It is doubtful if
1arliament ean in effect extend the juris(liction
of the provincial courts to include the Minister
of Finance as a garnishee.
My answer is this. This measure interferes
not at all with provincial jurisdiction, nor does
it seek to extend provincial constitutional

We alone can do that. No other jurisdiction

cannot do, because the Minister is outside
the jurisdiction of the province. In a word,
this is aiding legislation and nothing else.

AUGUST 5, 1940
2. Because under the present state of the law
the Crown cannot be impleaded in the courts
without a fiat. This principle constitutes the
main impediment in the way of garnishee proceedings. The proposed amendment would in
effect amount to the abandonment of this prerogative of the Crown in a limited class of
cases. It is most important that the position
of the Crown in relation to the courts should
not be .altered in this respect without full consideration being given to the whole problem of
proceedings against the Crown.
As to everything there stated, with the
exception of the last sentence, I have no word
of dispute to express. Without doubt the
three first sentences are correct. The last
sentence merely says that if we are going
to abandon the prerogative of the Crown in
a limited class of cases, it is important that
there should be full consideration given to
the whole problem. Strictly speaking, I
have no objection to that either. Of course
we should be careful. In our third amendment
we are so extremely careful that we do not
give an absolute and final right to anybody.
In the ultimate, the Governor in Council is
in control. While this is a partial invasion
of the historie right of the Crown to refuse
to be impleaded, it seemed to the committee,
and I am satisfied that it seems to this
House, a very advisable invasion; otherwise
a section of our population is privileged to
do what should be forbidden with the utmost
finality-privileged to defy its creditors and
refuse to pay its debts. That alone is the
reason of the limitation. That distinct reason
for this section of the territory of the Crown's
prerogative being invaded does not apply to
the remainder; and in invading this section
of territory the amendment exercises the
extremest care.
3. Because the question of recognition by the
Crown of voluntary assignments of debts due
from the Crown is allied to the subject-matter
of the amendment and it is not clear why it
should not also be dealt with.
It is clear to me, and I admit, that the
question whether the subject who has a
debt due him from the Crown in the right
of Canada can assign that debt, and thus
compel the Crown to pay to somebody else,
is allied to the question of the right of
garnishmenit; but it is only allied and does
not need to be considered immediately with
that question. Even. if it did have to be
considered soon after, I could sec nothing in
the consideration to cause terror. I do not
know of any great difficulty that this conThe third reason,
sideration would entail.
while no doubt truthfully expressed, is very
weak.

449

4. Because the proposed amendment only
pernits garnishee proceedings to be taken in
respect of any judgment for or on account of
any tax or other debt not sounding in damages.
The justification for excluding other judgments
is not clear.
Well, if the justification is net clear, my
answer to No. 4 is, include the other judgments. We thought that debts sounding in
damages against the Crown were somewhat
different from simple contract debts, and so
included only the one class. If it is going to
simplify matters to include debts sounding in
damages, I for one should have no objection at all to our doing so.
5. Because the grounds for making a distinction between officers, servants or employees of
His Majesty in the right of Canada on the one
hand and other persons to whom amounts may
from time to time be due from the Crown on
the other are not -apparent from the proposed
legislation, will not be apparent to the public,
and require consideration.
At this point I interject the remark that
there is no distinction. What is in the mind
of the Commons appears in the next sentence.
in particular, it is not clear why such persons
as senators, members of the House of Commons,
judges, and persons entering into contracts with
His Majesty in the right of Canada are excluded
from the provisions of the amendment.
I know of no reason for saying that persons
entering into eontracts with His Majesty in
the right of Canada are excluded. If they
became creditors, they would be subject to
garnishment under amendment No. 3. Now,
it is pointed out that if the debts are due
from the Crown to senators, members of the
House of Commons and judges, they would
It is only fair to
be garnishable also.
add that in my opinion, as respects the
indemnity payable to senators and members
of the Commons, there is no debt due from the
Crown to them; they are not in a position
at all analogous, legally, to that of the civil
servants; consequently the phrasing of the
Bill as it came to us would not include them
I am not expressing the same
anyway.
opinion as to the judges; I think that in this
matter they are in just the same class as civil
servants. In this respect we are just adopting
the language of the Bill itself. If it is the
desire to include senators and members of the
Commons there would have to be a new Bill
to attack the subject in an entirely different
way. I have not the least objection to that.
I do not know why they should not be subject
to garnishment the same as any other
persons; but you could not do it along the
lines of that measure.
6. Because under the proposed amendment a
creditor is put to the expense of obtaining a
judgment and garnishee order and forwarding
them to the Minister of Finance, but the Min-

SENATE
ister of Finance is not under any obligation to
make deductions fron the sums payable to
the debtor of such person.
That is truc, but I do not think the province
of Manitoba or any other authority will hesitate to go to the expense of getting a judgment
if this Bill passes. It is known that the
Minister will carry out the spirit of the
measure. Furthermore, the 'recalcitrant debtor
will become liable for costs as wel'l.
7. Because in form the proposed amendment
is open to the following objectionsThen comes an alphabetical list.
(a) The expression "third party" is well
understood to mean a person made a party
by a defendant whto claims to be entitled to
contributions or indemnity from such person.
A garnishee is not a third party.
To -paragraph (a) I take specific exception.
Usually a third party is brought in by a
defendant, but a garnishee is none the less a
third party. There is no error in form there.
If he is not a third party, what is he? He is
not a first, nor a second. Is he a fourth?
No. He is a third party, the same as any other
person brought in by the two principal
contenders.
(b) This proposal is to extend to claims by
the provinces for taxes. Where te Crown seeks
to recover its taxes from third persons such
remedies as tite writ of extent are ordinarily
enployed

It may even be doubted wliether the Crown is
entitled to proceedi by way of garnisheeThat is the Crown in the right of Manitoba
they have in mind there.
-since
such expressions as "person" and
"judgnent creditor" used in the provincial
statutes relating to garnishee proceedings are
not apt to describe His Majesty. The munieipality, too, has special remedies to enforce
paymtent of taxes.
The last sentence has no application. As
to the preceding part of the paragraph, that
would be powerf.ul were it not that Bill 99,
if passed, would change the whole situation,
so that the conditions objected to would no
longer exist.
The Crown would thon be
garnishable. That is the complete answer.
(c) The expression "garnisliment" implies
compulsion and is an inappropriate terni to use
witi reference to Ris Majesty even though
the statute provides merely for voluntary anid
not compuîlsory payments.
Well, I suppose garnistment involves compulsion. I presume ttat is whv when we
sue the Crown we proceed by petition of right
instead of by the ordinary writ of summons.
But is ttere any weight to such objections?
There is no affront to the Crown in the word
"garnishiment," and there is no affront in
the legislation, because the discretion, the
whole control of the situation, is left by the
Bill in the bands of the representatives of the
Crown.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

(d) The Exchequer Court tas by statute
exclusive jurisdiction over claims against the
Dominion Crown and it should be made clear

that the Senate proposal is to apply notwithstanding anything contained in the Exchequer
Court Act.
The answer to that is very plain. This Bill
99 would be special and subsequent legislation, whereas the Echequer Court Act is general and precedent legislation. Consequently,
a non obstante clause is not needed. If such
a clause

were needed in respect

of the pro-

posed amendment 3, there should have beeni
one in the old legislation, for exactly the
sarne reason. There was noue, because, as is
the case here, special and subsequent legislation, when affected only by a precedent generali
statute, does nut require it.
(e) The Minister of Finance tas no "representative capacity" to represent His Majesty

These words are truc. But we did not give,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: After quoting the
eighth and last objection made to our amendment, the distinguished gentleman who was
handling this matter in another place said:
Those are the reasons J would suggest why
the House, at this stage of the session, should
not accept the Senate amendment. I have left
out of account any consideration of any practical
matters which may or may not be of great
importance. The ones that occur to me are the
inconvenience and expense to the Crown of
acting in these garnishee proceedings, as well
as the doubt as to need for any further remedies
to creditors of civil servants, or, in other words,
the whole question of the adequacy of present
remedies.
Unquestionably that is not a true statement
of fact. The honourable gentleman must have
known, as everyone here knows, that present
remedies were insufficient or Bill 99 would not
have come to us for the purpose of making
possible the collection from 1,400 Dominion
civil servante in Manitoba of a tax imposed

452

SENATE

upon them by the Government of that province. I repeat, our intelligence is insulted
when it is suggested that present remedies
are sufficient. There are no present remedies
for the creditor of a civil servant who fails
to pay his bills. If I am incorrect, will somebody put me right? I think we could unearth
hundreds of cases-yes, in this city of Ottawawhere present remedies have been of no
avail. There were no remedies. All that a
civil servant debtor had to do was to fail to
pay his bill, and his creditor had no redress.
I could mention two or three very serious
concrete cases, but maybe I had better not.
We are given to understand that we are
to have a three-month lay-off and muet mark
time until the close of the session. It seems
to me that the interval should be sufficient
for the Department of Justice and any other
department of Government responsible for
these matters to go thoroughly into the whole
question and ascertain whether civil servants
pay promptly, and, if not, whether they should
nat be required to pay their bills the same
as any other citizens. Therefore I move:
Tiat in this the greatest period of war stress
the world lias ever known, wlen Canada stands
ready, with other portions of the British Empire,
to sacrifice its all in blood and treasure, to
conserve democracy, the Senate is firmly convinced that the civil servants of Canada should
now, and for the future, be accorded the same
full measne of rights, privileges and obligations devolving on and controlling other Canadian citizens. Thus we insist on Senate amendments.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, since we are not sure of sitting to-morrow,
this may be my only opportunity of saying a
few further words on this matter.
According to the honourable gentleman who
lias just spoken (Hon. Mr. Murdock), we
should, in the terms of his motion, consider
whether civil servants should not be accorded
the same rights, privileges and obligations
as devolve on and control other Canadian
citizens. May I point out to him that what
he proposes has absolutely nothing to do
with what we are now discussing. This is
a question, not of civil servants paying or not
paying their debts, but of the Crown being
forced to appear in certain proceedings,
irrespective of whether or nat civil servants
are connected therewith.
When the Bill came before us our Parliamentary Counsel expressed the opinion that
it was ultra vires because it sought to
encroach on civil rights. With that opinion
I agree absolutely. That is one of the reasons
why I objected to the Bill in the first place.
I objected to it also because it was in effect
an attempt to authorize the garnishment of
civil servants.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

According to the newspaper which I have
before me, the message from the House of
Commons contends that no voluntary assignments of debts owing to the Crown should
be considered. How can this stand be reconciled with the purpose of this Bill, that any
debts owing to the Crown by civil servants
in one of the provinces, for example, Manitoba
-the province specially coneerned in this proposed legislation-may he assigned? In any
garnishee proceedings there is a summons
directed to the garnishee, and he as to declare
whether or not he owes the debt and will
pay it at some future time. By this very
amendment to the Act neither the Minister
of Justice nor the Minister of Finance would
in any way be obligated to ascertain whether
the debt was due. The section reads that if
"in the opinion of the Minister of Justice"
there is indebtedness by a federal civil servant
to a province, such indebtedness may be
deducted from his salary. No garnishee proceedings are necessary. In my view, this is
nothing less than confiscation.
I say that
under the procedure proposed you are precluding residents of Manitoba or of any other
province from resorting to the courts, because
you cannot get the Minister of Finance or
the Minister of Justice to appear in court.
Your only satisfaction is that you get the
Minister of Justice to say, "In my opinion
there is a debt, and I will take that money
from the Minister of Finance." If this is not
confiscation pure and simple, and an encroachment on the civil rights of the citizens of a
province, I do not know what other interpretation can be placed upon the Bill.
According to the newspaper report to which
I have referred, damages are nat included in
the proposed amendment. There is a very
good reason for this omission. It is against
equity, and in no court is it permissible, to
garnishee a debt in respect of damages until
you have obtained judgment. It would be a
crime to say you will tie up a contract with
the Crown or with anybody else by and
under the terms of any garnishment proceedings.
We made three amendments to the Bill.
First is the amendment limiting the amount of
deduction eaci month, proposed by the honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Coté). This amendment was accepted by the
Commons. The second amendment proposes
that the measure shall come into force only
upon proclamation.
To this the Commons
disagreed. The third is itheimportant amendment, and in my opinion the reasons urged in
disagreement by the Commons have no bearing
on it if you consider the principles of the
Bill. If I were practising in Manitoba, and a

AUGUST 5, 1940
civil servant came to me for advice on his
position with respect to this proposed legislation, supposing it were enacted, I should have
no hesitation in advising him to protect himself in the courts, because first a fiat would
have to be secured to proceed against the
Crown. This would mean that the litigation
would be taken from the trial court to the
appellate courts and eventually to the Privy
Council.
But surely we have no right to doubt the
ability and willingness of civil servants to pay
their debts. We know that as a class civil
servants are hard-working and honest. Just
because a provincial Legislature passed certain
legislation, the constitutionality of which was
doubtful, the Federal Government apparently
is willing to go to all the trouble of collecting
provincial taxation, when there is no evidence
before either the Senate or any other body
that the provincial authorities have exhausted
other means of collection. It would be making
it too easy altogether to allow any province
to be in a position to say: "Mr. So and So
owes us a certain debt. He is a federal civil
servant. We do not know whether he bas
any property, but he is taxable, since he is a
resident of this province. Now, Mr. Minister
of Finance, you must deduct out of his salary
whatever taxation he owes to the province,
because the Minister of Justice has said so."
Surely if the alleged debtor is a resident of
the province the provincial authorities must
have a remedy. The only action they would
have to take in order to be in a position to
collect the debt would be simply to cancel
every possible exemption under their own
provincial laws. Why the Minister of Finance
should be constituted a collector for Manitoba,
Quebec, Prince Edward Island or any other
province, I should like to know.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would my honourable friend say why a civil servant should
have special privileges in the matter of paying
his debts?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I think I made
myself clear in the first instance. We are concerned, not with civil servants, but with the
prerogative of the Crown. You cannot sue
the Crown unless you get a fiat permitting
you to do so.
For the reasons I have stated, in my view
the remedy which the province of Manitoba
seeks under the Bill is not worth a snap of
the fingers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, it will be remembered that when this
Bill came before the House for second
reading the opinion was expressed that all civil
servants should be brought under the general

law and made subject to garnishee proceedings. The special committee to which
this Bill was referred discussed the matter
thoroughly, and a tentative amendment was
ultimately drafted, which is now known as
amendment No. 3.
I draw the attention of the Senate to the
fact that at present the Crown can be sued
only under a petition of right, founded on a
fiat issued by the Minister of Justice. If,
under such piroceedings, the plaintiff succeeds
in obtaining judgment, the Crown is obliged
to pay. I know cases have arisen where the
Crown's dilatoriness in meeting a judgment
raised the question whether the Crown could
be pressed for payment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Under this
amendment the Crown is not compellable at
all.
I am coming
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to that point. We have studied the question
as fully as was possible in the time at our
disposal. As we are aware, in this Chamber
there is a pronounced sentiment in favour
of some legislation by which civil servants
can be made to pay their debts. When the
amendment was presented to us we felt it
was not altogether satisfactory, and I may
indicate just one weakness, to which my right
honourable friend has alluded. The amendment proposes:
The Minister of Finance shah not be subject
or required to answer in or to attend at any
garnishment proceedings; he shall be liable as
a third party garnishee in his representative
capacity only, and he shall be subject in matters
to which this Act extends to orders and directions, specific or general, of the Governor in
Council.
However, it was
This nullifies clause 3.
decided to return the Bill as amended to the
House of Commons, to indicate to that
House our trend of thought and our desire
that some legislation should be drafted which
would attain the object we had in view. I
for one thought that this action would go a
long way towards directing the minds of
the legislators of the two Chambers towards
a solution. I knew quite well that the matter
was too vast and too complex to be taken up
at this late date in the session, but I felt
that it was a good idea to have the Commons know the feelings of the Senate in this
respect. I have good reason to believe that
a considerable number of members of the other
House, as well as a portion of the public,
are in favour of some solution which will
satisfy the public conscience.
I do not know what proportion of civil
servants have been negligent in meeting
their obligations. I have been told by civil

SENATE
servants, of whom there are thousands in
Ottawa, that in honourably meeting their
obligations they compare favourably with
any similar number of men anywhere. More
than one civil servant lias told me that less
than five per cent of the whole civil service
is delinquent in this matter, and that the
ninety-five per cent suffer in reputation by
reason of the negligence of the few. There
are many reasons why some civil servants
may not be able to pay their debts. All
kinds of accidents befall them, as they befall
the rest of the community.
However, I believe we have fairly attained
our object. I was glad to hear my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
answer from the legal point of view the
reasons given by the Minister of Finance.
The right lionourable gentleman's remarks
will form part of the record, and the House
of Commons will know the views of this
Chamber.
In these circumstances I hope that my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
knowing, as he does now, that nothing can
be accomplished by the proposed amendment No. 3 if the Government is not ready
to allow a creditor to collect from a civil
servant's salary, will withdraw his motion.
Then I shall move:
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House that the Senate
doth not iisist on its second and third amendments made to Bill 99, an Act to amend an
Act respecting debts due to the Crown, with
whieh anendments the House of Commons bas
disagreed.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is net that
wrong? The House of Commons does net
disagree with the second amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, it does,
because the Minister said be desired the
legislation to corne into force as soon as it
was sanctioned.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I thought
the Commons had agreed to the second
amendment. The honourable gentleman is
rigbt.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I know my
honourable friend from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte) contends that net only is the third
amendment weak constitutionally, but the
Bill also is weak. As it may be taken for
granted, however, that the opinion of the
Department of Finance, which I read, supported by the Department of Justice, entitles
us to exercise a preference, we should prefer
the interpretation which maintains our jurisdiction. As I have often said in this House,
when there is a fair doubt as between federal
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

and provincial jurisdiction, it is net for us to
question our own jurisdiction and we should
stand up for our constitutional rights. Therefore I would suggest to my right honourable
friend that a way should be left clear for this
legislation next session, when we shall be able
to cope with the subject and perhaps reach a
conclusion acceptable to the Department of
Finance and the Government. The Senate
must know that if the Government says, "We
will not aceept it,'' the amendment is of no
avail. That is why I think we should not
insist.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:
May I ask what
hardship will be suffered by the ninety-five
per cent of the civil servants that is not suffered
by any other wage-earners in Canada? The
honourable gentleman bas said that the ninetyfive per cent suffer for the five per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then I did not
clearly express my thought and develop it.
They suffer in reputation with the public at
large if it is thought they are not the honest
men they are. I think that is a consid.eration.
Another assertion bas been made to me,
and is a second reason, which I think my honourable friend will understand. It is asserted
-I do net know how true it is-that the
trade in Ottawa is inclined to charge civil
servants a little more in order to cover bad
debts.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Because, they say,
in many cases they will net be paid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Because
some instances they will not be paid.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is a

the bonourable leader. He says that in the
opinion of the honourable senator from Ponteix this legislation is ultra vires, but at the
same time he has the opinion of the Minister
of Justice, who says it is net. I shall refer
to just one paragraph in the statement of the
Minister of Justice. He says that if there
is any doubt as to validity of this Bill, it is
going to b cured by legislation to be passed
by the Manitoba Legislature. I just leave it
to the honourable gentleman to answer that.

Does my honourable friend want an answer?

AUGUST 5,1940
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wonder if the
leader of the Government would give us a
word of advice on the statement wh.ich emanated from another place as to the adequacy
of present remedies. What are they?
The situation,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
as I understand it from two or three members of the Bar practising in Ottawa, is this.
If I am wrong I stand to be corrected. A
civil servant who is in debt is brought before
the court. I thought I had heard of such a case
coming before the Recorder's Court, but I
was corrected by one of the members of the
Bar in the Senate, who says it is the Superior
Court. The judge, after examining into the
case and into the ability of the civil servant
to pay, condermns him to pay by monthly
instalments, and if he fails to do this he is
cited before a judge for contempt of court and
sent to gaol. This may apply to others as
well, but we are speaking of civil servants. I
know that during the forty years I have been
in the Senate I have heard of more than one
pressing demand for payment of debts.

455

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I accept that as a
promise, and will withdraw my amendment,
feeling confident that something will be done
at the next session.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It has been suggested to me that the ninety-five per cent
who pay their debts would like to see the
amendment passed, because their credit is
hurt by the action of the five per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have no one
before us to speak for them. But, I may say,
surely they would like something effective
to be done, and this would not be effective.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I cannot see why it
would not be. It is effective in the various
provinces. For instance, if a civil servant
in the province of Saskatchewan owes money
and will not pay, I have no difficulty in securing a garnishee summons and serving it on
the Provincial Secretary or the Provincial
Treasurer and getting the money. The Government pays it into court, subject to the exemption.

There was a
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
penalty of imprisonment for debt.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would that apply
to a federal civil servant?

We had

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I do not see why
it would not. The provincial Government acts
in the name of the Crown, just as the Federal
Government does.

Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
it in the province of Quebec.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
our forefathers.

In the time of

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had an action
by a plaintiff against his wife for separation
in bed and board. The court found that the
suit should have been taken against the
husband, and dismissed his claim, and there
was a counter-action, in which the wife
obtained separation. Although her husband
had money in England, she had to earn her
own living. Every Saturday between eleven
and twelve she was obliged to go to the gaol
and deposit a dollar. This she did for three
years to keep him there.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable the leader what would be the
objection to letting this particular question
stand for the next three months in order to
see if the ]Department of Justice and the
Government cannot devise something which
will do what I believe we all want done?
The Minister
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of Finance, who is a lawyer, has suggested
that if something bas to be done, it could be
done in an effective manner by a Bill along
other lines, which would ccme up after a
survey of the whole ground. I hope the
honourable gentleman will not press his
motion.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the question
of waiving the petition of right and the
Crown saying who may issue a fiat is of
such importance in the eyes of the men in
the various departments who have the responsibility of advising the Minister, I would
suggest that the amendment should come from
the Crown, or the Government, which has the
responsibility of the administration of the
country. My right honourable friend has been
a Minister for a number of years. It may be
that this question never arose in his time,
but since 1867 it bas been the lawHon. Mr. ASELTINE: This is not a case
of taking action against the Crown. I understand that you issue a writ, get a judgment,
and then garnishee the Crown. It is not at
all a case of issuing a writ against the Crown.
The judgment summons business which the
honourable Minister has been speaking of
has been done away with in .most of the
provinces. We had it in Saskatchewan. We
cannot bring up a federal employee on judgment summons and have him committed for
contempt of court if he does not carry out
the order made against him, and we are unable
to collect anything at all from him.

456

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
motion is put, I want to clear up one or two
points and state my own position. As respects
the views of the Law Clerk of the Senate, the
practice has grown up of having these transmitted to the two leaders. But we have no
more rights than other honourable members
of the House, and I suggest that the reason
why other senators do not receive a statement
of the Law Clerk's opinion is the difficulty of
reaching them all. If the honourable member
from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) wants an
adjournment of the debate, in order to give
further study to the matter, be ought to
have it.
Secondly, I do not think it is fair to say that
the remedy in the proposed new section 3
would not be effective. In my opinion it
would be thoroughly effective. Nothing has
been adduced to convince me that if it
became law it would not do just what is
intended, that is, to render the civil servant's
salary liable to the same garnishment proceedings as the salary of anybody else is.
Naturally, with deference to the right of the
Crown, nothing would
be
compulsorily
assessed against the Crown. But that would
not detract from the amendment's effectiveness. The right to sue the Crown exists now.
That a fiat is necessary, in deference to the
Crown's exalted and peculiar position, does
not leave the subject without his remedies.
Nor is it right to say that there are other
remedies, and that judgment summons is one.
I agree with the statement of the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdoeck)
that the creditor of a civil servant bas virtually
no remedy. It was shown in the committee
that in Manitoba, at least, although judgment
summons still exists as a means of enforcement, it is without effect at all, because while
default in the first of the monthly payments
ordered at the hearing would render the
debtor liable to some penalty, whatever it
might be, as a matter of fact he never goes
to gaol; be gets around the difficulty by
making the first payment and defaulting on
the second. That is not considered contempt
of court. He bas to be brought up again,
with the result that the cost to the applicant
is more than he gets out of it. Therefore tho
judgment summons is nullified and is merely
a nominal, not an effective remedy. You can
put the debtor to some trouble, but you
cannot collect your debt.
As was pointed out by the honourable
senator from West Central Saskatchewan
(bon. Mr. Aseltine), it is not correct to sav
that garnsisment against a civil servant is
equivalent to a suit against the Crown. You
cannot sue the Crown in the right of Saskatchewan, but you can garnishee the Crowo
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

while it is acting in the capacity of a holder
of money due a citizen. It was stated, and,
I do not doubt, correctly, that the same is
true in British Columbia.
Of what other
provinces it may be truc, I do net know.
The Crown in the right of some of the provinces bas seen the distinction and removed its
civil servants from a protection to which they
are not entitled. It only remains for the
Crown in the right of the Dominion to do so.
While I am in agreement with the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) and should have supported a
motion, if the bonourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) had
moved it, that this House insist on its amendments, I cannot feel that this is a case where
we should so insist against the honourable
leader's will. I take that stand mainly because
this big subject has just come before us for
the first time, and only at the end of the
session. But, like the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), I feel we
should regard the statement of the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) as a promise
that next session there shall be some Government legislation dealing with the entire
problem.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not desire
to be misunderstood as binding the 'Government. I may say the Minister of Finance
told me, for the Department of Justice, that
the matter was of sufficient importance to be
examined separately and dealt with in a
separate bill. I would only add that we
ourselves have power to examine into the
whole situation, and there is no reason why
we should net do so in the event of delay
in the bringing down of Government legislation.
I move that a message be sent to the
House of Commons to acquaint that House
that the Senate doth not insist upon its
second and third amendments to Bill 99, an
Act to amend an Act respecting Debts Due
to the Crown, to which said amendments the
House of Commons bas disagreed.
The motion was agreed to.

AUGUST 5,1940
IMMIGRATION AND CARE
REFUGEES

OF

INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hlonourable
senators, I should like to refer to a subject
I have mentioned before, the care of those
whom, for want of a better term, we descýribe
as refugees from the two great formerly
allied countries. I presumne that because of
the disastrous turn of events in France there
are unfortunately flot many persons, if any
at ail, who are able to leýave that country
now. Such, however, is flot truc of Britain.
I cannot find any systematization of the
work of taking care of these people. That a
great many Canadians are interested in it,
I arn aware. And I know it is a fact that
most, though I feel sure flot ail, of the
refugees who have arrived have obtained
some place at which to stay in the meantime.
But certainly there is no scheme, even under
advisement, for looking after the educaitional
intercsts of children who corne. Undoubtcdly
the difficulties are prctty serious. The British
Governrncnt will flot permit the parents of
these childrcn, even where the parents are
financially able, to send out money for cducationai purposes. A limit of ten pounds
has, I think, been ' set by the British Government in this connection. With that no one
can find fault, for every pound sent out of
Britain for such purposes subtracts from the
country's
financial
ability
to
purchase
materials essential for winning the war.
Then, I presumne, the British Governinent
is anxious that the whole plan of removal of
childrcn and, where necessary, of women,
shouid work out with the greatcst possible
dcgree of equity and fairness as between
persons who are capable of paying and those
who are not.
Howevcr, the fact with which
I amn now concerned is that a considerable
number of children are coming over, and
what I should like to see is some central
organization charged with the placing and
supervising of these children in Canada. The
United States is organ.izing to render material
assistance, which will be very welcome, but
it does sccm to me that the Dominions are
the natural homes for these children. Canada
is the closest Dominion and therefore the one
to which they look first. It would be a
tragedy, for wbich we should neyer forgive
ourselves, that we should fail to provide
adequate care for the people who arrive under
the distre:ssful circumstances of these times.
Little can be said by those in authority
on the other side of the occan. Naturally
they would not wish to complain, no matter
what were donc. And they will praise; no

matter what is done. It is for us to sec that
an organization to look after the children is
establishcd, and that the whole problemn is
adequatcly dealt with. I amn not going to
say that the cost of a proper scheme should
be wholly borne by the Dominion trcasury.
The work is something in the nature of that
taken care of by the old Patriotie Fund in
the last war. It might be nccssary to have
financial assistance given by the treasury, but
the work is not an inappropriate one for
support by intercstcd people in this country.
And I do not think a caîl for assistance
would go long unanswered by our citizens.
When I arn asked whcrc these children
may be lookcd after, I do not know what to
say. There is no central place. This church
here, another church there, and a ladies'
college somcwhcre cisc are doing what they
can, and some people are trying to arrange
for the use of a large building, and s0 on,
but there is no one organization in charge
oS the work as a whole. That is the report
brouglit to me by those who have corne out
with these people. Sometimes refugees arrive
without anynne at ail being present to meet
them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And without
any notification being sent here from the
other side.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Without
notification, perhaps; I do not know. But
they aIl could be taken care of if there were
a propcr system. That seems to me something which fails peculiarly within the new
Dcpartmcnt of National War Services. One
gets that impression upon reading the Bill
creating the new ministry. Some organization
should be set up which has the dcpartment's
biessing and to which those who are eager
to assist as best they can might apply. I do
not think the work should be done directly
under the department, though if it wcrc I
should not find fault, but at least the department could give a lead to the setting up of
a central organization and sec to the establishment
of subsidiaries
throughout
the
country, so that this great service in which
we are now privileged to take part may be
donc properiy.
Besides, it will ultimately
redound to the advantage of Canada. 0f
course, not- ail the people who corne here
will rcmain here as citizens, but some will,
and we ought to see that they ail get a
gond impression of the country.
There should be no further delay in looking
aSter this matter, and I suggest that it be
dra'wn to the attention of the Minister of
National War Services. Perhaps he already
has it in hand. I hope he has, for nothing

would please me better than to be told I
am late with my suggestion-that the matter
is in charge of that Minister or of another,
and that some system is being applied to the
working out of the whole problem. Let us not
fail in this.
Hon. Mr DANDURAND: There is seldom
a meeting of the Cabinet when its attention
is not directed to one angle or another of
this subject. I think I could get Hon. Mr.
Crerar, whose department embraces the Immigration Branch, which has supervision of
the entry of these refugees, to come before the
Committee on Banking and Commerce and tell
us what has been done up to date and what
is projected for the future.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I realize that we could have adjourned
the
Senate on Saturday until Tuesday
afternoon.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But opinions
in another place were divided as to the
rapidity with which the estimates could be
disposed of there. As we are not having
separate sittings to-day, I would suggest that
we adjourn during pleasure, and on the information I 'have I think we should perhaps
reconvene at 8 o'clock this evening.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is that an
intimation that we may be here to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: It is a little stronger
than "may," I think.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When it was
suggested to me that we adjourn until 8 o'clock
to await the last Bill ta come to us, there was
implied the expectation that the Bill would
be here by that time, and that after the Royal
Assent was given to it and other measures
we should be able to adjourn this evening
until the 5th of November.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot, of
course, foresee what may happen in the other
Chamber, but it occurred to me that we might
do as we did yesterday-adjourn until half
past five or a quarter to six. If we reassembled
then we should know what the evening bas in
store for us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That suggestion
is quite agreeable to me, and I would move
that the Senate adjourn during pleasure, to
reconvene at half past five this afternoon.

stipulates that supplies (stationery, etc.) are
only to be accepted when fully prepaid by
means of postage stamps at the ordinary postage
rates;
Therefore lis Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the
Minister of National War Services and with
the concurrence of the Postmaster General, is
pleased to amend .the National Registration
Regulations, 1940, established by Order in
Council of 12th July, 1940 (P.C. 3156), and
they are hereby amended by adding the following words to section 35 thereof:
provided postage shall be fully prepaid on
supplies (stationery, etc.) at the regular third
class matter rate.

25th day of July, 1940.

directions to the Chief Registrar for Canada.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. They are

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If it will not
alarm my right honourable friend, I may say
I am always thinking of him, and of the

requests le occasionally makes for various
information. I asked yesterday if these regulations would reach us in time to be laid on
the Table, and was told that was improbable,
but they would be issued soon and announced
to the public. They are based on the statement
which I read here a few days ago.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I could have
told my honourable friend long ago-in fact
I did tell him-that it was improbable they
would be laid on the Table in time for the
House to discuss them. This just makes a
monkey of Parliament.
My right honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend has no right to say that,
because not only did I read the whole basis
of the regulations, but I said that if my
right honourable friend so desired I would
call before one of our committees the gentlemen who are drafting the regulations, so that
honourable members would know just what
was being done and how it was being done.
These gentlemen are: Mr. Cassels, a prominent Toronto lawyer, who, I think, is a son
of the late Judge Cassels; Brigadier Orde, the
Judge-Advocate-General, and Mr. Boisvert,
of Quebec.' I think my right honourable
friend will find everything done to his satisfaction.

see very much value in cross-examining

General acquainting him that the Right Hon-

TRIBUTES TO DECEASED SENATORS
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it is my sorrowful duty to inform
this Chamber of the demise of two of our
colleagues, Senator Laird and Senator Fauteux,
since we separated in August last.
The Honourable Senator Laird had been
with us since 1917. Coming from the capital
of the province of Saskatchewan, he brought
to us a large store of experience and information. As he had been a journalist, he was
able to extend his thoughts to all the ques-

tions of the day and was well prepared for
the task of enlarging the information of his
readers. He was public-spirited and occupied

a number of offices in his home city of Regina,
where he was chief magistrate for a couple
of years.

Like many citizens of the North-

west, he had been brought up in the old
province of Ontario. He not only interested
himself in the public affairs of the country,
but took part in its industrial development.
He was president of important companies and

had acquired a practical knowledge of business affairs at first hand.
The late senator had a notable career in the
military field. He served for four years with

the Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto, for seven
years as a captain in the 40th Northumberland Battalion, and for three years as a major
with the Army Service Corps, and was with the
Canadian Expeditionary Force during the war.
In 1916, as lieutenant-colonel, he organized the
3rd Divisional Train, C.E.F., and proceeded to
England and France in command. Unfortunately, in 1917 he lost his son, who was with the
Royal Flying Corps in France.
Such was his record when he reached this
Chamber in 1917. We were pleased to find in
him one perfectly equipped for his task. He
had a general and profound knowledge of the
affairs of the West, and discussed numerous
questions appertaining generally to the welfare
of this country. Senator Laird was net very
often heard in this Chamber, although before
disease afflicted him we used to hear from him
when occasion demanded, and up to the last
day of last session he gave us the benefit of
his advice in various committees when they
were reviewing legislation. We always found
that he had a clear mind on those questions,
and we felt the wiser for listening to him. I
think the judgment that I pass on him will
be shared by all who sat in committees with
him, even in the last days, when he was in
poor health. He endeared himself through
his qualities of mind and heart, and we shall

464

SENATE

all miss him. I always found him one of the
most courteous and friendly members of this
Chamber, and it was a real pleasure to meet
him, in or out of the Senate.
The Honourable Senator Fauteux had been
with us but a few years. When he was
appointed he gave promise of a very brilliant
career in this Chamber. He had a high
reputation as a barrister in his own province,
and became the head of the Montreal Bar,
or, to use the French term, the Bâtonnier.
It goes without saying that he enjoyed the
esteem and confidence of all members of his
profession. He was inclined towards political
activities and, through his eloquent voice,
gave his party all the help he could. As a
matter of fact, he was one of the Conservative
party's brilliant speakers in the province of
Quebec, and no one was surprised when the
Right Honourable Mr. Meighen selected him
as Solicitor-General for the Dominion. In
this House he was not heard very often,
because, as we were surprised to learn last
session, he was in very delicate health. That
fact was not evident from his appearance,
but all those who knew him felt it was the
reason why he did not rise oftener to give
us his advice on questions that were being
debated here.
To the families of our departed colleagues
I offer the heartfelt sympathy of all members
of this Chamber. I am quite sure my honourable friend who is leading the other side
to-day (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) will associate
himself with these condolences.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I did not have the privilege of
being acquainted with Senator Laird until I
beceame a member of this Chamber, seme nine
years ago. At that time he was in his full
vigour. I was attracted by the clearness of
mind which, so long as he retained his health,
he brought to bear on all the subjects that
one would discuss with him or that came up
for consideration in the Senate. My honourable friend the leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) has, in bis customary eloquent
and sympathetic manner, traced Senator
Laird's active life. It was not only an active
life, but also a most useful one. The West
particularly and Canada as a whole are poorer
because of the passing of Senator Laird.
Senator Fauteux I knew for more than
twenty years. He was a gentleman of great
qualities and of a kind disposition, and was
very modest and reticent. When you got to
know him as a friend you found ho was one
of 1he most jovial and likeable persons that
anyone could meet in public or private life.
He was possessed of unusual talents as an
orator, and I doubt very much if he bad any
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

superior in the province of Quebec. To me
it was always a matter of regret that we did
not hear from him oftener in the Senate.
As my honourable friend opposite has already
stated, Senator Fauteux had a distinguished
career as a barrister, and became Bâtonnier
of the Montreal Bar. He offered his services
to the public freely, and no doubt that is one
reason why in later years his health was not
as robust as it should have been, and why
be passed away at a rather early age.
I know I am expressing the views of everyone on this side of the Senate when I say we
associate ourselves with the honourable leader
andi members on the other side in conveying
our most sincere sympathy to the families of
the late Senators Laird and Fauteaux.
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVÉ
(Translation):
Honourable senators, there are few places
where life follows its course on such a striking

tempo as it does in this House. There are
few if any sessions during which the deathknell is not sounded for some one of our
colleagues, fallen a victim to the Grim
Reaper, who strikes right and left, with no
consideration for age or for human tasks to
he performed. I should have nothing to
add to the tribute so eloquently paid by the
leaders of this House to the memory of those
who were the last to be called by death, were
net the tics of friendship that have bound
me for fifty years to the late lamented senator from Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Fauteux)
enjoining me to render him a last tribute in
this House.
André Fauteux was a man endowed with a
natural distinction, which was heightened by
a sound intellectual culture, and marked by
an eloquence full of charm, clegance and
spiritual elevation, which bespoke a mind
nurtured with beautiful things and noble
ideas. André Fauteux was quite fond of
politics as a means of upholding principles
and ideas; consequently, under our democratic system he frequently had 'to suffer in
this regard.
He was net a politician; he
confessed to a lack of psychological precision.

To serve his country through bis party, he
ignored danger or peril; ho could fight to the
last ditch and accept unhesitatingly the most
threatening risk, the heaviest sacrifice and
the hitterest political struggle.
However, the nobleness of his feelings. the
sincerity of his heart and the dignity of bis
coducet ensured him the admiration of his
fiercest opponents.
As he came to Ottawa too late to become
sfilicently accustomed to the federal atmopherc, hi-s colleague s had but too seldom the
opportunityv of aipprcciating his talents, but all

could admire in him a perfect gentleman.

NOVEMBER 5, 1940
May his soul rest in peace, and may the
memory of his life be a lesson and an
example to the younger Canadian generation.
Hon. H. H. HORSEY: Honourable senators, I am sure we all join in the tributes
two late colwhich have been paid to
leagues by the leaders (Hon. Mr. Dandurand
and Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) and by the honMr.
(Hon.
opposite
ourable gentleman
Sauvé).
I knew Senator Fauteux only slightly, but
I was familiar with his brilliant record as a
barrister and a parliamentarian.
I did not know Senator Laird until I
beicame a member of this House, but at our
first meeting he made a strong impression
on me-as I know he did on others-and I
was soon on intimate terms with him. His
genial disposition endeared him to us all.
He displayed conspicuous ability both in this
Chamber and in our committees, his remarks
being always to the point and, when occasion
allowed, humorous as well. During the last
few months of his illness I visited him in this
city several times, and always he met me with
a smile and referred in terms of affection to
his colleagues on both sides of the House.
Though Senator Laird held strong political
convictions, he could always be depended
upon to subordinate party welfare to the
national interest.
Our sincere sympathy will go out to the
widow and family of Senator Laird, and also
to the family of Senator Fauteux.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

The Right Honourable Sir Lyman P. Duff,
the Deputy Governor General, having come
and being seated at the foot of the Throne,
and the House of Commons being come with
their Speaker, the Right Honourable the
Deputy Governor General was pleased to
close the First Session -of the Nineteenth
Parliament of the Dominion of Canada with
the following speech:

465

Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
When the present session opened in May,
one free country after another, in quick succession, had become the victim of Nazi a gression.
Before its adjournment on August 7, Italy had
joined ber Axis partner as an open enemy,
French resistance had collapsed, and the Government of France had surrendered. Britain
herself was threatened with invasion. The
theatre of confiict had begun to spread into
other lands beyond the confines of Europe.
Japan and China were still at war. Among
the nations of the world, the United Kingdom
and the British Dominions, alone, stood in
arms in the defence of the world's freedom.
Canada has willingly accepted the widening
responsibilities which events have placed upon
her. The measures which you have taken have
had in view the immediate task of sharing more
completely in the defence of Britain and securing our own country more effectively against
internal subversion and external attack. They
have also had in view the long-range task of
ensuring the ultimate defeat of the enemy.
To serve these ends, the structure of the
Administration has been altered and enlarged.
A Ministry of National Defence for Air and a
Ministry of National Defence for Naval SerThe scope of the

powered by the National Resources Mobilization
Act to bring to the defence of Canada and the
advancement of the common cause all the
resources of the country, both human and
material. In the different branches of war
activity there has been a steady expansion and
acceleration of training, transport, manufacture
and production.
By the Unemployment Insurance Act you
have made a valuable contribution to industrial
and financial stability in time of war, and to
social security and justice in time of peace.
It is deeply gratifying that approval was given
by all the provinces to the necessary amendment
to the British North America Act to permit
of the enactment of unemployment insurance
by the Parliament of Canada.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the financial appropriations
which you have made. The determination of
the Canadian people to support and advance the
cause for which we have taken up arms, has
been reflected in the unselfish acceptance by all
of its heavy financial burdens.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It bas become only too apparent that the
lust for conquest will continue to enlarge the
theatre of war. The struggle to preserve freedom will be long and hard. May Almighty
God guide and uphold its brave defenders.
