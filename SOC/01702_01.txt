OFFICIAL REPORT
THE SENATE
Thursday, March 12, 1931.
The Parliament of Canada having been
summoned by Proclamation of the Administrator of the Government of Canada to
meet this day for the despatch of business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
OPENING OF THE SESSION
The Hon. the Speaker informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from the Acting Secretary to the Administrator informing him that His Excellency the
Administrator would proceed to the Senate
Chamber to open the session of the Dominion
Parliament this day at 3 o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the
Administrator proceeded to the Senate Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne. His
Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House being come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the
Second Session of the Seventeenth Parliament
of the Dominion of Canada with the following
speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I welcome you to your duties at a time when
the nations of the world are passing througl
a period of great economie depression. Canada
bas not escaped it. But the Canadian people
hav- met the trials of the moment with
patience and fortitude, and are facing the
future with the courage and faith which must
triumph over every difficulty. In prosperity
they were united. In adversity that union is
made still stronger by the spirit of co-operation
and mutual understanding which is the surest
bulwark of the nation's welfare and happiness.
These attributes of Canadianism are national
assets of real value, and, upon their possession,
I do profoundly congratulate you.
It will be your privilege to consider certain
measures designed by my Ministers to ameliorate
existing conditions, to provide further means
by which our people may go forward to achieve
a prosperity heretofore unattained and to

furnish them with all possible safeguards
against a recurrence of the present subordination to world forces.
The fact that- in this period of universal
distress Canada has been spared the same acute
degree of hardship which many other nations
have been called upon to bear, will not, I know,
blind you to the fact that between this country
as it is and as it should be, there is a gulf
to be bridged by the industry and zeal of all
those who have the welfare of the nation in
The problems which stand
their keeping.
between us and ultimate prosperity are manifold and great. To be effectually met, they
must first be understood. Confusion between
cause and effect will but delay their solution.
My Government has explored the origins of
our difficulties and is firmly of the belief that
many of our problems do not arise out of worldwide depression, but are antecedent to it; and
that domestic factors have also largely determined the degree of economic distress from
which this country is suffering.
It w-as this belief which impelled my Ministers at the emergency session of Parliament
held in Septemaber last to remove one of the
root weaknesses in our industrial system by
effecting such then possible changes in the tariff
as would, in their opinion, provide substantial
security against harmful world competition.
Although in the interval world conditions have
changed but little for the better, this tariff
legislation has resulted in a marked improvement in the domestic situation through the
strengthening of established industries, and in
addition many others, formerly exporters to
Canada, have now become producers in Canada.
The operation of the Unemployment Relief
Act, 1930, has proved equally beneficial. While
the grant authorized by this Act could not
imnediately have checked unemployment aising from causes of which you have full knowledge, yet its careful administration by my Ministers, ably aided by the provincial and municipal governments and the two great railway
systems, has resulted in the institution of a
nation wide program of publie undertakings,
each one a unit in a scheme of national development, which have collectively provided work for
the greatest number of men who have ever been
employed through the direct efforts of the
Federal Government.
Since the last session of Parliament four
of my Ministers attended the Imperial and
Imperial Economie Conferences in London.
Several ceonstitutional questions, arising largely
out of the resolutions of the Imperial Conference of 1926, were fully discussed and, in principle, approved. My Ministers, however, held
the view that before certain constitutional
changes embodied in these resolutions should be
made effective by a statute of the Parliament
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, the Provinces of Canada
should be given an opportunity of further con-

sidering themo and of satisfying themselves that
these proposed changes do not in any way
restrict their constitutional rights. Unanimous
concurrence in this view having been given by
the representatives of Great Britain, the Irish
Free State and the other Dominions, my Ministers have called a Provincial Conference to
be hld at Ottawa in the month of April for
the consideration of the proposed changes.
Following the conference you will be asked to
take appropriate action.
Exhaustive consideration of the means most
likely to ensure a lasting and nutually advantageous scheie of Empire economie co-operation
w.as also commenced at the Imperial Conference,
and nany matters preliininary to a final concision were then disposed of. Searching investigation
into the mnerits of alternative
schemes by the governments concerned is continuing. and it is confidently hoped that, at the
adjourned Conference to maeet at Ottawa during
the ensuing summer. agreements will be concluded for closer Empire trade, which will
strengthen still more the bonds of Empire and
bring to every part of it great and enduring
prosperity.
Pursuant to the fixed policy of my Governmont to combat all influences which are inimical
to the social and economic welfare of this
Dominion, an Order in Council has been passed
prohibiting the importation of certain commodities into Canada fron the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.
My ,insters have completed the organization approved by legislation at the last session
of the Sixteenth Parliament for administering
the Pension Act as anended, and have taken
steps to ensure that every care shall be exercised to obtain the just and equitable satisfaction of all legitimate claims.
My Ministers have had under anxious consideration the ineans by which an orderly
marketing of the wheat crop of Western
Canada may be assured. and have already
taken such effective action towards that end as
the cirecnstances appear to justify. My Ministers are aware that changing conditions in the
vorld's markets may necessitate further intervention by my Government, which is prepared
te render whatever additional assistance may
be deened advisable in the national interest.
rie present situation has emphasized the necessity of effecting a reduction in the costs of
production and marketing of the wheat crop
and of providing more stable markets, as the
welfare of all parts of Canada is involved in
satisfactory returns being received by the grain
growers.
The broad outline of the general scheme of
national developmnent undertaken by my Government. including provision for old age pensions, aid to agriculture, technical education
and highway construction, has already been
made known. My Ministers are persuaded that
this general schmne cannot advantageously b
altered.
Careful consideration bas therefore
been given to the progressive stages by which
it will be carried out, and you will be asked
to consider measures sanctioning such action as
the current economie situation warrants, and
such as can be undertaken without undue
demands upon the national exchequer.

You will be asked te consider such further
revision of the tariff as may be carried out
with but incidental adjustments to the British
Preference Schedules now in force.
You will have before you for consideration
a Bill to create a Tariff Board, the purposes
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

of which will be to ensure stability of trade,
opportunities for the developmsent of our home
market by Canadian producers in fair competition with those of other nations, and the protection of our ceonsunsers from exploitation.
Amongst other measures to which your attention will be invited are Bills for the more
effective control of national finance; for the
revision of the existing provisions for Government purchases; for amuending the Naturalization Act; and for amending the Copyright Act.
The reference to the Supreme Court of
Canada of the respective jurisdictions of the
Dominion and Provinces over radio breadcasting necessarily postpones any definite legislative action being taken until the opinion of
the Court of last resort bas been obtained.
Mnebers of the House of Commnons:
The public accounts for the last fiscal year
and the estimuates for the coming year will be
submitted at an early date. The estimates will
manifest my Ministers' resolve that, until the
revenues of the country reflect a definite
miprovement in the economic situation, every
econony compatible vith the proper administration of the State will be exercised.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
ienbers of the House of Commons:
The policies and measures I have outlined
are based upon the firm belief of my Government that this country is soon to enter upon
a new era of prosperity, and that the proper
developnent of its vast resources by a people
jledgcd to unity and co-operation. and endowed
with courage and industry, wuill ensure to
Canada a leading place anong the nations. I

Honourable the Prime Minister and the
Honourable the Minister af Labour, who, 1
am pleased ta say, is a highly esteemed
member of this Chamber. lit is a matter of
partieular pride that this is the second time
rny province has been so hononred.
The march af time has brought with it the
periodic change in the viceregal governmcnt
of aur Dominion, a change which in the
latest instance was hastened somewhat by the
choice af aur late Governor General for important service in anather part of the Empire.

develapment. The new Governar General and
his estimable lady will be sure ai a warm.
welcame ta aur shores, and ai loyal and
sympathetic sneport during their terni of
service.
Honourable senators, we are assembled in
the Parliament oi this great Dominion ta
deal with the most tense financial and economie conditions, which are world-wide and
causing concern ta legislators ai every
country. Thongh aur financial and econamie
position ta-day is such as ta give gronnd for
anxiety and very seriaus thought ta this Parliament, and especially ta the great leader
wha sits in the Prime Mînister's chair in
another place, and the loyal men who surround him as advisers, and though depression
may exist in all countries in theý world, Canada will be at least, one of the first ta emerge
agamn at its normal level. Our conntry abounds
an resources over which, as has been said,
the ground has been merely scratched, it is
a comparatively new country, flot pressed
down with sncb crnshing burdens as those
with wbich the oldei, parts caf the world are
laden. I tbinýk it is a f air statement, that this
Dominion is the most prosperou.5 place in

SENATE
civilization, excepting perhaps France. The
way may look somewhat dark, and, according
to rumour, it may be stormy for a while; but
as with nature, after the storm the sun wiil
shine, and with the co-operation of Parliament and the people, this country will arise
greater and stronger than ever.
The Prince of Wales once said, "Canada is
one of the most astonishing examples of expansion and development the world bas ever
known." That is a fairly broad expression,
but who can say that the truth is overstated?
Once the policy of this Government for the
development of home industries is put fully
into practice, with the energetic co-operation
of our people, the wonderful resources of the
Dominion wilil be instrumental in creating an
enviable position for this country in the not
far distant future.
Many times, in many places, public men
of this country have referred to our great resources, such as agriculture, fisheries, minerals,
water-power, lumber, and so on. May I call
your attention to some of the most important
which have brought Canada to the favourable
position it occupies to-day?
The mineral products of this country in
1900 were valued at $64,000,000; in 1928, $260,000,000. Nincty per cent of the world's nickel,
76 per cent of its asbestos, and 25 per cent of
its cobalt come from Canada, and our production of gold and silver ranks high.
The late Minister of the Interior issued a
statement showing the relation between the
mineral industry and water-power. Two significant points were brought.out. In addition
to the ore reserve that bas already been
blanketed, and the discoveries that have already 'been made, there is an area of more
than 3,000,000 square miles, being eighty per
cent of the total area of the Dominion, which
forms a prospective mineral field. The other
point was in regard to the extent of the waterpower resources of the Dominion. The waterpower at presunt recorded is some forty million horse-power, of which only about eight
million horse-power has as yet been utilized.
Another great industry of Canada might be
mentioned-life insurance, which, up to December 31, 1929, amounted to six billions.
Again, our investments indicate confidence in
our country by its own citizens. Out of an
aggregate of about eighteen billions only onethird is foreign. True, other countries have
investments in this Dominion. It bas been
stated in this country and in Great Britain
that the United States is gaining economic
control of Canada. Is there any authority
for such a sweeping statement? To repeat, of
eighteen billions of dollars invested here only
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER.

one-third is foreign capital. Can we not take
an optimistie view of the situation? The United
States bas, undoubtedly, large investments in
Canada; but bas it net been asserted that
capital is usually followed by its owners into
the country of investment, and that eventually
capital is nationalized? The present levels of
Canadian securities, and the dividends paid,
show that investments made in past years
have brought substantial returns. Again, in
the last quarter of a century the productive
capacity of industries bas increased from
$4,000,000 to $3,500,000,000.
However important and profitable are the
various other industries of the country, I have
no doubt that the greatest industry of all in
Canada is yet, and will be in the future, the
agricultural industry. Our gross agricultural
wealth in 1929 was practically eight billions
of dollars. The total agricultural revenue in
1929 was something over a billion and a half.
The total area sown to field crops was sixty
million acres. The acreage of wheat in Canada
is twenty-four and a half millions, of which
the Prairie Provinces provide about twentyfour millions.
Net only does the agricultural production
of this country aid the rural districts, but it
aids probably more than does any other
industry the great harbours of Canada, the
harbours of Montreal, Vancouver, Quebec,
Halifax, Saint John, Churchill, Fort William,
and other ports.
We will all admit that the great aid to the
return of prosperity will be the increased purchasing power of the people, and it does seem
to me, rightly or wrongly, that if we can
increase the purchasing power of the people
engaged in the agricultural industry of this
country, it will do more than any other factor
in restoring prosperity.
A fair criticism of the speeches from the
Throne in the past bas been they were more
notable for what they omitted than for what
they contained. Such criticism cannot bu applied to the speech presented by His Excellency the Administrator in this Chamber on
Thursday last, so much is portended in that
speech on so many important items, such as,
to mention them briefly, further tariff revision, a Bill to create a Tariff Board, radio
legislation, old age pensions, and of very great
importance, the cutting down of the Estimates.
The following announcement, contained in the
speech, is noted with pleasure:
The present situation has emphasized the
necessity of effecting a reduction in the costs
of production and marketing of the wheat crop

and of providing more stable markets, as the

welfare of all parts of Canada is involved in
satisfactory returns being received by the grain
growers.

MARCH 17, 193,1
The speech also says:
My ministers have had under anxious consideration the means by which an orderly
marketing of the wheat crop of Western
Canada may be assured, and have already
taken such effective action towards ths.t end
as the circnmstances appear to justify. My
ministers are aware that changing conditions
in the world's rnarkets rnay necessitate further
intervention by rny Government, which is prepared to, render w'hatever additîonal assistance may be deemed advisable in the national
interest.
Before concluding rny brief reference to
the extension of our rnarkets I wish to say a
word as to our trade commissioners, and the
rninisters plenipotentiary, such as we have at
Washington, Paris and Tokio. Our ministers
plenîpotentiary are possibly essential, but 1
arn confident that trade agents and trade
commissioners, granted that they are rnen of
energy, industry and experience, are the
soundcst rneans of extending our trade with
f oreign countries. It has been rny privilege
to corne into contact with our trade commissionùers in several foreign countries, and it
has ever been rny belief that the rnan who is
in close touch with the people of any of
these foreign countries can do more for the
extension of our trade than the so-called
rninisters plenipotentiary, who, however good
they rnay be, do not corne into contact witb
the "rnan on the street" as do the trade commissioners.
I wish to refer briefly to the onerous task
that has been placed upon the present Minister of Labour, who is a member of this
House (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and to express
rny appreciation of that honourable gentIernan. He has been charged with perhaps the
most difficuit duties that have ever fallen
to the lot of any cabinet minister other than
the Prime Minister. Surely there is flot a
rnernber on either side of this House who will
not affirrn that the Minister of Labour has
exhibited great tact, and given evidence that
flot only is he well-inforrned, but he also
possesses to a great degree those qualities
which. are so necessary in adrninistering the
twenty millions given by this Parliarnent at
the 1930 session for the relief of the great
number of unernployed. According to information which 1 have been able to obtain,
228,351 have been given ernployrnent and
about four million rnan-days' work has been
supplied frorn the cornrencemnent of operations up to the end of last rnonth. Direct
relief has been given to 11,138 farnilies, and
to 86,164 individuals. The co-operation of
the provincial governments, the municipalities and our two great railway systems was,
I rnay say, ahI that could be desired. Further,
the policy propounded by the present Gov-

ernrnent for the protection of home industries, and ernbodied ini legislation plaoed in
the Statutes of Canada at the special session
has, thougb the tirne has been short, given
very favourable results ini securing the establishmnent of foreign industries ini this country and the reopening of industries that for
rnany years had been closed. Sorne of these
may be rnentioned.

Hon. T. J. BOURQIJE
Hionourable gentlemen, nîy first duty is te
,thank the Government for having done me
the honour of asking me te second the
Address in rcply to the Speech from the
Throne. I recognize that the principal reason
foi' this wvas the desire te honour the Acadian
race, of which I amn one of the representatives
in this Chamber. The Acadians, who are
iapidly grewing in nunibers and influence in
the Maritinme Pr~ovinces, are always happy te
take part in the country's affairs and te, fulfil

MARCH 17, 1931
generously and loyally their duties as citizens
of Canada, their native land, to which they
are deeply attached.
For the first time in the history of this
country the Canadian Parliament has been
opened by a Canadian. This is an extraordinary incident in our national if e. It
arises from. the fact that Canada has just
lost its Governor General, who during his
sojourn in our midst has won the esteem of
ail Canadians, and whose remarkable talent
for diplomacy will in future be exercised in
a rountry now confronted with difficult and
important problems.
Lord Willingdon's successor is a etatesmnan
of long experience who has distinguished himself also>on the field of battle, in the Great
War, and his coming to Canada will be
welcomied with joy and with the respect and
loyalty that we owe bo the British Crown, of
which he is the representative.
The Speech from the Throne mentions the
general depreasion that; bas prevailed for
some tirne in ail countries of the world, and
the wise and vigorous measures that have
been taken in Canada to relieve distress,
stimulate industry, give employment to workpeople and overcome the financial criais that
we are at present encountering. The Governent is to be congratulated upon the
ability and courage with which it has met
an extremely difficuit and threatening situation. I arn happy to say that owing to the
wise policy pursued by the Government, the
Province of New Brunswick up to the present
time has passed through the crisis without
undue suif ering. The works undertaken on
the iniative of the Federal Government, with
the co-operation of the Province and municipalities, have been of great assistance in
improving the situation and lesseniing unemployment, which has prevailed leas among us
than anywhere else in Canada.
Agriculture, lumbering and the fisheries
are the chief industries of my province. Al
these occupations have been seriously aifected
by the economic depression. The new tariff
imposed by Cuba against Canadian potatoes
is a severe hlow to us, especially in New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, where
pobtatoes are grown on an extensive scale. It
is to be hoped thaît some remedy may b
found for the preseint deplorable state o
affairs.
The fisheries are of primary importance in
the Maritime Provinces-of the samne relative
importance to the Maritime Provinces as
wheat growing is to the West. They provide
einployment for large numbers of people and
are an abundant source of revenue. It is

incumbent upon the Fisheries Department to
give particular attention to this industry in
order to maintain and develop it. The
products of our Atlantic coast fisheries are
unsurpassed. Our fiaI are noted for their
cloice, exquisite quality. Need I mention
our oysters, known everywhere for their
excellence; our lobsters, exporbed te the four
corners of the world; our salmon, fresh and
frozen, which has now entered the Old
Country markets; our mackerel, smeits, cod
and other varieties of fiaI whicî abound
along our coasts? In the last few years
especially this industry has been given a
remarkable impetus, and it is the duty of
the authorities to encourage and protect the
fislermen who engage in it, oftentimes at
great risk.
The Government's attitude to*ards old
age pensions las been approved by the
people, and I amn glad te observe in the
Speech from the Throne that the Goverument intends to take the necessary steps to
give effect to the policy it has advooated in
this respect.
The Government lhm devoted special attention to thc question of the tariff. It is
apparent tha>t the measures it has taken have
exercised a salutary influence on industry
and trade in Canada, which in general have
been stimulated hy the protection aiforded
l'hem, and are consequently providing more
employment for the workers in this country.
It is to be hoped that the Imperial Conference, wlose meetings have been adjourned
until next autumn, and whicî will resume its
labours in Ottawa, will be carried te a
successful conclusion and will have beneficial
results, both for our country and for the
British Empire as a whole. It is a matter
of pridc for us to note that the Prime Minister and h-is colleagues who represented
Canada at this Conference have upheld the
great traditions of the past.
Before resuming my seat I desire te take
advantage of this opportunity to congratulate
you, Mr. Speaker, upon being appointed to
preside over this august assembly. You
pos sess in a high degree ail the qualities that
are necessary for the lonourable, impartial
and fair performance of the duties of Speaker
of this honourable body.
Honourable senators, I thank you for the
kind attention tIat you have given me, and.
I am sure that our delîberations at this
session wilIle
bcharacterized by harmony,
good understanding and such happy resuits
asq have attended them ini tIe past.

SENATE

(Text) Honourable senators, 1 arn well
aware that many of you have not been able
to follow me in the few remarks that 1 have
just concluded in the French language, rny
mother tongue. Nevertheless, I thank you
sincerely for the attention you have given
me. I appreciate deeply the honour that was
conferred upon me in the invitation to second
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. I realize -that the honour was
especially intended for the race whom it is
my privilege to represent in Parliament.
Hon. RAOUL DANIDURANiD: Honourable senators, I arn sure that ail honourable
members of this Chamber will agree with
me that the Government made an excellent
choie-e in asking the honourable senator from
Boissevain' (Hon. Mr. Schaffner) and the
honourable senator from Richibueto (Hon.
Mr. Bourque) to move and second the Address. There was nothing in the matter noin the f orm of the honoura;ble gentlemen's
speeches to which anyone could objeet. We
should hear these honourable gentlemen
of'tener. They are, 1 will confess, near to
my heart, and the more we hear froma them
the wiscr we shali be.
The Speech froma the Throne dos flot refer
to the departure of Lord Willingdon nor the
appointment of bis successor. We enjoyed
the presenýce of Lord and Lady Willingdon
in Canada. They woere able representatives
of Bis Majesty the King, as I arn sure their
successors xviii be. It seemns te me that perhaps the last Imperial Conference would have
been an opportune occasion for considering
an alteration in the titie whicha we give to
the represe-ntative of the Crown in this
country. The titie Governor General is a
vcry old one, and for a great many years it
was a fltting one. Just as in olden days the
King governed in England, s0 the Governor
did in fact govern in the colony to wbicb he
xvas sent. But Governors General of a
Dominion no longer govern; they are simply
direct representatives of the King, who likewise no longer governs in Greýat Britain.
Therefore it secms to me logical-though
perhaps that is because of niy Latin mind-that, as I have .suggested before in this
Chamber, we shouid have for lis Majesty's
representative a new title, that of Viceroy.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Hýe is the Commander-in-Chief of ou-r Army and Navy.
Yes, but he
Hon. Mr. DANýDUTRAND:
would stili be that as Viceroy of Canada.
I have read the Government's statement
whicb was deplivcred hy' His Excellency the
Administrator in this Chamber leqst weck, and
Hon.

Nfr.

BOURQIJE.

I find that it deals mainly with the econornie
situation in Canada. It is quite natural that
that should be se, for every Canadian is concerned over that situation. In the Speech
fromn the Throne it is admitted th-at worldxvide conditions are a factor in the depressiois
that we are experiencing, but it is also stated
that conditions anterior te the world crisis
have accentuated our domestic distress. Taken
with its context, this means that until last
year our tariff was tee low, and wàth this
point of view I desire te take issue. My
honourable friand from Boisseva-in (Hon. Mr.
Schaffner) said th-at the people have turned,
as they did in former periods of distress, te
the Conservative Party. I would remind him
that we ware in a state of deep depression in
1921, when the then Government appealed
to the country, and the people, as usual,
turned towards the Liberal Party for relief.
As honourable mambers knSw, from 1922 te
1930 we had a fairly higha tariff, for it was, on
the whole, rather above 25 per cent. If my
bonourabie friends opposite would compare
that with the tariff of the ceuntries with whicha
we deal, the., would agrea wvith me that our
tariff was high. But it ivas tempered by the
British praference, wh.ich the Liheral Government had estahlishied in 1897, and it was
tcmperaed aN4o te a large extent by our many
commercial treaties.
What happened under those conditdons?
Nobody will dany that during 1923 and the
years that followed, up te 1929, this country
was very proisperous. The trade returns indicate it. I will simply giva the figures. The
export-s of 1922 amounted te $753,900,000, and
those of 1929 te $1,388,800,000, or neariy
double. Industries tbroughout Canada were
thriving.
My honourahle friand ha.s read a list of
ncw industries astablished, or industries revived sinca Septembar last. I wiil ask him
te look at the statisties, where he will find
that hundreds of new industries were estabiisbed, and as many enlarged, during the

official statistics at hand, but I have cited
them before. A rapidly taken census of the
newv institutions that have opened or that are
intending- te open will show that there is
ne comparison either in number or in size with
w-bat took place during the eight or nina years
prc:ceding the inceming of the present Govarnment.
Diirin.- those eight years frorn 1922 there
xvas considerable optimismn throughout the
lend, and industriel stocks were soaring-searing te sucb a point that people went mad.
Industrial stocks paying 6 per cent, with accumulated reserves and surplus dividends,

MARCH 17, 1931
mounted to $200. A speculator would say,
"It is true that this gives me a return of only
3 per cent, but think of the future development of this country." Such was the optimism
that the prices of stocks rose until the dividend was no more than 2 per cent. Stocks
were divided, and profits given to the shareholders. Stocks were "watered" on the basis
of reserves. That is what oocurred up to
1929.
My honourable friend from Boissevain (Hon.
Mr. Schaffner) may very well say that no
other counitry ever ranked as high with the
outside world as Canada does. The position to
which my honourable friend has referred was
not established yesterday. Since 1923 1 bave
been crossing the ocean from year to year
and meeting representatives of many countries, sorne of whom, with long faces and depressed spirits, have turned towa.rds Canada
and eaid, "What a luicky country you are!"
That was the view which prevailed during
the eight years of the regime of the Liberal
Government. It may be said, "Well, that
was probably a fair policy in f air weather,
but it is à. weak one in time of stress." 1
venture to say, honourable senators, that had
it not been f or the wheat slump ive should
have stood the test.
The Speech from the Throne says that
Canada bas 'heen spared in some degree the
hardshjps suffered by other nations. It has
been spared, and I say that but for cur wheat
difficulties Canada would have gallantly ridden
the storm, because our ýpurchasing power would
hardly have 'been affected. We have suffered.
from depression to a lasser extent,' I should
say, than the other countries of the world. To
meet that tamporary condition the present
Government says, "The remedy is a higher
tariff wall." If that were the true gospel, and
if it wera recognized throughout the world
and ganerally appliad, what would it mean?
It would me-an that every nation would he
living within bigh tariff walls, and that outside
trade would be danied; there would be no exchange, for the higher tha tariff walls the
greatar would !be the prosperity within those
walls.
Tha Prime Minister bas announced a higher
tariff. I have stated what bas been the average
tariff. My rîght honourabla friend 'the junior
member for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) has bad a hand in the mnakîng and
administering of tariffs, and he knows what
kind of tarif wve have had during his regime
and since: he knows that it was more than a
modarata tariff. Having unnounoed a higher
tariff, tht Prime Ministar, as a logical sequence,
proposes the danunciation of commercial
treaties, becausa he bas been asscrting-and

9

wve have heard it statad also in this Chamberthat those treaties were lowering the customs
duties and reducing tbe protection to our
industries. A higher tariff and the denunciation of commercial treaties are the principles
for wbich my right honourable friend the
Prime Minister stands. I would ask my honourab'le friends who face me to bring us information as to the number of commercial
treaties that at this date 'have been denounced.
Such treaties, sînce September lust, are supposed to bave been hurting the trade of Canada
if they 'have been lowering the duties and
running counter to the ýorthodox doctrine of
bigh tariff.
At the same t ime, almost in the same
hreath, the right honourable gentleman says;
that he will strive for wider markets. This
statamant is to be f ound in the Speech from
the Throne, and it was made offi.ially in
clear-cut terms by -the right honourable gentleman from 'his place in Parliament during
the short session of 1930. Surely the two
policies are inconsistent. Ona cannot blast
his way into f oreign markets while refusing
to open bis own markets. Thare are always
two parties to a bargain, and fair trade is
fair exchange. We may raise our tariff walls,
but in so doing we endanger-we may even
dastroy-our export trade, which provides,
to a large extent, and has provided, amployment for thousands and tans of thousands
of working men engaged in our industries.
Surely no one in this Chamber will dlaimn
that we should be limited to our domnestic
market. Many. of our commoditias we export, and must export. Take wheat for
example. We shaîl have to flnd expert
markets for our whaat and many othar things
that go to swell our volume of trade. Shail
we obtain any favours in f oreign markets
without giving favours in raturn? We raad
last week or the weak befora that France
had arcctad a tariff of 32.50 against Australian whaat, becausa Australia had raîsed
its tariff wall so bigh that no Franch goods
could pass over it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is 82.50 on
100 kilos.
Two dollars
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
and a haif per quintal. France is protacting
itself against the importation of wheat from
Australia becausa Australia will not reciprocate.
Whan the Prime Minister came back from
Europe he stated, and I was very glad te
hear it, that the French Government would
buy soma. of our wheat. But, I shoîiId like
to inquire, did ha obtain that promise just
for the asking? What did ha give in return?

10

SENATE

There, as elsewhere, there must be give and
take. The present Government, or any Government, cannot escape the fundamental law
of commerce, which is exchange.
Let us take the case of the United States.
The United States has a varied climate and
varied production; that country is better
situated than any other country in the world
to attempt to live in isolation and to be
self-contained. Yet the United States have
not been content with only their domestic
market: they have built up an immense export trade, and in spite of their high tariff
they have imported to the extent of 67
per cent of the value of their total exports
of manufactured goods. In 1929 the United
States bought $1,600,000,000 worth of manufactured goods from outside countries. That
is a very interesting situation.
An American economist, bent upon finding
solutions for the economie problems of the
United States, attributes the development of
the econonic crisis, which, he declares, started
in that country, to the decrease in their purchasing power, whieh decrease prevented the
United States froni buying from foreign countries whose markets were awaiting them. The
result was, he says, that in those countries
prices went down and industry was retarded;
their purchasing power was therefore materially rcduccd and they in turn had to reduce
their purchases from the United States. What
conclusion is to be drawn from that? The
United States were unable to buy because
of the reduction in their purchasing power
in the autumn of 1929, and could not sell because they had injuriously affected other countries from which they were in the habit of
buving. Here are his words:
Our diminished iimports reacted unfavourably
upon them and contributed to the fall of prices.
resulting in a condition of distress. and as our
business froi them lias fallen off and their
purchasing power lias been curtailed, their
ability to buy from ius lias been correspondingly reduced.
You have there, honourable senators, the
action and the reaction, showing how interlocked are the nations economically
Now, to cure their passing ills the United
States, like Canada, have turned to the nostrum of a still higher tariff. Already, by reducing their purchases, they had brought distress to their foreign clients, who, in the same
measure, ceased to buy from them; then the
situation was aggravated by a higher tariff.
The result bas been most damaging to Europe
and to the United States as well. Imports and
exports between the United States and Europe
have gone down tremendously and on both
sides of the ocean unemployment lias increased.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

It is true that an inerease in the tariff may
benefit some producers, but it may be injuriously affecting the country as a whole. Increased employment may appear here and
there, but the health of the country may
seriously decline, and this ill surely be the
case in a country to which foreign trade is an
absolute necessity.
There are two schools of thought in economies-the Cobden school of free trade, and
the high protection school. The Liberal Party
of Canada lias stood between the two extremes.
To a certain degree it has accepted competition from outside; but it has maintained
a tariff such as I have described in order to
give a fair chance to the consumer and at
the same time to develop foreign trade.
We had a raither severe economic depression in 1920, 192'1 and 1922. The Conservative
Party went down to defeat. The spirits of the
people were depressed. We had to face that
condition there just as my honourable friends
opposite have had to face the present conditions. Did we resort to a higher tariff?
On the contrary, we simply did what the
Borden-Meighen Covernment had' donc: we
tried to adjust ourselves te conditions by
maintaining a fair protection, at the same timc
developing our industries and our foreign
trade. I do net recall in exactly what month
the Borden Government was replaced by the
Meighen Government, but at that time there
was an opportunity to resort to the remedy
that is now offered to us. Yet the Government did nothing of the kind. On the contrary, they removed the seven per cent increase which had been imposed at the beginning of the war. I may be told that the
imposition of that seven per cent was a war
measure; nevertheless, when it was removed
we had just emerged from the war and had
still to face its consequences. Though we were
entering on a period of depression. the Goverrnnent decided to bring the tariff back to
the average figure which I have given of 25
per cent or, it may be, 26 per cent. It was
at one fell blow reduced by seven per cent.
And, if I am net mistaken, the Meighen
Goveronient reduced the duties on agricultural implements. But the policy which the
late Government adhered te soon restored
the country to a high degree of prosperity.
In two or three years the national finances
were re-established on a sound basis, large
surpluses had accumulated, and there was a
reduction in the country's debt and in taxatien. That Government did net see fit to
resort to the measures whieh are being comnended by my honourable friends opposite.
But I wish them success, for I am a Canadian first.
I hope their policy will net

impede the development and prosperity of
the country. If the present Government,
during this Parliament, do as much for
Canada as was done during the first Parliament of the late Government, I shall thankProvidence.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTTON: Will the
honourable gentleman answer a question?
Did not the late Administration in the last
session in which they were in power raise
the tariff to a higher level than it had ever
before been at in the history of Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will consider the Dunning modifloations, the Dunning BudgetHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, I
mean the general tariff; I arn not referring
to preference. Did they not raise the general
tariff against coi.mtries outside the Empire
to a higlier level than it had ever been at
before?
Hon. Mr. DAN'ýDURÀND: If my honourable friend is referring to the mean level of
the tariff, I answer his question in the negative. The late Government increased the
duties on steel. Bounties were given to iron
and steel producers in the East and the
West, and the tariff was increased on some

articles.
friend that a tariff is not like the laws of the
Medes; on the contrary, it can ho modified
and readjusted occasionally as conditions
warrant. But there is a great difference
between a policy like that of the former
Administration and one which would resuit in
high protection on most of the items on the
tariff.
Do I
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
understand the honourable gentleman to agree
that they did raise the tariff to a higher level
than it ever lad been at before?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I cannot
say that.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I should
liket to understand what the. honourable gentleman does say.
Hon. Mr. DAIN'DURAND: I answer my
honourable friend in the negative, while admitting that we did raise the tariff on certain
items.
Hon, W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
senators, for plysical if for no other reasons,
I have no intention of following the honourable leader on the other side in a discussion
on the tariff. My purpose in rising is to
express my compliments to the lonourable
members who have moved and seconded the

il

Address. I think it is a well established eustom that the leaders on both sides of this
Chamber should congratulate the mover and
the seconder of the Address, but I desire to
do so now, not merely from a sense of duty,
but because it is a pleasure to do so. My
bonourable friend who moved the Address
(Hon. Mr. Schaffner) is an old parliamentarian. Coming from the West as 1 do, I
realize that it was only because he was an
able politician and highly esteemned by the
people that lie was able to hld an agricultural seat in Manitoba for the Conservatives
in the reciprocity election. He was possessed
of both attributes, ability and acceptahility
to the people. 1 have had an opportunity
of observîng some of the services that he
lias rendered on committees of tliis House,
and I know of no lonourable memnber who
is more regular in lis attendance at eommittee
meetings and more efficient in 'his duties. In
common with most Anglo-Saxons, I have not
the good fortune to lie a good bilinguist; but
I understood and greatly enjoyed the speech
of the honourable gentleman from Richibueto
(Hon. Mr. Bourque) when lie spoke in lis
mother tongue. I amn sure I express the sentiments of ail other honourable members when
I say that we should like to hear these two
lonourable gentlemen oftener. Perhaps it
may not lie out of place to remark bore that
there are a number of honourable foombers
in this House who were formerly distinguisbed
members of another place and who speak to
us here too rarely. These honourable gentlemen, who perhaps became tired of the
stren.uous life in the other House, have a ripe
experience fromn whicl we should lie glad to
profit. Then, too, there are a number of
honourable senators who had no political
experience prior to their appointment to tliis
Chamber, but who hold eminent positions
in the business and professional world, and
whose opinions we sliould like to hear expressed more frequently.
If no otlier honou'rable member lias anything to say, I would move that tlie House

It is somewhat difficult in organizing the

A matter of vested rights.

And that newcomers are eligible only when vacancies
occur.
It had been suggested-and
this
morning we acted upon the suggestion to a
limited extent-that a senator who has been
a member of a committee and for two
sessions has not served on it should waive
his traditional right to continue on that committee, just as he would forfeit his right to
sit in the Senate if for two consecutive
sessions he failed to attend. My purpose in
mentioning this is that honourable members
may realize that their prolonged absence
from a committee will be an indication to

the emergency session, also in French. I value
greatly the document in French, but I have
always thought that mernbers of either House

to our esteemed Clerk, and I should like
the members of the Joint Committee to inform the Distribution Office that members

of this Chamber we heard him championing
here the cause that was nearest to his heart.
In latter years we have seen him going down
the hill of life, and mellowing to a considerable degree. As I thought of him at times
it seemed to me that against the many disadvantages of age there is one advantage, that
as we draw near the end of the journey we
look upon men and affairs with a softened
eye, and a softened heart as well.
I join with the honourable leader of the
House
in extending
sympathy to the
beroaved family.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
I should like to join briefly in the tribute
to the late Senator Turriff. He was one of
the first members of the old Legislature of
the Northwest Territories, and as such was
one of those who laid the foundation of our
laws, many of which are still in existence in
Saskatchewan and Alberta.
It is a sad
thought that so many of the pioneers of the
West have passed away. The late Senator
Turriff was a man of considerable natural
ability. Despite our political difference, he
and I were alwavs good friends, and I am
able to endorse what has aready been said,
that he was always fighting in the interests
of the West. Both in this Chamber and in
another place, he could ahvays be depended
upon to present the Western viewpoint
effectively. Not only the West, but the
country generally has suffered a great loss.

TRAFFIC

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators, I wish to make a few remarks in regard to automobile traffic in the Parliament
grounds. As I understand the regulation
passed at a recent session, cars coming in
through the east gate were obliged to turn
to the right and to go around the East
Block; they were forbidden to turn to the left.
That regulation appears to have been
dropped, for I noticed that as cars came
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

through the East Gate to-day, some turned
to the right and some to the left.
Now,
those of us who are getting old and are too
poor to ride in automobiles have to be very
careful to avoid being run down. Under the
existing conditions the likelihood of an accident occuring inside the gates is more than
twice as great as it was formerly, because,
now, when one sees a car coming one does
not know whether it is going to turn towards
him or in the opposite direction. I should
like to sec the old regulation re-established,
and I would ask the honourable leader of
the House if he will see what can be done
in that respect. I should also like to know
whether this meets with the approval of other
honourable members.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I shall confer
with the proper committee and see what, if
anything, can be donc to remedy the situation, if a change from existing rules is necessary. I shall inform the honourable gentleman later of the result of my interview with
the committee.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Administrator's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Schaffner for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
senators, when I adjourned the debate last
night I was hoping that some other honourable member would bc ready to proceed
to-day, because, I confess, I have had neither
the time nor the opportunity to make preparations for an extensive address to the House.
But perhaps it is incumbent upon me to say
something concerning the development that
has taken place in publie affairs since the last
regular session of the House, in view of the
close connection that I have had with many
matters of interest to the country as a whole
during this time.
First I should like to express my sincere
congratulations to the mover and the seconder
of the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne. It is obvious that these honourable gentlemen devoted a great deal of
care to the preparation of their speeches, and
I am sure that all honourable members are
grateful to them. As I listened to the mover

Parliament was convened.
It .was provided that certain sums of

the Government. to assist provinces and money, out of the $20,000,000 voted by Parliamunicipalities in their endeavours to give ment, should be equitably distributed, as far

SENATE
as possible. It was deemed important to
make provision so that where work was not
available people should be fed and kept
warm. Therefore $4,000,000 of the $20,000,000 was set aside for that specific purpose,
on the understanding that the provinces and
municipalities concerned would do their bit
on an equal basis. So it was provided in every
provincial agreement, as well as in the Federal
Government's regulations, that wherever people
were found to be in need of -municipal
assistance in order to secure food and to
keep warm, the municipality should have
full jurisdiction to render aid, and that upon
the presentation to the Provincial Government of proof of the expenditure made, that
Government and the Federal Government
should each bear one-third of the cost.
The remainder of the $20,000,000 was
allocated for the purpose of creating employment opportunities. It is not my intention
to-day to go into the details of all that was
done, because another time, 'perhaps, will
be more opportune for the discussion of such
details. In order that honourable members
may have an idea of the intent and the
motives behind the plans laid down, however,
I shall deal with them briefly. An agreement
was reached with the provincial governments
as to the amount of money to be applied to
each province. We quickly found that while
many municipalities were very eager to carry
on public works to relieve their unemployed,
they were not so ready to pay any large proportion of the cost. So it became necessary
to lay down some basic principle which should
govern. I remember that the Premier of the
first province to come in under the plan said
that there were municipalities in his province
that could net pay a cent for such purposes. I
said to him: "I am sorry, Mr. Premier, but
the Federal Government cannot agree to relieve any municipality entirely of its constitutional obligations; therefore some portion of the cost of carrying on works to relieve unemployment must be borne by the
municipality in-every instance, and the principle of the responsibility of the municipalities towards their own citizens must be recognized and maintained." Se, generally speaking, all the provinces signed agreements to
that effect, and the municipalities were required to pay one-half of the cost of important municipal works within their own boundaries, such as sewers, sidewalks, or water
supply, and to carry on such work this winter
to give employment to those who otherwise
would have to be helped directly, work being universally recognized as preferable to
direct relief. We said: "You pay half the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

cost, and the Province and the Dominion
pledge themselves each to pay twenty-five
per cent."
More than 1,600 tripartite agreements between municipalities and provincial governments and the Federal Government have
been entered into since October last, and in
consequence about $69,000,000 worth of employment opportunities have been placed
within the reach of the people of Canada
who were out of work and in need.
In addition, the two great railway companies were approached and consulted as to
whether or not they could assist in creating
employment opportunities that would be
helpful at this time. After a few days' discussion, first with the Minister of Railways,
and then with myself, the railway companies
into
consideration.
took the suggestions
Shortly afterwards they came back and said:
"Here is a programme of work which it was
intended to commence within the next one,
two or three years, but we are prepared to
proceed now if the Federal Government will
compensate us to the extent of paying the
interest cost on the capital investment necessary. Proposals were carefully discussed and
considered, and it was found that much work
could be done. It did not seem feasible
to attempt to build too much new line.
Although hundreds of miles of lines had
been authorized, it seemed advisable rather to
distribute the work as widely as possible,
among as many industries as possible. It
was found that the purchase of a couple of
hundred miles of new heavy steel rails would
furnish work for the coal miners and for the
men in the steel mills, and would extend
employment opportunities to a considerable
number of men who otherwise might not
have been reached. So in the aggregate a
very substantial quantity of work was outlined and is now under way.
Another useful work that was considered
in order to provide employment was the
elimination of grade crossings, which comes
under the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners.
It was thought that
that work might be undertaken, with good
results, for two purposes-to reduce the
hazards of the travelling public, and to provide employment; and the substantial sum
of $500,000 was transferred to the Board of
Railway Commissioners, through whose instrumentality the work was to be carried on.
This is a brief outline of the plan that has
been pursued in co-operation with the provincial and municipal authorities throughout Canada since October last. Early next
week there will be laid upon the tables of
both Houses a report giving by provinces a

MARCH 18, 1931
rather concise account of the matters that
I have outlined, and a great deal of detailed
information with which I will not now take
up the time of the House. When honourable
members reccive tbat information they will
be in possession of all the details of the
plan and will see how it bas worked out.
I want to say in passing that, as the Minister in charge of the administration of the
Unemploymcnt Relief Act, 1 arn trying to
work it out on a basis that will be absolutely
equitable to all the people in alI parts of
Canada. and 1 am gratified at the very hearty
and fricndly co-operation that lias been shown
by the provincial and municipal authorities
in this matter. Every government,' municipal, provincial and federal, regardless of its
political complexion, lias manfully endeavoured to do the job, and, regardless of
whether it met with the approval of everybody or not, lias tried its best to relieve
distress through the medium of co-operation.
Another condition that existcd shortly after
the new Government took office, and that 1
týhink might properly be referrcd to at this
time, was this. It was obvious that there wcrc
far more people in Canada than could be
usefully and gainfully employed, and that the
numbers of unemployed were rapidly increasing; therefore, if a cure for unemployment was to be found, it was necessary tliat
the cause of it, or one of the causes, should
be adjusted. It is patent now to everybody
who reads, that during the eigliteen months
prior to the last general election, approxipeople came to Canada'.

shores from other lands. At tlie same time,
the exodus of our own people, whicli had been
going on for a number of ycars-and to that
1 am taking no exception, because it is a
man's inalienable riglit to go to the place
where cmployment opportunities and prosperity seem greatest-that outflow of population, principally to the republie to the south
of us, slowed up and finally ceased because
of the growth of unemployrncnt in that
country. For many months aftcr most of
the emigration from. Canada liad ceased,' the
tide of immigration continued, and even
grew; consequently Canada f ound herself
in the position of liaving to curtail the
inflow of new population until sucli time as
our own native sons and the people who liad
Come liere in good faitli from other lands to
establisgh tliemselves in this new country
should become self-supporting. So, on tlie
12tli of August, as I recaîl it, within about a
week of the time when the Govemnment took
office, steps were taken, of whicli somne people
did not approve-specially those who wanted
22112-2

to get into Canada-to curtail immigration
into this country, and the figures now show
the resuits. That curtailment did much to
retard the growth of unemployment.
Other leatures also enter into the picture,
one of themn being the fact that about one
million Canadians who had gone to the United
States during the previous decade, finding
themselves out of employment because of the
natural desire of the American employer to
give the preference to American nationals,
began drifti-ng home.. Wh-en Parliament last
Septemnber vote-d 320,000,00 to create cmployment opportunities in Canada, many
Canadians outside the boundaries of this
country feit that their opportunities of getting something to do, in order to provide for
their depen-dents, were better in Canada than
elsewhere; consequently a substantial number retuTne~d. This aggravated the Government's difficulty in coping with the unem-.
ployment situation.
Conditions have gradually improved. The
improvement, it is truc, lias been slow; but,
notwithstanding statements that have heen
ma-de on political platforms, and elscwhere,
I do flot think it was to be expected that unemployment would be abolished within a certain number of days or we.eks. The substantial improvement in the situation is due not
only to the opportunities created by the cooperative action of governments, federal, provincial and municipal, but also to the tariff
adjustments made duTing the special session
last fall, whiçh will be iully discussed during
the present session and. need not be dilated
upon now.
There is in times of business depression, or
business stagnation, a tendency for the pub lie
mind to become uneasy, then distressed, and
perhaps even openly rebellious. That lias
occurred before. I am thoroughly convinced
that had Parliament not met last September
and taken the steps it did to enable the Government to aid the provinces and municipalities in relieving distress, there would have
arisen in Canada ere this a situation that
would have been very difficuit to control. Unemployment is probably the darkest shadow
that hangs over the head of the wage camner
in any country, and the fear of unemployment is probably the greatest cause of gray
hair, in the heads of women particularly. So
it would appear to me highly desirable that
alI govemnments should give more attention
to trying te find a permanent solution of the
problem than bas been given to it by govemnmcnts in years gone by.
Many economists, many great teachers and
preachers, mýany labour leaders are in these

and the Government already has done a
little, it hopes, to help in reaching a solution
of the difficulties in the days that lie ahead.
It is not easy to devise a policy for the relief
of unemployment, or to create an unemployment insurance scheme or anything of that
sort as a panacea or cure, because Parliament,
or the Government, like the physician, must
ascertain the primary causes before it can
intelligently apply a remedy.
The Government has acted upon the suggestion made
last summer, that, inasmuch as 1931 is the
decennial census year, provision ought to be
made for taking a census of all the unempleyed in Canada and ascertaining their
former employment, their sex, their age, the
length of time they have been out of work,
and a number of other relevant facts, so that
when the census is completed there will be
concrete and reliable information to assist the
Government authorities, and the economists
who are doing research work, to form accurate
conclusions as to what can be done towards
discovering something to effect a permanent
cure.
Within the borders of our own country, as
well as in many other countries, I presume,
there are many citizens who feel that the
passing of a Bill will entirely remedy a grievance. In many countries that sort of experiment bas been proved by experience to be
a serious hindrance rather than a help to
national welfare. One need only instance the
unemployment insurance legislation passed in
the Motherland. I was one of those who were
greatly pleased with' that scheme, as I believed it would operate successfully. For a
time it undoubtedly was a splendid. thing,
out as the years went on and unemployment
increased the plan was found to be entirely
inadequate; and, as all honourable members
know, the resulting burden upon the British
Government and people bas become a matter
of grave national concern.
I think Canada
should endeavour to profit by the experimonts of other countries, and thereby avoid
schemes that experience bas shown to be
inadvisable.
The Right Honourable the Prime Minister
has announced the Government's intention to
put through a technical education Bill along
the lines of the legislation that was abandoned
in 1929. I was pleased, and indeed a little
surprised, to find that in 1927 the Government of every province in Canada went on
record-as is disclosed in the files of the
Department of Labour-urging the continuance
of that legislation. The present Administration are satisfied that the results achieved
in the ten years that the Act was in force
justify the passage of another such measure
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

for the promotion of technical education and
vocational training for the rising generation
throughout this Dominion.
The old age pension legislation is a more
difficult matter. The Prime Minister bas indicated the intention to deal with it, but no
decision bas yet been made as to how far
the measure will be carried this session. The
question of jurisdiction between the provinces
and the Dominion will have to be carefully
considered before final action is taken.
The Speech from the Throne dealt with
other matters, which I shall not attempt to
discuss in detail at this time. Extended
reference has been made te them in another
place, and I commend to every honourable
member of this Chamber a careful perusal
of the statements made by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister yesterday. Dealing
with criticisms of some of bis actions and
utterances at the Inperial Conference, he
declared that these were exactly in keeping
with the principles laid down, in discussions
with the British Covernment, by one of
Canada's great statesmen of former days, the
Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
I submit, honourable senators, that my
honourable friend the leader on the other side
of this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) in bis
speech last night said very little that domands
a reply. He condemned only the Government's
tariff policy, which he considered to be an
erroneous one. He quite frankly and properly
expressed bis views on that subject, but I do
net intend te enter into a tariff debate at
this time. I should like to congratulate my
-honourable friend upon the manner in which
he addressed the House. I consider the theme
of bis speech was a model of the way in which
subjects shoulld be dealt with by honourable
inembers of this Chamber at all times, inasmuch as the underlying motive was the welfare
of Canada rather than political considerations.
In passing, may I remark that although I
do net profoss to be a patriarch in this Chamber, I have had the pleasure of sitting bore for
some years, and I believe that some honourable members of the House have had such a
wide experience in and are so well informed
about public affairs and business and professional matters, that if they would take a more
active part in our discussions the Senate would
become evon more useful than it now is.
There are numerous questions of public interest to which some honourable members,
from whom we hoar all too infrequently, might
address themselves either in the House or in
comniittecs, and I am sure that if they did so
good results would be felt throughout the
Dominion. Nothing is farther from my mind
than the criticism of any honourable member,

Sorne Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I desire ta, compliment the honaurable senator from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) upon bis interesting
address. But if he is surprîsed at criticismns
of the Government for their failure ta carry
out certain promises made during the electian
campaign, may I remind hirn that many
peaple did not know that some of the promnises
were not ta be taken seriou-sly. 0f course,
sorne of us who had knowledge of tbe true
state of affairs realized that a nusnber of the
pledges were impossible of fulfilment, and
consequently we are not now as disappointed
a-, we otherwise might have been.
Since we have been going tbrough this
econamic deprecgion, the opinion bas often
been expressed that a period of prasperity
always has been. and a>lways wil be followed
by ane of depression. So-called experts have
undertaken ta tell us why we cannet always
be prosperous. It has been contended by some
that the gold standard is wrong and bas had
mucb ta do with the bringing about of present
conditions; an the other hand, we are told
that aur problems are largely psychalogical,
and if we practised more Couéismn we should
soon convince ourselves that everything was
ail right. I shal onake no attempt to analyse
tbe cause -of depressions, but I want ta express
disagreement with tbe theory tbat prosperity
must inevitably be followed, sooner or later,
by depression.
Ana tber school of tbought holds that the
present state of affairs, eiconornical and other,
is as perfect as it mcn ha; that this is the best
of ail possible worlds. I do not think that

and in that respect I think that ail honourable

manently done away with. I am sure that
there vill come a time when no longer millions
of men who are anxious to obtain work will
be unable to find it; and this is an end towards which, I submit, the Government not
only of Canada but of every civilized country
should strive.
With the permission of the House I should
like to read a short extract from a speech
made by Governor La Follette, of Wisconsin.
In his inaugural address he said:
As a state and nation we have astonished
the world-how te produce the necessities and
luxuries of life in sufficient quantities to supply
the needs of all our people-but in the midst
of abundance we have want and suffering.
Unless we can solve this problem of the distribution of abundance, unless we can stop
linger and hardship in all of this plenty, we
shall be actors in the gre.atest tragedy of
history.
I should like to read also a statement that
was made by the Right Hon. Arthur Meighen
in the course of an address at Washington:
The world is not well organized for the purpose of distributing amongst the population the
fruits of their toil by brain and hand, in
accordance with the contribution of each.
I think the Right Hon. Arthur Meighen struck
the nail squarely on the head when he said
that the present economic systen falls short
in distributing the world's wealth to those
who earn it. I have great admiration for
Mr. Meighen's ability and I wish that it could
be put at the service of the country just now.
Mr. Henry Wise Wood, of Alberta. in a speech
at the convention of the United Farmers of
Alberta, at Calgary, made a statement similar
to that of Mr. Meighen. There is a great
difference betwer.n Washington and Calgary
and betwcen Hon. Mr. Meighen and Mr.
Wood; but they are both men of great ability,
and because of the thought that they have
given to public affairs their opinions carry
weight all over this country.
We often hear it said that all the people of
the world are neighbours, and that the means
ef communication have been improved to
such an extent that distance bas almost been
eliminated; that we in Canada to-day are as
close to Great Britain as the people of one
village in Eneland were to those of another
perhaps one hundred years ago. But do
people really believe that? Do the actions of
governments indicate a belief in that? On the
contrary, is not every nation striving to erect
higher tariff barriers all the time and to make
more difficult the means of communication
with other nations?

know that this is not practical polities at
present, but in the meantime we must realize
that we cannot achieve truc prosperity by
building trade- barriers higher and higher.
However, I rose to speak not so much
along these lines as in regard to Western conditions, about which I am perhaps as wel
informed as any other honourable member in
this House. I happened to meet a gentleman who is prominently known in Canada,
but is not a member of Parliament, and he
asked me: "Who is right, the farmer, or Mr.
Beatty, or Mr. Black of the milling interests,
as to conditions in the West?" Who is right?
Well, if you ask the fa.rmers they tell you
one story, and if you ask Mr. Beatty you get
another. I have a great admiration for Mr.
Beatty, both as a private gentleman and as
president of a great railway, and I have no
doubt that ho believes in the psychological
effect of telling the people that they are not
so badly off as they think they are. However, that is not a great deal of encouragement to the person who is struggling under
difficult conditions. I want to state in plain
English that the farmers in Western Canada
to-day are in financial difficulties, and I do
not see why the fact should be disputed, or
why it should not be brought out. The conditions existing in the West are the worst
that I have scen in mey forty-nine years of
expeirience in that country. We have had
difficult times; we have had crop failures;
personally I have had disappointments of all
sorts that come to people engaged in agriculture; but there is something in the present
condition that has never existed before, and
that is a want of confidence in the future.
The average price of wheat in 1930 was 92
cents per bushel. What will the average price
be for 1931? Is anyone bold enough to say
that it will be over 60 cents a bushel? In
just what respect is the situation of the farmer
going to improve within the next twelve
months? I do not believe that any improvement in agricultural conditions in Western
Canada is possible in less than one or two
years, or perhaps a longer period.
Just to make this point clear, I might mention a few figures. In 1927-28 1,000 bushels
of wheat would liquidate a farmer's liability
to the extent of $1,200; to-day it takes 3,000
bushels of wheat to do exactly the same
thing. The prices of farm products have

MARCH 18, 1931
dropped out of ail relation to the prices of
the commodities which the farmner requires
ta carry on business. Eighteen months ago
wheat was worth $1.40 at Fort William; today it is worth 60 cents. Bariey was worth
about 50 cents eighteen months ago; to-day
it is worth scarcely aijything. It may flot be
out of place to mention my own experience.
Last year I had a splendid crop of barley,
grading 3 C.W., which is about the best that
we grow in Western Canada. I shipped 2,000
bushels of that bariey.and received 14 cents
a bushel for it. That was supposed ta, ba the
top price paid for barley in Western Canada
last fait. I am happy to say that I have
stili over 2,000 bushels in the granaries--and
it wiii nat be sold for 14 cents, for I will feed
it ta stock, if possible.
Nobody told the farmers in 1927-28 what
was going ta happen. Who couid bave foretold two years ago that wheat would drap
from $1.40 ta 60 cents a bushel? I do nat
think that anything that has occurred in any
other business in the Dominion of Canada
wiii compare with the siump in wheat. We
know that in depressions agriculture receives
the first shock. But this is more than a
shock-it is a catastrophe, and the facts must
be stated. There wili be casualties in Western Canada. I do not see how they can be
avoided.
I bave not lost faith in the West, for 1
know too much about. its capabilities. and
wbat it bas done in the past, and will do 'in
the future; but the people ought ta, be told
and ougbt ta understand the situation that
faces us. Banks, mortgage companies, and
other creditors of the farmers can do much
ta heip the situation at the present timýe. I
am not one of those who take a particular
pleasure in dweIling upon the iniquities of the
banks and mortgage companies. I am not one
of those who have compia.ined that the banks
were too slow in lending money ta the farmers.
My experience is that t-hey were too qui.ck;
I think tbey have lent money too freeiy, but
charged too high a rate of interest. If they
had acted a little more slowly, probably they
could have condu*cted their business mare
safely and at a profit. Mortgage companies
have advanced too much money, and have not
a sufficient equity in the land to protect their
mortgages; so they, as weii as the farmner himself, are in a difficult position. But what I
want ta -point out is that they can help at
the present time. If there is any attempt
made by oreditors ta secure their pound of
flesh at the present time there is going ta be
-a catastrophe; a great many farmers wili fail,
and go out of business altogether; and what
will happen then I do not know.

Some system of amortization of debts migbt
help. We have a Dcbt Adjustment Bureau
in Manitoba, but I hiave not he-ard that it
is doing anytbing at the present time. If
something could be donc ta amartize tbe dehts
-of the farmers, spreading them over a period
of ten years ýat a iow rate of intcrest, I think
many farmers wouid be set on their feet and
starteil off in business again with new courage.
Perbaps that plan is not practicable, but it
does seem ta me tbat it would do something
ta help in the present situation.
The fariner as a rule gets a great deal of
advice, and in these days of distress ha is
getting more tbao usuial. I think mast of
that advicc is wcll meant. Most of the people
who want ta tait the fariner bow ta run his
business mean well. and think they are belpimg in giving bim the advice. A great deal
of criticism bs been ipvelled at the farmers
of tbe West for growing wheat. "Wheat
miners" tbey have been called in -another
place. Most of the farmers who went into
Western Canada bad not much capital, and
as whcat was a one-year crop, which yielded
quieker and casier returns than any other
farm product, naturally they went into whcat
growing almost exciusively. The growing of
wheat is wbat has built up the West ta a
very .great extent and has made possible the
physicai development of that great inland
continent of the three Prairie Provinces. The
growing of wheat hasl produced a golden
stream that has flowed into the tre-asury of
the Dominion of Canada and helped ta stimulate business of ahl kinds. A great deal that
has been done during the past three years
would have been impossible hail it flot been
for this tremendous quantity of wheat maving from Western Canûda ta, the continent of
Europe, and yielding enarmaus returns for use
in the develapment cf the Dominion.
I tcf t Brandon in the month oif August tiwo
years ago and traveiled west right through
ta the Peace River district. Honourable members of the Senate, I shall neyer farget the
sensations I experienced on that journey.
Aifter travelling past mil-lions of acres oi
waving grain, and seeing the countless homnesteads, and passing through the great cities
of Regina, Saskatoon and Edmonton, I could
not but realize how much hafi been made passible just because Western Canada had been
a favourable place ta grow wheat. So I think
we should be careful when we criticize the
growing of wheat in that counstry. Wheat has
played a great part in the building up of the
West, and bias been of great benefit ta the
great centres of population not onl' in the
West but also in the Est. Perhaps new
conditions have arisen-and new conditions

require changed methods of procedure; nevertheless, wheat growing will continue for many
years to come, and wheat will be one of the
major crops in Western Canada; and it would
be a tragedy should anything happen to prevent people from growing wheat in that
country.
The men and women of Western Canada
to-day are anxiously asking: "What of the
future?" We hear a great deal about diversified farming. Last session I expressed my
views with regard to the future of Western
Canada and the systen of farming that would
be found most profitable and most enduring.
I have not changed my ideas since then. I
still believe in the smaller unit; I still believe
in mixed farming where it is possible. I would
point out, however, that large sections of
Western Canada are not at all suitable for
mixed farming. There are large districts in
Manitoba and in the Province of Saskatchewan--I am not so well acquainted with AIberta-where it is impossible to find a water
supply, without which it would not be profitable to attempt to keep stock. I believe that
in the well watered sections mixed farming
will solve our problems; but unfortunately
such a solution cannot become effective before
a few years, because one cannot get into the
business of raising live stock all at once.
A scheme to help the farmers of the West
has been iniaugurated, and the credit for
bringing it to the attention of the public may
be given, perhaps, to Mr. Beatty, of the
Canadian Pacific Railway. No doubt most
of you have heard something about that
scheme. A corporation is to be formed with
a capital of $5,000,000. This money is to be
lent to the farmers for the purpose of enabling
therm to go into live stock raising as a basis
for their mixed farming. I am not very sure
just how much is to be advanced to each
farmer, but I think that probably the average
will be about $200. This scheme is based on
what is known as the Minnesota plan. I
have the plan here. Some of you may have
received this pamphlet. A scheme of the
same kind has been in effect in Minnesota,
Montana, and the two Dakotas, and has
worked a revolution in those states. Where
previously there was scarcity or want of
prosperity, the farmers have entirely changed
their condition and are now doing well under
a system of mixed farming.
I have noted carefully, in reading this
pamphlet, that in the loaning of money great
precautions are taken to see that it is.properly spent, and that stock will be given only to
people who are in a position to care for it
and who understand something about it. I
Hon. Mr. FORKE.

have no hesitation in saying that unless the
whole scheme is carried through as a business
institution and in accordance with business
principles, it will surely fail. In Manitoba we
have had some experience in lending money
to farmers to purchase stock and implements,
improve their farms, and so on. The Manitoba senators who are present will know what
I am speaking about. We had what was
known as the Cow Scheme, whereby the
Provincial Government lent money to the
farmers to enable them to purchase cows,
and to assist them to go into mixed farming,
if you please. That scheme was tried. I do
not know whether the farmers benefited much
by the cows or not, but I do know that the
Government lost nearly all the money loaned
to buy the cows. We have had also a system
of rural credits which, on the face of it,
seemed to be a good scheme and one that
ought to work well. The Provincial Government furnished money, to be loaned by a
local board on which the Government had a
representative. No amount of money was to
be loaned uniess the assets of the farmer in
excess of his liabilities were sufficient to cover
the amount of the loan. Apparently the matter was gone into very carefully, and the
Provincial Government furnished a very large
sun of money; but, honourable members, in
that also they lost a very large amount that
they will never regain. Then we had the
Farmi Loan Association, whereby the local
S'overnment was lending money to farmers
>n mortgages on their farms. I cannot tell
iou what acreage the Provincial Government
>f Manitoba bas to-day-I know that it is
.ery large-that came into their possession
moder foreclosed mortgages.
That is the history of three schemes to
improve conditions. I do not think the
failure was due so much to the schemes as to
the fact that proper care was not taken to
see that the money was loaned to the right
kind of people. I think it is perfectly obvious
to those who are acquainted with publie affairs
that when a government lends money it is
more difficult for it to get it back than it
would be for anybody else to do so. The
hope of this scheme, and its success, are
dependent on whether business principles are
observed, and upon seeing to it, before the
money is loaned, that the stock and the men
are of the right kind to make a success of
mixed farming. People who advocate mixed
farming, more especially city people-and I
say this in all kindness-do not understand,
perhaps, that it is much casier to grow wheat
than it is to raise stock. I know that the
immigration pamphlets that I used to send
out when I was Minister of Immigration told

MARGH 18, 1931
how some man eorning fromn Engiand, with
no experieuce at ail, raised a splendid crop of
wheat. That is quite possible; but it is more
difficuit to be a successful breeder of live
stock. If you have the soul and the clirnate,
and good seed properiy sown, you can leave
the crop to, the rain and the Sun and the
gentie breezes of summer, and it will corne to
fruition without any care on your part; but
live stock needs continuai attention from the
day of its birth until 'it is sold for a profit.
Consequentiy you have ta be more careful iu
rnixed farming than in the raising of grain.
Hou. Mr. DANDURAND:
And you have
ta do more work.
Hon. Mr. FXiRKE: More work. Why do
farmers nlot like dairyiug? I do not know
anyone who is in the business because hie
likes it. A dairy farmer has ta attend ta
his cows fourteen times a weýek, reguiarly;
there is a tremeudous amount of work invoived in seeing that the cattle are properiy
fed and cared for, and in the general running
of the industry. But, 1 arn glad ta say, you
wiil flnd milk cans at the railway stations all
over Manitoba to-day. In other parts of the
country mauy people do not seern ta be aware
of the great amount of mixed farming that
is beiug carrîed on in that province, and of
the revenue derived there frorn other farmi
products, which is equai to that frorn grain.
In this respect Manitoba is in a better position
than the other two prairie provinces. But
the great problern at thé present tirne is
where ta flnd markets. It rnay be possible
ta raise better live stock, but what can be
doue with it?
The present Government came into power
after promising ta provide markets for farmers
in the West. I kuo-w that that promise was
mnade in the course of speeches in Western
Canada, but the Hon. the Miniister of Labour
<Hon. Mr. Robertson) lias toid us that the
Governrnent have not had tirne ta do ail they
'49aid they wouid. I ar n ft speaking in any
spirit of bitteruess, but I want ta say firmiy
that the Government have not doue any
single thing that wiii in any way heip, the
farmers of the West. On the contrary, I eau
assure honourable senators that a great many
farmers look upon sorne of the things that
have been doue as nothing more nor iess than
n siap in the face. In making such a statement I arn not trying ta play poiitics, but
I arn thinking soleiy of the weifare of the
Western farmers.
Hon. Mr. LIRD: Did the Government
'nat denouince the Australian and New Zeaiand
treaties and try ta ourtail the importation of
butter ?

23

Hon. Mr. FORKE - Butter is sellng at 19
cents a pound in Wiunipeg.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD. The honourabie gentleman says hie does not know of a single thiug
that the ýGovernment have done that has
helped the farmers of the West. I arn remindiug him of what was doue about Australian
and New Zeaiand butter.
Hou. Mr. FOBKE: But butter is selliug at
19 cents a pound in Winnipeg now.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: .And the honourabie
gentleman knows that there are millions of
pounds of Australian and New Zeaiand
butter in storage in Canada to-day.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not think there
are.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The figures show that
there are about 30 million pounds of
Aus1iralian and New Zealand butter in
Canada to-day.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do flot think the
farmers are worrying mucli about the coinpetition of Australian butter at the present
time.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Certainiy.
Hou. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Is the honourable gentleman aware that since this Government put a duty of 8 cents a pouud on
New Zeaiand butter, the dairy industry in
Alberta lias .incremsed 60 per cent?
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
He neyer heard
about that.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: No, lie neyer
heard about that, but lt is a fact. Were the
Government not doing somethiug for Western
Canada wheu they helped ta increase the
dairy products of Alberta by 60 per cent?
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But the price
has not increased, and it is the price that
cou uts.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: When wheat is seiiing
at 60 cents a bushei sud it is impossible ta
get auything at aIl for barley, any farmer
who lias a few oows will try ta produce butter
if lie cau. Every time that the price for
wheat lias dropped ta any great extent there
lias been a marked increase in dairy products, and it will always be so. But I can
assure the honourable senator fromn Baissevain (Hou. Mr. Schaffuer) that farmers are
going into dairying because it is the only
thing that will produce them aýny cash just
now. If it is permissible to refer ta a conversa&tion with a relative, I rnay say that a

SENATE

in the world we could have donc if we had
not been milking cows."

The

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: "Nono are so blind as
those who will not see."
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I think I know as much
about farming conditions in the West as any
other honourable member.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: But no more.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: No more, but no less.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: 1\Iay I ask the honourable gentleman
a question? He stated a
moment or so ago that some of the things the
Government have done are looked upon by
the farmers as a slap in the face. Will he
kindly tell us what particular actions he considers to have been a slap in the face?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: That is my opinion.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: That is a statement.
Surely the honourable gentleman will back
up his statement.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: If the farmers of Western Canada think that the Government have
helped them, then it will be al right for the
Government; if they think otherwise, then it
will not be all right. But one would find it
dificult to convince a farmer in the West
that his market for wheat had been improved
by any action that was taken at the recent
economie conference in Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Certainly.
would suggest such a thing.

No

Hon. Mr. FORKE: The Government came
into power on the promise that they would
improve conditions.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: They have donc that,
as far as possible.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: But there were definite
promises that these conditions were going to
be immediately remedied.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: No.
Was the honourable
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
gentleman present when the Winnipeg speech
was delivered? I checked that speech word
for word from a typed document, and I can
prove that the statement was made.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: What is the difference
between a few days and a short time?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I repeat that there has
been no help to date.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Well, it is coming.
I am sincere in my
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
statements. I am anxious that the people in
Western Canada shall prosper.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Not any more anxious
than others are.
lion. Mr. FORKE: I do not say I am more
anxious, but I think honourable members will
credit me with sincerity of purpose. I know
families who have been in the West thirty
years and who to-day are in dire distress. Does
that strike a sympathetic chord in the breasts
of any honourable members? I know people
who cannot pay their taxes this year, and who
never before were in such a condition since
they have been living in Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Similar conditions have
been going off and on for forty years.
I went there when
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
there was nothing but the bare prairies.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I was there before my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Maybe that is so, but
I think the honourable gentleman has forgotten something.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:

No.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: Eggs are selling at 15
cents, in the little town where I live. The
merchant there says they are worth only 13
cents, but in trade he allows 15 cents for
them. I wonder if that will signify anything
to some honourable gentlemen opposite.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not see why there
should be so much heated criticism of my
remarks. The only reason I can see for it
is that I said the Government had not done
anything to help the Western farmers.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Are the Government
responsible for the prices of grain and eggs,
or anything else?

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The honourable gentleman went further than that. He said that
some of the actions of the Government were

Mr. FORKE.

MARCH 18, 1931
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: But the honourable
gentleman cannot claim refuge under that
statement.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: No, I do not. But I
certainly say that men who are experienced
in affairs of government should not stand on
a public platform and make promises that
they know cannot be carried out. Some
people who did not know any better thought
that a change of government would bring
about a general change for the better. I do
not want to discuss politics, for I am concerned only about conditions in the West.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: But the honourable
gentleman stepped right out.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: The honourable gentleman must admit that the Bennett Government
have tried to do something for the West,
whereas the former Government made no
such attempt.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not want to discues
politics, but I can tell the honourable gentleman that during the last election campaign I
did not hear anything said against the King
Government.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: It was not necessary
to say anything. People knew ail about it.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The fact is that there
were hard times, and people in the West got
the idea that a change of government would
result in a change in economic conditions.
I should like to say a few words about
the mutterings that have corne out of the
West in regard to secession. Some people
seema to think that Western farmers are a
difficult lot, but it seems to me that the truth
is simply that they are always alive and on
the job, and the rest of the country will hear
from them if they are not satisfied. I do nôt
pay any serious attention to talk about
secession. It is a sympton of discontent and
hard times, a sign that everything is not wel'l,
and I do not think the Government and the
people would be justified in ignoring that
kind of symptom. But I aan as sure as I am
that I am standing here that there will never
be secession on the part of the West; and we
shall hear no more talk about it when conditions have improved.
The farmers in this country and all over
the world are going to have a hard time for

a slap in the face to the farmers, and he has
not explained what he meant.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I say that the Government have not helped the farmers in Western
Canada to date; and that statement stands.
The people cannot -be deluded very long by
promises that it is impossible to fulfil, because there must corne a day of reckoning.
There is an emergent situation in Western
Canada, but after the Prime Minister had
gone through that part of the country he
stated at Regina that everything was all right
in the West; that there was no hardship.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: He did not say that.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Well, he did not find
any cause for alarm.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I should like the
honourable gentleman to produce the remarks that he alleges were made by the
Prime Minister at Regina, to the effect that
there was no hardship in the West. That is
a statement that is unlikely, on the face of it.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Well, there does not
seen to be any use in continuing any further
in this way. I am surprised at the attitude
of honourable members from the West.
The honourable
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
gentleman should say "some of the honourable members from the West." He should
not include us all. I have not said anything.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I have no fear for the
future of Western Canada, but I am alarmed
over the future of some of the individuals
who are living there at the present time.
There is no doubt that prosperity will again
smile over Canada and the Empire. Nothing
can permanently retard the progress of the
West, but the people are suffering there right
now, and they will continue to suffer unless
economie conditions can be improved. I
recognize the difficulties that confront the
Government, but if candidates for office were
a little more modest in their promises -during the election campaign there would not
be the saine resentment when promises are
not fulfilled. Of course, as I have already
said, those who knew the true circumstances
were aware that it was absolutely impossible
to bring about any great improvement in
conditions in Western Canada in one year or

SENATE

I hope there will never be any division
betrween the East and the West, for I agree
with the honourable senator from Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner) that each part of
the country needs the other. Up to the time
that I came to Parliament, ten years ago, I
had spent thirty years in the West, and my
mind was filled principally with Western
ideas. But no one can remain for long a
maember of Parliament without having his
:houghts and sympathies broadened, and one
soon finds that it is necessary ta give and
take. In each successive Parliament Western
miembers learn that they cannot expeot to
have everything their own way, and that the
East, as well as the West, has its spec.ial
problems.
I heartily desire that Canada shall always
remain one big united Dominion. I believe
that there is a great future for this country
among the nations of the earth, not only in
a material sense, but because of the influence
that we as a people may exert towards the
hetterment of the lot of humanity as a whole.
It is my hope and prayer that nothing may
interfere with the union of this great country,
from East to West, for all time.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Administrator's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Schaffner for an
Address in reply thereto.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable members of the Senate, I wouid
not if I could, and I could not if I would,
violate
or evade
the
long established
traditional practice, never honoured in the
breach, but always in -the observance, of
extending felicitations ta the mover and the
seconder of the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne.
My mind goes back in somewhat reminiscent mood in the present instance, and I
almost arrogate to myself the position of a
well experienced judge as to the quality and
force of these addresses. On my entry into
Parliament, in 1883, I heard for the first time
the proposal and the seconding of the Address
in reply ta the Speech from the Throne. I
was a new member then, full of ideals-and
imaybe full of illusions-and I remeimber quite
wcll the interest with which the speeches at
tha.t time were heard. Young Tupper, as he
was called-afterwards Sir Charles Hibbert
Tuipper-and Josiah Wood, of New Brunswick, were respectively the proposer and the
seconder of that Address, and both of those
gentlemen lived ta bear out in their subsequent distinguished careers the promise that
was shown at that time.
Since then I have attended forty-six openings of Parliament, and have listened, cansequently, to twice thaît number of speeches
dalivered by respective movers and seconders,
and I can confidently say that my two
colleagues stand excellently well in the long
historie procession. I have, moreover, been
struck with one peculiarity.
In the first
addresses ta which I listened, as in the latest
which I have heard in this House, I have
never heard an expression of criticism of either
the personnel or the policy of the party in
power.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is a well established custom, the very
letter as well as the spirit of which has been
faithfully adhered ta. Sometimes I wonder
what would happen if, in the jerky move-

MARCH 19, 1931
ments; of the present age, the mover or the
seconder, or both of tbem, were to take« it
into their heads to express wbat sometimes, I
fear, is in their bearts--tbeir own honest
opinion of the policy andi the personnel. I
shahl not -live to see that startlîng innovation,
nor is it likely that any of us at present in
this bouse will.
In undertaking to make a few observations
about the speech in hand, I amn not going to
enter into details. My remarks will be general and discursive, and whether or not they
will bang upon any consistent tbread throughout, I cannot at the present time mnake a
promise.
There is an atmosphere whicb surrounds the
action of a parliamentary body at any critical
stage of its history, and that, atmospbere is
especially pronounoed as surrounding ite
deliberations under the conditions as they
now present themselves to us. We live in a
changed and changing world. If a well
equipped and intelligent citizen of the world
had dropped to sleep about fifty years ago,
like another Rip van Winkle, and had
awakened, say, yesterday afternoon, what
would have been bis state of mind in comparing the world of hais awaking with the world as
it was when hie went to sleep? Imagine wbat
would be bis astonishment, and how bard it
would be for him to adjust himself to the
cbanged conditions. Througb researcb and
science, invention and mechanization, mass
production and the wonderful speeding up of
methods of communications and transport, the
world witbin baîf the time covered by our
memories bas changed essentially, and this of
necessity calîs for changes in manners and
metbods of conduet; individual, social,
political, and international. So it is that
to-day the f oundations of religious beliefs,
the canons of individual conduct, the conventions wbich society bas establisbed for its
governance are ahi called into question and
subjected to rigorous examination. Different
conditions have demanded new attitudes and
methods of procedure, whicb inevitably and
necessarily tend to fashion the development
of the individual, of so-ciety and of tbe. state.
The saine is true of metbods of production
and distribution and commercial, banking and
financial operations. lu every hine of enterprise and activity conditions bave arisen
which neoessitate different metbods of policy
and action.
I mention Vbis simply to show that metbods
and pohicies well adapted to deal witb conditions long ago existent in matters pohitical,
national and international, caîl for revision
in these later days of entirely different conditions, and tbat there is no unchengoeble

principle to, whiob we must rigidly adhere.
Difference of conditions requires a different
attitude of approach for their solution.
*My next observation, relates to the pressing
gravity of the present situation. I wonder if
ive really are sufficiently impressed with the
particular d-ifficulties that we face at the
present time, and whetber we really do give
ourselves to the task of eonsidering carefully
the situation which bas developed, and our
attitude with reference thereto. 1 do flot need
to make an extended list of ahl that enters
into the situation of to-day. In the falling
off of our transport returns, in our decreasing
revenues and rising expenditures, the burden
of our debts, national and international, in
oui heavy taxation and in the drop in values
of our n-atural produets, the situation which
confronts the Government and Pax'liame.nt is
to-day one of special menace and gravity.
That, I think, we must acknowledge; and I
hold that a very considerable portion of the
responsibility for finding a solution rests upon
both branches of the legisiative body. We are
too apt to throw the entire responsibility upon
the Government. That, however, is neither
fair nor just. In both Huses of Parhiament
we, as legisiators, have our responsibilities. We
are called together to seek a solution of the
serious questions which are to-dýay confronting
the Canadian people. I arn not one who
believes that the whole remedy lies by any
means in legislative enactments. I hold that
now largely, and more and more as the
years go by, we must look elsewbere for
relief. The great questions of production, od
distribution, of economie and commercial
exchange, will be solved lees and less by
legisiative enactmnent and more and more
through the expert co-operation and ageney
of business men and scientific advisers, who in
future will play a more conspicuous part than
thcy do now. But with reference to its own
nation and matters of international concern,
the legisiature bas duties whicb it must be
prepared to carry out.
Let me make brief reference to the spirit in
which we as members of the Senate, and our
confreres in the other bouse, can best aipproach the present problems. I shall exercise
my imagination for a moment or two.
Suppose that we should read in the evening journals that the Prime Ministe-r and
the leaders of the Opposition 'have had a
protracted conference to-day with reference
to banding the existing situation, and that it
is .confldently expected that an important
agreement will be announced later. What
interest that would cause in the two halls
of Our national legisiature! What a buzz
would go througb the clubs and business

28

SENATE

circles in this city, and quickly traverse
the whole countryl
And suppose further
that to-morrow morning it were to be
announced that these leaders Lad come to
a decision to lay aside for the moment ail
their war paint, ail their implements of
party offence and defence, ail their subtle
plans for party scrimmages and campaigns,
and that ail the members of Parliament
would be asked to meet for the next four,
five, six or more weeks in committee of
the whole and devote themselves to an unbiased consideration of concrete proposais
designed to cope with tlie knotty questions
with which we are faced. I imagine that such
an announcement would be greeted throughout the length and breadth of this Dominion
with a loud pæan of praise, an expression of
national satisfaction that the solution of the
present grave and menacing problemes would
no longer be delayed for montlis by parliamentary contests with respect to mere
theories and to the personalities and incidenrs
that are commonly associated with party
politics. That indicates my view of the spirit
vhich should animate Parliament when great
crises arise.
I am proud to sec that optimism pre;-ails
throughout the Dominion. I do not think
that the spirit of Canada lias been broken or
nearly broken by the grave situation which
lias existed for some time and which seens
likely to continue, to a greater or less extent,
for an indefinite period. It is true that there
is some pessimism in some quarters, but I
think I am right in saying that on the whole
a reasoned optimism is decidedly uppermost.
In order to deal effectively with these problems it seems to me that the first thing we
need to do is te try to apprehend the causes
for the present situation. The first duty of a
doctor in attending a patient is to diagnose the
case, and the subsequent sueocess or failure of
the treatment depends greatly upon whether
the diagnosis is accurate or net. And
in our national affairs we need to understand
what has brought about the present condition,
and what is responsible for the prospect of a
continuation of that condition.
If we examine into these causes we find that
paramount amongst them, absolutely basic,
are the effects of the old methods of applying
war to the settlement of international disputes.
That is a fact which ought not to be ignored
in the attempt to arrive at an explanation of
our difficulties. We should impress upon the
present and future generations the necessity
of ever keeping in mind the evil effects that
have flowed from the Great War, and do
our itmost to make sure that the citizens of
Right

Hon.

Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

Canada in the years to come will enroll themselves in the arrny of active opponents to
war and supporters of internatiLnal 'jeace.
At the basis of the smnallest individual burden
as well as of the greatest of world problems
will be found some after effects of the last
great conflict between the nations. Let us,
therefore, enroll as defenders and supporters
of the great organisation which lias brought
about whatever co-operation, goodwill and
international confidence exist at the present
time. Undoubtedly it will be a long time
before the ideal is attained, but step by step,
mcarch by march, year by year, over larger
and larger areas of private sentiment and
conviction, and of public morale and world
faith, there are advancing the forces that will
nake war impossible in the future and will
ultimately establish permanent peace among
the nations.
I am not one of those, nor do I think there
are within the range of my voice any of
those, who feel that Canada is down and
out. There is no reason why we should lose
courage and initiative and hope. We who
take this stand do so because of our faith
in Canada and Canadian people, a faith that
is ba.sed upon a knowledge of what lias
lappe ned in the past, as well as socle understanding of the present and the prospect for
the future. In the solution of our difficulties
there need be no excuse of sectional differences, for in this matter what affects one
part of the country affects us ail. If an
eruption broke out on my arm, would I say:
"Arm, heal thyself. This is something which
does not concern the rest of my body"? No.
Every section of my anatomy would be affected, and would suffer so long as the cure
were postponed. So it is with Canada. If
one section of our country is suffering more
scverely than others from economic ills, we
are not justified in demanding that the rest
should stand aside while the most seriously
afflicted portion is attempting to heal itself.
Canada is an entity, whole and integral. The
East cannot ignore the hurt of the West, and
vice versa. I am heartily in accord with the
sentiment that has been expressed here in the
last day or two, that we stand as a united
country. He would be a daring man who
would preach sectionalism in any part of
Canada to-day. Experience and observation
teach us that as a nation we possess great
resources.
After ail, there is only one of our enterprises that has really been hit ha)rd. Perhaps
depressions will come and go in the future as
in the past, but I think it cannot be denied
that in comparison with other countries the

MARCH 19, 1931
Dominion of Canada is coming through ber
economic crises exceptionally well. Farming
is the one industry which bas borne the main
brunt of the present distress. I listened with
great care to the plain tale of my honourable
friend frorn Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke), and
found no fault with his exposition of the
farmers' point of view. But there are farmers
and farmers in the West; there are farming
scetions and farrning sentions. We must flot
forget that ail Western farmers have not found
it equally difficuit to carry on; some of them
are abundantly able to take care of themselves, and have sufficiant resournes to do an
even if the depression continues.
We are living under a democratic system
of govarnment, a e~stera that I do n'ot think
will ever be superseded in any country.where
it bas been able to obtain a secure footbold,
tbougb it may be vary mucb improved in al
countries. In the course of operations of that
systam the governments are often appealed to
for the financial relief of citizens. Genarally
speaking, a government that makes loans to
the members of the body politic will bave to
pay the lossas that resuit, for thase will not
faiT upon the recipients of the advanees. Tht
will corne about as part of the subtie ad
pervasive influences of the system. ButI
think that some practical method sbould ha
arrived -at wberaby the Dominion could give
ieinbers of
financial assistance to wortby
farming communities wbera the naed is pressing. 0f course, certain conditions would have
to be fulfilled, but those are details capable
of being effectively carried out. That is for
the benefit of 'both East and West, and of
every section of the country, and to that end
not oniy the Governrnent of the country, but
also the corporations of the country, may
weli give their hearty and self-sacrificing support-and I arn quite certain that those great
corporations are keeping that in mmnd. Take
the Canadian Pacifie Railway. Is there any
reason in the' world why that great corporation should not be sympathetically and vitally
interested in sustaining every braneh of industry in the great are-as of country through
wbicb its lines pass? And is it not particularly
conccrned that no farmer wbo is at present
astablished as a presant and prospective
custorner of that road should ba allowed to
go to the wail, *or bis industry to lapse, and
the place be occupies to becorne a vacancy
in the future? For equally good reasons we
have an intelligent and sympathetie interest
on the part of banks, boan companies and other
grec t corporations, -and wbat I have said of
the railways as to interest and co-operation
appiies to thýese. Their interests are pegged
down in this country to a great extent, and

can ba hast subserved by syrnpatbetic aid in
tbis period of difficulty and stress, which
tbraaten to overwbhelrn them. To alI these
sources we may look with hope and confidence
for aid in the solution of tbe cornmon problem. Ail that is needed is intelligent and
efficient organization.
Our resourcas, bappily, bave baen so far
explored tbat we no longer distrust tbem. The
period of prospective wealth in the great resources of the Dorninion-imaginary wealtb. it
rnight bave been called-wbicb gave an much
confidence to the Fatbars of Confadaration
and the early legislators and business men of
this ëountry, bas gone by. Experirnental researcb and actual exarnination and development bave resulted in placing tbe resources of
this country in a position of undoubted
strengtb. Those resources bave not -been
diminished in the least by any wave of depression that bas pagsed over the country.
There tbey are, and there Vbey will reiain,
and from trial and experien-ce of the capacity
of Canadians-intellectual, physical, and busincsslike-we bave gainad faitb in the belief
that in addition to our vast wealtb of resources aiready devaloped there ara even
greater .cpportunitics still in prospect, and the
aspect ofCanada "down and out"' fades frorn
tbe picture and bas no place in fact and very
little in fancy.
It appears clear to me that, in so far as
possible, we ougbt to postpone tba discussion
of theories and get dowýn to an examination
of concrete plans; and tbe sooner that is
done the better it will be for our own reputation and for the gond of the country. The
present situation in Canada, wbicb undeniably
is one of depression, but wbicb is being placed
before the publie in a somewbat exaggerated
way, raquires that a solution be quickly f ound
and applied. Is it wise or proper for members
of eitber House to delay tbe solution of our
problerna by interposing a period of extended
discussion on tbeory, and on varinus extraneous
subi acta, whicb I wiil not detail? Is it flot
advisable, rather, and more effective, to begin
irnmediately an examination of concreta plans
and proposaIs? The theories on wbich we migbt
spend weeks of discussion will nacassarily be
brought forward, to some extent, when we
coma to considar these concrate plans. la it
not, therefore, really tbe duty of the parliamentary bodies of Canada to-day-and I arn
not presurning to lecture or be dogmatie; this
is simply my idaa, of the common-sense
rnatbod-to gat together at once on these
proposais?
The Speech from the Tbrone bas been
criticized in different ways. To my mmnd it
is fairly suggestive. It is full of the promise

of plans and proposais which the Governrnent
is eaê er to present to the members of Parliaopa

rder that they mayexmn

,

oe
Why not facilitate to the greatest
de ossible the examination of the propoa sthey are presented to us in concrete
form? After ail, what is a government? A
governrnent is a committee of the nation,
elected and established according to our constitutional forins, upon whieh we tlirow the
onerous duty of making a thorough examination into the conditions of the country and of
coming to reasoned conclusions and subrnitting plans and polîcies to the two Huses in
order to give them effeet and put them into
operation. Now, the Government lias donc
that. It lias told us in the Speech from the
Throne that it bas given speial consideration
to certain subjecets, and that it lias evolved
certain concrete proposais and plans which it
is anxious to put before Parliament for
examination, amendrnent, if necessary, and
approval, s0 that ultimately they rnay
becorne effective. Let us, then, get to those
proposaIs as quickly as possible. That, I think,
would relieve us very largely of our responsibility to the people, who look to us as their
representatives for a speedy and effective
solution of the difficulties that present tliernselves. What are these measures? They arc
mea.sures to ameliorate present pressing conditions; tliey are measures to facilitate and
further the future deveiopment of Canada,
and to safeguard the country, as far as possible, against recurring periods of depression.
There is a selection which may weli engage
the powvers and the experience of this body
and of the House of Gommons. Unemployment relief lias been undertaken, and provision
made thereýfor. What lias been donc? How
lias it been donc? What more is necessary,
and, if anything, what forrn should it take?
As to agricultural relief, what lias been donc
and what is it proposed to do? What about
production-its direction and control;
and
distribution-as to transport and marketing.
And wliat, ton, about wages and profits, out
of which comes the rnuch desired purcliasing
power?
Just upon that point let me say a word.
[{ow often do we hear the plea that wages
must not bie diminislied, because it is thý
amnount of wages given that provides, in th-2
hands of those who receive the wages, the
purchasing power, and that it is the wage
carriers of the country who, in combination
with capital, make possible, ail the procs.eý(,,
of production. But is there not another
rnethod by which their purchasing power can
bce made greater, and without increasing the

cost of production? 1 think we have reached
the point, and the world is coming to it, where
we should give this matter sorne special consideration, and I believe that aloaag that liDe
there will be a great movernent in the world
of nations. I take an example. Not long ago
there was a celebrated law suit in the United
States of America. The Bethlehem Steel
Cornpany was proposing to absorb another
large industry, and the directors of the two
companies had corne to an agreemnent and
arranged a plan, but a minority of the shareholders took exception to the plan, and a Iaw
suit ensued. I followed the progress of that
law suit carefully, and these facts carne out
before the .iudges: that the president of the
Bethlehem Steel Company, in addition to the
salary which was voted to hisu by the directors
and approved by the shareholders, drew the
sum of $1,262,000 as a bonus on one year's
operation; and, rnore astounding stili, four
of the higlier officiais of the Bethlehern Steel
Company had, together with the president,
drawn out a littie more, than four and a haîf
rnillion dollars before any return was made
to the shareholders in any shape or f orrn. Yesterclay I took up a United States newspaper
and found that the president of a tobacco)
company bad received uin the iast year of his
in addition to bis
incumbency $1,220,000
salary, and that five vice-presidents took out
about $500,000 divided as bonus arnongst
thernseives.
XVas that with
Hon. Mr. CASQRAIN:
the consent of the shareholders or not?
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I shall just give rny version of the matter
and leave if, for others 10 comment upon it.
Now, that fact, it strikes me, is no credit
to the capitalistie system as it exists at the
present tirne. I do not believe that in the
future this or any other nation will permit
such an uneven division of profits to be
rnade; and sornehow or other, I think, a
systern will be found by which, above and
beyond the wages due and paid to the
labourers, there will aiso lie a division of the
profits on a more equitable basis than exists
to-day. For capital is absolutely powerless
unless labour is joined with it, and labour
can do litt]e, even with rnountains of resources, unless capital is .ioined with it; and
both neccssary partners should have a fair
division of surplus profits; and there ought
to bc some means of insuring a fair division
of wvealtli arnong those who produce it.
flon. Mr. liiiCIII.S:

Ilear, hear

Right lion. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The achievement of those means is sorne-

MARCH 19, 1931
thing which might advantageously occupy
the attention of our publicists and legisiators.
Hon. Mr. HUGHIES: Would the right
honourable gentleman tell us what salaries
the men he mentioned were paid ini addition
to the bonuses?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The salaries, I believe, are comparatively
nominal; probably from $12,000 to 820,000.
Perhaps also we may be able to throw
some light on the general situation by referring to the difficulties that beset some particular industry. Let us take for example
the newsprint and pulpwood industry in Canada. Why is it not flourishing? Is the reason flot to be found in the lack of harmonious relation between production and consumption? Is it no-t a fact that the productive capacity has been increased out of ahl
proportion to the demands of the market?
It seems to, me that we must devise some
system for maintaining in every industry
something like an even balance between production and the consumption markets. The
task of establishing such proportionate relation would be a difficuit one, but it seemas
to me that it should not be impossible, and
all the more so as we are able, thanks to
improved means of communication. to keep
constantly in touch with conditions in every
part of the world.
Now, 1 hope honourable senators will not
think I am going to give a temperance lecture,Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Oh, no.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
-although I will flot admit that a temperance
lecture might not do some good even here.
But my remarks have been discursive, and
presently 1 shail have something to say about
"Ithe trade," as it is euphemnistically called.
The honourable the Minister of Labour (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) in dealing yesterday with the
Government's contribution of $20,000,000 towards the relief of unemployment told us that
the total sum that had been allottcd by the
federal, provincial and municipal authorities
in providing work and other relief was about
$90,000,000. Honourable gentlemen opposite,
as well as those on this side of the House,
were delighted to learn that such a large sum
had been put into circulation in an attempt
to provide some reniedy in the present
emergency, But what shall we say about the
huge amount that was passed over the counters
last year as a result of that singular partnership between the brewers and distillers, on the
one hand, and provincial goveruments on the
other? In eiglit of our provinces ]ast year a

31

total of $200,000,000 was collected and swept
into the tilîs of the Government liquoâvendorg. Now, whether we be temperane
atics
or as wet as the Pacifie Ocean we caýoid
the feeling that if there weire a qjn
of the expenditure in that direction
uld
greatly improve general conditions.
n
not tell, if that $200,000,000 had not gone over
the counters of the liquor shops, just what
proportion would have found its way into the
pockets of those engaged in legitimate trades-Hon. Mr. POPE: Or illegitimate.
R.ight Hon.,Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I mean, the naturally legitimate trades-Hon. Mr. POPE: Or illegitimate.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Certainly a large proportion would have gone.
to the support of such trades.
Hon. Mr. POPE: And of bootleggers.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And what an impulse would have been given
to the general business and trade of the
country if a large proportion of that huge
sum had been diverted to channels of usef ul trades. Now, as 1 have already said, the
partnership between the brewers and distillers and the provincial governments is a
singular one. I read the other day that au
international commission h-ad made an award
against the Consolidated Mining and 8melting
Company of 8350,000 in favour of certain
persons in the State of Washington whose
gardens, Iawns, orchards, tillable fields and
forests had been damaged by fumes created
by the operations of the company. -That
caused me to reflect. Is it or is it flot a
principle of law that a company which is
chartered to do business will be protected in
its operations so long as these do not cause
injury to private persons and property, but
if such injury is caused then compensation
must be paid? For example, Parliament has
granted n charter to the Canadian Pacific
Railway, and our laws protect that company
with respect to its riglits, but if the company's servants negligently or otherwîse
destroy a farmer's cattle, the farmer must be
compensated.. But this pýartnership between
the brewers and di.stillers and provincial goveraments, for what is called the control of
the sales of liquor and the promotion of true
temperance, is not subject to that principle.
Certainly the distillers and brewers do not
pay any compensation to the victims of their
traffic. When a family is deprived of its
breadwinner, as hundreds and thousands of
families have been, and are being deprived,
in order that the liquor traffic may flourish,

32

SENATE

the family? Not the
who compensates
brewer. Not the distiller.
If it be claimed that governments derive
a revenue from the sale of liquor, I ask who
pays that revenue? Not the brewer. Not
the distiller. The victim pays. And who
cares for the resultant hunan rubbish? And
who tries to case the suffering that follows
wherever the traffic flourishes? Net the
brewcr. Not the distiller. The other party,
the provincial government, is the active partner who buys the product, who puts up the
shops and delivers the goods in a seemingly
respectable guise. Every provincial government makes a profit from the partnership,
and discloses it in its annual budget statement. Ontario tåkes in $53,000,000 over the
counters of the liquor shops and makes a
profit of $7,000,000. But the Ontario Government does not compensate wives and
fanilies whose breadwinners have become
victims of the traffic; nor does it make any
compensation to society for the loss of manhood and womanhood that results. I think
that this whole matter might well be the
subject of investigation and remedial legisLition.
In concluding my disconnected remarks, I
express the hope that our people will net be
deluded into thinking that it is possible to
prov-ide a plan of relief froi our present burdens over-night. There is no royal road towards a thorough solution of our problems.
Tinme and patience will be required, as well
efficiency of the highest order, before we are
able to rise entirely out of the present depreýsion. I am certain that we shall rise out
of it, chastened but strengthened and better
cquipped than ever for the march forward.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable senators, as the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) and the
honourable the Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) have suggested that there should
be a more general participation in the debates
in this Chamber. and as the right honourable
the junior senator for Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) has acted on the suggestion, J feel that 1, anoither member of
lie reerie force, should get into the front
,nes for a short time.
We have made history this session. For the
first time our Iarliament was opened by an
Administrator who is a native Canadian, and
he performed his duties well. I wish to expires my regreit that His Excellency has since
become ill. I am sure we all hope lie will
haive a spedy recovery and resume his place.
on the bench which he so highly adorned.
Our present viceregal situation is a peculiar
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

one. It is a mistake to say that we are without a Governor General, for Earl Willingdon
still holds office; he is not actually the Viceroy
of India yet. Practice forbids that we say
much about our Governor General. but as an
ocean is between us, perhaps I may be permitted to remark that Earl Willingdon performed yeoman service for the Dominion of
Canada, and he was ably assisted by his good
wife. It is my opinion that if these two
excellent representatives of royalty are unable
to launch India on its new constitutional program, then one might almost despair that the
task will ever be accomplished. The gentleman who has been named to come to us as our
next Governor General has a warm spot in my
regard. He is Irish, and once again, after
many years, we shall have an Irish representative of the Crown. That pleases me, because
in some respects I am as clannish as the
Scotch; and when I shake hands with the
Governor General and say I am a fellow
Irishman, I shall perhaps feel quite at home.
His consort is a Parisian, and she too will
find warrn hearts here among Canadians who
speak her native language, and among the rest
of our people as well. Altogether it is a great
combination, and the Bonne Entente organization in Canada will swell with pride, for we
shall have the French and the Irish at Government House. Now, if the French and Irish
people in Canada can live in harmony, then
we ought to b happy in this country, because
the rest of us can go along quietly.
I must not omit an expression of congratulation to the mover and the seconder of the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. The mover (Hon. Mr. Schaffner)
has had long experience in xnaking addresses
in this House and elsewhere, and therefore I
presume the duty that fell to him was not
sucl an ordeal as it would have been to some
honourable members who do not take so
active a part in parliamentary affairs. I never
moved an address in my life; so I do net
know what it feels like to do so. I think
perhaps the right honourable the junior member for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) gave a lue to the reason why I never
was asked to peTform such a duty, and that
is that the Government probably felt that in
my rough way I might make some embarrassing statement. The fear that I might in my
jerky way say something against the Government may b the reason. I congratulate the
mover of the Address (Hon. Mr. Schaffner)
on his speech. There is always meat in hais

delighted to hear the seconder of the Address
(Hon. Mr. Bourque) speak in French, and my

-7
MARCH 19, 1931
admiration of his abiiity to speak the tw3
languages was equalled only by the shame
I feit because 1 could speak only one. Ail of us
here who eall ourselves representatives and
who speak only one language ought to be
ashamed.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Why do you flot learn?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Well, twentyfive years ago I eo>uad spaak fairly good
French, but rny French, like my shorthand,
got away from me, and I became so stupidly
ignorant about it and made 80 many blunders
that the eloquence of my friends shained me
out of trying to speak it.
One feature has corne to my mind from
whi.ch 1 think wa can extract comfort. 1 have
reati somewhere that the hard times in
Canada were caused by some lack of goverfimental action, or sornething of that kind;
but now we are ail agreed that; the depression
is world4wide, and that it is not as bad in
Canada as e4sewhere. I take it that credit
rather than blame, attaches to the late Government for having prevented conditions in
Canada frorn becoming as bad as thay are in
other countrias.
Now I arn going to say just a word or two in
reference to the work of the Prime Minister
-anid what I say will 'be said more in love
than in anger. The Prime M-inister cannot
continue to carry on the work of the various
departmnents and sub-departrnents, as hae is now
attempîting to do, without inju-ry to hýimsc1f.
I speak as one who for a good many years
went through the mill. His health, no mattar
how rohbust hie rnay ba, will eventualiy break
down f romn this oveirburden of work. While
it mnay not ha convenient, as hie -points out,
to unload some of this work st this tirne, as
a parsonal friand and one who has oftentimes
tried to do three or four men's work, I warn
him against undeTtaking too rnu-eh and expecting to retain his heaith and vîgour.
I do not find so many spacifie things In
the Speech from the Throne as rny right
honourable friand frorn Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir,' George E. Foster) did. There is rnention
of certain subI ects, but thair trail does not
lead us very far. We are told that the Govarnment is going to do this or that, but we
are not given any idea as to how these things
are to be done. I agrea with the riglit honourable mambar frorn Ottawa, to whorn I a.lways
listen with great delight, that it is the duty
of Parliament to gat down to detail if any
benefits are to be reaped. frorn its labours.
This Speech from. the Throne is like ail
other Speeches frorn the Throne. My right
honourable friend from. Ottawa has helped to
prépare themn, my honourable friand hy rny
sida (Hon. Mr. *Dandurand) has ha'iped to

prapara them, and I have been guilty of the
saie thing rnyself; so we have a working
acquaintanee with the procedure of devising
Speeches from tbhe Throna. I would go so
far as to say that this Speech fromn the Throne
is no better or no worse than others. Like
most oyf them, it says too rnuch and yet doas
not say enougli. What I mean is that it
contains so rnuch language that it is difficuit
for us to ascartain what we reaîly want to
know. It is not peculýiar in Vhis respect. I
know the difficultias of drafting a Speech
frorn the Throne, because so many of the
members of the Cabinet want "f avoured
nation" treatment when it is being prepared.
I put this speech on a plane with other
speeches, in the préparation of which I havei
had a hand.
Nothing has been said during the debate, I
think, about the Tariff Board, although it
was mantioned in the Speech fromn the Throne.
I had the h-onour of organizing the Tariff
Board, and I arn more than pleased that
repentance has corne so quickly to the Government for having abolished that Board.
Any member cf a governrnent who sits down
and endeavours to give an intelligent hearing
to the requests or complaints cf deputations
or business men knows how futile is the
attarnpt. rNo minister cf the Crown can
devote hours to listening to deputations whose
mambers desire an inorease or a dacrease in
the tariff. No minister has the tirne to do
that. Furthermore, a ministar has other
things to think of. Honourable members
know fromn the expérience of the past few
weeks that the deputations that carne here
could not possibly be heard. As a rnatter of
fact, days and days inight ha ocoupied in
presenting data Doncerning certain industries,
and months, possibly, have been consumed in
preparation. The theory of a Tariff Board
is absolutely sound, and the practice is just
as sound. 1 arn not critieîzing the Prime
Minister for abolishing the old Tariff Board,
if hae so desired, and I congratulate hirn on so
quickly providing for another. It wiil1 not ha
the samie, but I arn not so particular whether
it is or not. Naverthelaas, the public and
business interests demand that there shall be
some forum i which they may appear, either
personally or through counsel, and some body
that wifl investigate th-eir complaints.
Whan we inaugurated a Tariff Board and
built up an organization around it, it was
an exparint. 1 went to Washington and
saw how the Tariff Commission worked there.
And hare may I giva just a little word of
warning? It may be wise to have a Taiif
Board astablished by statute, and to hava its

22112-3
REVISED EDITION

34

SENATE

powers set out in the statute; but I warn
the Government to be careful what those
powers are. The people of Canada would not,
I think, tolerate the idea of giving to any
board which was not responsible to them the
right to make a tariff. That is our prerogative,
the prerogative of the people. So, if the
powers of the Tariff Board are to be conferred
by statute, none of them should be granted
without careful study. I say without fear
of contradiction that the Tariff Commission
in the United States does not work smoothly;
there is frequent difficulty; and Congress time
and again has rebelled against things that the
Commission has done without the consent of
Congress. Under the United States statute,
the Tariff Commission has power to investigate thoroughly, and, if it finds that the
cost of production of a commodity in some
other country is such as to permit it to come
into undue competition with goods manufactured or produced in the United States, it can
recommend to the President that the tariff be
changed, either up or down, to meet the conditions, provided that the change does not
exceed 50 per cent; and the President thereupon can change the tariff without any
reference to Congress. We cannot go very
far in this country along the line of giving
anybody the power to change the tariff without letting Parliament know about it. Parliament has given certain powers to the Government to prevent, by Order in

Council, any

man, or group of men, from imposing extra
prices on the people. The warning may not
be necessary, but I would remind honourable
gentlemen that the Canadian people are very
sensitive about their right to have some voice
in matters of taxation. It may be all right
to give the Tarifi Board certain powers by
statute. Whether that is workable or not
depends on how extensive those powers are.
In the Tariff Board organization there was a
clerical staff that had become pretty well
accustomed to securing the required data, and
I would suggest-I may be wrong-that il
those people are still available they should
again be put at that work, because it will
take months, perhaps a year, to gather
together a new staff that will be capable of
doing the work in as efficient a manner.
There is one thing that is missing from the
Speech from the Throne, and because it is
not there I am not going to dilate upon it.
I refer to the St. Lawrence waterways. A
very responsible gentleman made the promise
somewhere, I think, that construction would
be proceeded with at an early dste. I do not
sec any mention of that in the Speech from
the Throne. That, of course, does not mean
that the work cannot be done; but if it had
Right

Hon.

Mr.

GRAHAM.

been mentioned it would have given us the
"lead" which has been referred to by my right
honourable friend from Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster).
On this side of the international boundary
there has been a good deal of discussion in
reference to the St. Lawrence waterways between the provincial and the federal authoritics, and matters have been pretty well adjusted; but in the United States, the Governor
of New York State bas introduced a new
plank into his platform-the plank of government ownership-and has had a commission report on the advisability of the State
of New York developing power on the St.
Lawrence river. The only way to straighten
out the difficulty would be to have a conference between those interested. It has been
said again and again that no power other than
the federal power has any right to place a
stick of timber in an international stream,
or any navigable stream, without the consent
of the federal power; so perhaps there is
some reason for the St. Lawrence waterways
not being mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne. It is a bigger question now than
it was a few months ago.
I am not at all sorry that my right honourable friend gave us the magnificent address
that he did. It struck me that perhaps an
occasional depression was not a bad thing.
We know that in our own businesses we
occasionally have to come to a halt, and take
stock, in order to find out where we are
going; and while the depression at this time
is a serious matter to a great many people,
T think, on the whole, that perhaps the country will em-erge from it with new determination and new vision and will be better equipped
to face or prevent similar difficulties in the
future.
Now, may I say just a word about the
economic situation. I admit that I cannot
tel] the farmer how to farm.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:

That is remarkable.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Almost everybody that I have ever met can tell a man
how to run a newspaper; but, after all, the
advice is not always good. If we have always
told the farmers how to farm, I am not going
to do it now. One thing I will say, however,
and that is that unless an export market can
be found for the farmer's produce, he might
almost as well go out of business. You may
say we have the home market. That is true,
but it cannot take all of our own products.

We are 10,000,000 people, and we cannot use
ail of the products of the farmers of the
West, to mention nothing else; and if every

35

MARCH 19, 1931
pound of goods and every machine from a
foreigu country were, shut out of Canada,
even -thougli we had the home mnarket to
ourselves, the improvement in conditions,
if there were any, would be very slight.
We are told that we msust flot have any
more immigration. Perhaps thaît is right. I
am not quarreling with that.
Hon. Mi-. ROBERTSON: Who said that?
Riglit Hon. GRAHAM: There were orders
to shut out immigration.
It was neyer
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
suggested that that should be permanent.
Righ.t Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: For the preseut, ait ail events, we cannot look to immigration to increase the number of our consumers. Sa what is the use of telling the
farmers of the West ta produce more when
they cannot seil what they bave? What is
the use of urging the manufacturer ta, produce mare goods, or bringing ini menufacturers
from outside, when we have nobody to, buy
such goods? We have ta go in another
direction and find -customers who can buy
them. Af ter ahl, whatever the reaan of it is,
the real difficulty in Canada to-day is, flot
bad crops, or inability to raise wh.eat or produce rnachinery, but the scarcity of rnoney
with which ta, buy.
Hon. Mr-. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is that
flot always what makes liard tirnes?
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM- I shuuld not
be surprised. It would with me. But when
we have pot a mnarket at home, and cannot
bave until we have more people, we mnust
either cut down on« production or find
markets elsewhere. Can we, by carrying on
a tariff war, find a market outaide cf this
country? We produce more goods than we
can seil or consume here; we must seil our
surplus goods ta sornebody; so the question
is, ta wbom eau we seil them. We eau sel
them only ta the people fram whom we buy.
That is an ordinary business a.xiorn. Now, if
we put up aur tariff walls so higli that other
people canuat get their goods iu here, and
they put their tariff walls up so high that
we cannot send anything ta them, we shai
have no expart market. 1 believe in a tariff,
but 1 am strongly of the opinion that this
war of tariffs is going ta extrernes, and that
while we are doing s0 mucli talking about
the tariff we are f orgetting that what we
need is some place ta seli the goods that we
produce.
There is another thing. Even if we could
seli for cash, on the other side of the acean,
ail the goods we praduce ini Canada, we could
22112-Sj

not compete with other cauntries, because
with a very higli tariff there wauld be no
return cargoes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does not
the honourable gentleman know that we have
an enormous trade with St. Pierre, and that
we do flot bring back anything at ail?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The right
honourable gentleman frorn Ottawa (Right
Hon. Sir -George E. Foster) says that is a
eurse-and perhaps it is.
Hon. Mr.
there it is.

LYNCH-STAUNTON:

But

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn just tryimg to make the general statement that this
country cannot do for herseif alone; she
ean do her share; but the nations of the
world rnust corne to some understanding as
to how they are going ta trade if there is
to be prospcrity throughout the world. One
country cannot succeed alone, no rnatter what
its raw materials or products rnay be. That
cannat be done. We shall have to make
sorne arrangement whereby the nations will
he able to trade more freely with one another
and in such a way that they ail will profit.
Some référenice ha8 bëen made to treaties.
Now, treaties are deaigned for the benefit of
the countries con'eerned, and the negotiations
must be conducted wîth that fact in mind.
But wheneve'r Canada makes a treaity, i-egardless of what government is in, power a.nd
with what country the pact is made, some
newspapers express strong criticisrn because
certain concessions have been granted. These
crities overlook the fact that a treaty is a
bargain beitween two or more parties and
cannot be one-sided. If we refused te, work
on the principle of give -and take in ou- dealings with other couirtries, we should not be
able to make any more trade agreements
abroad, and those now in existence would
flot be renewed. Let that Étaite of affairs continue for but a short time, then there would
be no mnarket for Canadian goods outeide ouiown boundaries. Our great need is more
foreign markets, but we cannot expeet to get
them if we will ndt take some goods from
other parts of the world.

Because con-

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
in what way?

Ohanged

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The honourable member should have listened as carefully
as I did to the right honourable the junior
senator for Ottawa. Conditions have changed
and we must deal with the situation as it

exists to-day. I have attended economic conferences and I know something of how they
are conducted. Just as in Parliament, the real
work of such conferences is donc by committees and informal groups. As every honour-

able member knows, the speeches that are
made on the floor of this Chamber, for example, do not have much effect upon the. way
we vote. When a member of any parliamentary body, or of an economic conference, wishes

to press a certain matter forward to success,
he will usually take it up with a number of

other members and lay his cards on the table.
It is impossible to obtain a knowledge of what
takes place at an economie conference from
the speeches that are delivered there. For
example, at the Economic Conference of 1923,
which I attended, all the proposed changes
with respect to preferenice. were decided upon
by representatives of the British and overseas
governments before the matters were formally
brought up for discussion. I shall not quote
any of the remarks that I made at that
gathering, although I have them before me.
On behalf of Canada it was pointed out that
we had no desire to interfere in the fiscal
policy of the British Government, but if they
decided to change, their policy we should be
glad to tell them how they could do so in the
best interests of this Dominion. After conclusions had been reached by the Prime Minister and his confreres, the late Sir Lomer
Gouin and myself, the Prime Minister wrote
a letter, a copy of which is on record, to
members of the British Government, suggest-

ing certain things that would prove beneficial
to Canada if they decided to make a change
in their fiscal policy. At the top of the list
we recommended preferential treatment for
Canadian wheat. But no British Government
has so far seen fit to follow that recommendation. However, at that conference we got
Hon.

Mr. SCHAFFNER.

Now, I want to point out a great difference between the proposal that was made to
the British Government by the present Prime
Minister and that made in 1902 by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. Sir Wilfrid Laurier went to London

with an olive branch in his hand.

His Gov-

ernment had passed a measure of preference

to Great Britain before he left this country.
He did not go with the object of driving a
bargain. As an expression of good-will towards Great Britain, and of appreciation of
the fact that that country for some years

had allowed the free entry of our products
to her markets, Canada made a gesture. Sir

Wilfrid therefore was able to point out what
already had been done, and to add that
Canada would be very pleased if the Mother
Country would grant certain preferences in
return. But before the present Prime Min-

ister left for Great Britain he erected a trade
barrier against that country. Obviously the
situations are not at all identical, for in the
first instance Canada's representatives bore an

olive branch, while on the last occasion they
went with a hickory club. The present Government raised. the duties on British goods

and then at the conference Canada's representatives said to Great Britain, "We will
make the duty 10 per cent higher on goods
from other countries, if you will do certain
things for us."

I do not desire to say anything further
about the tariffs. I know as much about tariffs
as some people, and not as much as some
others. We could discuss tariffs for years
without getting any nearer to a solution of
our present difficulties than we now are. This

country bas been prosperous under Conservative governments. I admit that frankly, although at one time I did not think such a
thing was possible. But under Liberal administrations the country has had the most prosperous periods in its history. Experience indicates that our trade is not affected to such a
great extent as we sometimes imagine it is
by fluctuations in the tariff.
I have great faith in Canada. I believe
that it is sound, that our people are sound,
and that we can stand a depression of this
kind better than any other country in the
world. If I did not think that Canada was
a good place to live in I would not be advis-

ing young men and women to corne to it and
to stay in it. But we need to proceed carefully; we should learn a lesson fromn aur
experiences during this depression, and be
better prepared if and when there is a recurrence of economnic stress in the future.
As a final remark, I wish ta emphasize that
an absolutely essent.ial step towards the permanent prosperity of Canada is the devising
of a system. Nhereby we can trade more freely
and to a larger extent with ail the countries
of the world than we now do.
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable senators, I
desire simply ta make a few remarks with
regard ta the alleged analogy between the
position tha't was taken by the Prime Minister
at the latest Economie Conference and that
which was taken by Sir Wilfrid Laurier et
the canference of 1902. Perliaps it is not
generally remembered that in Great Britain
in 1902 there wes a duty of one shilling a
quarter, or three cents a bushel, on wheat.
That duty was imposed, not for protection,
but as a tax ta help defrey the cost of the
South African War. 'rhe Canadien Government asked that the imports of wheet fromn
this country should be exempt from that tex.
Insteed of demanding that food taxes be imposed for the benefit af Canada, aur Government suggested that the people of Great
Britain be exempted from. a f ood tex, sa far
as imports from the Dominion were concerned.
Sa it is clear that the position was diametrically opposite ta that taken by the present
Prime Minister of Canada lest fall.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
FIRST RE~ADING

Bill 17, an Act for granting to His Majest '
certain sums of money for the public service
of the financial year ending the 3lst March,
l931.-Hon. Mr. Robertson.
SECOND

READING

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill
covers supplementary estimates for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1931, and provides for
the granting of moneys Vo pay for liabilities
that have been incurred for the purposes of
carrying on government, and that were nlot
foreseen when the main estimates for the year
were passed. There are numerous details in
the sixty odd items, which represent a total
of $19,842,664.22. 1 fancy that it is flot necessary for me Vo make a detailed explanation
of the Bill, on the motion for second reading,
at any rate. Most honourable senators, I
presume, have familiarized themselves witb
the discussion that oecurred in another place,
where the estimates were dealt witb in detail.
Rigbt Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, I presume it will not be out of
place te stipulate as is usually done, that the
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

passing of supply with virtually no discussion
is nlot to preclude honourable senators from
discussing any items of the Bill when we are
considering supply in the future. I prefer Vo
call estimates of this kind supplemental
appropriations, by way of distinguisbing them
from the regular supplementary estimates.
At every session we have the main estimates,
and invariably hýefore prorogation there are
supplementaries.
In those twe instances
supply is granted for money te be spent,
but a supply Bill brougbt in at the end
of a fiscal year is intended Vo cover liabilities
already incurred, for wbich ne money was
voted. To borrow a term used by the bankers,
the purpose of the present Bill is Vo cover up
-I do net mean it is Vo, hide-what we might
caîl an overdraf t. I presume that flot mucb,
if ýany, of the money referred Vo bere bas
actually been expended, but the liabilities
have been incurred. With the stipulation that
I have made, I have no objection te the
second reading.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I may say to
niy right honourable friend that the term
"supplementary," which, I used, appears on
the Bill itself.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
1 know it
does.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am perfectly
willing Vo agree that perhaps the other word
might be just as appropriate, but "supplementary" is used on the Bill that we have
before us.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is wbat
we have Vo pass.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have no objectien, and I do noV Vhink the Government
would have any, Vo bonourable senators discussing any of the items in this Bill wben the
main estimates are under consideration.

NEW SENATOR INTRODUCED
Hon. Lawrence Alexandor Wilson, of Rigaud, Quebec, introduced by Right bon. G.
P. Graham and Hon. J. P. B. Casgrain.
THE LATE SENATOR LESSARD
TRIBUTE

TO IIIS MEMORY

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON- HanouTable
senatars, perhaps Vhis wauld be an opportune
time ta refer ta the passing of one of aur
members, which bas occurred since we adjourned before Exister. 1 refer ta the Hon.
Mr. Lessard, of Alberta. He was an ornament
ta tbis House. Ho knew Canada well. Born
in the Province of Quebec flfty-seven years
ago, be werft west in early life and was one
of the pianeers in the settlement of the Province of UAlberta. Ho played an active part
in the development of that province, and was
particularly interested in the welfare of the
people Qf bis own race. It is fitting that at
this time we should remember bis life and
work and pay tribute ta bis memary.
Senator Lessard was a delightful friend and
polished gentleman. IV was my privilege ta
meet him, in bis own province an a number

of occasions, two of which 1 recail particularly
well at the moment. One of those meetings
with hima was in the city of Edmonton, and
i was greatly impressed with the high regard
in which he seemed to be held by the citizens
of his own community; and the last time
that I remember dining with him was in the
company of haîf a dozen other gentlemen,
ail of whom abviously were his cl-ose personal frienda and admirers. I am sure I voice
the feelings of the honourable the leader of
the Government in the Huse (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby), who is absent to-night, as wel
as the feelings of ail honourable memibers on
this side, in rendering a tribute of respect to
the memary of the late Senator Les.sard and in
extending condolence to his bereaved family.
The life and work of ou~r late friend will, I
am sure, be long remembered in Western
Canada.
Hon. IR. DANDURAND: Honoufrable senators, I desire to join in the tribute that has
lust been paid ta the mexnory of the late
lamented Senator Lessard. It was not my
privilege to be closely associated with him,
but of his work and reputatian I heard mýuch.
I was particularly impressed by our laVe
friend's courage and energy, Indeed, I have
a high -admiration for an-y man who, in an
effort to irnprove bis position in ie, beaves
bis native home, his friends and relatives, and,
maving far away, endeavours to, work out a
career in a new environiment. At the age of
twentyýfive MT. Lessard ]eft bis native province of Quebec and went Vo Edmonton. In a
short space oif time ho becarne engaged in a
wide range of activities, and one need but
look at the short biographicail sketch of him
which is available Vo realize the great strides
he made and the diversity of interests ta
which he successfully devoted himself. Not
oqnly was he active iii commercial ventures,
but lie played a prominent part in social,
military and polýitical affairs in Alberta. As
my honourahie friend has just said, the late
Senator was one of the Western pioneers. He
was a robust and strong citizen, who became
high*ly popular and respected ini bis own coin*munity. He was eleoted ta the Alberta Logislature a few years after his arival in the
West, and was favoured with the support of
bie constituents from 1909 to 1921. Stili a
young maon when ca;lled Vo, the Senate, lie
gave promise of a splendid career in this
Chamber. No longer shall we ho able ta
avsui ôu!rselves of bis advice, from which we
of ton benefited when questions of particulair
interest Vo Alberta and other western provinces were being oonsidered bore.
Ordinarily we expect the od Vo, die bofore
the yaung, but we have learnod from experi-

42

SENATE

ence that sometimes the young are the first
ta, be calied away. Thus we axe reminded
of the uncertainty of existence. Our days are
numbered, but no one knows how far he wili
travel along the roýad of life. A departed
friend, a former leader of mi-ne in this Chamber, Hon. Mr. Scott, used to say: "What
shadows we airel Wbat shadows we pursue!"
But we must carry on and flot falter, doing
day b* day and ycar by year the work that
falis ta our lot, so thaýt when aur time cornes
to pass on each of us wiii leave behind the
record of a life's work wcll donc.
On behaif of members on this side of the
House, I jain with the honourabie gentleman in exte.nding to the family of thc late
Senator Lessard aur deepest sympatby.
Hon. G. LAÇASSE: Honourabie senators,
may I, as one of the younger members of this
Chamber, be permitted ta add a few wards
to the apprapriate remarks just made by my
aIder coileagues. 1 arn ane of a littie group
of men who were born in the aid province of
Quebec, wba moved ta other parts of the
Dominion ta establish a business or open
professional offices, and who eventually were
chosen ta represent minority elements of their
adopted provinces in the councils of the
nation. My bonourable friend from Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) belongs ta that
group, as does the honourabie gentleman
from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Bénard). Ta
tbat group also belonged Prosper Edmond
Lessard. Sa perbaps I rnay be ailowed ta express particuiarly on bebaif of the rernaining
members of that group aur regret at the
sudden passing of the honourabie senator
frorn St. Paul, and ta extend ta lis bereaved
family aur beartfelt sympatby.
Tbe Angel of Deatb knocks at the door of
this Chamber at irregular intervals, and no
anc knows on wbam, the ncxt summons will
be servcd. Normally we should expeet that
aur aider coileagues wouid be called first;
but Providence reigns supreme in matters of
life and dcatb, as in evcrything tbat concerns
mankind, and, witb respect and hurnility, wc
mnust abide by its mysteriaus decrees. The
latest summons has caused a great sorrow i
the borne of what was a happy famiiy in
distant Alberta; and the city of Edmonton
rnourns the passing af anc of its most distinguishcd citizens. Neyer again shall we sec
the smiling and sympathetie face of Prosper
Edmond Lessard; no longer saal we be able
ta appreciate bis genial and affable personality. Our fricnd bas passcd ta tbe Great

time, when Canada needs ber truest hearts
and her beat bramas ta deal witb tbe huge and
exceptionally difficult probierna tbat now face
ber public men. Let us cheriali the hope
tbat tbc example of lis life, full of devotion
and earnestness in tbc accarnpiisbmcnt of bis
many duties, wili be an inspiration for the
youtb of tbis country, and let us hope also
tbat tbe man wba is scicctcd by the Government ta occupy lis vacant cbair will live

always rernember Senator Lessard as a good

two. The first -is to provide for the grantîng
of one-sixth of the amount shown in the

analyze and discuss the estimates ini detail
The amount saked for

and is for civil government. The second

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable niember, titis being what might be

advantage in detining the House et the

est-imates are placed before the House we shail

contained in them, including these. I have

INQUIRY

froin the inception

FIRST READING

231,982 24

some six weeks ago, before the Easter adjourn-

ment, I called the attention of the House to
the fact that cars coming into the Parliament
grounds through the East Gate are permitted
to take either a right or a left turn, contrary
to the former regulation, under which they
could make a right turn only. It seems to me
that accidents are more likely to occur there
under the present conditions; and I think the
East Gate is the one through which most
senators enter the grounds. When I raised
this question before the honourable leader of
the House told us that he would have the
matter looked into, and I presurne that has
been done. Perhaps I am the only one who
objects to the present regulation. If so, of
course I shall be content, although I think
the former regulation should be restored.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The honourable
gentleman knows that I laid on the Table a
departmental return stating that the method
adopted at the present time, in the view of
the engineer in charge, afforded greater security than the previous practice.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I did not know that
such a return had been made.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable

been to make a motion if it is deýsired to fix

I do not know whether there is an obligatory
rule on this point, but sucli has been the
un-iformn practice. I raise this question now
because there may be times when some hon-ourable members wouhd desire to discuss a
special date proposed for the second reading
of a Bill.
The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: I arn
advised that when it is desired to fix for the
second reading a date other than that provided by the rules, a motion is necessary.

shorter way is the hetter way, and there is no
valid objection.

THE LATE SENATOR G. G. FOSTER
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
senators, it becomes the sad duty of the leader
cd the House to refer to the death of another
senator, the Hon. G. G. Foster.
I feit
peculiarly attached to our late friend and
was under many obligations to him, but
my remarks at this time will be brief because
the honourable gentleman to my riglit (Hon.
Mr. Rohertsoin) represented the -Government
at the funeral and intends to speak to us;
and I know the honourable leader on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who is a
citizen of the same city *as was the deceased
senator, will desire to pay his trihute.
On hooking up a biographical sketch of the
late Senator Foster I find that lie was called
to the Senate in the same year that I was,

SENATE
1917, although at that time he seemed to me
to be my senior in political experience. I
early came under his magnetic spell. He was
one of the most charming men I have ever
known, and the kindly feelings that I entertained towards him in the beginning were enhanced year by year. Not only was he at all
times pleasant in manner, but he was an able
counsellor when we were dealing with important legislation. He was a distinguished
member of bis profession, being an ex-Batonnier of the Bar of Montreal and an ex-Batonnier General of the Bar of the Province of
Quebec; and he was intimately associated
with large commercial and financial institutions in Montreal. By virtue of the high
place he held among professional and business leaders, he had an outlook on life that
was very helpful te those of us whose experience was more limited. We Westerners
who have dabbled in land found in him something that made a special appeal, because
he had a farm of his own. I know he took
great pride in that farm and strove te make
a reasonable success of it. He would have
been a wizard had he been able to make
money out of farming, even in the Province
of Quebec.
We shall miss the kind face and the wise
counsel of the late Senator Foster in this
House. He had been Chairman of perhaps
our most important committee, the Committee
on Banking and Commerce. On one or two
occasions I happened to substitute for him in
that position, at his request, and at such times
he gave me beforehand advice that was of
great value in dealing with certain bills. It is
with sincere regret that this House mourns
what seems te me his early and unitimely
death.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
senators, the passing of our friend and colleague, the Hon. George G. Foster, undoubtedly
came as a shock to us al]. Born in 1860, he was
in his seventy-first year. He was a mecmber of the Senate for some fourteen years,
and I am sure that all honourable senators will agree with me when I say that
while we were net privileged te hear him frequently in this House, he was listened te with
the closest attention when he chose te speak
te us, and at all times his views were regarded
with the highest respect.
No one could have attended the funeral
yesterday at Knowlton, Quebec, without being impressed by the fact that his passing was
sincerely mourned by the people of that district. The deep sorrow that one saw all
around was a fitting and glowing tribute te
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

his memory. One of the most touching
sights was the presence, at the church and the
burial ground, of his aged mother, in her
ninety-fifth year. Children lined the street
te the church, little boys on one side and
girls on the other, testifying to the love that
they had for our deceased friend.
Honourable senators will remember how
partial he was te beautiful flowers, and we
are reminded of this facit, and indeed of his
love for beautiful things in general, when we
look upon the wreaths now lying on his desk.
His love of the beautiful in nature was illustrated by the choice of the place where he
had built a summer home, at Brome Iake,
in a setting of sueh rural loveliness as perhaps could net be excelled anywhere. The
surroundings were peaceful, and on the occasion of his funeral yesterday I heard several
persons refer te the fact that his greatest delight was te have his friends come te sce
him, and to roam through those woods and
around that lake in quiet conversation among
the scenes that he loved so well.
That he loved children is manifest from
numerous incidents and anecdotes that might
be related of his life. I remember hearing
recently of an incident that showed his kindness to the boys in his office. One day, seeing a messenger boy in tears, he inquired
the reason, and, learning that the boy had
lest what te him was a beautiful and useful dog-in reality it was nothing but a very
ordinary mongrel, but it was highly prized
by the boy-he had a search made for it,
and when it was found paid for its licence
for five years, and restored it te the boy.
That is but one of many little touches indicating the spirit of kindliness that was uppermost in the man's life.
One might multiply such references te the
kindly deeds of Senator Foster during his lifetime, but nothing could be more eloquent,
as to the esteem in which he was held, than
the evidence of devotion and affection given
by the people who assembled yesterday to do
honour te his memory. To what our leader
on this side has said, I desire to add my
tribute to the sterling worth and noble character of a loyal and devoted citizen. I am
sure that our sympathies go out to his wife,
his son and his daughter, in their grief.
Hon. RAOUL DANIDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, my honourable friends
who have preceded mne have stated truly the
many noble qualities of our late lamented
friend. They saw him in action mostly in
this Chamber and at the capital, and during
the latter part of bis life. Those of us who.

MAY 5, 1931
began life at about the same time that hie
did, who were called to the Bar about the
saine year that hie was, and who had occasion
to observe hlm in his various activities from
year to year, recogn-ized, long before hie came
ta the Senate, that there was not a weak spot
to detract frein Ms very rich nature. He was
kindness itself, and was always ready to put
himself out in order ta please. He had no
enemy. Ail the members of the bar were
his friends. In -any matter of court procedure
they did nlot require his signature; Mse word
was sufficient. I have observed Mim from
many angles and have always admired Mse
very high standing.
He was a devoted son. There was not a
day when hie was away from his dear old
mother that hie did not write to hier. Every
day that hie was, here a letter left Ottawa
addressed to lier. Re was the kindest of
fathers and the best of husbands, and as a
public citizen hie was always desirous to heip
and to serve. There was nlot a spark of litolevance in his mind. To him ail Canadians were of one family. I realize to-day
that no man in the Eastern Townships was
more esteemed and more beloved than George
Green Foster, and the same is true of the
metropolis of Canada, where bis friends were
legion.
Speaking for bonourable members on tMis
side of the Hause, I join with my. honourable friends opposite in extending aur sympathies to his dear wife, Mse dear oId mother,
and bis children.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
members, for me this is a personal bereavement. I pray that I may be given the strength
to control my emotion. I entirely concur ini
the fine sentiments so well expressed by the
leader of the Government and the Minister
of Labour, and in the eloquent speech of the
leader on this side of the House. We ahI feel
that we are like one great famiiy that has
lost a very dear miember.
For more than a quarýter of a century
Senator Foster's family and mine have been
two of six which have lived on a private
paroel of land witMin the city of Montreal,
but over which the city has no control. In
that diminutive community Senator Foster
shared our joys and sorrows. He was the. one
we ail went to witb our cares and troubles,
and we always received the kindest of bearing
and the best of advice. Thanks to bis lavable
disposition and his great tact, there was neyer
one discordant word amongst us in all these
years.
He loved Mse home, but the place nearest
to hie heart was dear old Knowlton, where hie

was born. With the first money hie made out
of law hie bought a farm for himself, although
Mse father, Judge Foster, had then a very
extensive estate in the village. The old farmbouse, aýft 'er nearly flfty years, is stihI standing
intact as part of "Blarney Castle." There was.
the home where Senator Foster reaily liked
to live. Only those who were fortunate enough
to enjay Mse hospitality know how kind and
considerate a host can be. This countryseat, cronsidered the finest in the Eastern Townships, had a frontage of two-thirds of a mile
on Brome Lake, the precipitous shores of
which were covered with the most beautiful
maple grove. The late Sydney Fisher, his
neîghbour, for flfteen years Minister of Agriculture, aiways saîd that there were no maple
trees anywhere like George Foster's trees,
which hie bad lovingly nursed for hall a
century. His farm was an inspiration not
only ta his immediate environs, but throughout the Eastern Townships that hie loved so
weIl. Hie wonderful herds of prize cattle and
bis flocks of sheep were renowned beyond the
boundaries of the Province of Quebec. The
soul represented his fatherland, and hie knew
that by improving the one hie was serving the
ather.
In. Montreal, when the news of his sudden
death spread consternation among his hasts of
friends, one heard on ahl sides, from people
of ail classes, that they had lest their best
frîend. Lord Athoistan said in the Mount
Royal Club one evening that if hie thought
hie could render a service ta George Foster
and had ta walk from Montreal ta Chicago
ta do it, he would start that night. They
were the closest of friends, working together
for the Home for Crippled Children, and
helped ta make that home the grand institution that it is ta this day.
There are two facts that I wish ta place on
record in Hansard of the Senate. When Senator
Foster wvas unanimously seiected as Chairman
of the Banking Committee bie was a Director
of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, a powerfui institution. A directarship carries with At
substantial emoluments; still his exquisite
sensitiv-eness prompted him ta make a pecuniary sacrifice by resigning the directorship,
s0 that even a suspicion of partiality could
not be attri-buted ta him in Mse rulings as
Chairman. On another occasion, when the
Government decided ta takce a share in the
Canadian Northern Railway, Senator Foster
was Director of the Canada Car and Foundry
Company. He resigned aiso this directarsMip,
because hie thought that this company would
of necessity have deaiings with the administration. Such was his higb regard for the iia-

SENATE
dependence of Parliament. In another place,
when a certain man accepted the highest gift
that his political party could confer upon
him, ha gave up every board. Ha also should
ha commended for this disintorosted move. It
is rofreshing to consider sucli actions, and
they should ho enshrined ini the political
annals of this Sonate.
We witnessed yesterday a scene that wc
shall neyer forget. Senator Foster's dear old
mother, 96 yaars of aga, wvas present at the
sacred service in the Anglican Church, and
aftcrwards followed hima to his grava. She
stood thora as his ramains were being lowered
into that Knowlton earth ho loved so well.
I was close to her. She spoke in an audible
voice. "They have taken my son froma me.
Lay himn down gently. My dear boy." The
local clergyman said: "Be brave, Mrs. Foster.
To-night 1 shaîl come to you and we shal
speak of him. Coma now." It is given to
few mon to witness sucha a scona.
We Christians have a very soothing and
consoling belief. Our common faith teaches
us that death is but a separation for
a numbor-very limited-of yoars, months,
weeks, perhaps days, of wbich God alone
knows the count, and that if wo love our
neighbour as ourselves, and do unto others as
we would have them do unto us, wo shal
some day ho united on tho barque of St.
Peter, spreading its broad, white canvas to the
soft and sacrod broozes of hope, and wafted
across the immense ocean of divine mercy to
the beautiful and onchanting shores of eternal
fohicity.
Honourable
Hon. SMEATON WHITE:
members, to what has boon so well and se,
eloquently said may I add a personal tributs
to my des-k-mate, the late Senator Foster.
Ha and I cntered thîs Chamber on the same
day, and were desk-mates for noarly f ourtaon years. I consider it a tribute to him
that during ahl that time wo couhd romain
together wîthout any unkindly words.
My personal acquaintance with him and my
knowlodge of bis family relations cxtcnd back
over forty yoars, and I know, perhaps as well
as any other member in this Chamber, how
highly ho was respected, flot only at Knowlton
and throughout the Eastern Townships, wbich
ho called his home, but also in Montreal. As
the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
bas said, Senator Foster occupiod a very distinguished position at the Montreal Bar.
Apart fromn that, in a social way, ho hold many
positions that bespeak more oloquently than
any words of mine bis noble qualities. Ha
wvas always shy of having his actions lauded
or his praises sung, and I do flot feol that I
cdn say anything more than that for many
years ho was a truc friend.
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. RUFUS POPE: Honourable memb ors
of the Sonate, thora is not.hing that I can add
to the very kindly remarks tbat have been
made by the honourable gentlemen who have
proceded me with reference to my porsonal
friand, George G. Foster. Coming, as I do,
from the Eastern Townships, whero bis famiýly
resided for three or four gonerations, I feel
almost as though 1 had lost a close relative.
The kindness of the man could not ho surpassed, and his gonerosity to all who knew
him and came under bis influence was ever
presont. As the honourable member from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Smeaton White) bas
said, the late sonator did not want bco ha
praised for anytbing that ho had done. Ha
preferrod that his gonerosity should romain
unknown.
It is a vary groat satisfaction to me to know
that bis departuro wus without pain, witbout
anguish, without struggle. He had visitad bis
legal office a day or two previous to bis death,
and bad said that ha would return; ha had
secured accommodation to coma to Ottawa to
ho with us to-day; and on the evening befora
bis death ha bad bis family around him-his
wifo, hie son, his son's wife, his daugbter and
ber husband, and threa or four close friands.
After spending an enjoyable ovoning ho retired.
In the morning ho rose and cama down stairs,
and after breakfast ho said to his wife: "I have
had a splendid breakfast; I nover enjoyed
one botter beforo." To ber inquiry, "You ara
feeling woll, George?" ho replied, "I have not
fait botter for yaars." She thon said: "Walh, I
am going down the street, if you hava no
objection," and, as ho had none, she went out.
When she returned ha had departed this lifo.
I do not know that wo could ask for any
greater blessing, perhaps, than was bastowed
upon him aftor two or three years of àlnessto leave 'this life without anguish and without
pain.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
1-onourable. members, I desira to associate
mysaîf most earnostly with ail that has been
said of our doparted friand. I hava not the
least doubt that all my co-mambers feel as 1
do. ls it too much to ask that we members
of the Sonate should rise for a moment or
two and in this way pay a silant tributa to
the mnemory of our departed friand, who wae
a dovoted public man and a loyal citizen of
Canada and of the Empire?
The honourable members rose and paid
sulent tribute. to the mnemory of the late Senator Foster.

REDUCTION OF WORLD ARMAMENTS
DISCUSSION AND

MOTION FOR RETURN

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE

E. FOSTER

ca'Hed attention to the present status of the
question of the reduction and limitation of
world armaments, and moved:
That the Government lay on the Table of the

Senate:-

1. A copy of the Draft Convention prepared
by "The Preparatory Commission for the

Disarmament Conference" of the League of
Nations Society.
2. A copy of the final report of "the Conmittee on Budgetary Questions" appointed by
the above named Preparatory Commission in

connection with the above named Draft Convention.

3. A copy of the resolution of the Imperial
Conference, 1930, with reference to the reduction and limitation of armaments.
4. Copies of any correspondence had by the
Government or the Department of External
Affairs with the British Government or the
Secretary of the League of Nations Society
since October, 1930, in reference thereto.
He said: The duty that presents itseli te
my mind at the present time is te call the
attention of honourable members te the successive steps that have been taken by the
League of Nations and other bodies in respect
te the limitation and reduction of world
armament.

It is a little difficult for me te

decide how te aipproach the subject se as not
te take up too much time and stiHi give a fair

and consecutive review of the progress that
has been made since the establishment of the
League and has culminated in one of the most
momentous announcements concerning the
devellopment of national life in all time.

49

In 1919, at the close of the most destructive
war in the history of mankind, the Peace Conference at Paris became responsible for the
organization which we; now know as the
League of Nations Society. There has been
much criticism of the alleged delay and failure
of this organization, one of the main objects
of which was to bring about a reduction of
warlike armaments of aH kinds, as a necessary
preliminary to the gradual elimination and
ultimate abolition of war as a means of
settling international disputes.
The basis upon which after-action was
taken, and is stili going on, for the achievement of this objective, is laid down in the
Covenant:
The Members of the League recognize that
the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point
consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.
So reads Article 8 of the Covenant.
In order to render possible the initiation of
a general limitation of the armaments of all
nations.
Se reads the preamble which formed a part of
each of the peace treaties as they followed
one another.
In order to diminish the economic difficulties
of Europe, armies should everywhere be reduced
to a peace footing, armaments limited to the
lowest possible figure, and the League invited
to examine proposals without delay to that end.
Se reads the instruction of the Supreme Council which was issued early in the year 1920.
The reduction of military burdens is a necessary condition for financial recovery.
This is the resolution of the Brussels Financial
Convention in the year 1920, in which thirtyeight nations were represented.
A permanent Commission shall be constituted te advise the Council on the execution
of the provisions of Articles 1 and 8 and on ail
military, naval and air questions generally.
So reads the Ndnth Article of the Covenant
of the League of Nations.
Upon this basis all action looking to the
limitation and reduction of armaments, since
the constitution of the League, has been
founded, and I suppose almost as much criticism has been directed against the League of
Nations for delay and lack of success in
acbieving the objective, as along any other
line.
Little drops of water, little grains of sand,
Make the mighty ocean and the bounteous
land.
I suppose that is one of the earliest couplets
that children learn in millions of our homes
and schools.

-comes
to us from the lines of the copybook of our earliest school days. All the
developments of life, multitudinous and varied
as they are, teach the same lesson, that time
and regular courses and patience are necessary
and fundamental. The man in a hurry looks
at the seed that his gardener commits to the
soil. An hour afterwards he savs to the
gardener, "But I do not see any result." Nor
can he. Little by little, day by day, phase
by phase. through Nature's chemical and
atmospheric laws, the seed germinates, grows,
buds, blossoms, and at last bears the perfect
fruit. Yet there are people who with regard
to great organizations undertaken by individuals, corporations, nationalities or international forces, desire to see immediate results from the initial efforts. I hope we have
none of that class of mind in this Chamber.
Criticisms with reference to delay and lack
of early fulfilment in this particular line of
effort of the League of Nations must be
governed by the same rules and conditions
that prevail in all phases of life and development in the great world in which we live.
Let us look, then, at the steps that have
been taken. The League of Nations came
into existence in Januarv, 1920. The first seed,
so to speak, the first organism, or part of an
organism, was the Couîncil of the League of
Nations, which was formed shortly after the
League began. This Council took immediate
action and on the 17th of May, 1920, appointed
the "Permanent Advisory Commission" on
military, naval and air questions, in accordance with the instructions of Article 9 of the
Covenant, that Commission consisting of nine
representative experts in land, naval and air
warfare, chosen from nine of the principal
nations of the League. Its membership was
afterwards extended to fourteen, selected from
t.he principal nations of the League.
The next step was taken at the first meeting of the Assembly at Geneva, in November of that year, which authorized the formation of "the Temporary Mixed Commission,"
which was set up by the Council in February,
1921. The duties of this commission were to
make inquiry into the military and naval
equipment of the different nations bclonging
to the League, and after such inquiry to
prepare for the consideration of future assemblies plans and proposals for bringing about
the successful accomplishment of the great
objective.
Many difficulties not apparent before then
made their appearance. There were the racial
and war ha.treds that had been deep-rooted
prior to the war and had been sharpened and
accentuated during the years of conflict.
Those hatreds and prejudices had to be
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

softened, and if possible eliminated, in order
that there might be created an atmosphere
favourable to co-operation in considering the
questions involved.
Other difficulties resulted from the creation of new nations, with
new economic and national ambitions, and
from the ambitions of the nations already
established for added prestige and extended
territory.
Then there came quickly to the fore the
question of security. Various nations said, in
effect: "You ask us to reduce and limit the
war equipment that we at present have.
What guarantee can you give us that if we
lessen our presenf means of defence we shall
ietain our existing status and security?" Consider, for instance, the case of Poland, facing the great Russian nation, an hereditary
enemy of long standing. Poland naturally
asked: "How can you demand that we limit
our present military establishment unless you
assure us that in case we are attacked by
Russia or any other enemy we shall be protected in our rights?" So the question of
security had to be given very serious thought.
Then came the question of the modus operandi. How was this reduction of armaments
to be carried out so that each nation should
be treated fairly and permitted to have the
equipment that was absolutely necessary for
safety? Problems of this type made it clear
to the League in 1920 and 1921 that the
difficulties in the way of bringing about reduction of armament were so great that their
solution could be reached only after many
years of careful study and unremitting effort.
We know how difficult it is to administer
government in a single self-contained country,
such as Canada, where there is at times a
conflict of sectional interests. How much
more difficult must it be to draft regulations
that will be acceptable to forty or fifty different nations, of varying races, traditions and
cultures, with sharply defined national prejudices and diverse geographic and economic
conditions. When we think of the vastness
and complexity of the problem, it seems to
me we are bound to be reasonable in any
criticism that we may make of the accomplishments of the League.
With these necessary preliminary steps for
examination and report was coupled a resolution asking the different member nations,
some forty-two in number, to make sure that
their war budgets of 1920 should not be exceeded in the following two years, while the
whole question of the reduction of armaments
was being considered.
On the whole the
various nations gave effect to the request in
that resolution.

MAY 6, 1931
There was complete unity of principle in
that, but the implications arising from the
application of that principle were very different. To make a long story short, let me
say that after very long and serious discussion of these plans the Advisory Commission
and the Mixed Temporary Commission were
of the opinion that Lord Esher's scheme was
inpracticable and impossible of fulfilment,
that it did not take in all the existing factors,
and that the principle of mutual assistance
was the one upon which the League should
proceed. An attemp.t was made-and it succeeded in the end-to bring these two parties
to an agreement on the same principle, but
with two methods of application. The result
was that the "Draft Treaty of Mutual
Assistance," on the report of the Temporary
Mixed Commission, was approved by the
Assembly of 1923 and submitted to the
nation members of the League for their consideration. That was the first tangible and
seemingly practical application of a considered
means to the desired end.
These conventions and agreements may be
passed by the League of Nations at the annual assembly, but they have force only as
they are accepted by the nations that belong
to the. League. Twenty-nine governments
responded to the appeal. Eighteen of them
were in favour of the Draft Treaty of Mutual
Assistance. Others, including the Government
of Great Britain, objected to it on various
grounds. Although not belonging to the
League, the United States and Russia, whieh
had representatives on that commission, both
gave as their opinion that the proposai was
not satisfactory.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Therefore, in 1924, when the Fifth AssemAssistance which would effectuate the purpose
in view. It went so far as to mean not only bly of the League of Nations met in Geneva,
financial assistance, but, if necessary, assist- it was faced with the practical failure of acance in the way of armaments and war ma- ceptance of the first draft convention. The
year 1924 was an important one. M. Hériot

The proposition put forward by Lord Cecil, was the Prime Minister of France, his party
and strongly supported by -the majority of or group of parties having lately succeeded
the members of the League of Nations, fol- to the government. In that same year the
lowed that same line of mutual assistance, Right Hon. Ramsay MacDonald was the

tween the affected nationality- and what might that meeting of the League, and were strong
be called the regional neighbours, but rather and active supporters of the principle emupon the force and power and strength, diplo- bodied in the League of Nations Society.
As a result of the discussions which took
matic, financial and military, of the whole
place in that year the Assembly said: "Well,
League of Nations. Under that plan, if an
aggressor threatened or commenced an at- we have had the reports from our committee;

plishing its purpose.
At the second Assembly of the League of
Nations the reports and proposals of the two
commissions were presented and became the
subject of interesting and vital discussion.
There was the scheme of Lord Esher, which,
at the second meeting of the League of Nations, came up for examination. The proposition was to settle the question upon the basis
of units of effective soldiers in peace time,
those units or portions of units being distributed equally according to the needs of the
different nations that formed the League.
There was another proposition, wider and
quite different, which was fathered by Lord
Cecil and by Colonel Requin of the French
Delegation. It took into account the necessity for security, something that was demanded by every. nation that felt that its
existence depended to a certain extent upon
the disposition of its neighbours. It was proposed that assistance should be given to any
nationality which was attacked, or threatened
with attack, and that such assistance was to
be guaranteed to it, under the French plan,
by neighbouring countries mutually agreeing
that if an aggressor attacked a neighbour country they would come to its help and thereby
guarantee its security. Of course that assistance should not be available unless the nationality demanding help should have assented
to a reduction and limitation of its armaments.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would the right
honourable gentleman allow just one question? When he says "assistance" What kind
of assistance does he mean?

third committees-two of the six grand conmittees of the Assembly-undertook the drafting of a proposai that should be in advance

with one representative of every nation in
each committee, assisted by a special committee of twelve experts chosen by the
League, set to work, and after serious consideration in the Assembly itself and in the
committees came to certain conclusions. The
first of these was that security was an absolute
essential and precedent to disarmament, and
that it was futile to ask nations that might
be the subject of attack to limit or reduce
their armaments unless continued security was
assured to them. Security thus became tied
up with disarmament, and yen had the two
words of the motto, "Security and disarmament." " Give us security," they said; " disarmament may follow."
But a third consideration now came to the
front, and that was the principle of arbitration. The difficult question of how te determine the aggressor was raised. In the case
of a threatened war or an actual attack, who
was to say which was the aggressor nation,
and consequently which nation was to suffer
the penalty of any united action for the
protection of the threatened nation?
In the discussion that followed Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and M. Hériot came to an
agreement that another principle should be
added, so to speak, and that the motto for
disarmament and the limitation of armament
should be: " Arbitration, security and disarmament."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

And that in order to make possible [he success of the whole movement a campaign must
be organized in favour of arbitration and conciliation as a preliminary. So there came to
the front a third element, which ever since
has been one of the dominant elements entering into whatever progress bas been made.
The result, in short, was that the first
and third committees, along with the twelve
members that had been added, came to a
unanimous conclusion and drew up what is
known as the "Protocol for the Pacific Settlement cf International Disputes." The Draft
Treaty for Mutual Assistance started out
with a denunciation of aggressive warfare as
a national crime. The protocol took the same

arbitration, and bound the members of the

It was still-born.
It was revived

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It provided for the outlawry of war; it provided for compulsory arbitration, backed by
sanctions, of all disputes not settled by
mutual agreement, by the Council or the Perrmanent Court of International Justice; it
provided for the definite determination or the
definition of the aggressor-a very important
point-and for the application of the economic,
financial and military sanctions authorized
by the Covenant. The decision as to who
was to be the aggressor, and as to how he
was to be defined, resolved itself into this:
the power which refused to arbitrate before
it attacked was plainly the aggressor and was
to be so defined. The great point in the
protocol was in relation to the sanctions or
penalties. They are called sanctions in these
treaties; in reality they are penalties for the
violation of the obligation of the members of
the League.
The protocol was unanimously agreed upon
by the Fifth Assembly in 1924. What happened? The Labour Government in Great
Britain suffered a mishap and went out of
office and was succeeded by a Conservative
Government; se, when the Council met in
December of that year and undertook the
examination and application of the protocol,
they were met by a demand from the British
Government for a delay to enable it to
examine the question thoroughly for itself
and in connection with the various dominions
of the Commonwealth. That demand could
not well be refused, and was not refused. At
the next meeting of the Council the British
Government presented its objections to the
protocol, and these objections were fatal to
its acceptance and immediate practical application.
What were the two prevailing
reasons? The imposition of the penalties for
infraction of the terms of the protocol involved
a resort te blockade. Great Britain was the
principal naval power, and in any attempt to
make a blockade effective the British fleet
would be eventuallyHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:-in the fight.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:the main force responsible for the successful

accomplishment of the blockade. But there
were some nations that did not belong to
the League, and included in those nations was
the great republic to the south of us, possessing
vast commercial interests and a powerful fleet
to safeguard them. Great Britain felt that it
would be too great a risk for her to become
ultimately responsible for the sanctions and
in this way probably run foul of the interests
of the United States of America. Had the
United States been at that time a member of
the League and in the same general frame of
mind as the other members, that question
would not have arisen, because Great Britain
and the United States would have had a
common policy. Anyone who has carefully
read the diplomatie correspondence between
Great Britain and the United States during
the war knows how very close the two nations
were to coming to blows. Those who have
read Mr. Page's book will remember his reference to an incident that occurred when
Anglo-American relations were so strained that
there was a question whether armed conflict
would not be declared between Great Britain
and the United States if the British Navy
seized another vessel, which was endeavouring to carry certain commodities from America
to enemies of the Allies. At that time Mr.
Page said to Sir Edward Grey: "Do not attach
another vessel, but let the French do it; then
observe what will be the effect upon the
United States." The French took a vessel
and the United States said nothing. The
bond sealed by Lafayette was still in force.
Of course, the United States, when it came
into the war, was very active in making the
blockade effective.
Great Britain made a proposal to this effect:
"Let us have regional agreements, if possible,
and let us call a world armament convention
to be attended by representatives of every
nation. whether a member of the League or
not. If an agreement could be reached at such
a convention it would be easily made effective."
Well, the protocol was disposed of, and as
a sort of reaction there followed the regional
arbitration and safety agreement provided for
in the Locarno Pact. The agreement for
mutual assistance on the part of Great Britain
and Italy resulted in a settlement of the
then impending uncertainty upon the western
border, and the application of the same principle in other agreements put an end, for
the time being, te troubles on the eastern
border as well. The Locarno Pact opened
the way to a general series of arbitral agreements and treaties between various countries
belonging to the League, and a strong endorsation was thus given to the principle of
arbitration.

-In 1926 Gerniany entered the League of
Nations. This event was of great significance:
it meant not only that praetically all the
enemy countries were now members of the
League, but also that Germany, a very
powerful nation, had been disarmed and consequently was, as it still is, emphatically in
favour of the limitation and reduction of
armaments in every other country.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Because Germany
is not allowed to have an army itself.

proved of by the League and were combined
into what is known as "the General Act for
the pacifie settlement of all disputes." We
shall have that General Act before us for
our approval. Already it has been ratified
by all the other British dominions, as well
as by Great Britain and France, and, I think,
by some seven or eight other nations. In
fact, it is felt that it will be adhered to by
all the important League members.
Another great forward step was made in
1925, when the League Assembly authorized
the formation of "the Preparatory Commission" for the preparation of a draft treaty to
be submitted to a world disarmament convention. Members of that Commission have
been experts in political, social, economic,
financial, military and naval matters. The
point was taken by the Assembly, at the
time the Commission was authorized, that
no treaty for the limitation and reduction of
armaments merely by the members of the
League could be thoroughly effective so long
as any very powerful nations remained outside the League. It was recognized that as
long as the United States and Russia are
not members it is problematical whether perfectly satisfactory final disposition can be
made of the question of armament reduction.
Therefore the object of the League is to get
a draft treaty prepared by representatives of
all the nations, whether League members or
not, and then have the convention of all
nations. The Preparatory Commission continued at work and in the month of December, 1930, it submitted its completed draft
treaty. The 2nd day of February, 1932, has
been set as the date for the opening of the
world disarmament convention. The agreement on this draft treaty by the representatives of the fifty-four nations in the League,
plus the United States and Russia, is a unique

event in world history; I ain sure that the
story of mankind reveals no other such
development. From now until the convention
meets the draft treaty will be considered by
all the nations whose representatives took
part in its preparation. The success of the
efforts of the League towards armament reduction in the last eleven years will depend
to a very large extent upon what happens
at that world convention. Therefore it becomes our duty to arouse interest in the
great event and stimulate public opinion
everywhere to support favourable action on
the part of the government of every country.
As we look upon it, there are many things
that tend :to a successful culmination of the
long years of effort. I do not say that the
work of that convention will be final. Rather
do I think that the action taken in February,
1932, will be a decided advance upon the
present, to be followed by other succeeding
progressive action until the full objectives are
finally achieved. But so much progress has
been made that I do not think any fair-minded
man can criticize the League of Nations on
the ground of undue delay in the prosecution
of the great object for which it was instituted,
namely, to bring all nations of the world into
common agreement to settle their disputes
by recourse to methods of peace and justice.
The work of the League has been greatly
aided by a number of subsidiary events. For
example, there was the Naval Conference at
Washington in 1921-22, attended by representatives of severail European nations, the
United States, Japan and China. At that time
there was initiated a program for limitation
of naval armaments in the construction of
large vessels, but for the time being smaller
units of naval warfare were necessarily
ignored. That again was succeeded by the
Coolidge convocation of naval powers at
Geneva in 1927, which proved abortive in the
immediate practical result, but was useful in
arriving at a better understanding of the conditions of the varions countries and the possibilities of future agreements. We had the
culmination of these efforts in London in
January, 1930, when France, Italy, Great
Britain, the United States and Japan met in
conference and came to certain agreements
which practicadly, not only actually reduced
existing naval armaments, but set a limit of
construction and put a stop to any competition in naval construction which threatened
the world. Just a few particulars with reference to that remain to be settled among
France, Italv and Great Britain at the present
time, and I have not the least doubt of a successful conclusion to their efforts.
Right

Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

I thank you very much for the kind attention that you have given me. It is always
difficult in so extensive a subject to hit upon
ust the line to take and the amount of information to give. I conceived that it would
be very useful at this time to have as nearly
as possible a consecutive idea of the various
steps that have been taken, the success that
has attended them, and the mighty and fateful decisions which will be made when the
unique and hitherto unequalled situation
develops of having representatives of all the
nations of the world meeting together in the
atmosphere of peace and goodwill to remove
from the world the menace of war and the
burden of the cost of military armaments,
which to-day are weighing down the nations
of the world. Do not let us think that we in
Canada have. no interest in the matter. If
we have economic and financial difficulties
to-day-and we have-after all our search
for the subsidiary causes. we must recognize
that the fact that the Great War of 1914-18
sapped the resources of the world is the root
cause of all our difficulties. Do we find it
hard to sell our commodities? Yes, because
the world was impoverished by the war and
bas not the means to buy. Have wo immense
burdens of taxation? Think of the $50,000,000
imposed upon us in taking care of the human
casualties of the war. Think of the huge national debt incurred in the operations of the
war. Is that no burden? As has been so
often asserted, and so infrequently contradictcd, if we had had a League of Nations in
1914, we should have had no such destructive
war. 'lie future binds most closely together
the interests of nations. It is impossible ever
to revert to the conditions of years ago, when
a war might take place between two nations
or half a dozen nations and the rest of the
world bc comparatively free fromn
its influences. Now a great war will involve the
interests of the whole world and the existence
of civilization. Here is an opportunity. If
the nations will, they can agree to put a stop
to increasing armaments which threaten war,
and they can give sustaining power and virility to the peace sentiment of the world. Canada bas taken an honourable part in the work
of the last eleven years, and we are deeply
interested in the final and successful solution
of this question. Let us pray that the nations
of the world may have wisdom to make a
proper choice and cone to a proper agreement and rid humanity of the burden and the
cruel barbarity of settling disputes by the
mutilation and destruction of our fellow men,
and the costly waste of the accumulated
resources of individual and national wealth.

MAY 6, 1931
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourabie
members, it is always a great pleasure ta
listen ta our venerable member, the right
honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster), who, in
spite of advanced years, has the vigour and
the ideals of youth. The belief that there
shall be no more war on earth is a beautiful
ideal. I wish I could be like the right honourable gentleman. It is wonderful that people
can be saturated with such ideas, because
according to the Good Book, when there were
only two men on earth, Cain and Abel, they
rnanaged to make war, and one of thern was
killed. And as we go on down the ages what
do we see? War after war.
As to compulsory arbitration, how can you
have it unless there is someone with guns
and bayonets and a navy to enforce it? These
ideas are ail v'ery well. My leader (lion. Mr.
Dandurand) encourages them. I should like
to be able to believe in them myself, but
after ail, it is against common sense. Lloyd
George has said repeatedly that we arc spending more money on armaments now than before the League was thought of.
The idea of a league of nations has flot
even the merit of being new. The Chinese
had a league of nations thousands of years
bcfore Christ. We had the Holy Alliance, and
l'Union des Princes Chrétiens. Nothing has
ever corne of ail the taIk of peace except war.
Bring people together ta talk of peace and
you will generate war. If people are brought
together, especially women, a row starts right
there and then, I am sorry ta say.
The League had everything nicely arranged:
Lt was going ta enforce peace through sanctions.
But there was no sheniff. What is a court
without a sheniff? What can a judge do without a sherjif ? He might as well sing while
he is on the bench, unless he bas a sheniff
ta execute his warrants. And if the sheriff i8
resisted he must get the police. Why do we
spend so much money on police? If municipal
police are necessary, 50 are international police,
and the big navies and armies are the international police.
AIL the nations, especialiy Germany, say:
"We are quite willing ta give up aur armies."
It reminds one of the f ox that lost his tail
in a trap and then wanted ail the other foxes
ta get rid of their tails. They said: '<Turn
around until we have a look at you," and they
laughed at him, and -decided to keep their
tails. Germany is not allowed ta have an
army, but just as sean as she is allowed she
will have a big one, and there will be a
chernical and aerial war.
If nations do net want ta arbitrate, haw are
yau going ta compel them ta do so? When
it was proposed ta use force, what farce was

there? There was the Britishi Navy, if you
please, paid for by the British people, or the
people of the Empire. Why should they pay
for a navy ta make sorne people at the'end
of the earth do this or do that? Austen
Chamberlain saîd: "There cames a time when
an Empire must say fia." And he said no,
and that was the end of that proposai.
My right honourable friend spoke with
great eloquence about the pratocol, but he
did not tell you that it was stiil-born. There
was aise the Kellogg plan, and Mr. Kellogg
and Mr. Aristide Briand went around asking
everybady if he would like to sign. Everybody signed. Nabody wants war. Neyertheiess, war carnes, and it wiil continue ta
came in spite of ail the taik.
It is net my intention ta make a speech
on this 6ubi ect. I may have occasion ta do
s0 before the session is over. When I hear
of the League of Nations I always think of
wbat the Right Hon. Charles Doherty once
told me about l'Abbé Saint-Pierre, who had
invented a league of nations in the tirne of
Henry IV of France. L'Abbé Saint-Pierre
brought the volumes cantaining his proposais
te some cardinal who was acting as a prime
minister, and he said: "I arn bringýing you my
project for universai peace." I may say ta
honourable gentlemen that this work is in
the Parliamentary Library, in some sixteen
volumes, and tbey are so well bound that
they are in good condition. Perhaps they
have net been used very much. As I was
saying, the author went ta His Erninence and
left his wark with h.im, and later he went
back ta him and said: "What do you think
of my project?" The cardinal repiied: "It is
perfect; I couid net add a word to it, or take
a word from it, but it is made for angels, not
for human beings."
That was the end of
l'Abbé Saint-Pierre's sixteen volumes. The
last volume, which was published twenty years
after the first one, contains a résumé that I
wauid cornrend ta the righi honourable the
junior member for Ottawa. He knows French
well enough ta be able ta*- read it, and I
hope that after ho has read it ho wiil stili
have bis illusions and will still believe that
ne mare seldiers are needed and that France
will net build any more ships. L'Union des
Princes Chrétiens was even better than the
Abbé's project, because, in addition ta other
th-ings, it ivas designed te keep the royal
farnilies on the thrones of Austria and France.
If the people of one country rebelled against
the king, the ot-her country would interfere
on bis behaîf, corne in and say "No."

still. It steams forty miles an hour, and carries the most powerful guns.
Why was it
built? To go to Geneva? No; it could not
get into the lake there. It was built for real
war. Are the people who are spending money
on it insane?
I notice my honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) sitting opposite me.
I hope we shall hear from him. I am not
going to read his pedigree again. I did that
when he came into the House, and it took
an hour to do it. He is a historian, and lie
can tell you about l'Abbé Saint-Pierre. The
honourable gentleman always keeps a straight
face when he speaks to me on that subject,
but I find it difficult to think that he believes
in l'Abbé Saint-Pierre. He will tell you what
Sir Robert Borden said: "Ten years ago you
were talking of disarmament; you are still
talking of it." I agree with Sir Robert that
no progress has been made.
Why should this meeting that we have
heard about wait until 1932?
There is no
better time than the prosent. When it does
take place the result will be the same as
always: the delegates will adjourn again. I
am sorry for the poor people living at
Geneva. Hundreds of them are shaking in
their shoes every time there is an Assembly.
They heave a sigh of relief when it adjoures,
for, they say, "We shahl draw our pay now
for another twelve months." They are always
afraid that the League will break up. Now
there is some talk about making these people
permanent so that if the League does break
up they will get a pension.
I have not added up the figures given to
me in regard to the amount of money that
we spend on the League of Nations, but I
should like any honourable gentleman in this
House to show me that we get one dollar's
worth for all the money that we spend on
the League.

thinks the League of Nations will be unable to
prevent war in the future, and he bases his
opinion upon the fact that for hundreds o
years unsuccessful attempts have been madte
to establish peace through the medium of an
international tribunal. But he forgets that in
the past nations lived by themselves, that
each country considered the interests of its
reigning family to be paramount, that the
common people were looked upon more or less
as mere cannon fodder and were ordered to
fight for reasons which they never understood.
The great Louis XIV confessed in his last
days that he had loved war too well. We are
reminded by Voltaire that Le Roi Soleil would
not cross the Rhine "parce que sa grandeur
l'attachait au rivnge."
But he allowed his
people to die for the satisfaction of his passion
for war. Now conditions have changed and
ordinary people, who have much more power
than they formerly had in controlling the
destinies of their own country, want to know
for what cause they are asked to shed their
blood. Furthermore, there has been developed
a close relationship among all nations, and
those who speak in the forum of the League
of Nations can be heard all around the world.
I say to my honourable friend that the League
will live, because of awakened public opinion.
If my honourable friend were right in contending that there is no ground for believing
that the time will come when human beings
will no longer be sent out to kill one another,
I would say, "All right; let us prepare for the
worst." The honourable gentleman feels that
the wars that are yet to come will be more
terrible than any that have happened in the
past, and that they will result in wholesale
destruction; yet he would have us fold our
arms and do nothing to prevent such catastrophes. I am glad to think that he is the
only sponsor for such pessimism in this
Chamber, and perhaps in the whole country.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend was informed yesterday, in reply
to an inquiry, that Canada had spent altogether $2.280,000 on the League of Nations.
How far would that go towards building a
dreadnought? I think it is a very small sum
to have spent upon the League.
My right honourable friend from Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster), in telling
us of the work that the League has donc.
stressed its efforts for the reduction of armaiients. Article 8 of the Covenant of the
League says:

MAY 6, 1931
The Members of the League recognize that
the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point
consistent with national safety and the enforcement by Borne common action of international
obligations.
The words "consistent with national safety"
nie extremely important, because they give
expression to the necessity for security. Gerniany, Austria and Hlungary were forced by
the Treaty of Peace to disarm. Germany was
allowed to have an army of one hundred
thousand men, and at the time the treaty was
made it was declared that there would be a
general reduction in armaments in ail countries.
Naturally Germany is 110w insisting that other
nations shaIl reduce their militlary and naval
powers s0 that she will not be kept in such
a comparatively weak state. But who is to say
just what force is needed to guarantee the
safety of any nation? Apparently on this
question ecd nation is its own judge.
In 1924 1 had the honour of representing
Canada at the League of Nations. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald came there with a speech
to which he had given mucli thouglit, and
before lie spoke lie informed the representatives of the Dominions what lie intended
ta say. His theme was compulsory arbitration and disarmament. 1 took the liberty
cf telling him that the Assembly would not
agree to his recommendation; that the nations
of Europe would.object to compulsory arbitration and disarmament without provision
for what they regarded as ample security. My
opinion was the result of thc experience 1
had gained from contact with the representatives of European countries. Mr. MacDonald made his speech, in whidli lie urgcd
that there should be reduction of armaments
after all nations had agreed to compulsory
arbitration. But afterwards lie had bis eycs
opened by the speeches of threc or four off
the most brilliant representatives of the
Assembly. I remember Mr. Politis, the representative of Greece, as clear a thinker as
could be found in the Assembly, turned to
Mr. MacDonald and said, in effect: "I shall
submit for your consideration a hypothetical
case. Suppose I were representing a country
o:f ten millions of people engaged chiefly in
agricultural pursuits. Adjacent is a highly
industrialized counmtry of fifty millions. You
ask me ta sign an agreement obllgating my
country to arbitrate in the avent of a dispute
witli another. Than you advisa my country
ta disarm, and after we have donc s0 wc
wake up ane morning ta find ourselves invnded by an army of 200,000 men from across
the frontiar. Our people are agriculturalists;
tliay are unprepared ta rasist sucli aggresslon.

57

Wliat would you do for my country than,
Mr. MacDonald?" Similar arguments were
made, in a varicty of forms, by other representativas, and as we left the House at six
o'clock Mr. MacDonald said ta me, "I must
accept the trio-compulsory arbitration, security and disarma-ment."
Now, the protocol was draftad on those
lînes, as my right honourable friend has
pomnted out, but there is one feature that he
did not mention, namcly, that in the event
of an international dispute, if one nation
refuses ta arbitrate, it will be regarded as the
aggressor. If ýtroops sliould clash somewliere
far away from Geneva, where it was difficult
ta ascertain wliat country was thc aggressor,
an armistice would ba declared and the troops
would be requirad ta raturn ta thair respective
frontiers. If one country refusad ta compiy
in this matter, it would be declarad the aggressor. It seems ta me that the document
clearly provided for determiing which
country was the aggressor in any dispute.
As my riglit honourable friend lias painted
aut, the protocol affirmad the principle of
one for alI and ahl for one. Thare was great
disappointmcnt when the protocol was disIn tha following year Mr.
pensed with.
Austen Cliamberlain suggested regional agreements, and the Locarno Pact was brouglit
about and peace was established on the
Rhina. Great Britain was accepted by France
and Garmany as an arbiter, and in the evant
of a war it would assist the country that lied
been assaultad. At the time an agreement
was mada at Locarno betwcan the Central
and the Eastern powers, but tiare was no
arrangement for seourity or arbitratian. France
will support Paland in the maintenance of
the trcaty in the Eaut. If tiere were an
attack by ona of the Central Powers, let us
say Germany, upon Poland or Serbia, France
would go ta the dafenca of the attacked
country, and then there would arise a question as ta what effact, if any, the Locarna
treaty would have.
In 1928 the Briand-Kellogg Pact was signed,
providing for the renunciation of war by ahl
cauntries. Aithougli this document undoubtaly lad a great moral influence througliout
the world, there was nothing in it ta guarantea
national sacurity. In 1929 Mr. Ramsay MacDonald did what Sir Austen Chamberlain, as
a membar of the Baldwin Govarnment, refused ta do; that is, lie signed the Optional
Clause, binding Grat Britain ta submit ahl
justiciable questions ta the International
Court off Justice. In 1930 Mr. MacDonald
wcnt a step farthar and signed tlie General
Act, which obligated Great Britain ta arbi-

trate other questions. As my right honourable friend stated, this was a long step forward, for the great nations in declaring themselves ready to submit all their differences to
the International Court put themselves on a
level with the smaller and weaker countries.
Mr. MacDonald presided at the London
Conference on the Limitation of Naval Armament in 1930. At that time Great Britain
and the United States agreetd on what was
practically naval parity, but Italy and
France would make no such agreement, although Mr. Briand strove hard to have it
arranged that Great Britain should be the
arbiter between those two countries on the
Mediterranean.
Mr. Briand pleaded that
Great Britain, on account of its influence at
Gibraltar and Malta, should agree to act as
arbiter, and he said that in such event France
would be ready to reduce its naval armaments
to a very considerable degree. Although perhaps Mr. MacDonald was personally disposed
to accede to Mr. Briand's suggestion, unfortunately lie did net believe that public
opinion in Great Britain was ripe for the
assunmption of the responsibilities involved.
Mr. Briand then asked the United States to
agree to a consultation in the event of trouble
arising in the Mediterranean. There was considerable opinion in the United States favourable to an agreement of that kind, but no
official action was taken, and therefore no
security was provided. As I have stated, Great
Britain and the United States agreed to practical parity. They felt that they would be
strong enough to protect themselves. So far
their respective navies have been for the defence of their own countries and intereststhat is to say, for their own security.
Last Monday the President of the United
States, feeling perfectly safe in North America, offered the following advice to Europe:
President Hoover, speaking at the opening of
the sixth conference of the International
Chamber of Commerce, to-day told 1,000 leaders
of business in 35 nations that the present world
economic depression was comparable in its depth
and extent only te those which have followed
about the saine distance after the former great
w ars of modern history.
The President suggested as a means of reducing the tax burden of the world limitation of
armament. He pointed out the world expenditure on arms is now nearly $5,000,000,000
yearly, that there are 5,500,000 men under arms
and 20,000,000 more in reserves, vast forces
exceeding those of the pre-war period.
The President said: "Reduction of this
gigantic waste of competition in military establishments is, in the ultimate, of an importance
transcendent over all other forms of economie
effort."
How can that reduction be accomplished?
My right honourable friend expresses the hope
that in 1932, at the meeting for which diligent
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

preparation is now being made by the various
nations of Europe, we may attain a certain
reduction in armaments generally. But I would
put this question. If the land forces are to
give those countries possessing them the
same measure of safety that the United States
demand on the sea, what is the reduction
to amount te? Does it not occur to Mr.
Hoover that, although strong navies for defence may satisfy "sacred egotism"-to use
the expression of a former prime minister of
Italy-they go no further. Those to whom
the Almighty has given power should use it
to help the weak. The two great navies, if
dedicated to peace, can assure peace. It is
not sufficient to say: "We are secure on the
sea; let the land powers shift for themselves,
or so reduce their armaments that they will
no longer be a menace te one another." I
suggest that that is bad policy, even in a
material sense, because it may result in chaos,
and then the United States may have to intervene as they did before. It seems te me less
costly and more humane to endeavour to
prevent such a condition.
The President of the United States says:
Reduction of this gigantie iwaste of competition in military establishments is, in the ultimate, of an importance transcendent over all
other forms of economie effort.
It is unnecessary for me to emphasize the high
degree of economic interdependence of the nations of the world. The President of the
United States has but to say the word-if the
American democracy will allow him to do soand this virus of which he has spoken will be
for ever removed. He admits the necessity
of co-operation. Will he not say the word that
will assure the world of peace? A mighty
responsibility rests upon the United States of
America. One word from the lips of their
President, approved by the Senate at Washington, would most certainly insure the success of
the conference of 1932. All nations are now
at work studying to ascertain the lowest level
consistent with national safety at whiclh they
can place their armaments. One word from the
powerful country te the south of us would
enable those countries to fix their minimums
50 per cent lower than otherwise they would
be disposed to do.
Before closing I desire to make a brief
reference
to the projected Austro-German
Customs Union. Germany apparently has
thought that this union with Austria would be
advantageous from an industrial or commercial
point of view. We know that Austria bas a
population of 6,600,000 people, engaged mainly
in industrial pursuits. Austria having lost a
numîber of its provinces wrhieh were agricultural in character, more than one-quarter of

future war must partake of the nature of the
war of 191448, with increasing instruments of
destruction and consequently a greater destruction of the human race. For my part,
if that is to be the future of the human race,
I think it would be much better that it should
be annihilated in the next war. Then, at all
events, we should have peace.
My particular purpose in rising is to mention something that is, perhaps, a little apart
from the subject under discussion. It is to
say that I think we owe a very great debt
to those who bring such questions as this
before us for discussion. There has been a
great deal said recently, in the press and
elsewhere, about the Senate having nothing
to do. We all know how we were annoyed
somewhat at being called here to meet for
five minutes, only to adjourn bocause we had
nothing to do, and at having to wait for the
House of Commons te send us certain legislation that it was not ready to present. There
is no reason in the world why we should wait
for the House of Commons. Even if we cannot make some arrangement with that House
whereby more legislation can be initiated in
this Chamber, the whole world is before us.
Never before was there a time when there
were so many interesting topics of discussion.
Why should we not discuss them here as they
are discussed in the other House? In that
House private members rather prize the
privilege of being able to present matters that
are not properly the subjelct of any government legislation. Only the other day a member advocated a plan for economic and
scientific research, and made a very interesting speech on the subject. My honourable
friend to my right (Hon. Mr. Hughes) has
made a motion of a similar character, askirig

hardly imagine two countries better fitted to
exchange their wares than Germany and
Poland. Why has Germany felt it desirable to
enlarge the markets of Austria and at the
same time apparently forgotten Poland? It
seems to me that the representatives who are
shortly to meet in Geneva in connection with
the Economic Union of Europe-an ideal suggested by Mr. Briand-might well consider the
advisability of Germany offering to Poland,
Hungary and Roumania, all agricultural

to what extent France, Italy and other countries could adapt themselves to such a condition, but I see there the possibility of the
Economic Union making some headway. Those
countries to the east are in great need of
markets for their agricultural products, while
in Central Europe there is a highly developed
area which, it seems to me, would benefit by
drawing into this Customs Union such countries as I have mentioned, to which it could
sell its wares. This would tend also to
minimize the frontiers of Europe, which in
every direction are an eyesore, and it would
perhaps create a more neighbourly spirit and
make for peace in Europe.

SENATE

instead of being left to perform the humble
function of occasionally putting on the
brakes? As a matter of fact, the ýprocedure, it
seerns to me, puts the cart before the horse.
It is generally supposed that deliberation
should precede action; but we find that the
action takes place in the other House and
that afterwards we are supposed to deliberate,
and that we are able to give but very little
time to that deliberation.
During a similar discussion in Great Britain
there was one newspaper-I think it was the
Westminster Gazette-that in speaking of the
fonctions of the House of Lords said that it
ought to be not the second Chamber, but the
first Chamber; that is to say, that its business
was to make inquiry into, and deliberate upon
and discuss public matters, and in this way to
lay the ground for legislation. That seems to
me to be a very useful -object and one to
which this Chamber might very well address
itself, thus removing frorn our consciences the
uneasiness that we feel at spending so very
little time in discussing public affairs.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I rise only to make an observation
with regard to the remarks just made by the
honourable member from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Lewis). It is perfectly true that some of the
questions that would corne before this House
would be academie in the sense that they
could not immediately be carried into legislative effect by anything that we could do.
We have not the power of originating money
bills, and much legislation involves the expenditure of public moneys. That limitation
on the scope of our activities gives a more or
less academic appearance to whatever we
may do.
During the time that I have been in this
House, it has on many occasions organized
committees which have conducted valuable
inquiries into important subjects referred to
their attention. I hope that our intellectual
curiosity or our desire to do something useful
is not less to-day than it has been in the past.
So far as I am concerned, I shall welcome any
suggestion from any quarter of the House,
or any individual member, for the appointment of a committee to deal with any subject
of present or possible usefulness in the conduct
of the public affairs of this country, always
with the understanding that under present conditions there must be a limitation of the
expenditure. The expenditure for the purpose
of clerical assistance and reporting ean, doubtless, always be arranged for.
I frequently have been disappointed to
observe that some of our members, at all
events, seemed more reluctant than I should
have expected to participate in the discussions

Mr. LEWIS.

of the House. They seemed rather to anticipate the shortening of our daily, weekly,
and other sessions. There are in this House
many members who possess at least as much
experience as any member of the other Chamber. It seems to me that we have here an
accumulation of very valuable legislative
experience which could be frequentlv used for
the benefit not only of Parliament, but of
Canada as a whole. Honourable members will
find that I shall always be ready to arrange
for and facilitate, as far as I can, discussions
on public matters, whether they seem to be
purely academie or of a character which can
be dealt with best by action through committees.
Hon. CAIRINE M. WILSON: Honourable
senators, in listening to the speeches that have
been made on the League of Nations, I could
not help being struck by the fact that many
phases of the League's activities were not
mentioned. Ras the League net done much
to prevent the spread of disease, to regulate
the hours of labour and otherwise to improve
working conditions, and, above al], to protect
the lives of women and children in many
lands? Is not a great deal of credit due to
the League in connection with the rehabilitation of Austria and Hungary? I could mention
many other splendid achievements by the
League, had I prepared myself to speak on
the matter.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX:
Honourable senators, although I had not intended to
express an opinion on the merits of the subject that bas been under discussion this afternoon, I feel that I am sufficiently well in
touch with the trend of public opinion to be
in a position to give my utmost support to
the views so eloquently expressed by that
venerable statesman, the right honourable the
junior senator for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster). I desire also to express
concurrence in the remarks made by that
veteran diplomat, the honourable member for
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). Someone bas suggested that a discussion like this
is purely academic. I beg to differ entirely
from that view, for I feel that there is no
more practical question before Canada and
the worl.d to-day than the establishment of
permanent peace among all nations. How can
it be said that in discussing the best means
to ensure world peace for the future we are
discussing an academic subject? Ten million
young men, the flower of the world, were
mowed down during the Great War. Of this
number more than sixty thousand came from
Canada. They sleep abroad, in regions where
trenches were dug and fierce fighting took
place. Should we be faithful to the motives

which impelled those young men to take up
arms in 1914 for the causes of peace, justice
and hu.manity, if we were now to be so unminidful of tiheir sacrifice as to say, "Another

with it in the best way we can"? I think,
hon-ourable senators, that we are in duty
bound to give our support to that great institution, the League of Nations. That is
why I risc, though withaut preparation, toi
make these few remarks. I wish in my first
speech in this honourable Chamber to deelare
my enlistrnent in davour of the League of
Nations.
As the right honourable the-junior member
for Ottawa has stated, the causes of the
present industrial crisis, the end of which unfortunately is not in sight, can be traced
directly to the war whicha raged from 1914
to 1918. How, then, can we say that it is

to prevent a recurrence of such a war in the

him express such views, and I hope that he
may soon corne to a better appreciation of
the League. As we heard ini the historical
sketch that was given to us thîs afternoon
by the right honourable the junior member
for Ottawa, the establishment of the League
was one of the conditions which. the Peace
Commissioners insisted upon in their deliberations at Versailles. More than a decade has
sînce gone by, and in my opinion it is due
to the efforts of that great institution at
Geneva that there have been in that tirne
no military activities more serious than some
rurnblings in the Balkans and the present civil
war in China.
Honourable senators, 1 support with ail my
heart the position taken by those who stand
by the League of Nations.
What hetter
means can we devise for preventing wars than
those means which it advocates? The plain
people of this -country, the farmers and the
industrial workers, are in favour of the League,
because they know that if there were another
war they would be seriously affected. They
know that to-day better than they ever did
before, for they are aware that, as I have
already stated, the causes of the present
crisis can be assigned directly to the late
war.
Shahl it be said that those who fought and
died so valiantly for Canada and for the
cause of justice and humanity will not be

De Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) said that
attempts to abo]ish war had been made in
China thousands of years ago. Similar attempts were made by the Arnphictyonic
League in Greece, by l'abbé Saint-.Pierre, and
during the middle ages. But these facts show
conclusively that the best minds of hurnanity
from time irnmernorial have been engrossed
vith the idea of establishing permanent peace
in the world. I arn not a prophet, but I
say that if the League of Nations were
disbanded we should soon witness a revival
of jealousies and conflicts on the same scale
as they existed up to the close of Ihe late
war.

advent of a new era in the annals of humanity,
and that for ail tirne to corne people will

expressing the opinion of the people of the
country when I say that this honourable body
can do no better than support the principles
of the League of Nations, and that we are not
wastîng tirne in expressing our support. Both
parties in Canada have looked upon this
question, not as a party issue, but from a
broad, humanitarian viewp oint, and the best
minds of our country, in both parties, have
been chosen to represent our country at

SENATE
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN CANADA
DISCUSSION

AND

INQUIRY

Hon. J. J. HUGHES rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
and the Government to the world-wide depression that now exists, and to the serious economie conditions in Canada, and will enquire
what action, if any, the Government intend
to take to remedy these conditions.
He said: Honourable senators, presumably
the members of this House have been appointed to their positions because of their
age and because of their experience in their
various callings, and once here they are supposed to be largely free from party political
bias; therefore they should be able and willing to give useful service to the country in
the management of its public affairs, and in
the guidance and direction of public opinion.
Hence the Senate, as I sec it, should, this
session at all events, give more than usual
consideration to any legislation designed to
improve conditions. There should be fewer
and shorter adjournments, and, in my opinion,
more seriousness in the performance of our
very responsible duties. To follow this course
need not add one hour to the length of the
session and would add very little, if anything,
to its cost. In fact, such co-operation with
the work of the other House might conceivably shorten the sessions and reduce their
costs. And here I wish ta commend very
strongly the editorial in the Montreal Gazette
of the 29th ultimo under the heading, "The
Case of the Senate."
Before entering upon the general statements
I intend to make. I wish to refer briefly to
some of the work of the emergency session of
last year.
During that session Parliament
voted the sum of $20,000,000 to relieve unemployment, and this sum was to be spent,
and was spent, in co-operation with the provinces and the municipalities. In this way some

$60,000.000

or $70,000,000 became available,

and was used under the direction of the Minister of Labour, who occupies a seat in this
House. It was in my opinion wise legislation
and on the whole, so far as I have heard, the
money was judiciously and honestly expended.
I have heard some complaints from Nova
Scotia, but they were, I think, in regard to
the provincial share of the work rather than
the federal. I have also heard some complaints from Montreal, but they were apparently of a minor character. Probably the
Minister made soime mistakes: if he did not
he would be more than human. When a public
man 'does his duty honestly and conscientiously
as he sees it, justice, in my opinion, demands
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

that his efforts be publicly recognized while he
is still living. This encourages other public
men to give the best that is in them to the
service of the country. Let us hope there will
be no need to repeat the vote for unemployment next winter. That would appear ta be
something very like the beginning of the dole,
which would be most unfortunate.
I wish I could commend all the legislation
that passcd at the emergency session alluded
to, but I cannot, and my reasons will appear
in my observations as I proceed. To begin
with, I doubt the wisdom of protective tariffs,
a policy to which the Government, and particularly the Prime Minister, seem to be
irrevocably committed. I know that we are
living in an age when there are practically
world-wide national protective tariffs, and
such a condition might justify us in departing
temporarily from the basis of sound economics,
just as a skilful physician may prescribe a
deadly poison, arsenic, in cases of serious illness, or a capable master mariner, caught in
a storm, may throw overboard part of his
cargo to save the remainder. But the doctor
who would prescribe arsenic as a daily food
would have few patients ta operate on, and
the ship master who would order the jettisoning of part of his cargo every time he crossed
the ocean would not be left long in charge
of any ship; so the statesman who would advocate protection as a proper, ordinary national policy would not long retain command
of the ship of state, if as much common sense
prevailed in polities as prevails in most other
things. Unfortunately, howevcr, national fears,
national enmities, national prejudices and national covetousness are oiten stronger than
national good-will and sanity. Therefore, many
men, recognizing this fact and desiring power
more than any other earthly possession, sow
the wind and allow their people to reap the
whirlwind.
Protective tariffs are not first
causes; they are the symptoms of deep-seated
maladies that are centuries old, and at least
as extensive as continental Europe and
America.
The statesmen who meet at Geneva have
tremendous problems ta face. They want to
abolish physical war, and they want, I think,
to abolish or at least mitigate commercial
wars, namely, protective tariffs; but the
national maladies which I have enumerated
stand in their way, and are lions in their
path. Physical wars and commercial wars
have much in common, and both are the result of international distrust, and the question is, How can this distrust be removed?
The League of Nations has undoubtedly been
useful and has done something towards
establishing international confidence, but its

MAY 7, 1931
progress bas been slow, and it will inevitably
continue ta be slow while the United States
of America stands aloof.
The political
machinery of the European cabinets has been
kept busy for the purpose of establishing international confidence, reducing armaments
and thus removing the dread of war. But it
must be evident that progress i this direction will be retarded by fierce international
economie aggression; for nations are reluctant
to remove political trade barriers and to becorne dependent on one another while the
fear of physical war exists. It is a vicious
circle, and the nations so far have not been
able ta, find a way out. A recent writer said:
The tragedy of the present world crisis is
that as* conditions grow worse, the reactionary
groups in each country îseem to grow stronger.
The resuit is that instead of uprooting the
policies which have been largely responsibi e for
the world's undoing, we are giving themn a new
lease of if e.
The enactment of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff
in Jane, 1930, deait a severe blow to international trade and good-will, and, in the
,opinion of m.any observers, several of them
Americans, was a great injury to the United
States. The United States has not varied ta
the extent of a dollar the debt agreement
made with Great Britain in 1923, and with
the other Allied countries later, 'while the
Allied nations have reduced by- more than
two-thirds their demands made upon Germany in 1921. The United States insists by
her legislation upon the reparation payments
being made largely in gold, which she piles
up in her vaults, and thus, so far as she is
concerned, the gold miglit as well have remained in the earth from. which it was taken.
She impoverishes her debtors who might be
her castomers, and enriches not herself. Some
day or other this gold, if it hs ever to be of
any value, will have ta be taken out of the
vaults where it is stored, and exchanged with
other nations for goods; sa the exchange
might as well have been made in the first
instance. The United States, in the opinion
of many of her own citizens, is pursuing a
suicidai policy, but while the majority of
her own people think differently other nations
can do nothing about it.
There are said ta be some twelve or fifteen
millions unemployed in America and Europe
outside of Russia, and that means thirty or
forty, or perhaps fifty, millions at or near the
borders of destitution. It is a seriaus and
threatening problem, and God knows it was
not caused by the absence of protective tarifse.
1 have mentioned what I believe ta, be some
of the causes, but there may be other causes
lying deeper still.
Now, I do flot think I arn a sentimentalist
or a dreamer, and I arn not going ta try ta

63

preach a sermon-though I do not know why
a layman in my position should apologize if
he did try. I believe in the divinity of Jesus,
and ahl that it implies, as firmly as I believe
in my own existence or in that of the Parliament of Canada. I therefore belîcvc in the
practicability and the imperishability of His

are sammed up in the Sermon on the Mount.
But the nations of the world, particularly thc
prosperaus business nations, say that these
principles are impracticable, and this idea
has largely prevailed during the hast four or

true that there are worthy rich people in the

The tragedy is all the greater bccause the
situation has resulted not from scarcity, but
from abundance. It is said that one man
attending a machine can now prod':ce as much
in a day as thirty or forty men co'id produce
fifty or one hundred years ago. This mechanization, instead of giving every one more
time for rest and the cultivation of the
higher things of life, produces millions of
paupers on one side and thousands of millionaires on the other. Greek mythology
tells us that Tantalus, King of Sipylus, was
chained in a lake of clear, sparkling water
which reached to his chin. He was dying of
thirst, but every time lie bent hs head to
drink, the water receded from his lips. His
plight was supposed to represent the very acme
of human suffering. Was it different from
what the destitute are suffering to-day? Will
it be written of the twentieth century that
the rise of the machine was the fall of man?
If it can be so written, and if the present
world situation cannot be changed, then our
civilization has broken down, and London,
Berlin, Vienna, Rome, Paris, Washiagton, New
York, Chicago, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto,
will go the way of Nineveh and Tyre.
An American writer says that before the
war he was sent by his parents io finish his
studies in the universities of Germany. He
says that the ruling classes and the so-called
intellectual classes ai that country had practically given up Christianity, that they even
regarded it as a subject scarcely worthy of
debate; and in his opinion more than half
the ordinary people were of the same way
of thinking. Their god was Mars. Him they
worshipped and in him they had all confidence. They had no place for the lowly
Nazarene or lis teaching. We kiow the
result. God is very patient, but He will not
be mocked forever; and even in our day His
word has been fulfilled. "All that take the
sword shall perish with the sword." If reports
speak truly, there are in North Anerica many
schools and universities which are nurseries of
atheism, where God is not allowed to enter.
Can we expect that if we follow Cermany's
example in this regard we shall escape punishment?
The German people bave many
virtues. They are very thorough and very
industrious, and they have done, and will continue ta do, their share of the world's work.
Perhaps the nation will be purified by the
ordeal through which it has passed.

rulers and many of the nobility of France

lier faults. She also is human. For long years
we sang "Britannia rules the waves." It was
a proud boast, and we seemed to care very
little how other nations might feel about it.
Perhaps we did not realize that great riches
and great power are very dangerous possessions if not wisely used. On the whole, however, Great Britain has been a good example
ta the world in many things. She is now
passing through an ordeal that will test the
national character as it never was testeid before, and the next few years, perhaps the
present year, will be freighted with the consideration of the most momentous questions
we have ever had to decide. Let us hope
that in the future, as in the past, no Britisher
will ever feel ashamed of the mother that bore
him.
Perhaps a glance at that incompreliensible
country called Russia might not be out of
place. We see going on in that country, before our eyes, the most drastie experiments
mankind has ever witnessed. The governing
authorities have ruthlessly suppressed private
capital in favour of a system of state production and distribution which virtually
covers all commodities. Under its five-year
plan the Soviet Government, according to its
friends, is attempting ta raise the standard of
living of Russia's millions by gradually converting the country from an agricultural to
an industrial one, and in place of the ever
recurring unemployment, the maladministration and the maldistribution of other years,
substituting an orderly method of production
based upon social needs. On the other hand,
according to its enemies the Soviet Government is inflicting upon millions of its countrymen horrors in excess of anything ever
suffered by the people of any other country
since the dawn of history. These statements
are probably exaggerated, and if we did not
know of the terrible conditions that prevailed
in Russia under the old order of things, our
condemnation of Soviet rule would be greater.
We know, however, that under the Czars official life was corrupt ta the last degree, that
the vices and the immoralities of what were
called the higher classes had so benumbed
the public conscience that the situation in
Russia had become almost hopeless. The common people had no political liberty, and
groaned under their burdens, and the Church
either condoned these terrible wrongs cr was
powerless to combat them. But can a state
church, where the head of the state is also

against officiai immorality and officiai corruption? To expect that it -cani and will, is

Makea countless millions mourn!
I now corne to our own country, Canada,
where economic conditions are far from what
we should like themn to be, though,, comparativeiy speaking, we have much to be thankfui for. A few figures will proba-bly suffice.
In one year our trade has fallen off by saime
six or seven hundred millions, the national
revenue is down by sorne eighty or one hundred millions, the gross earnings of our national1 railways are ormaller by soine forty or
fiity millions, and the gross earaings of the
C.P.R. by tens of millions. These are
staggering figures and cail for the most serious
consideration. They mean heavy additional
taxation, and large increases in the public
debt, and necessitate the strictest elconomy
in every departinent of the public service.
At the beginning of the present session the
Government told us that the worst was over,
that we were on the up grade, that there was
"marked improvement in the domestic situation because of the tariff legisiation of laet
year." But where shall we find the proof of
ail this? Surely flot in the large reductions
in the prices of lumber, fish and ahl agricultural produts-in fact all basic products.
Pious hopes and wishes are good things in
themselves, but flot very tangible assets, and
if the mai ority of our people ever came to
believe that the tariff legisiation of last year
and the proposed tariff legislation of this year
would produce permanent improvement, it
would be, I think, our greatest misfortune.
I arn quite willing to admit that it is possible to stimulate temporarily any secondary
industry, or even a group of secondary industries, at the expense of the primary industries,
but will such stimulation be to the permanent
advantage of even the secondary industries
theinselves? Last faîl or early iast winter
The Montreal Star, perliaps with the knowledge of the Governmrent, carried a series of
articles written by Mr. Normnan MoLeod,
which were subsequently pubiished in pamaph-let form. On page 20 of the pamphlet Mr.
McLeod tells us that hie had met a Frenchi
Canadian, -an expert weaver, who hsd Iived
fox twelve years in New England, but liad
ta return last year to the land of his birth

'because he could obtain no ernploymnent ini

protection lad failed ta provide employment
for tradesmen and ora-ftsrnen in the United
States-the very thing we are told it will do
in Canada. For years we have been toid ýthat
protection was accomplishing wonders in the
republic to the south; that that country owod
its undoubted prospyerity to its fiscal iegislation, which ail other nations should copy. If
there is in the world a country where prcîtecCion might work, it is the United States of
America, and for reasons that must be obvious
to every intelligent porson. Now we are told
by its advocate that it has failed tIers, but
that it will not fail here; that while Uncle

On page 19 Mr. McLeod gives a supposed
quotation from. Abraharn Lincoln. Here it is:
I know very little about the tariff, but this
I do know: that if we buy rails from Europe
then Europe has our money; but if we buy
rails in the United States, then we have the
rails and we have tlie m oney too.
And Mr. McLeod adds, "Neyer has the case
for protection been better stated."
To begin with, this statement tliat has
been attrihuted to Lincoln is hoary witl age
and infirmity, and I arn sure Lincoln neyer
made it, because it would not take an Abrab9a Lincoln to doteit its fallacy. If the
United States can makze better and cheaper
rails than any other country, or than most
other countries, tIen it should certainly make
rails and exdhange thern for something that
à needs and that so-rne other country can
make or produce botter and more cheaply
than can [he United States. By ucli an exch ange botli countries would ho benefited
and international trado promote.d. On the
other hand, if the United States could flot
make rails to advantago, it would be a wastod
national effort for that country to try to
make tîpin. If the principle of protection be
scund, international trade is wrong, and sîould
be internationally outlawod. If the principlo
of protection cannot be supported by soinsthing botter than tIe alleged staternont of
A'braham Lincoln, which Mr. MeLeod pronounced to be perfect, tIen nothing can be
said in its favour. The Star publishes Mr.

There seems to be a widespread fallacy
that to exchange goods for money-say gold
-is far better than to exchange them for
other goods, such as food, clothing, implements of production and works of art. The
United States provides an outstanding illustration of this fallacy. Trade is essentially
barter, and all trade is a good thing; it
blesses him who buys and him who sells.
Some people are terribly afraid of imports
and of a balance of trade, as they call it,
against them. But the fact is that the larger
the so-called adverse balance of trade, the
better, provided the imports are paid for
by the exports. This could be proved by
concrete examples, if necessary. When nations
go to wa.r they instinctively feel that external
trade is vital to everyone; hence they blockade each other's ports and are even more
anxious to prevent each other from importing
than exporting. Does it not seem strange
that in time of peace enlightened nations,
governed by wise, patriotic statesmen, should
to some extent by legislation do to themselves what enemy nations try to do to them
in time of war?
We were told that the Prime Minister had
in mind the passing of legislation authorizing and requiring insurance companies and
banks to use such part of their funds or reserves as might be deemed necessary in the
purchase of 4 per cent Canadian consols,
which would be used to redeem the tax-free
and other high interest bearing bonds as
they matured. This would seem to be a
thoughtful, comprehensive plan to reduce by
millions the large interest obligations which
the Government must provide for every year,
and would probably be desirable legislation if
kept within the limits of the present national
debt. We are told now that this idea bas
been dropped and that the Government will
issue 4, per cent interest bearing bonds to
meet our outstanding obligations. This will
be just ordinary financing and will save
something. But in addition to all that can be
saved in this way, as I sec it, there is need
for retrenchment and economy in every department of our public and private affairs.
Some time ago the newspapers reported
that the Prime Minister had issued an order
to the effect that in future cabinet ministers
would not be supplied with private cars; and
the public approved. Lately the newspapers
announced that no such order had been
issued. I am sorry. We now find that the
cabinet ministers will receive an annual increase of $2,000 each for the purpose of providing their own cars. Perhaps this is in the
line of economy, but I think the times called
for something better. Some time ago it was
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

announced that the Government was thinking of reducing the salaries of the Civil Service employees. I think such reduction will
have to come, but we .should not begin with
the Civil Service only. We should begin with
everybody who is receiving, directly or indirectly, any pay from the federal treasury.
This would include the Governor-General, or
at all events his office, the Lieutenant-Governors, the judges, the members of Parliament, every member of the Civil Service,
also the president and every employee of the
National Railways. Many railway men are
receiving higher salaries and wages than they
could earn in any other occupation; they are
being paid more than the traffie will bear and
more than Canada can afford to pay. In
addition, the pass privileges should be reduced; and the franking privileges, whereby
large quantities of merchandise are carried
free on the railways, particularly for the
higher officials and their friends, should be
abolished or greatly reduced. It is remarkable how fast class privileges and family
compacts grow. Furthermore, the income tax
legislation should provide for the contribution by every wealthy man in Canada of his
full share towards the public needs; and in
this connection I should like to sec the taxfree bonds issued during the war and still
outstanding, made subject to taxation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Government
should not break a contract.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Such bonds should
never have been issued. I may have more
to say on this matter some other time. These
reductions should work no injury to families
with fixed incomes, because the lowered costs
of food stuffs should enable such families to
purchase as many of the necessaries of life
then as they could purchase formerly. But
in any event, an approximate equalization
of the standard of living for all who are
willing to work will have to come. The families engaged in the basic industries are
obliged to accept low standards of living;
and, depend upon it, honourable senators, if
this country is to endure, the masses, who
produce their share of the wealth, will not,
and should not, accept a much lower standard of living than the classes. We cannot,
in my opinion, have submerged masses and
privileged classes on the North American
continent. We cannot have men and women
and little children hungry and cold in the
midst of abundance and great wealth.
At the close of the war, I believe, the
United States of America received a call to,
leadership among the nations. It heeded
not the call; it deliberately turned its face
to the wall. President Wilson may have made

"He who wiil corne after Me let 'him take

to nations as weli as to individuals; but this

lion. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourahie
senators, when one cornes Vo diacuss a question of such importance as the existing economie situation, I suppose the Vendency is
Vo confine one's thoughts and remarks Vo
conditions as they are in one's own part of the,
country. If I were Vo be asked to express in
one word the key Vo the solution of Our
present probiem, and if 1 were Vo think oniy
of Canada as that part west of the Great
Lakes, the word I would use would he
"whea V." I hiave a strong feeling that if the
prices of wheat and other farm produets couid
be brought nearer Vo, their former levels our
general economie problem in Canada would
be solved. If 1 may discuss that prohiem
from the Western viewpoint, I may he able,
as a business mean who is in contact with
agricuiturai conditions in the West, to hring
some new iight Vo hear on the siihject.
For somne months lback we have been offered
a variety of proposais for reiieving the depression, bhut I feel that insufficient consideration has heen given Vo auniu of the suggested
remed-les. In the first place, Western Canada
will always Ïbe a great wheat-raising country,
if for no other reason than that the gi-enter
part of the agriculturai areas there are suited
oniy for the raising of high-ciass wheat. Mixed
farming is noV practicable in m-any sections of
the Western Provinces. In the Canadien
Pacifie Railway's division in Uic southern part
of Alberta there is enough wheat raised in an
average year Vo suppiy ail the requirements
of the whole Dominion; that is, noV oniy
sufficient Vo feed ail our people, but aiso Vo,
furnish the seed required by our farmers.
But I wouid noV for one moment attempt Vo,
discourage mixed farming in -the West.
One of the weaknesses of Western agriculture
has heen that the Western fariners have noV
depended upon their own produce for sustenance Vo Vhe extent that they sh-ouid have;
they -have noV raised sufficient Vive stock Vo
provide the rniik, butter and meat required
hy theseselves and -their damilies. Had there
heen more mixed fsrming out there, the distress would not have been as great as it
now 15.
Let me speak of the difflculty of carrying on
mixed farming in some sections of the West.
That rejninds me Of a story that I heard in

8

of all, of enabling the farmers to sustain themselves. If the business is gone into more extensively than this, then we must insist on
high standards of quality so that we may be
able to compete successfully with the producers of other countries.
As I said at the outset, I think that Canada
will always be a great wheat-producing country, and therefore .it is important that we
should do everything in our power to bring
about a higher price for wheat. If we could
get an additional 25 or 30 cents per bushel
right now, there would be a great improvement in conditions throughout the length and
breadth of Canada. We have said, those of us
who come from Western Canada-and I am
more convinced of it to-day than ever before
-that the prosperity of the whole of Canada
depends upon the purchasing power of Western Canada. Our industries in Eastern Canada have extended during the past twentyHon. Mr. FORKE: Hear, hear.

the last few weeks. In one part of the Province of Saskatchewan a traveller met a farmer
hauling four or five barrels of water. The

or five miles away from his farm. So the
traveller said, "Why don't you sink a well on

should have to go even farther to get water."
The saine thing could be truthfully said by
farmers in many sections of Western Canada.
But if we go into mixed farming in the
West to a greater degree than in the past, we
must be careful not to over-produce. Not
long ago a statement was published by the
Dominion Bureau of Statisties ýto the effect
that Western Canada even now has a greater

eggs than the other parts of Canada have.

bilities of the irrigated land. We can raise there
neariy every kind of veget-able,. But no encouragement is given to the raising of vegetables, and there are no canneries of any
accouat in the Prairie Provinces at the present
timne. 1 feel that the Eastern Canada canning
industries should encourage that developmnent,
in ordeT that the farmers of Western Canada
might enter another avenue of agriculture and
produce somne of Western Canada's requirements in canned goods, and in order also to
create a market for the labour that we have
at the present time and always have had in
that part of the country.
Then again, we are giving assistance through
the tariff to the woollen industry, but we are
flot encouraging the woollen industry s0 far as
the raw inaterial is concerned. There is no
reasan why in large sections of Alberta and
Saskatchewan there sbould not be considerable
expansion in sheep raising. We have the very
best lands that can be found. for gra.zing sheep.
There are lands there that are suited only
for grazing sheep. Tbey are flot suitable for
agriculture, and probably not suitable for
other classes of live stock. But there is na
incentive for a man ta go inta the raising of
sheep unless he is assured of a market for bis
wool, and his iamb and mutton.
I feel that. in laoking towards a solution of
some of the agrîcultural problems of Western Canada we should think of the possibility
of developing agriculture in certain sections
along lines that will take land out of wheat
and put it into some other praducts, like those
I -have inentioned, that are required by the
people of Western Canada. I feel that if we
are going to encourage the development of
industries on the Western Prairies we must
encourage the people there who are raising
the raw materiais suitable for thase industries.
If they are goinig into the production of sugar
beets, there must be sugar beet factories ta
consume their products; if t-hey are going ta
engage in the gro'wing of vegetables, they
must bave canning factories; if they are going into sheep raising, they must be assured
that woollen mills will 1;e established in Western Canada, or that the 'mils now operating
in Eastern Canada will take their product.
These are amnong the ideas that I have, after
st.udying the problemn close at hand in my own
setotowards helping agriculture, apart from
the general extension of mixed f arming, which
is possible in certain favourable areas. It so
happene that industries throughout the country are depressed. The industries in British
Columbia, bordering the Prairie Provinces, are
ail depressed. They would not be depressed
if thc farmers of the Prairies possessed buying

69

power. I have in mind the lumber industry,
which would benefit fromn a development of
tbe kind I bave suggested. There is one industry in British Columbia and on the
Prairies, however, that is in a worse position
to-day, I think, than it bas ever been in
before, 'and the outlook of which, I think, is
af the darkest. I speak of the coal mining
industry. The outlook of this industry in the
Prairie Provinces is just as dark as it appears
ta be in, the extreme e'ast of Canada. This
is not due wholly ta the present economic depression; it is due partly ta the fact that other
fuels bave been mnade available ta the people
of Western -Canada, and partly to the extreme
mildneFs of the pa.st winter. 1 think it is
saf e ta say that the miners in the coal fields
of Alberta, at any rate, did not have more
than two days' employment a week, on the
average, during the pust winter, though the
winter is the period whcn coal is usually in
demand. The development of the natural
gas industry was probably responsible ta a
greater extent than the mildness of the minter.
The first coal mines in Western Canada were
developed by the late Sir Alexander Gaît in
the city in wh.ich I live; in fact, the city was
created because of the coal mines. There are
to-day at the doar cof the city three or four
coal mines that are able ta produce probably
10,000 tans of coal a day, and I venture ta
say that 75 per cent of the fuel used in the
city is natural gas. That is simply an illustration of what is happening throughout the
whole -of Alberta, where there is s0 mauch
natural gas--such a great waste of natural gas.
Unless some solution can be found for aur
coal problem, the coal mines of Western Ca.nada are more or lesa likely to go out of existence. Unless someone can flnd a means of
marketing, that caal economieally in those
parts of Canada where coal is flot produced,
the coal markets of the West will be limited
largely ta the rural sections of the provinces
in which they are located, because the larger
centres will be using natural gas almost exclusively in the next few years.
Now, 1 have finîshed with the observations
that I desired ta make at this time. I rase,
as I have said, sirnply ta give ta this honourable body my view of the situation as it exists
in Western Canada, and ta offer in my humble
way a solution for somne of aur problems.
Wýhile the depression is very severe in certain sections ùf Western Canada, 1 feel that
the situation is in many respecta as had ini
Eastern Canada as in the West. The existing
depression, Dominion-wide and world-wide
as it is, is proving that -each section of Canada
is dependent upon every other section, and

SENATE
that it is only by a policy that aims at
unity and national development that we can
ever solve our difficulties. We have to look
at things in a national rather than a sectional
way. I feel-and I want to emphasize thisthat the industries of Eastern Canada cannot
thrive until the purchasing power of the
farmers of Western Canada returns. We must
get down to rock bottom and try to solve
the agricultural problems of the country, and
then, I believe, our industrial and other
problems will be solved.
BANKRUPTCY BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. BUREAU moved the second
reading of Bill B, an Act to amend the
Bankruptcy Act as respects locality of a
debtor.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Explain.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: This Bill was passed
by the Senate in the session of 1929, but too
late to receive consideration in the House of
Commons. It affects only the Province of

Quebec.

Under the Bankruptey Act as it relates te
the Province of Quebec, the word "court" has
been interpreted by the Superior Court and
the Court of Appeals of that province, and
by the Supreme Court of Canada, as being the
court named, no matter where it may be
sitting, and as the Act now stands a man who
carries on business in the county of Gaspé,
should he become insolvent, could be compelled to come to Hull to meet a petition for
insolvency filed there by a single creditor,
even though all the other creditors were in
the county of Gaspé. The cbject of the Act,
I think. was to prevent an insolvent in one
province from being haled to another province,
and the word "court" meant a court having
jurisdiction throughout a province. In Quebec
our Code of Civil Procedure divides the
province intro twenty-five or twenty-six judicial districts-I am not sure which number-and determines where actions shall be initiated,
but the federal statute defines what courts
shall take cognizance of insolvency cases.
and we have no right to restrict that statute
by provincial enactments or regulations.
The object of this Bill is to prevent confusion and expense. Lawyers in the Province
of Quebec have been accustomed to initiate
proceedings in the particilar district where
the Code says they shall be initiated. Under
the amendment the word "court" would be
rcstricted to mean the court in the judicial
district wherein the debtor resides or carries
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

on his business, or, in the words of the Bill
itself, "the court of the locality of the debtor."
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The difficulty
with the Act as it now stands had been called
to my attention before. This amendment, I
fancy, will clarify the situation. Another advantage to be gained by making the proposed
amendment is that it will lessen the cost of
the administration of bankrupt estates.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

That is the object.

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Bureau, the Senate
went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-locality of %debtor:
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
Honourable senators, I move that the proposed new clause
be altered by striking out the word "Revised"
and all the words after "Statutes of the
Province of Quebec." The clause would then
read:
Il the Province of Quebec, the judhicial district wherein the debtor carries on his business, as defined by the Statutes of the Provlne' of Quebec.

The amëndment and the section as amended
were agreed to.
On section 2-bankruptcy petition:
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: My honourable friend
to my right (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) has
suggested that the proposed new subsection
shoulld be put into a little better English, and
I agree with him. I therefore move that the
word "of" in the third line be stricken out
and that the words "having jurisdiction over"
be substituted, so that the subsection would
rcad:
Subject to the conditions bereinafter specified, if a debtor coimits an act of bankruptcy
a creditor may present, to the court having
jtruriction over the locality of the debtor,
a bankruptcy petition.
The amendment and the sec'tion as amended
were agreed to.

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: We have never heard
of it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER: We
have not had notice of any resignations to
date.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No; they are
willing to serve to the end, I believe. But
so long as we have this body functioning as
I have outlined, this Bill would affect the
people only by incre'asing the directorate to
seventeen and providing that each of the new
directors, of course, should be paid $2,000 a
year. The Bill will not increase or dim.inish
the responsibility of the board, but will simply
give representation to two provinces that heretofore have been unrepresented. If a director
is worthy of appointment at all, his attendances at the board are worth $2,000 a year. It
may be that the ablest people in the country
are net appointed to the board, but it cannot
be said that this is the first public body which
has not been able to secure the services of
the best brains in the Dominion. Certainly
the men appointed from those two provinces
ought to have sema opinions as to how the
road should be operatcd as far as those provinces are concerned. For instance, the extension 'of railway lines in the various provinces
is a subject that comes to the attention of
Parliament hy way of recommendation from
the board. I know there is a latent sentiment
in the West that at times, perhaps, some
other parts of Canada have a greater voice
in regard to the actions of the board than
have the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, which are net represented. Wisely or
unwisely, a policy of construction bas charaeterized the history of this great railway since
the Government took it over, and many extensions have been built. The propriety of
extensions should be, to some extent at any
rate, within the knowledge of the member
appointed from the province in which the
extensions are to take place, and I think it
would give the people of Alberta and Saskatchewan a certain feeling of satisfaction te
know that they were represented on the board
by someone who was able te throw light on
the subject when the board mot in another
part of Canada. In that way I think the
value of the board will be enhanced by the
two appointments.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
do not wish to be understood as objecting to
the addition of so small a number of members
to the board at the salaries mentioned, but
it has been borne in upon me very strongly
that there is a lack of co-ordination, or a
lack of Government supervision in certain

matters, and that frequently the first news
that we receive in regard to enormous expenditures upon projects not strictly germane
te the construction or operation of lines of
railway comes to us only after the expenditures have been authorized and made. I
think this matter is under careful consideraition at the present time, and I hope that
as a result there will be, before expenditures
are incurred, something in the nature of a
closer supervision by the power that bas to
pay the bills. I am, and have been, in faveur
of the roaid being operated independently of
the Dominion Government as far'as that is
possible, but I do think that some method
should be devised whereby the Government,
which in the end has to foot the bills, should
have a supervisory and directory authority
in the matter of new policies and new construction.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Ail new lines,
in any event, have to reccive the approval of
Parliament. Provision for all branch lines
comes before us in the railway's a.nnual budget,
and this gives us some little control.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:. I
will come down to particulars and say that
expenditures in connection with the erection of
hotels do not come before either branch of
Parliament for authorizaýtion. Our knowledge
of them is acquired, in some cases, through
visiting certain parts of the Dominion and
stumbling upon the hotels; in other cases
through the presentation to us of the bills
after construction has been entered upon,
and perhaps even completed. The avenues
open to an enterprising manager of a great
railway are many and varied, and it seems
to me that if we have to pay the bills we
should have a little more direct supervision,
particularly over the initiation cf new projects.

the Railway Act anything authorizing the

of my honourable friend in regard to the
erection of hotels may not be very far apart.
Parliament mav not have been very keen to
approve such expenditures, but they have
been raýtified. I assume that when a hotel
involving a large expenditure is contemplated
the project surely must be brought to the
attention of the special committee of the
House cof Commons. I can only say that I
have not been present. I dare say the

either.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: No. But such projects
have been brought to the committee after the

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FUSTER:
There is evidently a distinction between operation and operations, in regard to the working
out of a railway system. To my mind it
would be impossible to work it out satisfactorily if there were interference in the way of
patronage or in regard to the process of
operating the railwav. The operation is in
the hands of the manager and bis officials;
and, having the necessary knowledge, they are
the proper persons to direct it. I do not suppose, though, that the President and directors
of the railway have power to commence the
building of a line that bas not been authorized

before us for consideration. But there are

READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the secý
ond reading of Bill 9, -an Act to ratify and
confirni certain agreements respecting the joint
use by Canadian National Railways of certain
traçls and premises of Canadian Pacifie Railway Comppany at Regina.
'He said: Ail honourable members fromi the
West, at any rate, know that both the Oanadian
National Railways and thec Canadian Pacifie
Railway have j ointly used the tracks -and
premises, including the station, at Regina. I
have a memorandum. firom the Department,
explaining that the Bill is for the purpose of
confirming and ratifyin-g .two agreements respecting the joint use of tracks and premises
of the Canadian Paciflo R'ailway Company
at Regina by the Canadian National Railways. The agreements are to be in effect for
ninety-nine years from the lst of January,
1912, and therefore require parliamentary sanction. The old agreement .between the Canadian Nort.hern Rail-way Company and tlie
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company was for
twentv years. On the 28th of January, 1926,
a supplementary agreement was entered into
between the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, the Canadian Northern Ilailway Company and t.he Grand Trunk Pacific Railway
Company, whereby the original agreement of
1912 -was macle applicable to the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Thailway Company and varied .the ternis
of payment, and the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Comnpany agreed to permit any other company or railway forming part of the Canadian
National Railways to exercise the rights
granted to the Grand Tiýunk Pacifie Railway
Comnpany, subje.t to certain variation in the
shares of costs and expenses. This agreement
was to continue in force from the date thereof
during the samne period as the original agreement of 1912, and was siibject to ratification
by Parliament. On the 5t.h of May, 1930,
an amending agreement was entered into between the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company
and the Canadian Northern Railway Company, the Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway Company, the Grand Trunk Pacifie Branch Lines
Comipany and the Canadian National Railway
Com.pany, biy which the agreement *of 1912
was amended with reference to commercial
telegraph messages, office accommodation at
the joint station, certain switcbing rights and
advertising. The object of the Bill is to
ratify anid eonfirmn those supplementary and
amendting agreements, se, as to, continue thern
in force for the 'fuît period of ninety-nine years
from the date of the first agreement, that is,

the lst of January, 1912, unless sooner terminatcd in accordance with the provisions of

other words, the Bill wouhd ýmake possible a

the Canada Evidence Act permits positive
piroof *by affidavit; that is, the issue of certificates or licences can be proved merely by
the production in court of an affidavit, based
on the books of the Department concerned
and sworn by the proper officer in Ottawa.
The amendment proposes that the same procedure may be folhowed where no licence lias
been issued. The amendment would save a

Ife said: Honourable members, this also
is a comparativaiy simple Biii. It bas arisen,
perhaps, out of certain legisiation in the
Province of Saskatchewan, or in any evant.

MAY 8,1931
that legisiation is affected by the Bill. I
happen. to have had at one time the honour
of being the leader of. a noble but diminutive
band in the Saskatchewan Legislature who
resisted, as being inexpedient and costly, certain legislation that was brouglit into that.
Htbuse for the purpose of establishîng a provincial police force and dispensing with the polieing done by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. At that time, as at all times, the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police had a reputation
which, of itself, was of infinite value in the administration of justice. However, the Bill
passed and we had for many years two forces
of police, the Dominion force looking ai ter the
enforcement of Dominion laws, and the local
force looking after the residuum of criminal
matters in the province and the enforcement
of Acts of the Saqkatchewan Legisiature.
The Province of, Saskatchewan b-as since
surrendered its force to the Dominion Government, and there are, I think, four officers
and about fifty-five non-commissioned officers
and men who will now come into the Dominion Police. This Act stipulates how they
saal be taken over and provided for. Without doubt, this will cheapen the cost of administration. In saying this I do not want
to cast any reflection on the efficiency or
integrity of the Saskatchewan police, because
I think it is important that any member of
this House or the other should be careful not
to refleet upon the administration of justice
or any body constituted for that purpose.
It bas been deemed expedient to enter into
an arrangement whereby this selected number of nmen should again become members of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

into their own body members of any provincial police force that they may wish to
sequire? Does it give themn compulsory
power?
Hon. Mr'. WILLOUGHBY, No. It is a
matter of arrangement.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL- As the Bill reads, the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police are authorized to take over any men that they may require at any particular time from a provincial
police force, whether the provincial police
are willing or not.

77

It enables
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
tbem to take them over, but it does flot
Imake that compulsory.
.Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is not the purpose of this amendment to provide for the
recognition of the provincial officers who are
being taken over, or who, may be taken over,
for the federal service?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I could flot hear
the question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn asking my
honourable friend whether the main purpose
of th-is amendment is not to provide for
recognition of prior services of provincial
police who may be taken over by the Dominion police.
Hon. Mr'. IILUGHBY: It will serve
that purpose.
Hon. Mr'. BELCOOURT:' As the Act now
stands, I do not thinýk the Dominion authorities are prevented from engaging men who
have served in the provincial police; so the
amendment is not required for the puxipose
of engaging sucli men. The only purpose
of the amendment, that I can see, is that
the prior services of members of the provincial police may be recognized when they
are taken into the Dominion force.
Hon. Mr'. WILOUGHBY: That is certainly one of the objects of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIiOOURT: 'It seems to me that
it is the only object.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is an i-mportant object, anyway.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was going to
suggest, that the federal authorities can
always eenploy any old officiasHon. Mr. BELÇ5OURT: Old or new.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -old or new
officiais of any provincial government; but
I appreciate that such legisiation as this is
necessary if upon their enlistment in the
federal force their prior services are to be
recognized by M'y of pensions. When it was
my duty to, brîng similar legislation before
the Senate I often had to rely upon my
gallant friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach), and the fact that hie has not
demurred to this legisiation, so, far as I have
noticed, strengthens my opinion that it is
worthy of approval.
Hon. Mr. LEMILEUX: Has the honoursble
gentleman any idea of the cost that this
would entail? We are .providing pensions for
new-comers.

78

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WILILOUGHBY: I have no figures
on that.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: In the early days, under
agreement, the local Government paid $75,000 a year for the policing of the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta by the Royal
Northwest Mounted Police. In later years
a local force was organized in Saskatchewan
and exercised authority. Four or five years
ago the local Government oade arrangements
with the Federal Government to have the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police do the
policing of the province. At that time it was
agreed that some of the provincial police
should be absorbed into the Dominion force.
Now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
have authority in the Province of Saskatchewan, and, I think, in Alberta as well.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Can the honourable gentleman tell us whether the Provincial
Government had a pension fund for their
police? If they had. should not the accunulated receipts be transferred to the federal
fund?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: At first a pension was
net provided for, but I think that later it was.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not intend to
oppose the Bill, but I think we should
thoroughlv understand what wre are doing.
Under this Bill pensions would be provided
in rcspect of service rendered by those men
under provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Part of the
timre tlicy undoubtedly were in the provincial
Service, but I presume that they all were
formerly members of the Dominion force.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They were in the
provincial service for a nunîber of years, and
this Bill would give them a pension out of
the federal fund in respect of those years.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: But I think that the
provincial police were responsible for the enforcement not only of the laws of the provinee, but also of certain federal laws. To that
extent, therefore, they were acting for the
Dominion as well as for the province.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Now that the
provinces have their natural resources they
should pay for their police, it seems to me.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: They are paying. Under an agreement between the Federal and
Provincial Governments the province is paying to the Dominion the full cost. As I have
already stated. the amount paid to the Dominion in the first instance was $75,000 a year;
that was when the Autonomy Bill was passed;
but I think it ,is three times as large as that
now.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps the honourable leader of the House would be willing
that the Bill should go no farther than the
second reading stage at, present. He might
then have an opportunity to get some information for us.
Hon. Mr. W ILLOUGIIBY:
Quite willing.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: The honourable
leader on the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
asked whelher the police fund of the provinces
should not b turned over to the federal
fund. J think the point was well taken. If
the provinces placed the accumulated receipts
in their general revenue account, it is questionable whether this proposed legislation is
fair to the Dominion. I suggest that the
honourable leader of te Government in this
House should make inquiries and give us
the required information before we proceed
further with the Bill.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The second section of
the Bill sys that it shall be deemed to have
come into operation on the lst day of April,
1928. I am not sure, but it scems to me that
the arrangement provided for in the Bill bas
been in force since 1928.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, the agreenct between the governments.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: As a matter of
fact, J think these men, to the number of
fif ty-two. were absorbed in the Canadian
Mounted Police force at the time it took over
the policing of the provinces. I should like to
know what happencd-what was the arrangenient-with respect to the accumulated pension
fund of the Saskatchewan provincial police.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I shall get all
the information I can before the Bill is
brought before us for the third reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perhaps that
information will be available at the committee stage.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Postpone the committee stage until the information is available.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There may be no
occasion to go into committee.
NORTHERN ALBERTA RAILWAYS BILL
SECOND IEADING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY
moved the
second reading of Bill 3'5, an Act respecting
Northern Alberta Railways Company.

MAY 8, 1931
Hie said: Honourable senators, the purpose af the Bill is ta extend for two years the
time for the commencement and completion
of certain extensions of the Northern Alberta
Railways, the construction of which extensions was authorized in 1929. The N'%ortbern
Alberta Railways Company is jointly owned
by the Canadian Pacîfic Railway Company
and the Canadian National Railway Coinpany, which hold an equal interest. As
honourable members will sce, the Bill provides that "Northern Alberta Railways Coinpany msy within tivo years froin the date of
the passing of this Act commence ta construet" and s0 on.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second turne.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Is this not the
railway that was ta be extended through
Grande Prairie and ta have an outlet in
British Columbia? Was there flot ta be an
arrangement between the Canradian National
Railways and the Canadian Pacific RailwayThe railway
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
is .îointly owned and jointly operated, as I
understand.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: But was there flot
a provision for a delay of six months in the
completion af that railway?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think the Act
does not provide that.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the third turne, and passed.
GOVERNMENT EM'PLOYEES COMPENSATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY maved the second
reading of Bill 37, an Act ta a>mend the Governinent Eîmployees Compensation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
af this Bill is ta amend the Act so as ta
make the benefits thereunder applicable ta ail
Dominion Government emaployece except permanent members of the military, naval or
air forces of Canada-for whom. provisions
are made under other statutes-and without
regard ta the departinent or branch to which
the em.ployee belongs, or the nature or dlas
of wark on which the employee is engaged.
The ameaidment also provides that compensation shaîl include any benefits authorized
under the provincial Compensation Acta. The

present Act has been interpreted so as ta exelude fromn its benefits many employees ini
certain provinces, although employees per.
forming similar duties in other provinces receive sucli benefits. The proposed Bill wil
correct this situation. The amount required
is est-imated at about $70,000 a year. A Bill
involving the same principle was endorsed last
year, but did flot find its way into the Statute
Book, it being dropped, along with other legislation, in view of the approaching general
election.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Did I understand
my honourable friend.ta give a figure as ta
the anticipated expenditure involved?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes; $70,000 a
year.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: How can that be
estimated now? This Bill applies ta the
Dominion the provisions of the different provincial enactmnents with regard ta compensation ta workmen.
Honi. Mr. WILiLOUGHBY: (Y course it
could be only an estimate. You cannot tell
what the compensation will be until the accident accurs.
Hon. Mr. BEDCOURT: And there may be a
far larger number of accidents than are anticipated. I do not sec how an estimate can be
made.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Lufe insurance
companies estimate the death rate, and
liability insurance companies make forecasts.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It would be a
pretty wild guess.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: This bas ta be
done on the same principle.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: I might add
that many Government, employees have been
covered, in case of accident, by provincial
Compensation Acts. For example, Canadian
National Railway employees on what were
known as the Government Ilailways before the
amnalgamnation were brouglit under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, and if injury or
accident occurred ta these men from their
employment they were compenwated by the
Government on the sazne basis as employees
of a private railroad were compensated.
Gradually this principle has been extended ta
other employees in the public service, and
the present Bill is ta caver those wha do
not already come under the law.
Let me give a speeific instance which will
illustrate the point and perhaps justify the
proposed action. In one af the large post

80

SENATE

offices a machinist engaged when the new
mechanical appliances for the automatic
handling of postal matter were installed got
caught in the machinery, consisting of pulleys
and belts, and was very badly injured. If
he had been engaged in an industrial plant or
on a railroad, even a Government railroad,
he would have been entitled to compensation
under the law, but because he happened to be
a post office employee, even though he was
injured in the course of duty, he was deprived
of this benefit.
The purpose of this Bill is simply to bring
in all the employees of the Government who
happen to be injured in the discharge of
their duty, just as though they were engaged
in any other industry.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not at all
opposed to the Bill. I know of a case in
Ottawa where a furnace man-I think it waî
in the Printing Bureau-was totally blinded
by the explosion of the furnace that he waa
attending, and never got any compensation,
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The figure given
as to the amount involved is surely an esti.
mate based upon the experience of the
branches of the -public service that already
come under the Act.
Has the honourHon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
able gentleman compared the Compensation
Acts of the various provinces, and can he say
whether or not they are the same? Is there
not a danger that a Government employee
in Ottawa might get more compensation for
an accident than an employee in Quebec or
New Brunswick would get for a similar accident? I am told that there is a considerable difference in the compensation allowances
paid by the various provinces.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In times past
that was quite true, as it is only recently that
some of the provinces have enacted compensation laws; but, generally speaking, the
laws of the various provinces-with the exception, I think, of Prince Edward Island,
which has no such law-are fairly uniform.
The Province of Quebec recently adopted a
workrmen's compensation law and set up machinery for its operation, and, while I do not
think it is quite on a par with the laws of
some of the other provinces, it approaches
them very closely. Under this Act an employee in the Province of Quebec would, if
he were injured, be entitled to the same compensation that he would receive if he had
been engaged in that province by a private
corporation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Has the honourable
gentleman any idea as to the number of employees who would come under this provision?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have not that
information at hand, but I may say that such
employees are not very numerous. On the
basis of the cost of operation of the Act in
relation to Government employees now
covered by it, it is estimated that the total
cost will not exceed $70,000.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: This compensation
is paid by the Dominion Government?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: So it has nothing
to do with the funds of the workmen's compensation boards of the different provinces?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In case of injury they would assess the damage, just as
they would in other cases coming under their
jurisdiction, and the Government, being the
employer, would pay the assessment.
lon. W. E. FOSTER: Do the compensation boards of the respective provinces receive any recompense for handling these cases
for the Dominion Government?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would say
that matter would come within the control
of the provincial board.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: In the case of the
employces corning under this Bill the compensation boards of the respective provinces
Io not handle any money; as I understand
it, they merely nake the assessment, and it
is paid by the Dominion Government. But
do the compensation boards of the respective
provinces receive anything from the Dominion
(Government for the work they perform? In
an ordinary case, as the Minister of Labour
knows. different classes of industries are
assessed, and if an accident occurs within a
certain class compensation is paid out of
the assessment upon that class. The cost of
administering the Act comes out of those
assessments, supplemented sometimes by a
contribution from the general revenue of the
Provincial Government. The compensation
boards are doing a certain amount of work
for the Dominion Government by reason of
the fact that they sit on these cases and
make an assessment. Do the compensation
boards receive anything for performing that
service?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I cannot definitely
inform my honourable friend as to that, but
it is my impression that in his native province, for instance, where the employees of the

MAY 8, 1931
Government Railway were brought under the
New Brunswick Workmens Compensation
Act, the Federal Government contributes the
nmount of the assessments that the provincial hoard deems necessary and. proper to
cover the cost not only of relief, but also of
administration. The existing practice, whatever it is, will ho continued, and will ho extcnded to a few more employees who are not
now covered hy the federal Act. This will
not change the situation i any way.
It would ho
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
natural to oxpoct the provincial boards to
perform. this duty wîthout extra compensation.
Whether the man is an employee of the Government or of a corporation does not make
any difference.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:- If I am flot mistaken. the compensation board in Ontario is
paid enitirely out of funds collected from the
eniployers. I think the work done by that
board is among the hast work done hy boards
of any description. The workmen's compensation legisi-ation bas been very heneficial. I
think the measure bof ore us is *also a very
good one, but I feel quito certain that within
a short time the 370,000 mentioned will not
ho sufficient to meet the requirements, hocause I know of very small institutions in the
Province of Ontario that are paying anywhere
from $10,000 te $15,000 a year. I imagine that
the number of employees included under this
legislation miust be very great, and that it
wvill increase.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Where will that
figure of 370,000 to covor accidents each year
ho -found? Will it bo found in the Supply
Bill or in the Act?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY- On what is it
founded?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend says that the sum of 370,000 is provided for.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. He said it was
the estimated cost.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -Oh, it is sinply
an estimate?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I suppose this
will militate to a certain extent aigainst -tho
business of private comparues.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: An employee of
the Government is not pre.cluded from taking
accident insurance? Is any consideration given
to the fact that employees -may be heavily
insured?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.

81

Hon. Mr. MacARTHURi: They get the
compensation. just the sarne. Somo of them
will do very well.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: They pay for it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bull was
re*ad the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Could m.y honourable friend. fix the cornmrittee stage of this
Bill for Wed'nesday next, &o that we miglit
have some time, to examine it?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Since there is to be
a postponement, .perhaps my honourable friend
could ascertain in the -meantiýmo whether the
question of the services to be rendered 'by the
provincial boards has been d.iscussed between
the Dominion Government and the provincial
authorities. Possi'bly there should be some
understanding or some agreement in regard -tu
that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: J may iniform,
my honourable friend now that the matter was
carefufly canvassed -and that there wss a conference, which I had the honour of attending,
with the miniister of another department, departmental officiaIs, and the chairmen of the
workmen's compensation boards in two large
provinces, and that this legislation is the
resuit of the agreement or understanding
reached at that time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: How many provinces were represented?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Two large provinces.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Ontario and Quebec?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Those boards
Hon. Mr. DANDU-RAND:
are maintained by the contributions of the
various large corporations that employ labour.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They are maintained by the assessments issued by the board
against the industries, and the Government
under this Act is regarded as an industry.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: In the Province of
New Brunswick we have what was formerly
known as the Intercolonial Railway. In so
f ar as our compensation board is concerned,
that railway is regarded as an industry and
is essessed in the same way as the lumbering
industry or any other. The assesmients are
intended to cover not only compensation for
injuries of employees, but also the administration of the Act from. time to time, as the
noed is indicated by the number of accidents

SENATE
in the various industries.
I presume this
legislation will work out in the rest of the
Dominion in precisely the same way that it
does in the Province of New Brunswick. We
have accepted the principle of workmen's
compensation, and it seems to me that by
this Bill we are only extending it to certain
classes that have not heretofore been included.
SALARIES BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the
second reading of Bill 38, an Act to amend
the Salaries Act.
He said: Honourable members this is a very
simple Bill dealing with the salary of the
Solicitor General.
As you are aware, and
as stated in the Salaries Act, the Solicitor
General receives a salary of $7,000 a year.
The object of this Bill is to increase his

salary to $10,000 a year and put him on a
parity with the ministers. The existing Act
assigns to theo Minister of Justice certain
functions in connection with the reviewing of sentences, and so on; and I
remember that when Hon. Mr. Doherty
was Minister of Justice he told me that
be had examined into a very large number
of applications for commutation of sentence.
Even yet it is within the scope of the Minister of Justice to examine such applications
at any time. As a matter of practice, however, Ihis most onerous duty is performed by
the Solicitor General. The scale of salaries
has risen since the salary of the Solicitor
General was fixed, and the addition of $3,000
to bring his salary up to $10,000 does not
seem unreasonable when one remembers that
at all times he is doing a most important kind
)f legal work. He is the right-hand man of
the Minister of Justice; in fact his substitute,
I imagine, in many matters.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
As I stated previously this afternoon, I held the office of
Solicitor General in a former Government.
The Right Hon. Mr. Meighen was the first
Solicitor General to bo raised to the dignity
of a Privy Councillor, and at that time the
salary was increased fron $6,000 to 88,000.
Later on, the present Minister of Justicc,
Hon. Mr. Guthrie, was also made a Privy
Councillor at the time he became Solicitor
General, and so was the Hon. Mr. Cannon,
although there is nothing in the statute that
requires this to be donc.
Every year that Mr. Cannon was Solicitor
General the sum of $3.000 was voted to him
in addition to his salary of $7,000. This Bill
provides that in future tbe regular salary
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

attaehing to the office shall be $10,000. As
the honourable )leader of this House has
stated, the Solicitor General has important
duties to perform. Not only does he have ta
look after the numerous petitions under the
Ticket of Leave Act, to which reference was
made a little earlier, but he represents tha
Crown, the -Government of Canada, before
the courts of the land. He appears before
the Privy Council in England, the Supreme
Court of Canada and other courts.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
ever do that?

Does he

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Oh, yes. When I
was Solicitor General I had the honour of
appearing in four cases before the Privy
Council; and Mr. Cannon appeared before
the same body two yoars ago in an important
case.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
But is
it not an exception to the rule for a Solicitor
General to appear in the courts?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
an exception to the rule.

It

should not be

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

But is

it not?

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
I am not sure
whether Mr. Meighen, when he held the office,
went before the Priv Cetinoil: h was not
long at the post before his great ability
earned him promotion.
But Mr. Guthrie
went over to tho Privy Council. Because part
of the time of the Deputy Minister of Justice
is taken up in appearances before the Supreme Court, he is given a higher salary than
other deputy ministers; and consideration
should be given to the value of the service
that the Solicitor General rendors in performing similar duties.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was under the
impression that when a Solicitor General was
called to the Privy Council he automatically
became entitled to the same salary as his
colleagues, and I did not know until now
that $3.00 of tho suiary was voted annually.
This Bill- will put the whole salary on a
statutory basis. I may say that I know the
Solicitor General has frequently appeared before the Exchequer Court as well as before
the Supreme Court.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read a second time.
THIRD READING
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

TerminaIs, Lim.ited, the holders of the first
mortgage bonds of both these companies, and
the Lake Superior Corporation.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY- The solicitors
for the promoters o!f the Bill came to see me
and said they wanted it to go to the Committee on Finance. I said to them, "You
mean the Raii.way Committee," and they said,
"No, the Committee on Finance." That is
aîl I know about it. Is the honourable member
from Westmoriand (Hon. Mr. Copp) confusing the Finance Committee with the Committee on Banking aud Commerce?
Hon. Mr. COPP: I thouglit the Banking
and Commerce Co.mmittee was the sanie as
the Finance Committee.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No; we have a
Committee on Finance. 1 remember the appearance before it o! somne raiiway magnates,
who made representations concerning the
Canadian Pacifie Railway and the Canadian
Nbrthern Raiilway. The committee inquired
into the subi ect and reported to the Hýouse.

Hon. Mr. C'OPP moved that the Bill be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It will have to
go to the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: 1 beg my honourable
friend's pardon, but the Bill concerns a financial arrangement and will have to go to
the Banking and Commerce Committee.
The point is
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND:
not a simple one, and we might as well
elear it up now. It is true that the Bill
deals with a railway matter, but the honourable gentleman from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Copp) has said that, as it has to do with
financial arrangements, it should be sent to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
We must consider the question carefully,
because our decision wili create a precedent.
Hon. Mr,. LEMIEUX: 1 understand froen
an advertisement that I saw in one of the
papers flot long ago that this railway is one
of the assets of the Soo industries.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Personally I have no information. I happen t-o be a room..mate of
the right honouraible senator fTom Egazville
(Right Hon. M.r. Graham), and I know that
the promoters of the Bill called -on him. Before he went away he asked me to move that
the Bill be referred to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, because it is exelusively concerned with a financial arrangement among the Algoma Central and Hudson
Bay Railway Company, the Algoma C entral

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: It seems to me
that this matter should be determined by the
Senate and not by the promoters of the Bui.
My experience. has been that raiiway bills are
sent to the Railway Committee. Should that
committee at any time report that it is unable
to deal .properly with any bill referred to it,
the bill eould then bc referred to another
committee.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I was spoken ýto about
this Bill, but I should like it umderstood that
I am not solicîting it for the Banking and
Commerce Committee, o! which I arn Chairman. That committee does not want to consider anything that should not be referred to
it. The right honourable gentleman who is
sponsoring this Bill, and who is, I think, the
new Chairman of the Railway ýCommittee
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham), said to me that
while it might'appear to ba a railwvay bill, it
was really not so, except in so far as it concerned a re-financing arrangement. He considered it to ha purely a financial bill, and said,
"'Therefore you niay expeet it to come before
your committee." A day or two afterwards, the
solicitors of one or more of the companies
interested in this re.financing-for that is
what it is--went over their proposais with
me. That is ail I know ab-out the question,
and I state it for wvhat it is worth.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think the Bill
should be sent to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce.

Hon. Mr DANDURAND: I have not a
copy of the Senate Rules at hand. I have
inquired of the Clerk of the House whether
there is any one committee to which we are
obliged to send the Bill. His opinion is that
we can send it to the Banking and Commerce
Committee if we so desire, or to the Railway
Committee. I will net object to sending it
to the Banking and Commerce Committee.
If only a financial matter is involved, perhaps
that would be the better thing to do; but that
committee may report, after hearing the
parties interested, that the Bill should be sent
to the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Will the
honourable gentleman explain why he thinks
that simply because the Bill deals in part
with financial arrangements it is a proper bill
for the Committee on Banking and Commerce?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it not the
proper function of the Committe on Banking
and Commerce to examine into financial
matters?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Every
railway bill that comes before us contains
some clause regarding finances.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Every railway
bill has some provision for the issuance of
bonds, or some such thing. I have not looked
at this Bill, but the explanations I have heard
indicate that it concerns a financial scheme
respecting two or three railways.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is true that the
Bill deals with a financial matter, but in connection with a railway. I cannot see why the
Bill should net go to the Railway Committee.
If we send it to any other committee we
shall be creating a precodent that may cause
trouble: on the slightest pretext other railways will be asking us to send thoir bills to
various conmittees.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
When an application
for a railway charter is received by this House
it is invariably referred to the Railway Committee, although every such application contains some clause referring te financing.
If later on there is a proposal to vary the
financial terms, the logical committee to consider the matter is the committee that dealt
with the original application. I notice that
section 4 of this Bill, on page 6, provides that
the Railway Act shall apply, and that nothing
in the Bill shall restrict the powers of the
Board of Railway Commissioners. Now, what
has the Committee on Banking and Commorce, or the Committee on Finance, to do
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

with such miatters? It seems to me that this
Bill should logically be sent to the Railway
Committee.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I agree entirely with
the remarks of the last two speakers. I think
the Bill should be sent to the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Most railway bills
deal with financial matters, and I do not think
this is an exception.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The purpose of this Bill
is not to provide for the financing of a railway. From what I have heard, it is a matter
mntirely for the Committee on Banking and

nothing to do with the building of lines, or
anything of that kind. The Bill simply confirms a financial arrangement made by a railway company and some other parties in regard to certain bonds. As I said before, the
right honourable gentleman in whose name
the Bill stands (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
asked me to move that it be referred to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. If
after due consideration that committee should
find it is unable to deal with the measure,
then the House could send it to any other
committee.

HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. BARNARD moved the second
reading of Bill E, an Act respecting Hospital
Sweepstakes.
He said: Honourable members, the object
of this Bill is to make it legal to conduct in
the various provinces sweepstakes of which
the profit, or portions of the profit, are to be
dcvoted to the benefit of hospitals. The
sweepstakes are to be conducted under regulations framed by the Attorneys-General of
the provinces in which they are held, and
are not to be carried on in any province without the consent of the Attorney-General of
that province.
I may say that in the Province of British
Columbia the finances of the hospitals are in
a deplorable condition. The general hospitals
there have three definite sources of revenue:
per capita grants from the Governmont according to the number of patients; municipal
grants, when the hospital is situated in a
municipal district; and moneys received from
pay-patients. The hospital in my own city,

MAY 8, 1931
in making application for further aid from,
the Government and the municipality, stated
that it was able to collect only from forty to
fifty per cent of the sujpposedly payable accounts. The resuit of su-ch a -condition is
that neaniy every hospital of any size in the
province is constantly incurring annual deficits. Heretofore when deficits got s0 large
that the tradespeople became restive and began demanding their money, the hospitals were
able to go to either the Provincial Government or the municipal authorities and get
further aid, or by making a drive on the
public to raise funds sufficient to wipe out
their deficits and start them off with a dlean
siate. Conditions to-day, however, are such
that it is practically impossible to get any
further aid fromn the municipalities or the
Governicent. Both are sorely presscd for
money. It is equally difficult to collect large
sums from the public.
The method proposed in this Bill would undoubtedly provide ample moncys to keep the
hospitals going and enable themn to function
efficiently. Editorials in certain newspapers
in reference to proposais that have been made
along the lines of this Bill have suggested
that a practice of this kind would encourage
gamhling on the part of the publie. I think,
however, that if the public want to have a
little flutter they are going to have it.
There is nothing very new in this Bill.
This Parliament has legalized betting on
horse-races, and, in fact, the Government
derives a certain revenue fromn the betting
on race-tracks. 1 have noticed also that whiie
there is a clause in the Criminal Code that
prohibits the holding of lotteries, there is an
exemption in the case of lotteries for smal
prizes at church bazaars. That is a small
matter, perhaps, but it establishes the princîple.
It is a fact well known to every member of
this House that thousands of dollars'go out
of this country every year for sweepstake
tickets. We have had the Irish sweepstake,
the London Stock Exchange sweepstake and
the Calcutta sweepstake-and I may say I
have had tickets for most of them. I can
see absolutely no reason why that money
ahould not be diverted and used locaily to
enabie our hospitais to function without being hampered by lack of funds in the good
work they should be doing.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I wish to say a word in support of this Bill. I suppose that people
with ultra-moral feelings will look upon t-his
Bill as one that proposes gaming. I do not
think the mover has any reason to apologize
for introducing it. There is nothing in the

b

Bill that is offensive to morals or religion.
It contains no0 principle that is flot 110W
recognized by law and practised by nearly
everybody. Gaming, of course, is anathema
to some people on religious grounds, and it
is anathema to others on grounds of prudence. A man may gambie to his heart's
content on the stock exchange, and nearly al
do so. There is a statutory provision which
makes margin trading- lawful, though, as
everybody knows and admits, margin trading
is plain, unadulterated gaming. Any man
may stake money in a wager on a game of
cards or any other event if hie chooses, as
long as there is no third party to profit by
it. Ail that our gaming laws do is to prohibit
a "rakc-off," if 1 may use that expression,
by a third person. No iaw that I know of
interferes with my right to gamble, my
right to stake my money on any event I
choose, unless some person or other is making a profit on the side.
What is wrong with gambling? To my
mind, to my perhaps muddled intellect, there
i5 no0 harm. morally in a man wagering anything that hie can afford. The vice in wagering is in venturing an amount that he cannot afford to lose, or the. loss of which may
cause misery to his family or misfortune to
himself.
Hospitais are most necessary. In these
modern times the cost of maintaining efficient
service ini hospitals is exceedingly high; and
when the people are called upon to pay
enormous taxes for ail kinds of things--as
they are in every part of Canada-they cannot afford to keep up the hospitals; or else
the politicians cannot afford to make them
do so.
Now, if 1 subscribe to a hospital, what is.
wrong about the hospital authorities allowing
a discount on my promise to pay? What
does the Bill mean? If they seil a thousand
tickets at $5 apiece they will have 35,000; and
if I subseribe they will give a discount, but
they will pay it on the total amount to two or
three or more persons. That is aîl it means.
They could give the discount to each person
who subscribed, or they could divide it among
those holding certain tickets. Where is the
gaming in that? I cannot see any. If I pay
my taxes promptly I am given a discount of
5 per cent. If I go in on a Monday I get
the discount; but if 1 do not go in until
Tuesday I do flot get it. Is there flot as great
an element of gaming in that as there is in
what is proposed here?
I submit, 'honourable members, that this is
a praiseworthy Bill; it should be adopted,
because it has merit; it can do nobody any

harm, and it will do suffering people much
good.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The purpose of
the Bill is to insure that November 11 shall
be observed as a holiday, so that those who
desire to engage in exercises suitable to the
day may be able to do so without interference
from their employers. Furthermore, the Bill
provides that the lth
of November shall
be known as Remembrance Day, instead of
Armistice Day, as at present. As honourable members will observe, the first clause
of the Bill provides for the repeal of sections
2 and 3 of the Armistice Day Act. I am
instructed that in the future, if this amendment is passed, Thanksgiving Day will be proclaimed by the Governor in Council, as was
donc prior to the passing of the present Act
some years ago. I understand that my
honourable friend fron Colchester (Hon. Mr.
Stanfield) has an important amendment to
offer, and I intend to move that the Bill be
referred to the Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills so that there may be an opportunity to hear witnesses, if necessary, and
thresh out the whole question.
Hon. J. STANFIELD: Honourable members, I think I should offer a brief explanation
of the amendment that I intend ta move, so
that the honourable members who, like myself,
are not on the Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills may know what I am proposing.
Honourable members who are connected with
any industry know that holidays result in
seriously reducing production. As the law
now stands, Thanksgiving Day is observed on
the Monday of the week in which the 11th
of November occurs. That micans that under
the present Act, Thanksgiving Day this year
would be on the 9th of November. If this
Bill passed, the 11th, which is the following
Wednesday, would also be a holiday, and, as
Saturday is only a half day in most industries, the employees would be off work two
and a half days that week.
Hon. Mr. POPE: And Sunday would make
it three and a half.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
What would
happen?
It is my observation that when
Monday is a holiday many employees take
advantage of the opportunity provided by
the long week-end to visit relatives or friends
who live at a distance. Now if Wednesday
also were a holiday they would say, "What is
the use Of going back for Tuesday?" The
result would be a great curtailment of production and a consequent increase in overhead costs, which, in the present conditions,
are already very high. I therefore intend ta
move as an amendment, at a later stage:
That the following be added at the end of
the Bill, as clause 3:
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

3. The holiday commonly called Thanksgiving
Day. being a day usually appointed by proclamation as a day of general thanksgiving to
Almighty God, shall whenever appointed be
proclaimed and observed for and on Remenbrance Day.
That would mean one holiday instead of two.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
the law now?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
lion. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
do not understand it.

But is that not
No.
No.
I must confess I

Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: The law at prest nt is that Thanksgiving Day shall be the
Monday of the week in which the llth of
November occurs. For example, the 11th of
November this year falls on a We-dnesday,
and the Monday of that week is the 9th.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But there is only
one holiday now.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: This Bill would
miake two.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

I know.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Section 3 of the
present Act reads:
Theli holiday comnmonly called Thanksgiving
Day, being a day usually appointed in the
msonth of October or Novemîber by proclamation as a day of gereral thanksgiving to
Alnighty Cod, shall whenever appointed be
proclainied and observed for and on Armistice
Day.
The Bill would repeal this clause. I do not
quite understand it, and I should like sorne
expianation.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Some years ago
Parliament passed a law to the effect that
the Monday in the week in which the llth
day of November occurs should be a holiday,
ta be known as Armistice Day, and that
Thanksgiving Day should be celebrated on
the same holiday. The purpose of the prestnt Bill is to repeal that legislation and to
provide that Armistice Day, to be known in
the future as Remembrance Day, shall be
kept and observed on the llth of November.
But there is no provision with respect to
Thanksgiving Day, and my understanding is
that the date for that holiday will be fixed
in the future as it was before the present Act
was passed, by proclamation by the Governor
in Council. As the honourable gentleman
from Colchester (Hon. Mr. Stanfield) says,
there will be two holidays. He brings forward a very cleverly worded amendment
which puts everything back almost where it
was before; but not quite, because under the

MAY 12, 1931
amendment which he proposes Thanksgiving
Day will be observed on the llth. of November, which wiIl be Armistice or Remembrance
Day. But I think it should be provided in
the amendment that if November il falis
on a Sunday the day foliowing shall he
Thanksgiving Day, so that the holiday may
flot be lost altogether.
I amn asking that the Bill be referred to the
Cammittee on Miscelianeous Private Bis in
order that I may have an opportunity to
receive further instructions from the prornoters
of the Bill as to whether or flot the amendment is acceptable. The basic demnand is that
the men whro so desire shall be free to observe
Armistice Day on November 11. My honourable frieud proposes to make that Thanksgiving Day as wehl, and if there is no objection to that amendment, everybody wili be
quite happy.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, peinhaps it is well to recali hrow
Thanksgiving came to be fixed on Monday.
The travelling men of Canada were unanimous in askdng that that day be appointed,
the reason being that they returned to their
homes on Friday and could remain there until
the following Monday even-ing or Tuesday
morning. Otherwise they would be sent ont
on the road on Monday morning and might
find themselves idle, as well as absent from
home, on Thanksgiving Day. I suggest that
we should not change Thanksgiviing Day from
Monday hurriedly without consulting the
travellers of Canada, who were very insistent
on the arrangement that was made. Personaily I am inclined to th-ink that Remembrance Day is important enough to have a
day tu itseif.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourabie members, first, would it not be possible to have
Remembranre Day on Thanksgiving Day?
After ahl, if there is one thiog we adi thank
the Lord for, it is the end of the war, and
what time couid be more fitting for this than
Thanlcsgiving Day? Then, on the lst of
November forty per cent -of the population
of Canada, the Roman Cathoiics, cannot work.
They have no choice, for it is Ail Saints' Day,
a feast of obligation. Couid there be a better
day on which to thank the Lord liban when
you are ceiebrating the feast of all the saints
-4St. Andrew and St. Patrick and aIl of them?
We have heari a great deal about the Bonne
Entente. Here is a fine opportunity to make
it a reaiity when ail these people are in consciience bounýd not to work. We have to close
our offices that day.
Hon. Mr. DANT>TRAND: My honourable
friend is in church the whole day.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I go there more
than the honourabie gentleman does.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: That is flot saying very much.
The honourable
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
gentleman is a bigger sinner, I suppose.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
rnember irom Coichester (Hon. Mr. Stanfield)
says very truly that a holiday in the
middle of the weck disorganizes business--and
some peopie, having celebratcd the holiday
too weil, do not turn up the following day.
But as to the lst of Novemiber we have no
choice. it ýis very bard to change the Pope
at Rome. The Anglican C'hurch also celebrate
A-I Saints' Day. On th-at day we join with
the saints in Heaven, wherc we ail hope to
go soon.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not too soon.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: So would it not
bc a good thing on All Saints' Day to, celebrate Thanksgiving Day and Remembrance
Day?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do flot agree
with my honourable friend's argument.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourabie
gentleman neyer does.
I seidom do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Here is a proposai. to alter the name of
Armistice Day to Remembrance Day, and to
celebrate it on the llth of November. We
ail know why that date is chosen. My honourable friend has mentioned the lst of
November, but if the iaw were lef t as it is,
the day fixed would fail much nearer the
1ith of November, because it would be within
the same week. In the iaw as it stands the
Governor General was deprîved of his discretion ini prociaiming Thanksgiving Day, and
Parliament expressed the desire that there
should be but one holiday, a Monday, on
which to celebrate Thanksgiving Day and
Armistice Day; and it need not be the llth
of November uniess that date fell on a
Monday. My honourabie friend from Colchester (Hon. Mr. Stanfield) proposes that
Thanksgiving Day, instead of heing necessariiy a Monday, shouid be observed at the
same tîme as Remembrance Day, on the llth
of Novernber. It seems to me that his
amendment is in conformity with the opinion
of Parliament that there should be but one
holiday, and aiso with the desîre of many
people in this country, not only returued
soidiers, that the llth of November should
be the Day of Remembrance. Until I obtain
more iight on the subjeet I arn disposed to
accept the Bill of my honourabie friend from.

VENTURA DIVORCE PETITION
IREPORT OF THE COMMITTEEDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. L. MeMEANS moved:
That the twenty-second report of the Standing Coinmittee on Divorce be referred back to
the sail cuomittee, with instructions to take
no further action in the matter of the petition
of Mary Ann Ventura, praying for a Bill of
Divorce.
He said:
Honourable members, this report deals with a case in which there are
special circumstances. Last year Parliament
passed an Act conferring on the courts of
the Province of Ontario jurisdiction to try
divorce cases, and the petition referréd to
in this report is the first one that we have
received from Ontario since then. The question that has to be decided is whether the
Senate will entertain a petition for divorce
presented on the usual grounds by a person
who is now domiciled in Ontario. There is
no doubt that we have the right to receive
such a petition and deal with it in the
Hon. Mr.

DANDURAND

Divorce Committee, just as there is no doubt
that any citizen of Canada has the right to
petition Parliament for any legal purpose
whatsoever. The jurisdiction that we conferred upon the courts of Ontario did not
take away our own jurisdiction. Another
point that is worthy of consideration is that
perhaps it is much more convenient for
people residing in the city of Ottawa, or in
other parts of Eastern Ontario, to bring
divorce petitions to the Senate rather than
to take them to the courts. The Committee
on Divorce desires to have the judgment of
the Senate on this question, and with a view
to bringing it properly before the House I
am making this motion. I should like honourable members to give the question their
serious consideration, because the issue is
an important one. It is not my desire that
any citizen should be deprived of the right
to petition this House or the other, for any
legal purpose, but I feel that one of our
reasons for conferring divorce jurisdiction
upon the Ontario courts was that this House
might be relieved of the numerous petitions
that were being filed fron Ontario. The
petitioner in the present case has been living
in Montreal for about sixteen years, but the
marriage took place in Ottawa, a child was
born here, and the husband has continued
to live here ever since. I should like to
explain that my reason for making the
motion is not to give expression to my
opinion at all, but simply to have the matter
discussed in the House.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
the petitioner live?

Where docs

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: She has been living in Montreal for about sixteen years, but
the couple were married in Ottawa and the
husband has always lived in Ottawa. The
domicile of the woman is in Ottawa, because
her domicile in law is the same as ber husband's.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Who is the petitioner?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

The wife.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Under the rules of
the court, must a divorce petitioner who lives
in Ottawa go to Toronto? Must the trial

I should like
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to know what the committee's report is.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

There is no recom-

I understand the
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
honourable gentleman's motion is an amendment to the report.

MAY 13, 1931
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No. We make a
report, but it does flot recommend the taking
of any action with respect to the petition.
We simply place ail the facts bef are the
Senate,* in order that the matter may be
pro'perly discussed.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Is the coinmittee aware of any reason why the parties
should flot have proceeded before the courts
of Ontario? Why do they corne before this
committee?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I understand the
solicitor who filed the petition was under the
impression that hie could apply to the Senate
of Canada as well as to the courts of Ontario, end I fancy hie thought it would be less
expensive ta have the Senate deal with the
case. That is the on-ly reason that I know of.
The present proposai wouid work a great
hardship on the petitioner, because she has
gone to the expense of filing hier petition,
empioying a solicitor, and bringing bier witnesses here.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What is the
hardship?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: After having empioyed a solicitor, prepared the case and
brought ber witnesses here, to be met with
the objection that she shouid have gone elsewhere. It is just a question whether this
Bouse thinks that we have any right at ail
tr, refuse to consider the petition. We have
the right to try it, and we are ready and
willing to try it, but we do not feel inclined
to -create a precedent and open the door to
ail other applicants unless the Senate instruets us to do so.
SHon. Mr. FORKE: Bas no precedent ever
been created by a case caming from any of
th-ose provinces that have the privilege of
deaiing with divorce?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
I believe that
four or five years; ago, for some peculiar
reason, with which I arn not familiar, we had
a case fromn British Columbia, aithough that
pro vince bad a divorce court. This is the
first case from Ontario since Ontario bas had
jurisdiction in divorce.
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Wben I came
to the Senate, some thirty-three years ago,
I asked my seniors of the saine faith as myself what was their tradition in regard to
divorce, and I was toid that Catholica uniformiy refrained fromn voting on such questions. As I have refrained fromn reading the
evidence in divorce cases, I have nat qualified myseif to discuss them; but academicaliy,
and beyond the question of divorce, there is

involved the right of the citizen under the
Canadian constitution to petition Parliament.
My honourable friend speaks of the legisiation th-at bas given the courts of Ontario
jurisdiction in this miatter. What applies ta
Ontario may appiy aiso to tbe other provinces, and therefore I think-athougb I do
not know that I shall participate in the vote
-tbat the Senate, before deciding the question, might weli discuss it from the constitutionai viewpoint. Ail the provinces have
their courtsHon. Mr. BEIQUE: Quebec has none.
Ail the provHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
inces but Quebec; but, under our constitut ion, that does not mean that the door of
Parliament is ciosed «gainst ail petitioners
from those provinces.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourabie members, it does not seem ta me
that the motion of the honourable gentleman
fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. M'cMeans) provides just the riglit method of coming ta a
decision on this point. If we vote to send the
report back we are asserting the opinion that,
cither as a matter of iaw or as a matter of
policy, this womýan bas no recourse here. I
do nat think that .we, a body of iaymen, arc
a very good tribunal to decide as ta the
rights of the individual from a legal or constitutionai point of view. It seems ta me that
we should refer this question to a committee
of the legal gentlemen of this Chamber, or
ta our iaw department, in order ta find out
what legai principies are involved. This is a
matter upon which aur law officers ought ta
bave sometbing ta say. If a private citizen
bas the right ta appeai ta the Crown for the
remedying of a grievance, it is rather difficul' for us, as the medium through which. he
approaches the Crown, ta say that as a matter
of poiicy we wiil nat hear his petition. I
shouid think that instead of trying ta arrive
at a decision by an ahl-round discussion it
would be better ta get this matter bef are the
legai authorities, either by referring it ta a
special commnittee composed of the legal
meinhers of this Chamber, or by asking the
Minister of Justice for his opinion on the
legal rights in the case.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: H1as not the Senate
the right ta refer a case like this ta the
Supreme Court of Canada?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Do we need ta do that?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I, think that the Senate
bas ta consider merely a question of polie>',
and that the suggestion of the right honour-

SENATE
able gentleman (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) to refer the matter to a committee
is a proper one. The committee might
examine the question whether, in view of the
Act creating a tribunal in Ontario, an application of this kind should be dealt with here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Or an application from one of the other provinces.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members, this question doos not appear to me as
it does to my right honourable friend who
sits in front of me (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster). I think that Parliament undoubtedly has jurisdiction in the matter. I
do not thinlk there is any legal question involved, though I am only a layman and perhaps should not express an opinion in that
regard. I think that the subject has the
right to apply to Parliament, and that it is
for the Senate to consider the practice to be
followed in the future. The chairman of the
committee has referred this question to the
Senate as a whole, and in my opinion we are
quite capable of instructing him in the matter.
A court has been established in the Province
of Ontario, and one of the arguments in support of the establishment of that court was
tiat the Senate would be relieved of the
necessity of hearing divorce cases arising in
that province. I think that if the door is
opened to one case the committee will have
to hear innumerable others. The question is
whether we will continue to hear cases from
Ontario or not. It is not a question of our
right. We have a right to hear such cases,
and we also have the right to say that we will
not hear them. This is a matter of policy,
and I think that the Senate as a whole is in
a position to decide it.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: I
agree thorougbly with the honourable gentleman as to the law, so far as I understand it.
The committee can hear anybody it wishes
to hear, notwithstanding the Act establishing
a divorce court in Ontario, 'or the fact that
divorce courts exist in other provinces. But
there is in this case what the layman might
call a technicality. While the petitioner technically resides in Ottawa, she in reality lives
in the city of Montreal. We do net want
to go so far as to have that woman or her
friends believe that by referring her to the
courts in Ontario we are -compelling her to
come under the jurisdiction of a province in
which she does net really reside. Perhaps
there will not be such another case in a long
time. If both parties resided in Ontario there
would be no question about sending them to
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

the Ontario courts, but the petitioner has
lived in Montreal for the past sixteen years.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: Honourable members,
the question of domicile, J think, is really the
crux of this whole matter. If by separating
from her husband and by living apart from
him for fifteen or sixteen years in a different
province this woman became domiciled in
that othor province, we should accept her
petition and proceed with the trial of the
divorce; but, as I understand the law on the
subject, the wife's domicile is the domicile
of her husband. and consequently in this case
the woman's domicile is in the Province of
Ontario. I have it in my memory tha-t a year
or two ago we debated this very question of
the domicile of a w-oman who was separated
from her husband. The law was net changed,
and the woman's domicile is still the domicile
of her husband. Under these circumstances
I think the only tbing for us to do is to adopt
the motion of the honourable senator.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
Honourable
members, I am ready to admit candidly that
I am prejudiced against divorce. It is my
idea. however, that the purpose of the legislation that we passed last year was net only
to relieve Parliament or the Senate of their
very arduous duties in connection with
divorce cases, but also to render justice. If
it had not beu demnstrated that the courts
in the Province of Ontario were better able
than Parliament to render justice to applicants for divorce, I certainly would not have
voted for the Bill. It goes without saying
that anybody may petition Parliament, but
it also goes without saying that Parliament
may cither accept or reject the petition.
We have now before us the case of a petitioner whose domicile, according to my
knowledge of the law, is distinctly in the
Province of Ontario, and this petitioner is
endeavouring te depart from the normal and
natural course of applying to what is clearly
the
proper tribunal to judge her case,
namely, the Ontario court. Last year I for
one, and, I believe, nearly all the members
of this House, agreed that the court in Ontario would be better equipped than the
Senate to render justice in cases of this kind,
because the court could dispose of questions
such as alimony, the custody of the children,
and certain other matters with which the
Senate could not deal. I am still of the same
opinion. Are we going to say now that the
Province of Ontario, with its properly constituted court, having complete jurisdiction,
cannot do justice to this petitioner? I do
not think so. It is an anomaly that the

MAY 13, 1931
autliority that makes the law sliould lie constituted -a tribunal to administer it. This
tribunal in the past, I think, lias been abused.
Wby sliould we go back to the old system?
Now that full scope and absolute liberty are
given to everybody ta obtain justice in the
courts, why ehould we ailow anyone to corne
here for wbat we ahl recognize ais imperfect
and incomplete justice? I cannot understand
sucli a proposal, and I shail vote for the
motion.
Hon. ROBERT FOIIKE: Speaking beside
the question, I want to point out the manifest injustice of the situation. If the coinplainant had been the liusband, and if lie
had gone to live in Montreal, lie would have
had the full right to corne to Parliament to
ask for a divorce. His wife cannot do so. If
this situation cannot be remedied immediately, it ought ta, le remedied in the flot
distant future, so that the wif e may have
exactly the saine privilege as tlie liusband.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The woman lias a
perfect riglit to corne to Parliament.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The husband liasHon. Mr. MeMEANS: So lias the hus-.
band.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: -if lie lives in Montteal.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Hle would have to
orne liere. But that is flot the point. The
question is: shahl the Senate entertain applications as to which there is jurisdiction in
Ontario?
Hon, C. MacARTHUR: What puzzles
me a little is this. The Cliairman of the
Divorce Committee says that there is no question about the autliority of this committeeHon. Mr. McMEANS: I cannot hear the
honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The lionourable
gentleman says that the committee can deal
with this case.
Hon. Mr. McMEAINS: Absoilutely.
Hon. Mr. MmcARTHUR: I take it that
the Cliairman of the Cornmittee would like
ta make th.is a sort of test case, in orde-r to
get a decision of the Senate as a precedent
for the future. If it were a matter cf jurisdiction or law, then we sliould have to take
saine other step than that of referring it to
a committee of the Senate. What bothers
me is tjhe situation of tlie petitioner.« Wliat
she lias done is perfectly in order. Tlie
solicitors have not made any false steps.
Under these circumstances, I do not very wel

93

see how the comniittee eau penalize the
petitioncr by refusing to deal witli lier case.
If she lias to go to the Ontario court slie
will have to pay extra costs. It seems to
me that wlien the Bill giving Ontario the
power to grant divorce was passed thle
solicitors shouId have received a circular letter
notifying them that the Senate would hear
no more cases from Ontario, so that petitioners miglit avoid incurring extra expense.
Now 1 want to correct a rtatcrnent made
by the honourable leader on this side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) in regard to
the Provincoe of Quebec being the onJy province not having a divorce court. The province that I have the honour to represent in
this buse, Prince Edrward Island, lias no
divorce court, and I think the Divorce Committee will have before it in a few days a
case from. that province, whicli will be the
second case in tlie history of Prince Edward
Island; but there is no question' about jurisdiction in that case.
I1wouild ask the Chairman of the Committee
to clear up the point as to wlietlier the
petitioner in the case now liefore us is not
going to be înconvenienced and put to extra
cost if she is obliged to go to the Ontario
court.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: 1 thouglit I had
made it clear tliat in the present case the
proposai would cause a liardship in requiring
the petitionier to go to the Ontario court,
after having petitioned the Senate, employed
a lawyer, and brouglit lier witnesses liere.
1 am surprised to liear that there is no
divorce court in Prince Edward Island. I
thouglit that there was some metliod by whicli
the Governor in Council could try sucli cases.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES~: I think the lionourable gentleman is correct.
Hon. Mr. SPENCE: May I raise a point
that lias not been touclied upon at ail? If
this womwn goes to the Ontario court she will
have to put up security for costs. It will lie
two liundred dollars to start witli, and may
'be increased.
Hon. Mr. BLAiCK: Unless it is dispensed
witli.
Hon. J. LEWI[S: This seems to be a very
popular sujectHon. Mr. McMEANS: I think tlie honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Spence) must be thinking of some other kind
of action. If the woman is domiciled in
OntarioHon. Mr. SPENCE: It is a question not of
domicile, but of residence.

94

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Perhaps my honourable friend is right.
Hon. Mr. SPENCE: Under the rules, it is
a question of residence, n-ot of domicile.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Honourable members, I
arn influenced by the expianation given by
the Chairman of the Divorce Committee,
showing that a great hardship would be done
to this petitioner if we refused to consider her
petition. I have also given thought to what
lias been said to the effect that we should be
careful nlot to create a preceedent that might
re-suit practicaily in a re.storation of the old
conditions. So I have been trying to tbink
out a plan by which both these points couid
be adjusted, and I propose an amendment
whieh, aithougli it may flot be in legal form,
wiii possibly cover the case. I mnove, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Spence:
That the report be rcferred hack to the
C'omnittee on Divorce withi instructions to prorecd witis this rase isecause of special circumnstansees.
But the Senate deciares that as a
generai rule tlis body sliould not grant a
divorce ils any case wbere a provincial court
lias j urisd irbon.
That is, the Scnate would regard this as an
exceptional case.
lien. Mr. MeMEANS: The honourable
gentleman mean-s it should flot consider this
case as establishing a precedcnt.
Hon. IL W. LI.ARD: Honourabie senators,
I a n flt a member of the Divorce Comnmittee, but I wvas present as a spectator at its
sitting this morning, when this miatter was
being discussed. For that reason, perhaps, I
amn taking more intcrest in the question than
I othcrwvise would. It seems te me that the
issuc bcfore us may be divided into two
parts: first, the authority of Parliament to
de:st witli suri a petition as the one before
us; and, secondly, thc position in which the
petitioner in tic case finds hcrself.
Now, it 'vas the unanimous opinion of the
inenîbers of the Divorce Committee this
morning that the committee had .Iîiîisdiction
to he.ar this case, and bring in a report. That
statcment bas been cenfirmed by tic Chairman of the Committee on thc floor of the
Housc this afternoon. I do flot tbink there
can ho any question as te the comnmittee's
.Iurisdliction. As I arn not a iawycr, I cannot
contribute any vaiid legal opinion. Howevcr,
the case is s0 ecear, it seems te me, that
even a layman can corne te only one' conclusion upon the matter.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mi. LAIRD: The authority te legislate in matters of divorce was given te ParlialIon. MIr. SPENCE.

ment by the British Nortli America Act. I
shall rcad a part of section 91 of that Act:
It is lscreby declared tiat (notwithstanding
anlytising in this Act) the exclusive Legisiative
Asithority of thse Parliament ef Canada extcnds
te ail nsatteis consing withsin tic classes of
subjects next hereinatter enurnerated; that is
te say:And -No. 26 cf the itemis enumcrated is
'Marriage and Divoýrce." That gives te Parliament the unquestioned rigit te deai with
matters of divorce. As honourable senators
wili remember, an Act was passed last year
conferring upon the Supreme Court ef the
Province of Ontario the power te try divorce
cases. That enactment is contained in the
Statutes of Canada, 1930, Cliapter 14, at page
199, and is describod as "an Act te provide in
the Province cf Ontario for the dissolution
and annuiment cf marriage." The rnarginal
note te section 1 of that Act provides that
"'part cf the iaw cf Engiand on Juiy 15,1870, is
made the law of Ontario"; and section 2 provides that "the Supreme Court cf Ontario shall
hav'e .iurisdictien for ail purposes ef this Act."
New, it dees neot say that the Sujireme Court
cf 0Ontarie shall have exclusive jurisdiction;
it sinîpiy ssys tbat it shahl have jurisdictien.
Therefere Parliameant bas the athority to
de:sI with this divorce position. Thc applicant
in this case complied with tic rides ef the
Scoute. She filed ber petition, paid the fees
and came before tlie Corninittee on Divorce
w'itb ber witncsses; and that cemmittoe decided te hear, and bas hieard, the os idence in
the case, and Ns paruparcd ýte make a rcemiondation.
The bonotîrable tise Chsairman cf the Cernmiittce on Divorce (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) bias

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOýSTER:
If my honourable friend wiii permit me teo
interriipt bim, may I say tbat tint was net
the point I tried te make. The question I
raisecl was wbetber tbe committee or Parliament hias tbe rigbt ýte refuse te bear a case
andi give a decisien, after the petitiener bas
appliid te this House and bas gene tirougli
tise reqtîired .prece'scs. Tbat Parliament bas
the riglit te drai with 'the case, I entircly agree.
But lias it the rigbt te refmse te give a de-

MAY 13, 1931
cision in a case like this, after the committee
has heard the petitioner and bier witnesses?
I think sucli a refusai would work a bardship.
Hlon. Mr. LAIRD: Then it is a question of
poiicy; and we do not need to refer'a question
of that kind to the iaw officers of the Crown
or to a comrnittee of lawyers. I think every
ho.nourable member of this House, whet-her
legally trained or not, is competent to -form an
opinion on a question of poiicy.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The authority of Parliament to deal witli petitions of tbis kind
wiil not be affected in any way if this House
adopts the motion made by the honourable
tbe Chairman of the Divorce Committee.
The oniy resuit tbat would follow fromn tbe
adoption of that motion would he tbe deniai
to the petitioner of lier riglit to relief, to
wbicb relief tbe Cbairman of the Committee
bas stated liere she is unquestionably entitled. Now, if she shouid bave that riglit,
wby should we say we wiii not give it to
ber?
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Tbat is tbe point.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: If sbe is entitied to
this riglit, I submit that she should get it.
Whether, as a matter of policy, this buse
sliould in future refuse to entertain petitions
for divorce from Ontario, is a different question. It seems to me that if honourabie
members are desirous of preventing Ontario
people fromn presenting divorce petitions to
tbis House, we sliould make known our
opposition to the receipt of sucb petitions,
and the Cierk could be instructed to advise
solicitors who file applications from Ontario
of the stand that we bave taken and informi
tbem tbat if they proceed witli their cases
they wiil do so at their own risk. If tbat
notice were given, the Divorce Committee
wouid be justified in refusing to hear an
Ontario case. But in this case, as tbe Chairman of the Committee on Divorce lias stated,
the applicant undoubtedly bas the riglit to
petition Parliament for relief, and I submit
tbat we have no justification for refusing ber
that right.
Hon. H. J. LOGAN: Honourabie, senators, I am inclined to agree witli the amendment, because in this case there is no question that tbe applicant lias a legai rigbt to
bave ber petîtion disposed of by Parliament.
I think upon that point ail honourable members are agreed. The question is entireiy
one of poiicy, it. seems to me, ratber* than
of iaw. for every person in Canada bas the
riglit to petition Parliament. We cannot
take that right away. May I say, before

95

going furtber, that the honourable gentleman who preceded me (Hon. Mr. Laird)
made sucli an able and astute argument that
1 think lie should be created a King's Counsel immediateiy.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: It seems to me that
if we adopt the amendment we shall do no
injustice to the petitioner ini the present case,
and at the samne time we shall be giving a
warning to solicitors tbroughout Ontario that
they are flot to bring to the Senate petitions
in cases over which the provincial court bas
Jurisdiction. Last year the Divorce Committee deait with about 250 cases from the Province of, Ontario. If we are not careltul we
may be faced again with a large number of
Ontario petitions. As far as I know, a
petitioner from this part of tihe country is
not put to extra expense by reason of having
to appiy to the court, because the cases are
tried by the Supreme Court judtges on circuit.
An ýOttawa appioant does not need to go to
Toronto, for instance, but can have bis or hier
case heard in this city. My honourabie friend
f romn Toronto (Hon. Mr. Spence) bas stated
that a deposit must be made when a divorce
action is brought in the courts. But the samne
thing is true when te petitioner cornes to
Pariament. If anything were done to create
the impression that we are stili wiihling to hear
Ontario cases, some of the judges, if they
think at any time that they are 'being overworked, may feel inciined to restriet the granting of divorces so as to en-courage the parties
to corne to the Senate. Furthermore, if we
entertain Ontario petitions here we shall bc
the means of opening up a double channel of
justice: a person wbo bas bis case tried in
the courts and fails may turn around and
petition Pari ament for relief. Therefore I
think we should give an intimation that we
do flot want any more divorce petitions from
Ontario. But I doubt that we can go farther
than tbat, so long as the iaw stands as it does.
My honourable friend who referred to Prince
Edward Island (Hon. Mr. MacArthur) wili
be pleased to know that there is a court
with divorce jurisdiction in that province,
aitbougb. it bas flot been functioning for a
great many years. If a Prince Ed'ward Island
case cornes to, us, and whe.n it does, we shali
deal witb the question.
HonourHon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
able members, I quite agree with the exposition of the law as delivered by the honourahie
gentleman from Regina (Hfon. Mr. Laird).
But whiiýe every subject has the riglit to
petition Parliament, I am not sure that it
is not quite improper for a persn to appiy

96

SENATE

to Parliament for a rcmedy which he can
get through the courts. The legal right may
exist. but the parliamentary and the judicial
practice may be entirely against it. I do
not think any Canadian would apply to the
English Parliament for a bill of divorce.
We must be careful not to establish a precodent in this case, because, owing to the
large number of communities lying on either
side of the border betvcen Ontario and Quebec, there is a possibility of many such instances as the present one occurring in the
future. So far as this case itself is concerned,
I think we might allow it to proceed, because,
as the petitioner has lived for many years in
Montreal, she may have quite naturally
thought that her petition should be made
to Parliament. Furthermore, she and her
witnesses have appeared before the committee, and I think it would be a serious hardship to force ber to take her case to the
Ontario court and begin all over again. I am
absohtely opposed to divorce, and if I thought
that by my vote I could defeat the Bill, or an
application to Parliament, I would vote for
that purpose, but, as things are, I think I
shall vote to allow the committee to continue to deal with this case.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Suppose the positions
were reversed, the wife being a resident of
Ottawa, and the husband a resident of
Montroal, and the wife wanted to have a
divorce.
Could she go to the ourts of
Ontario, or would she be obliged, because of
the fact that her husband lived in the Provinc.e of Quebee, to come to the Senate?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: It depends upon where
the parties lived at the time of the separation.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable senators,
there appear to me to be some interesting
questions, not only of law, but of constitution
and policy, involved in the issue before the
House.
I think the honourable gentleman
from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
raised an important point when he suggtsted
that although the petitioner may have a
strictly legal right to come to Parliament, it
is not so certain that parliamentary and
judicial practice warrants it. Men and women
living in Ontario applied to Parliament for
divorces because there was no court open to
them in Ontario; but now there is a court
open to them. If I have a legal claim against
my neighbour here, for example, in respect
to contract or trespass, or any other matter,
I go to a court. True, as a British subject
I have a right to go to the foot of the Throne,
or to appeal to Parliament; but in a civil
Hn. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

natter Parliament would never aream of interfering if I had the right to go to a court.
So we may very well ask, whether Parliament
should be called upon to hear divorce cases
from Ontario.
I did net intend, honourable members, to
go into this matter except to suggest that we
must remember that this Chamber is not the
whole of Parliament. We may say that we
will not receive divorce petitions, but they
may be received in the other Chamber. Then
what shall we do about it? The House of
Commons can receive petitions, just as properly as the Senate can; so we cannot settle
the matter by saying that we will not reccive
them or act upon therm.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It is settled as far as
we are concerned.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: As far as we are concerned. There is a general impression outside
of this House that the Senate has the sole
authority in this matter, whereas it has a joint
authority with the House of Commons.
Having listened to the discussion, I do net
see that a little delay would work any hardship in this particular case. The witnesses
have all been hcard. I suggest that we take
a day or two to think the matter over, and I
move the adjournment of the debate.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable members, I am net going to discuss the legal
question. Apparently we are ail satisfied in
that regard. I rise only for the purpose of
explaining the vote I am about to give. My
practice, like that of my co-religionists in this
House. has been to refrain from voting on
matters of this kind. I am going to vote for
the amendment because I want to be consistent with my past attitude, and because I
find in the amendment a declaration on the
part of this House that would have the effect
of reducing the number of applications for
divorce.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The answer to the
question I asked shows me that wornen are not
on a parity with men in this matter. They
have not the same right. I thought they had,
and I should like to have the privilege of
voting to give thom that right.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable
members, I am net interested in divorce cases,
and never have been, but I am interested in our
constitution, and I am afraid that if we take
the step that we are invited to take, we shall
be violating the British North America Act.
The Chairman of the Divorce Committee very
fairly stated this afternoon that he was con-

MAY 13, 1931
vinced that Parliament had jurisdiction even
in this case, but he wanted to know whether
the hearing of the case bef are his committee
would be creating a precedent.
Last year, when a speciai Act was passed
estabilishing the riglit of the courts af Ontario
to hear divorce cases, what was given ta the
petitioners for divorce was only an alternative. The law has been vcry ably stated by
my honaurable friend fram Regina (Han. Mr.
Laird). Notwithstanding the Act of last year,
there is no doubt that under the constitution the Dominion Parliament, which is the
grand court of the nation, stili lias jurisdictian ta hear divorce cases, and I arn afraiti
that if we invite people ta evade this court
when seeking relief we may be ignaring the
British North America Act. What impels me
ta speak is the fact that my gaod friend the~
member for Ottawa (Han. Mr. Belcourt) said
that he would vote in favcur of this amendment. H1e lias always stoad for a strict interpretatian of the British North America Act.
If we ignare the Act on one major point we
may be thereby establishing a principle of
jurisprudence by which other riglits would be
infringed. I think this is a very dangerous
inove, and, as has been stated, the matter is
so important that we cannot settie it offhand. I would support a reference ta the
Department of Justice, aur law officers, or
a committee composed of the best legal
minds of the Senate, in order ta ascertain
whether the precedent, if created, is binding
f or ail time.
In canstitutional matters a
precedent is always dangerous. I would eall
the attention of the Chairman of the Cammittee ta that point. Suppose parties to a
divorce case are informed that in the future
they wiil have ta apply ta the courts of
Ontario, or ta the courts of some other province, that can oniy be f or the time being.
Other senatars wUl came here-unfartunateiy
senators are flot immortai-and this newly
estabiished jurisprudence mray weli be set
aside. Ail this goes ta show that the suggestion of the riglit honourabie the junior member for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE
HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
REPORT OF

SPECIAL COMMITTEE

presented, and
Hon. Mr. BARNARD
moved concurrence in, the report of the
Special Committee to whom was referred
Bill E, an A-ct with respect to Hospital
Sweepstakes.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable nembers, I have heard the motion made, and the report has been read, but
I have not been able to catch a single word
of it. As no very great hurry is necessary,
and as we have got along for a number of
years without this measure, I suggest that
probably the fair thing would be to take it
up in a little more leisurely manner, after the
report is spread upon our Minutes and
honourable members are given time to think
it over, and opportunity to understand what
kind of legislation is proposed and what the
effect of it would be. I am quite sure that
my honourable friend does not wish to railroad this proposition through the House.
When the Bill came up the other day T
had not an opportunity of looking at it, and
I doubt that five per cent of the members
of the House had read it through. I was
somewhat surprised, therefore, when it passed,
in about fifteen or twenty minutes, almost te
the crucial stage of the third reading. I have
not much doubt that if it had not been that
His Honour the Speaker of the Senate thon
rose to put a motion te the House, the Bill
would have been read the third time. That
is a rapidity in legislating which I do not
think it is advisable for this House to sanction, and my plea to-day is that this report
be spread on our minutes so that we may
have a chance to think over the inatter, ani
so that the country may have a chance to
consider it; for there are people outside of
this House, as well as in it, who are intercsted. In this way, when we come to
grips with the niatter, we shall be informed
with regard to it and shall have an opportunity of canvassing it thoroughly amongst
ourselveos.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: I think, honourable
members, that where amendments are made
to a Bill by a conmnittee to which it has been
referred, members of this Chamber should at
least have an opportunity of reading them
and knowing what they are. I am quite sure
that the majority of the members of this
Chamber have no idea what changes are
recommended by the committec, because they
cannot bear what the Clerk reads over in a
net very loud voice. Furthermore, to pass
such amendments when the report is brougbt
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

in is contrary to the rules of the House. The
rules require that a certain time shall intervene so that members may know exactly
what it is they are asked to vote for. For
that reason, as well as for the maintenance of
the rules of the Senate, I think it is only
right that this report should not be adopted
before the next meeting of the House.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I am quite agreeable, honourable gentlemen, and would suggest that the report be considered to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that it is the intention of the honourable the
leader to move the adjournment of the
Senate until next week. If that is correct,
I suggest to my honourable friend that he say
Wednesday next. The interval would give us
an opportunity te reach an opinion on this
very important matter.
I confess that I have net yet made up my
mind as to the principle contained in the Bill.
Some thirty years ago I waged a successful
fight in this Chamber for the passage of a
Bill to curb games of chance, in the form of
lotteries, and by that enactment such operations were reduced. Now my honourable
friend brings in a Bill which he suggests will
be of great assistance to a number of our
hospitals. I do not know why he did not
inelude other charitable institutions. I should
like to think the matter over before we deal
further with the proposed extension of a
practice that I tried to curb thirty years ago.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Unfortunately the explanation given by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Barnard) does
I have some very decided
not suit me.
opinions on this proposed legislation, and
owing to the fact that I have to go away
to-morrow and shall not be returning before
Tuesday, I would ask that, as a fair courtesy
to one who has been a member of this honourable Chamber for some considerable time.
my honourable friend will fix, say, Tuesday or
Wednesday of next week for the further consideration of the matter.
Hou. Mr. BARNARD: I shall be quite
happy to mcet the wishes of the right bonourable gentleman, and I move that the report
be placed on the Order Paper for conidcratien on Wednesday next.
The motion was agreed to.

REGISTRATION B3ILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READINGBILL REJECTED

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN moved the second
reading of Bill A, an Act respecting the
registration of ail British and alien subjects in
the Dominion of Canada.
Hie said: Honourable senators, I may say
that I had nothing to do with the drafting
of this Bilh; it was drawn up in wbat shouhd
be the Law Clerk's department. I do not
know whether 'honourable members are aware
that at present the Senate lias no Law Cherk,
but only someone acting in that capacity.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Who is lie?
1 do not even
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
know his name, but 1 think it is Mr. Larose.
1 do not know whether lie is a lawyer or
not. I should hike to d!raw the attention of
the Government to the fact that it would
be a good thing to have a ]awyer in that
department, because it is very difficult for
a hayman to draft bills. This Bill was drawn
up at my request, but it was just the opposite
of what I wanted. It was described as a
Registration Act. Welh, that name is not
22112-7à

particularly savoury throughout Canada,
especially in the Province of Quebec, and 1
thought that my hf e was in danger. But 1
arn not nervous about it. This is a short
Bill respecting identification by means of
cards or cerUficates. The Governor in Council would be empowered to make ail the
necessary regulations.
I may say that a voluntary system of
identification by means of cards, a copy of
which I have here, is in force in the city of
Montreal at preisent. For many reasons I
cannot give to the House a frank and complete statement of the necessity for a Bill of
this kind, and therefore I should hike to see
the Bill sent to a committee. It could be
understood that honourable members are flot
endorsing the principle at this stage. Whihe
the House is in open sitting I do nok want
to enter into a detailed discussion of the
Bill, the obi ect of which, I think, wihh be
chear to honourable members who have read
sosne of the Bohshevist documents. In papers
that were seized at the time the Arcos Building was raided by the British Govcrnment,
Canada was described as one of the hest
codntries in which to start a worhd revohution.
I have here a copy of the document, iicluding
a diagram, which any honourable member
may see. I have already spoken to the
honourable leader of the Government in this
Chamber (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), and, if lie
is agreeable, I should hike to have a special
committee consider the Bill and hear witnesses. 0f course the committee could, if it so
desi-red, give the Bill a nice littie funeral, but
I think the members of the committee would
receive some ver>' vahuabhe information, such
as I wouhd not dare to mention to thse Bouse.
Suffice it to say that in 1929 there were 4,419
direct agents of Moscow working in Canada
every day of the year. The Dominion has
been divided by these people into nine
sections, extending from the Maritimes to
British Columbhia. In Ontario aIone there are
131 unions, most of which are in the southern
part of the province, but others are in the
mining district, in Timmins and places of
that kinil: whihe others again are in the
Thunder Bay District. 1 feel it would flot,
be in the public interest to give these things
too much publicity if we are going to take
action.
Honourable senators should bear in mmnd
that these agents have had many years of experience in their work. They know just how
to proceed to interrupt the telegraph service,
to dynamite bridges, to destroy our railroads,
and so on. But perhaps I am saying too much.
I repeat that honourable members couhd provide that they were not adhering to the

100

SENATE

principle of the Bill when voting for second
reading.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I cannot understand
why the honourable member wants all the
information. What is the object of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the honourable
gentleman will allow me, I shall tell him
privately when the House has adjourned. I
expressly stated that I did not wish to explain
publicly why a measure of this sort is urgently
needed. If the Bill were referred to a committee, honourable members would be able to
decide in a short time whether we should
pass legislation along this line. I think it is
only a stone or a brick in the wall of the
citadel that we shall have to build as a means
of protecting ourselves against world revolution.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: The honourable gentleman who is sponsoring the Bill has
already showed it to me, and I am familiar
not only with its contents, but with the object that he has in view. So far as I am
concerned, I am quite agreeable that this
House should strike a committee for the purpose of investigation. It seems to me that
the expense incurred would not be very great.
I quite agree with the honourable gentleman
that the hearings would have to be in camera,
for evidence in a matter of this kind could
not be given openly. Of course, I am net
trying to prescribe what the committee should
do, but am simply indicating what I think
would necessarily be donc. The committee
would be the judges of that, however. It
is not my intention to make further remarks
at this stage, but if the honourable gentleman
will, as he suggested to me, nominate some
honourable members for the committee, I will
name some others.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
senators, the honourable gentleman has indicated what has impelled him to bring in this
Bill. Many countries in Europe use the livret
d'identité. I am not sure of the correct name
of the document, but I know that in a number of countries on the continent everyone
carries an identification book, which he is
required to produce to the police on demand.
I do net believe that there is any such systen
of registration in effect in Great Britain, and
of course we have none in this country. My
honourable friend bas said that the city of
Montreal tas made a start with something
of the kind. I can sec that there would be an
advantage in having such a registration of
people in our towns and cities. Montreal is
growing past the million mark, and it and
other cities of Canada are at times invaded
Hon. Mr. CASGRALN

by criminals of the worst types from the
United States. For example, when gunmen in
Chicago or New York find that the police
are malking too strong a drive against them,
they are apt to come across the border and
engage in bank robberies, holdups and such
crimes in this 'country. Undoubtedly the
police would find their work facilitated if
they were able to demand from every person
of whom they were suspieious a card showing
his identity. I think if everyone were required to carry some such form of identification there would be an improvement in peace
and order throughout Canada. The only objection that I can sec to making a law of
this kind applicable to the whole country is
that people in the quiet and peaceful rural
sections would b inconvenienced. This is my
difficulty. If we limit the application of such
ai law to towns and cities. we shall not be
properly safeguarded under the circumstances,
because People can always claim that they
have come from a rural district, where the
legislation would not be in force. I am prepared to examine this legislation with an open
mind. I sec the object that my honourable
friend has in view. but to the reasons at which
ho has hinted I would add the desirability of
keeping out fly-by-night visitors who surreptitiously enter the country somewhere along
the three or four thousand miles of border
that separates us from the republic to the
south.
Hon. R. LEMIEUX: Honourable gentlemen, is net the Immigration Department doing practically that sarne work? Any foreigner
comring to Canada is obliged to give his name
and nationality.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Does that include
the gunmen from Chicago?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:

They are foreigners.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

They come here.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I am not opposed
to hiaving this Bill referred to committee. I
think it may help the police of the country,
especially in the mining districts and in the
larger cities such as Toronto, Montreal, and
Winnipeg. But the trouble I sec is this. It
is difficult enough to convince people not
only in the back sections of the country, but
in the more thickly populated parts, that
they should answer the questions put by the
Already I have received
census officials.
letters about this Bill. People are asking me
what is the matter with the senaïtor from De
Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)-is he thinking of some conscription bill? The danger
is that this Bill might facilitate blakckmail.
It would be very awkward for a man who

MAY 13, 1931
does not happen to have his identification
card in his pocket to be brought to the police
court and sentenced perhaps to a fine of $20
or to a jail term of thirty days. In that
respect this is a dangerous Bill. It should be
amended if it ever goes to committee. I
rnay tell the honourable gentleman that it is
quite a task to convince the people of Canada of the necessity of everyone registering
and carrying an identification card to prove
his British citizenship.
The Bill is directed against undesirable
foreigners. The regulations of the Immigration Department provide for such cases, and
they are very stringent. Besides, the Dominion police, the provincial police and the
municipal police are well informed in regard
to the activities of foreigners. Some two
years ago my honourable friend-and I have
the highest regard for him and for his informant in these matters-showed me some
letters. I went to the Department of Justice
te inquire whether the Government knew of
the activities of the Reds in the West, and
to my surprise I found that they already had
a full report about the Communistic movement
in Western Canada. I repeat that I have
no objection to the Bill going to the committee. Nevertheless, it contains dangerous and
questionable features, such as the liability
that a fine of $20 or a sentence of thirty days
in jail may be imposed if A or B or C
happens one afternoon to be walking along
St. James street without having his identification card in his pocket.
Furthermore, I claim that this work ought
to be done by our immigration officials and
it ought to be done -outside of Canada. Before boarding a steamer every foreigner
should be bound, and is bound, to produce
his identification.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman has a fine chance. His is the first
name on the list of members of that committee.

Hon. Mr. LOGAN: May I call the attention of the honourable gentleman who has
introduced this Bill to the fact that it may
be ultra vires of this Parliament?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Let it go to the
committee. We shall decide that there.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I think we should consider very seriously the question whether we
are interfering with civil righ.ts. I am inclined to think that when we compel a man
to carry a card around with him we are interfering with civil rights, and in my opinion
we should look into that question very carefully before spending further time on the
matter.

101

Hon. ROBERT FORKE: I think that
this Bill would'be very unpopular from the
Atlantie to the Pacific. It seems to me that
we are becoming a little hysterical on the
subject of Bolshevists and Communists. There
are in this country very many good, lawabiding people, which makes it pretty certain that our laws will be lived up to. This
is the first time in ten years of parliamentary
life that I have been asked to endorse a Bill
that was so mysterious that it could not be
explained on the floor of the House. If the
Bill is necessary, why should we not get full
information as to what makes it necessary?
I do not believe in this idea that there is
some mysterious thing that is going to overtake us. If there is, let us hear about it.
What is the danger? A few Communists
may sometimes talk wildly, but as long as
they continue to talk in public I think there
is not much to be feared from them. Most
honourable gentlemen have been in Hyde
Park, London, as I have been, and have
heard such people talking. The police protect them, and let them talk if they want
to, and that is the end of it.
I think we are making far too much of the
Communists in Canada. I had an opportunity of witnessing in Winnipeg a Labour Day
demonstration and parade in which six thousand unemployed took part. I watched the
faces of those men as they passed. There
may have been a sprinkling of Communists
among them, but I may tell you, honourable
gentlemen, that after watching them I was
overwhelmed with sorrow' at the condition in
which they seemed to be. They were haggard, badly dressed, and seemed to be underfed. Let me say in all seriousness, lhonourable gentlemen, that there is our problem.
I think I have said in this House before
that if you give a man a job and a home
the Communists may talk all they like and
they will never do him any harm. I do not
think there is any necessity for this Bill to
go to committee.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: May I ask whether
a great many of the men in that procession
were not brought into this country when the
honourable gentleman was Minister of Immigration?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I admit that many of
them were foreigners.
Perhaps foreigners
have more difficulty in getting jobs at the
present time than our own people. These
men did not look to be at all dangerous.
I saw one man carrying a baby-haggard, ill
fed and badly clothed. I am not objecting to the Bill going to committee, but I
think that we are making too much of Communists in Canada.

[02

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have put the
honourable gentleman's name on the committee. I think he has an inkling as to where
my information comes from.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
This is getting to be very intriguing. This is
something new. A Bill is introduced by an
honourable gentleman, with the very best of
intentions, because he possesses information
which makes it imperative for him, in pursuance of his public duty, to bring in the
-Bill. I give my honourable friend full credit
in that respect. But here is my difficulty. I
am asked to vote for the second reading of
the Bill, and consequently to give my support
to the principle contained in it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No. I beg the right
honourable gentleman's pardon. I said the
second reading need not commit us to the
principle of the Bill.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
My honourable friend gives me absolution,
but, after all, when a Bill is given the second
reading there is an impression that we are
in favour of its principle. I am told that if
I knew all that my honourable friend knows
I would raise no objection to the Bill. That
may be, but in view of the fact that I am
asked to approve of the legislation and to
help it forward, step by step, because of information which cannot be imparted to us,
I find the responsibility a rather heavy one
to assume.
The Bill involves important consequences.
Under its provisions it will be obligatory upon
overy citizen of this country, of a certain age,
with some few exceptions, to register under
some system which is supposed to provide
suficient information to safeguard the country
from evils that are real, or that the promoter
of the Bill supposes to be real. It seems to
me that there is a different way of accomplishing what is desired. We have a Government
that is responsible for the maintenance of
law, order and justice in this country. Why
should not the information that has been
referred te bo laid before the Government,
or, as is donc in periods of great stress in
Great Britain and in most other countries, be
placed beforo not only the Government of the
day, but also the Opposition, in order that
law, order and justice may be maintained?
It seems te me that if certain fortunate individuals possess an under-stratum of information of which the rest of the people are
not aware, and that information indicates an
impending peril, it is the duty of those individuals to lay the matter before the Government and place upon it the responsibility
of taking such measures as are necessary to
Hlin. Mr. FORKE.

insure peace and order. If the information
which my honourable friend has is correct and
weil-founded, I cannot conceive of the Government rejecting a proposal te examine into
it and te take such steps as are considered
necessary te meet the situation. The Government can call in the leaders of the Opposition and confer with them te decide what
measures are necessary. I do net know that
we have in this country any secret service
fund, but the steps that I have spoken of
could certainly be taken, and I should think
they would be taken if the basis of the information were found to be correct.
If yen go te Paris or some other European
city yeu will find that everything about you
is written down, made a matter of record,
and placed in the hands of the police. I can
see how in the city of Montreal, maybe in
the good city of Toronto, or perhaps even in
the city of Ottawa, such information might be
useful te the police authorities.
I am not entirely free of a sense of the peril
in which Canada stands to-day. As I look
over te the United States of America and
sec what is taking place there in regard te the
administration of law and justice, I realize
what a force and power commercialized,
organized and wealthy violators of the law
have become in the carrying on of their operations, and I am net entirely free of an
apprehension that they may cross the border
and invade our cities. The Government ought
te be alive to this peril; I am not sure that
it is net; but if private citizens have information which is not possessed by the Government it is their duty te place that information
in the hands of the Government.
It is difficult for me, however, te understand
how I am te support legislation that puts
burdensome restrictions upon the people of
this country, without first having complete
information as te the necessity of an inquisition into their private lives, or the necessity
of their registering with some authority and
carrying credentials with thern at all times
in order that they may avoid all sorts of
trouble and expense and vexation. Think of
the inconvenience te which they will be subjected, and the interference with their freedom of movement. Then there is the cost.
It is net going to be easy to register everybody under this Bill. It will cost a great deal
of money, and that is something to be taken
into account. These are the thoughts that
run through my mind, and I wonder whether
there is net a better means than my honourable friend has chosen for the carrying out
of his idea-a means that would not arouse
the feeling that the proposed legislation is

MAY 13, 1931
sure to arouse throughout the length and
breadth of this country. I think that this
legislation might be very useful for our larger
cities, and that it is such as in the course of
our evolution we may be obliged to adopt;
but that it is necessary at the present time is
a matter of doubt in my mind. In any event
this would be a most arousing and exciting,
and, in a certain sense, a most undesirable,
addition to the legislation and tli very
meticulous regulations that we now have.
Hon. G. GORDON: Honourable senators,
in my opinion this Bill should not be given
a second reading. I know that the honourable
gentleman who introduced it (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) is sincere in his motives, but the
remedy that he suggests for the Bolshevist evil
would drive any free and independent people
into revolution. The result would be exactly
what my honourable friend wants to prevent.
At the present time many of our people are
put to considerable hardship because they have
not their automobile licence cards available
every time that a policeman demands them.
It appears to me that if registration of this
kind were inflicted upon a free people, the
outcome would be disastrous. As for myself,
I should resent a demand from a policeman
to present a card of identification. The Bill
appears to me to be so absurd and ridiculous
that, I repeat, we should not give it second
reading.
The motion for the second reading was rejected: contents, 12; non-conitents, 20.

Bill has received the approval of the Attorneys General of the different provinces?
I understood my honourable friend to tell
us the other day that the Bill was introduced
after consultation with the Attorneys General,
but I am wondering whether they have approved of the wording.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think the
honourable member from Welland (Hon.

103

Mr. Robertson) can give that information,
but he is not in the House at present. I am
unable to answer the question further than
to say that, from talking over the matter
with the honourable gentleman before he
left his seat, I understood the necessary approval had been given.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not want to
impede the passing of the Bill, but perhaps
my honourable friend will not insist on third
reading tili next Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is agreeable. I have here a memorandum that apparently is in answer to a question that was
asked at a time when I was not present, as
to whether provincial workmen's compensation boards are recompensed for handling
cases for the Dominion Government. It is to
be noted that according to subsection 4 of
section 3 of the Government Employecs Compensation Act, the Minister of Finance, under
the authority of the Governor in Council,
may pay such portion as is fair and reasonable of the administration expenses of maintaining the provincial boards. Every year the
Dominion Government pays to each board
what is considered to be a fair and reasonable share of the annual expenses of maintaining the board.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That provision is
in the Act now?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes. In the
year 1929-30 the Dominion Government paid
out for this purpose $21,702.02.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: May I ask the honourable gentleman whether there has been any
reference to the employees themselves about
this Bill? Have they been heard by any
committee?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Not to my
knowledge.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: Does the honourable
gentleman not think that they should be
heard in regard to a Bill concerning compensation?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Although the
Bill stands in my name, the honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
who has just returned. to the House, is more
familiar with the matter than I am. He
may be able to supply the required information.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I will repeat my question. Were the employees consulted in connection with this Bill? Did they appear
before axy committee or make any representations?

104

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend just whom he means by
"the employees"?
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: The employees of the
Government.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Civil Service.
My understanding is that representations of
the employees' wishes were made to the Government originally through the Trades and
Labour Congress of Canada and through the
Department of Railways. The matter was
subsequently taken up by that department,
and the Department of Labour was consulted.
Following a conference between
officers of those two departments, a Bill was
framed last year and made some progress,
but it was not passed by the time Parliament
dissolved. The measure was renewed this
year and brought down in another place,
where it was passed, and it is now here for our
consideration. So far as I know, there is no
objection at ail to it on the part of civil
servants. As a matter of fact, the Bill provides the only means by which civil servants
are able to obtain compensation in the event
of being injured while on duty; for, as J
understand the law, a Government employee,
being in the service of the Crown, cannot take
action in the courts against the Crown without its consent. That is, he has no recourse
in common law. This Bill would provide fair
treatment for civil servants by putting them
on a footing with employees in private industries who are covered by provincial workmen's compensation Acts.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I am not conversant with
the facts, but I have been told on good
authority that a large body of civil servants
desire to'be heard before the Bill is given
third reading. That is the only reason I
raised the question.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I may say to my
honourable friend that, subject to the approval of the honourable the leader of the
Government in this House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), I shall try to get some information on this matter to-night. The Civil Service Federation gave notice a couple of weeks
ago that they wanted to resume discussion
with me of a matter that had been taken up
some months ago and adjourned for further
consideration; and it so happened that I
suggested that the conference be held tonight, as neither House of Parliament will be
sitting. So this evening I shall be meeting
in the Labour Department a delegation from
the Civil Service Federation, who represent
civil servants in every department of the
Government, and I expect to have a discusHon. Mr. LOGAN.

sion lasting a couple of hours or so. I have
no knowledge of what they wish to discuss,
other than what was considered before, but
since the honourable member has raised this
question I shall be glad to inquire from the
delegates whether they have heard of any
objections to this legislation.
I may say
that I have heard of none. I shall inform the
House of what information I receive.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: That is quite satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
Does this Bill
apply only to civil servants? Does it not
apply to temporary employees who do special
work for the Government?
I understand
it refers to all Government employees net
otherwise covered.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Government employees net otherwise covered.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I think a number
of them will not be civil servants.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am agreeable
that the Committee should rise and report
progress.
Progress was reported.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. LACASSE moved the second reading of Bill 23, an Act respecting the Essex
Terminal Railway Company.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Would th
honourable gentleman kindly give a little
explanation te the House as to what the
purposes of the Bill are? I do net think many
honourable members are familiar with the
subject-matter.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I had the privilege
of introducing a similar measure about two
years ago, and it was passed. As honourable
members will observe, the purpose of the Bill
is to give authority to the Essex Terminal
Railway Company to commence the building
of an addition to its line in the county of
Essex within the time specified, which is two
years. The previous Bill specified the same
length of time, which has now expired, and
the company is seeking an extension.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: A similar Bill was
apparently first passed in 1902, twenty-nine
years ago, and has been coming before
Parliament at intervals of two years, with one
exception, ever since. I should think it would
be to the advantage of the promoters of the
Bill to drop it rather than to keep on paying
the expenses of its renewal every two years.

MAY 13, 1931
-Hon. Mr. LAQASSE: My honourable friend
will admit that collective organizations always
last longer than individuals. The company referred to, here is a transportation concern and
it has been seriously affected by the general
depression, as have ail the larger Unes in the
country. Tg put the matter simply, the comnpany is asking f or a renewal of the riglits
granted two years ago, since whicli time no
great wave of prosperity has swept over the
land. If the Bill is passed now and the coinpany lias te apply te, Parliament for another
renewal two years hence, my honourable
friend *will have an opportunity of pressing his
objection then.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have a hazy recollection-I am not clear on the matterthat when this Bill was before the Railway
Committee two years ago some question was
raised as te, the advisability of granting a further extension of time for the construction of
the line referred te, because of the fact that
the company had received similar extensions
over a period of almost thirty years. I think
the committee came to the conclusion that
ne harmn would lie donc by once more extending the time for two years, but that the Bill
should net be renewed after the expiration of
that limit. If the Bill is sent te the Railway
Committee, probably other honourable members there will remember what occurred twe
years ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No doulit the
Bill will have te go te the Rallway Committee,
liecause an explanation will lie required fromn
the promoters as te, why a further extension
of time sliould be given. I suppose that the
oftener tliey request an extension the stricter
the committee will become in demanding
reasens.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It miglit lie
furtlier observed, by way of reminder, that at
the saine time te which I arn referring an
extension of time was asked for by a railway
in the province of my honourable friend from
DeLerimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). That
was a road running northwards from
MontreaHon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Joliette.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Yes, the Joliette
and Lake Manuan railway.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes. I think it
is only fair te, suggest te, the honourable
gentleman sponsoring this Bill (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse) that the promoters should be prepared te explain, if the Railway Committee se,
desires, why the Bill is being renewed.

103

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I sliould like to
inquire *whether this company hm. anything
other than its charter. Does it own any other
railway, or is it affilhated with any other
railway?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It is a small coinpany which was organized in the county of
Essex, the main purpose of whicha is to, provide
connecting lines from the C.P.R., the C.N.R.,
the Michigan Central, etc., to the extreme
end of the peninsula of Essex, which is flot
reaclied by those railroads. It lias been
operating for a number of years, and lias a
considerable quantity of tracks and rolling
stock.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

TRADE MISSION TO SOUTH AMERICA
DISCUSSION

AND INQUIRY

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN rose in accordan<ce
with the fohlowing notice:
That lie will osil the attention of the Senateto the recent Canadian Trade Mission to South
America, and inquire -whether the Goverament

SENATE

106

intends to follow the recommend-ations of the
Mission looking to the expansion of Canadian
trade to that continent.
He said: Honourable members, I think I
may without risk of contradiction preface my
remarks with the statement that Canada
under present conditions needs to keep all
she can of her own market and to extend as
much as she can her trade in foreign markets.
This becomes more apparent when one ohserves the condition of our powerful neighbour to the south and realizes thast the difficulty of the situation in the United States
has been greatly increased by a reduction of
exports from that country. Yet in normal
times the United States sends abroad only
about 8 per cent of its total production,
whereas Canada ordinarily exports no less
than 30 per cent of hers-though recently
this figure has fallen to 20 per cent. The
hulk of Canada's exports are sent to only a
few countries, 60 per cent going to the United
States of America. 20 per cent to the United
Kingdon, 10 per cent to the rest of the
British Empire, and only 10 per cent to the
rest of the world.
Trade
The purpose of the Canadian
Mission to South America was to find an
additional market for Canadian products and
to secure a share of the South American
trade, of which we have very little at present; less than one per cent, or. to be exact,
S39.000,00 worth out of a total of $15,000,000,000. The Trade Mission has accomplished
its task and submitted a report containing
its conclusions, the principal one of which i.
that we should secure a much larger share
of South American trade. The Mission has
done a very useful work, but, like many
another good work, if it is not followed up
it will be lead to nothing. I confess that tonight I am attempting to do my share in
this follow-up work, and if I can enlist the
members of this House in support of the
conclusions contained in the report I shall
feel that my efforts have been of some avail.
I think I ought to say one word as to the
composition f the delegation, but before doing
so I shall ask my genial colleague, companion
and adviser from Prince Edward (Hon. Mr.
Horsey) to be kind enough to make up any
deficiency in my remarks. The Mission was
perhaps the most important that ever lcft
the shores of Canada. It consisted of 150
Canadians gathered together by two associations having world-wide relations, and it was
headed by no less a personage than a Minister of the Crown officially representing the
Government. If you picture to yourself all
those delegates gathered together in one ship,
a ship not only flying the Canadian flag, but
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN,

belonging to the Dominion of Canada, you
can well understand that it was regarded and
received as a dignified national embassy.
I am glad that in another House Sir George
Perley has thanked in such pleasing and fitting
language those who extended such wholehearted hospitality to the Canadian delegation. I trust that I may be allowed to join
with him in his remarks, and perhaps to go
a little further-to express here the appreciation of the lawyers who formed part of
the Mission, and who, headed by the Right
Honourable the Chief Justice of this country,
through the graciousness of their Argentine
colleagues, were admitted to the Bar of
Buenos Aires honoris causa. On that occasion I felt that I bad been brought back over
7,500 miles of sea to the atmosphere of the
law courts in omy own city of Montreal, for
everbody spoke French, and spoke it not
only fluently but most gracefully. I cannot
refrain from
ientioning that throughout
South Aunerica it is understood and spoken
with case by every educated man.
In Argentina the Civil Law is French law-it is
the Code Napoléon; and every student of
law must pass his examination in Civil Law
in French before being admitted to practice.
I have very little to quarrel with in the
report of the Mission, but I regret that mention bas not been made of the fact that in
this couintry , where such a large part of the
population speak French, that language could
be used to render very valuable service to the
Doninion in South Anierica.
One particularly interesting feature of the
report is that it was made by business men,
mïanv of whoin Le leaders in their respective
lines of work. They are specialists, and their
irport, based on first-hand information
ereI iii South Aiierica, should be of
intirei-t to bu-ines concerns in Canada.
I -l il try to state briefly what the
VlL1(usins of the Mission were.

view, it offers great possibilities of trade, and
that is particularly the reason why I venture
to come before you with the request that,
if you share my opinion, Canadians should be
given every opportunity to capture that
trade.
But is that trade within our reach? Allow
me, honourable gentlemen, to refer briefly to
a very comprehensive report made by Mr.
Holland for the Export Committee of the
delegation. According to that report there is
in Argentina a good demand for radiators,
steam fittings, gas stoves, and an extremely•
large market for agricultural implements,
electrical washing machines, pumps driven by
wind-mills; and for the supply of these commodities Canadian firms are now actively in
the field. There is also a very large demand
for outboard motors, patent medicines, toilet
preparations, art paper and envelopes-all of
which products are now imported mostly from
France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain.
There is a large demand for canvas, rubbersoled footwear, and several Canadian firms are
now doing a substantial business in these
lines. Over $2,500,000 worth of Canadian
autos went to the Argentine in 1930, and with
the improvement in roads, which is bound
to come shortly, this business should be

furnishes a market for over $1,750,000 per
annum worth of Canadian sewing machines.
About $132,000 worth of binder twine went
from Canada to the Argentine last year, and
this should increase considerably in the future.
Though one large American company bas
now opened its own plant locally, there will
continue to be a fine market for Canadianmade tires and rubber goods, which last year
showed a figure of over $3,500,000. The statistics of last year show that $134,000 worth of
iron pipe and tubing went to the Argentine
from Canada. There should also be a good sale
for iron rods and bars, due to the large
quantity of ornamental iron work donc locally.
Iron rods for reinforced concrete work should
furnish Canadian manufacturers with a profitable market. Because of the popularity of
boating in the Argentine, it is felt that
Canadian manufacturers of canoes could profitably devote some attention and effort to
the development of this market.
But I will abridge my citations. Canada's
trade with Brazil can be incrcased in rubber

cordage, paper products, agricultural maHon

chinery, sewing machines, automobiles, iron
and steel products, marine engines, hardware,
electrical apparatus, and cement.
With Chile we could trade in tires and other
rubber manufactures, boots and shoes, tinned
salmon, wood, wall-paper, farm implements and
machinery, razors, automobiles, aluminium products, and soda compounds.
Uruguay offers a market for rubber manufactures, newsprint, iron piping, sugar, tubing,
sewing machines and automobiles.
This long list of prospective exports could
be enlarged considerably if I quoted from the
reports of our committee on lumber, on fishcries, food specialties, agriculture, etc. Fish
can be exported in large quantities to Brazil.
Canadian poultry and silver foxes should find a
good market in South America.
The Mission has made two kinds of recommendations: those which apply to private
initiative, and those which must be left to
public authority, that is to say, to the Government or to Parliament. I am not going to
deal with the recommendations addressed to
private initiative, except to state that Canadian prestige in South America has been
admirably served by private initative, more

which those institutions, particularly the
Royal Bank in South Americi, have merited
the confidence and the respect of the people
is wonderful. Every one of the Canadians
who visited the offices of the Royal Bank in
Buenos Aires or in Rio de Janeiro vas proud
of that institution.
I now appeal to you on the recommendations addressed by the Mission to the Government and to Parliament. These recommenda.
tions are three in number. The first concerns
the Atlantic service between this country and
South America. Since 1928 there bas been a
direct service between certain ports of Canada
-Montreal
in the summer and the Maritime ports in the winter-and Buenos Aires
and intermediate ports. A monthly service
is furnished by four boats of the Canadian
National fleet, of 8,100 tons each. Strange
to say, there is no difficulty in securing cargoes for Canada, more than 66,000 tons having come from South America during the last
twelve months; but there is difficulty in
getting cargoes shipped the other way, or
rather in preventing shipment from Canada
going via New York in American bottoms
The reason for this is to be found in a very
able report made by Mr. W. D. Robb, the
Vice-President of the Canadian National Railways, who accompanied the Mission. This is
what he says:

MAY 19, 1931

The second recommendation made by the
Trade Mission favours better tariff treatment.
Through a treaty made by Great Britain in
1825 covering the whole British Empire,
Argentina has the benefit of the mostfavoured-nation clause. However, as Argentina has but one tariff, save for insignificant
concessions to neighbouring countries, Canada derives no benefit. On the other hand,
Argentina enjoys the benefit of our intermediate tariff. It seems to me that this is
not a very satisfactory tarif[ relation. The impression of the members of the Mission when
visiting Buenos Aires was that the Government of Argentina had a set policy of maintaining the tariff in its entirety, and the Tariff
Committee of the Mission were not a little
surprised to learn, on visiting the Minister of
Trade and Commerce, the Hon. Mr. BeccarVarela, that exactly the reverse was the case.
I shall just read an extract from a letter from
the Minister of Trade and Commerce of Argentina, and, with the permission of the
House, shall have the whole letter placed on
Hansard for the information of honourable
members.

Mr. Senater:
I beg to thank you for your kind letter of
March 18 and to express the satisfaction which
I have derived from my interview with you
and the other gentlemen of the Canadian
Mission who honoured me wit their visit.
Your interpretation of what we discussed
in our interview with regard to the proposals
of the Argentine Republic is correct. The Republic, as I have had occasion to state to you,
and subsequently to you and Sir George Perley,
is considering at the present moment the posaibilities of concluding special commercial treaties
to permit the interchange of certain products
between our country and other friendly nations.
On such conditions we are prepared te consider

Oanadian Government, of the initiative which
I offer in concrete form in the letter, a copy
shouldered by private individuals.

The volume of trade from Canada (east
coast) to Argentina has increased substantially
during the past years. There is little doubt
that this increase is due chiefly to the shipping
facilities afforded by establishment of the Canadian National Steamships' direct service from
Canadian to Argentine ports.
The Argentine import market is, of course,
at present in a depressed condition, but as soon
as trading conditions become anything like
normal, we believe that the steady development
of the past year or so should continue progressively.
So far as traffic for this service from Canadian ports is concerned, a difficulty is to divert
to Montreal cargo which has hitherto been
routed via New York. It can be reckoned that
New York provides at present one fast mail
vessel, and an average of at least two moderately rapid cargo vessels per week for Argentina, 'and sailings are increased at short notice
to cope with extra demand for space. This
schedule compares with one .Canadian National
Steamship sailing from Canada per month.
In the efforts of the Canadian National Steamships' agents in Argentina to ind'uce importers
of Canadian goods to ship via Montieal, they
have always been faced with the difficulty of
the limsted sailing opportunities from Montreal,
as compared with New York. Manufacturers,
as a rule, wish to foSrward their goods to ocean
vessels as soon as they are ready, and it often
happene, of course, that there is no sailing
from Montreal for two or three weeks thereafter. In addition there is the risk, should
goods shipped via Montreal be delayed in transit to port and thus miss the vessel, of a
month's delay before another sailing is available.
The Canadian National Steanships'
agents in Argentina consider it of importance,
therefore, that addLtional tonnage should be
placed on the service, and they recommend for
the present that the service be on a threeweekly instead of a nonthly basis. As it is
hoped that traffic will steadily increase, the
probability of giving a fortnightly service later
on should be kept prominently in mind.
For a considerable proportion of goods
shipped from Canada to Argentina, speed in
delivery is not of vital importance, but automobile importers, as a rule, require quick delivery, and ait certain periods of the year agricultural maehinery is required with urgency.
Improved speed would, therefore, be a valuable
asset to te Line.

convinced that we could secure a material
reduction of the rate on those products. Can
you imagine what it would mean to Canadian industries in any of those lines to have
practically a right of way into that market?
The difficulty would not be in regard to
obtaining concessions, but rather in granting
concessions. We grow in this country very
little corn, and we buy a large quantity of it
from Argentina.. Most of the corn used in
Canada is imported for the distilling of alcohol.
We import large quantities of hides, casein,
and certain other products. Why would it not
be possible to grant concessions on such articles
as those? And could we not place a small duty
on corn, which now comes in free? By so
doing we certainly should not hurt our own
agriculturists. At the same time we should, hy
giving a preference to Argentina, help her to
export a muoh larger quantity of corn.
Now, honourable senators, I want to hurry
to my last point. I apologize for having taken
so much time.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Go on.

111

If tSere was one thing which struck many,
if not all of the delegates, it was the unfavourable and illogical position which our trade
commissioners occupy in Argentina and Brazil
and possibly in many other countries in the
world. They are but the commercial agents of
the Canadian Government and as such can
have no direct relation with the governments
of the countries to which they are attached.
For example, our trade commissioner would
not dare request an interview from any
Minister of Argentina or Brazil. If he did,
his request would not be entertained; besides,
it would not be understood, as the people of
South America are particularly punctilious on
diplomatic etiquette. If any of our commissioners, in the discharge Of their duties,
must deal with the official representatives of
such a foreign government, they do so through
the British Minister accredited to such government. That is their only channel.
Such contacts with foreign governments
are not infrequently required by Canadian
interests, mostly for commercial reasons. In
South America our export trade is largely
competitive with British trade and it is
bound to be more so in the future. The
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: With regard to
Brazil there is no difficulty whatsoever, because intercession with foreign governments in
that country is entirely complementary to our favour of Canadian business, if successful, is
own. Brazil desires nothing more than the often detrimental to British trade. The
Canadian commissioner is placed in this
export of her raw materials. May I quote from
a speech of the Hon. Mr. Collor, referred to illogical position, that he must apply for
assistance for Canadian interests to the very

able issue could result from it, the policy of
the Argentine Government being, as it had
always been, steadfastly and irrevocably opposed to any tariff concessions whatever.
From that moment very little confidence was
placed in the interview. The Minister was
frankly told at the outset how the hopes of
the Canadian delegates had been dashed to
the ground. "Why," the Minister retorted,
"the unyielding policy that you refer to was
upset, totally reversed, by the revolution of
the 6th of September last." The Minister then
expresed his readiness and his desire to
negotiate with Canada a commercial treaty
based on mutual concessions, in conformity
with the well established policy of his Governient.
Howx

can anyone explain that seven and a

half months after this overthrow by force of
the old reginse of Argentina, our trade comimissioner. accredited te that country, was
totally ignorant of such a radical change of
poliey on a matter regarding international
trade, so important to Canada?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-iSTAUNTON: Will the
honourable gentleman permit me a question?
Had the change of policy been announced?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not know exatly what ny honourable friend means by
":tnnounccd.' Frankly, I am unable te answer
the question: J ans merely stating what I
know. The Minister declared that the Goverement had been changed scven and a half
months before the interview, and, furthermore,
that for some months there had been in existente a commission which was created by the
(overnment
to negotiate treaties based on
treferences with friendly nctions. A gentleman for whonm I have great respect expressed
to me the opinion that such ignorance is the
comissioner's own fault. That may be the
ca-e, but the fact remains that the commis-ioner had no official medium of information
but the British Minister at Buenos Aires.
Leaving aside this particular fact, I submit
that for a score of reasons the position of
our com-mssioners has become msst unsatisfactery. For years they have claimed a status
which would allow them fully and effectively
to fulfil their mandate. Our own Department
of Trade and Commerce las recognized the
soundness of their request by recommending
to our Department of Forcign Affairs that
proper diplomatie status be granted our commîissioners in the most important countries,
including Argentina and Brazil. And there
the matter stands. It bas awaited a solution

Empire. For rather sentimental reasons they
would hesitate to withdraw our commissioners
from the tutelage of the British Ministers.
I respect their feelings, but it seems to me
that the best answer to a sentiment of this
kind is that the Dominions have settled the
question of their own status. The policy
that the Dominions have established in this
respect will not be reversed. The integrity
of -Canadian autonomy has become the first
article of our political creed throughout the
land. That being determined, there remains
but the practical issue as te how Canadian
interests can best be served. This, I suggest,
should be donc through Canadian authority
by Canadians answerable to Canada.
But Canadians are not the only ones who
hold views of this kind. May I quote on this
point no less an authority than Sir Ronald
Lindsay, Great Britain's ambassador to Washington, who, a few days ago, stated publicly:
If I may speak not only for myseif but also
'or the general body of the English career
diplomatists of which I am one member, I
'ould say that we have always felt it a great
onour to have been allowed to defend the
interests abroad of the great Dominions, and
we have always done our best to defend thens
effieiently. And yet I have no hesitation in
expressing the opinion that where your interests assume ceonsiderable proportions, they are
more effectively looked after by your own representative than they possibly can be by a
îmember of the diplomatie service of Great
Britain.
It is illogical that our representative should
be out of court and our case be confided to
an attorney net subjected to our authority,
but often under that of the real opponent in
the case.
This strange situation we have
reached in the course of our evolution to the
new regime from the old, which I know is
bound to disappear. Should we not endearvour
to correct it just as soon as it is practicable
to do so?
Canada at the League of Nations ranks
fifth in trade and eleventh in population. May

just asking the question whether the Mission
took into consideration the condition which
I mentioned.
The honourable gentleman's
reply is that it did not.
Hon. H. H. HORSEY: Honourable mentbers of the Sonate, I desire to support in
almost everything the very clear and comprehensive statement just made by my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien).
I think we will all agree that
he bas given us a very interesting, first-hand
account of his impressions and experiences
on the recent Canadian Trade and Good-will
Mission to Latin America.
The remarks I wish to make fall naturally
under three headings. The first deals with
the good-will engendered on all sides by the
social functions held and contacts made. The
second takes up the specifie, concrete accomplishments by the members of the delegation
itself. The third refers to the present handicaps. the modification or removal of which
would tend to increase mutual trade between
Canada and the South American countries.
Under the first heading, there is no doubt
that the receptions
and entertainments,
national, provincial and municipal, together
with those of the Chambers of Commerce and
of individual citizens, did lead to good-will
on all sides, and to a better understanding of
each other's needs and aims. We were received
with open arms. The social functions were
not overdone, and the delegation never forgot
the main object of the Mission, namely, to
extend and increase Canadian trade and promote Canadian interests.
Under the second heading, the following
accomplishments of the delegation may be
mentioned: They secured many direct orders
on the spot, including orders for marine
engines, agricultural implements, carpets and
rugs, fox furs, and even Canadian whiskey.
They established some fifteen new agencies
for their export firms, and considerable increase of trade over the years is certain to
result therefrom. They helped to advertise
this country and make Canada better known.
Travelling in such large numbers-150-on

their own steamer, and arriving at the time of
the Empire Fair, the delegation aroused great
interest in Buenos Aires. All the papers
there gave much front-page space to Canada.
its area, history, resources, people, trade. etc.
This Mission, I think, constituted a very
good basis for trade, furnishing valuable information for our importers and exporters,
by the use of which they may get into touch
and keep in touch with the people of those
countries, and thus be able to do busines
with them.
Now I come to the third point-some of the
difficulties or handicaps. the modification or
renoval of which would tend towards an
inerease in trade with Canada. First there is
inadequate steamship service, which already
has been mentioned by omy honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien). At the present time
we have a monthly service. In the summer the
boats leave Montreal, call at Three Rivers for
a cargo of newsprint, then at Saint John, New
Brunswick, and Halifax, whence they proceed
to Rio dle Janeiro and Buenos Aires. The
steamships on this route are ten-knot vessels.
and two out of the four, I bhlieve, have some.
refrigerator space. Honourable members can
see how difficult it is to compete with the
serv ice from New York. with two or three
rapid boats leaving weekv. We cannot hope
fo aect that competition on an equal footing,
but something might be dont to improva the
situation. As myVhvonourable friend has said,
Hon. W. D. Robb. Vice-President of the
Canadian National Steamship Company, was
the chairman of the committee that reported
on this matter, and he has estimated that 60
per cent of our trade with South America goes
via New York and by American steamers.
We arc thankful to have even one ship a
month on this route, and this has helped
towards an increase in trade; but honourable
meibers can realize that when a man ships
a cargo he wants it to get to its destination
as qcuiekly as possible. and rather than wait
two or thrco weeks for a vassel, as is often
necrssary in shipping through a Canadian
port and bv a Canadian boat, he will ship via
Ncw York.
Mr. Robb suggests that it is
possiby worth while to consider a change
fron a monthly sertvice of ten-knot boats to
a three-weeks
servica
of fourtein-koot
vessels. This is a matter of policy. A- my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) bas so
wcll said, when the Canadian National Steamships are facing a deficit, it is a queation for
the experts of that organization and of the
Government to determine whether or not some
of the 60 ptr cent of Canadian export.s that
are going via American routes can be diverted
to our own ports and steamers. It miglt be

MAY 19, 1931
found adviseble to carry out the suggestion
which, has been made. One thing we do know,
and that is thet if an improved steamship
service were esteblished it would lie of great
benefit to aIl our importers and exporters.
My honouraible friend was the able chairman of the Committee on Tariffs. I also
happened to be a member of that committee,
and I know something of the discouregements
and difficulties that my honourable friend had
to meet. Through his perseverance and
diplomacy, and his knowledge of the Freinch
language, he succeeded, as he has shown
to-niglit, in obtaining: interviews with the
Minîsters of Trade and Commerce in both
the Argentine anid Brazll, anid in obtaining
froma them an offer to consider treaties en
the basis of mutuel or preferential tariffs in
order to increase trade. I arn not quite so
sanguine as my honourable friend with regard
to the magnitude of the tra.de that can be
done, but I be'lieve the present trade can be
increese'd. If a treaty is too serious a rnethod
of attaining the desired endi, perhaps it miglit
be done by a conference of the representatives
of the Governments, who migh't decîde that
insteed of meking a hard and fast treaty they
would- do somethîng i the way of independent, voluntary action. My reason for
thinking that there may not lie scope for a
tremendous trade with Argentina, f ôr instance,
is this. While Argentina is a rich. country,
perhaps the richest of its size in the whole
world, it is ricli in agriculture, and its surplus
products are agricultural. Therefore we are
more or less in competition. This being so,
we cannot expect an enormous interchange
of produets, though, as my honourable friend
says, there is rooma for increased trade.I
do not quite egree, either, whcn my lionourable friend spcaks of placing a duty on corn,
or, for that matter, of increasing the duty on
enything. We cannot lower the duty on corn,
be-cause it cornes in free. For the same reason
we cannot lower the duty on hides. Neyertheless there is a very large and rich market
ini the Argentine for our manufacturcd products if our exporters can compete in quality
and price. If they can do that, the good-will
already engendered will, 1 believe, give them
a preference in Argentina.
In Brazil, as my honourable friend has said,
there are perhaps more opportunities for increased trade than in Argentina, because Brazil
has a larger area in tropical regiens and its
products are different fromi our own. There
are, however, many difficulties in the way of
seouring an extensive trade even with Brazil.
In the first place, there are tropical countries
nearer to Canada then Brazil. Products
similer to those of Brazil are produced by the
22112-Si

115

British West Indies, to which. we must give
the first preference. Then there is the United
States, which takes a very large share of the
Braziian coffee, probably two-thirds of the
crop, and this gives the United States a great
influence in securing favourable treatment for
its manufactures in Brazil. Nevertheless, as
my honourable friend has said, there are many
products in wvhich an exehange could be arranged. My honourable friend mentioned
raw rubber. It seerns to me a very sensible
and reasonable thing to expeet that if we
take their liard para rubber-whicli, by the
way, is of the best quality in the world, even
better than the rubber from. the Straits Settiements-wNe sliould be able to send in exchange
our manufactured rubber goods. We could also
exchange our wheat and our flour for their
coffee. So 1 think there is rooma for a considerable increase in trade. This matter should
be examined very carefully by the representatives of the Government. As my honourable
friend says, we do not want to lose any opportunity for trade; on the contrary, we want to
make additions here and there. That we cannot, have as large a trade as we have with
Great Britain or with the United States is no
reason why we should flot negotiate with our
friends in South America and see what is
possible of accomplishment.
Another point of difiulty was deait with
by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). 1 refer to the official status of the
Ca'-nadian trade commissioners in South America. I think it was the unanimous opinion
of the delegation, judging from what we saw
and what we could learn, that the status of
the Canadian trade commissioners should be
improved so as to give them the standing of
the commercial attachés of Great Britain and
certain other foreign countries, many of them
very small iii area, population and wealth.
I amn not going into detail. The illustration
given by my honourable friend is quite correet. We have in Argentina a trade commissioner, a successf ul one, a popular man, well
equipped and well able to look after his work;
but, not having official status, he was not able
to get into contact with the Ministers and
could not k-now that a change of policy had
occurred. If he lied had the necessery status
lie would have known. In this particular case
lie was unaware of the change after seven
montlis, excellent trade commissioiýer though
he is. Hie was absolutely sure that negotiations were of no use whatsoever.
This matter has been dealt with frequently
before. It is -a delicate subjeet, and no one
has yet been able to find a solution for the
problem. Since it came to my notice I have
spoken to a number of my friends who were
interested in the matter, and 1 have esked for

116

SENATE

suggestions as to how to proceed. The best
suggestion that I have heard-I think it is a
good one-is this: that the Government should
be asked to have this subject placed upon the
agenda of the next Imperial Conference, so
that it might be considered and discussed
there. Australia and New Zealand have trade
commissioners similar to ours, and they are all
in the same inferior category. I do not look
for immediate action; I know how difficult
that is. Nobody on the delegation to South
America expected that an expensive embassy
would be set up, or considered that the present
service should be interfered with. The men
we have are well selected. The examinations
they have to pass are strict. They are able
men, and men of merit, and nothing should be
done to affect their remuneration. It is thought,
however, that the official stamp of authority
should be placed upon them, equalizing then.
at least within the British Empire, and, having
fixed the status of Canada on an equal basis
with that of Great Britain, it would seem thai
the Imperial Conference should be able in
some way or other to work out a solution as
it did in the larger matter.
Hon Mr. CASGRAIN: If nobody else is
going to speak, I should like to move the
adjournment of the debate. I think I could
say something on this question to-morrow.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members, as it is not quite ten o'clock, and
as my honourable friend is not ready to proceed, perhaps I might have ten or fifteen
minutes in which to express my views in regard
to this subject.
I believe I speak the mind of every member
of the Senate when I express appreciation of
what we have heard from the two representatives of this Chamber on the Trade Mission
to South America. From our long acquaintance with them we know that they would do
us honour, and all that I have heard of them
in this connection justifies our assurance. One
member of the delegation, a Montrealer, told
me that our two representatives had played
an important part, and that wherever they
spoke their remarks were listened to with
attention and were greatly appreciaîed.
I desire to confirm what has been sta"ed by
our representatives, that South America generally is very sympathetic towards Canada
and is desirous of establishing closer relations
with this country. In the past eight or ten
years I have met a good many South
Americans, among them men who had directed
the affairs of their own countries as prime
ministers or foreign ministers, or as ambassadors in large European centres, and who
represented their countries at Geneva, and
every one of them expressed the ardent
Hon.

Ar. HORSEY.

desire that Canada should take its seat in the
Pan-American Union. They gave many reasons
why Canada should be in loser contact with
their countries, and why representatives of
Canada should meet their representatives at
Washington at their meetings, held annually
or oftener. I recognized, and I was not the
only one to do so, that the gathering together
of these representatives was most interesting
from an economie point of view, and that by
reason of the fact that Canada had a legation
at Washington it had become easier for Canada
to join in the meetings of the Pan-American
Union. But unfortunately there a.ppeared an
insuperable objection to Canada's joining that
union, na,mely, that at these gatherings the
political element always came to the fore.
There is considerable discussion, and often
there is friction, between some of the delegates
of South American republies and the Washington authorities over the interpretation of
the Monroe doctrine. This debars Canada
from joining the Union. If it did so it would
be running the risk of borrowing trouble. We
are not interested in the application or interpretation of the Monroe doctrine, and our
situation would bo a somîewhat difficult one
if we were represented there during the discussion of matters that interest South America
and North America, but in regard to which
we could not express an opinion, or to which
we could not bring any suggesion of a satisfactory solution. In alnost every conversation
with delegates one would hear a statement to
this effect: "Yes, Canada is very- popular with
us, but unfortunately it is not represented as
a nation at our meetings. Wc lack contact.
Looking northward, we should like to see
another partner, another friend. beside the
United States." There is no doubt that we
have suffered in the economic field because of
the fact that we have lacked that close contact
that the United States has had with the South
American republics.
I have had occasion to survey the markets
of the world with a view to ascertaining which
countries presented the best opportunities for
an extension of our trade activities, and I have
come to the conclusion that the best prospects
are in South Ainerica and in the Orient. I
think the general opinion in our country is
that we should cultivate the South Anerican
markets. My honourable friends have spoken
of Brazil and Argentine and Chile, but I think
our outlook should go beyond those countries
and include the whole of South America. We
have also been thinking of Japan and China,
and I feel that we as members of this honourable Chamber should do all that lies in our
power along the lines suggested in the resolutions that have been brought to our notice,
with a view to developing trade with the

MAY 19, 1931
South. Much thought has been given to the
question of enlarging our business with Japan
and China, and I think that all honourable
members will agree with me that it is likewise
an object that should command our constant
support.
Representatives of Argentina, Brazil and
Chile have suggested to me at Geneva that
Canada might have one Minister accredited
to those three republics; that he might reside
four months a year in each of their capitals,
Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Santiago;
and there might be a commercial attaché from
Canada living at each one of those capitals all
the time. It so happens that the climate of
those countries is such that a Minister from
the North could comfortably make these three
changes of residence every year. Many of the
well-to-do people in those countries move
about in a similar way.
Canada has an Ambassador in Japan, and
I feel sure that within a few years, when China
reaches a higher degree of stability, we shall
find it necessary to have a direct representative
in that large republic. Why should we hesitate
to make a reasonable enlargement of our official representation abroad?
Of course, we
need be in no hurry to appoint a Minister to
every country, but I confess that I intended
to impress upon the late Government, of which
I was a member-and I did, to some extentrthe fact that the time had come when we
should have official representation in South
America. I now pass on my suggestions to
the present Government. I believe that we
could not do better than have one Minister
accredited to the three republics that I have
named, with a permanent commercial attaché
in the capital of each country. Why should
we hesitate to make such an appointment? Our
hesitancy would indicate our failure to realize
that we have come of age. A great many
countries with smaller populations than ours
have had official representation abroad for
many years, yet Canada, one of the richest
countries in the world, with a population of
ten millions, has shown some timidity in moving forward. But we have reached our full
majority and I believe that Canadians as a
whole are ready to assume the responsibility
that our present status entails. In these times
of stress we should not incur any heavy
expenses that might reasonably be postponed,
but I feel that we should no longer delay the
appointment of a representative in South
America. I feel that before long we shall have
to make a similar appointment in China.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Casgrain, the debate
was adjourned.

CANADIAN

HISTORIC SITES
RETURN

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
senators, I beg to lay on the Table a return
to an Order of the Senate dated May 7, showing the names of places, localities or structures
in each of the provinces of Canada that are
known as historie sites, and indiEcating the
historie sites that are now under the control of
the National Battlefields Commission or other
like authority. This information was ordered
on a motion by the honourable gentleman
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner). If I am
permitted to do so, I shall read a few extracts
from this return. The following is contained
in a letter to Mr. Mulvey, Under-Secretary
of State, from H. H. Rowatt, the Deputy
Minister of the Department of the Interior:
Referring to the Address of the Senate, dated
May 7, 1931, mover Honourable Senator Tanner,
Minutes of the Senate 14, page 66, on the subject of the names and places in Canada known
as historie sites, I am attaching hereto a statement furnishing the information asked for in so
far as the Department of the Interior is concerned.
It is presumed that the information asked for
in the latter part of the motion relating to
historie sites now under the control of the National Battlefields Commission will be furnished
by the Department to which the Commission
is attached. It is understood that the Commission comes under the Department of Finance.
Attached is a statement which reads:
On the recommendation of the Historie Sites
and Monuments Board of Canada the following
sites have been acquired and marked by the
Department of the Interior.
Then there is a list comprising two foolscap
pages, which I shall not read. Following that
is another statement, under this heading:
On the recommendation of the Historie Sites
and Monuments Board of Canada the following
sites have been marked by the Department of
the Interior, the right to erect tablets in these
cases being received through license of occupatipn or other form of permission from the
owners of the land or structure concerned.
There are more than two foolscap pages of
detail given, and following that is another list
of historie sites unmarked, recommended for
attention by the Historie Sites and Monuments
Board of Canada.

FURTIIER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 2-compensation to be same as
under law' of province where accident occurs:
Hon. -G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
senators, when this Bill was being considered
in committee last week the honourable gentleman from Cumberland (Hon. Mr. Logan)
asked a question, which was, in effect, whether the employees in all branches of the
Government service were in faveur of, or satisfied with, the provisions of this Bill. Definite
information on this point was not available
at the moment, and the honourable gentleman was told that an answer would be given
to him when the Bill was again under consideration. The committee then rose and reported progress. It so happened ·that on that
evening I had a conference with members of
the Civil Service Federation of Canada, representing all the organizations within the Government service, and I had an opportunity to
discuss this question with them. One gentleman present was doubtful whether the provisions of the Bill were adequate to meet the
requirements of the particular class of Government employees that he represented.
I found it was quite needless to enter into
any detailed discussion of his point, because
his associates of the Civil Service who were
present at the meeting very quickly disabused
his mind of the fear that he had. This resulted in making unanimous the endorsation
of this legislation by the duly elected representatives of the various classes of civil servants, and I was authorized by the meeting
to intimate to this House the Civil Service
Federation's unanimous approval of the Bill.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Thé preamble and the titIe were agreed to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS.

VENTURA DIVORCE PETITION
REPORT

REFERRED

BACK

TO

COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from May 13 the
adjourned debate -on the motion of Hon. Mr.
McMeans:
That the twenty-second Report of the Standing Comtmittee on Divorce be referred back to
the said Committee, with instructions to take
no further action in the matter of the petition
of Mary Ann Ventura, praying for a Bill of
Divorce,
And the amendment moved by Hon. Mr.
Lewis:
Tiat all the words after the word "instructions" in the third line of the motion be struck
out and the following substituted therefor: That
the Standing Conimittee on Divorce should not
as a general rule hear petitions for Bills of
Divorce from those whose domicile is in a province having a divorce court, but that owing
to special circunstances connected with the case,
the Comnittee should hear and report upon the
petition of Mary Ann Ventura.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, we had a rather interesting discussion
on this matter the other day. I have only a
few remarks to add. I would first call the
attention of honourable members to the position in which the matter stands. The Standing
Committee
on
Divorce submitted their
twenty-second report, in which, instead of
reporting favourably or unfavourably on this
petition, they ask for instructions from the
Senate. Then the honourable Chairman of
the Standing Committee made a motion to
the effect that no further action should b
taken in regard to the potition. I do not
understand that the Chairman is, in point of
fact, wholly in sympathy with the motion
which he made. I rather think that he proposed it in that form for the purpose of
eliciting the views of the Senate on the subject. Following that again, the honourable
member for Toronto (Hon. Mr. Lewis) moved
an amendment, the substance of which is
that by reason of what is called special circumstances the Senate should send the matter
back to the committee, with instructions to
hear and report upon the petition.

MAY 19, 1931
The other day we had more or less discussion
about constitutional questions, that is to say,
as to whether or not, by reason of the fact that
Parliament had created a divorce court in the
Province of Ontario, Parliament had divested
itself of authority to hear a petition for a
divorce frorn that province. In that connection we have to bear in mind a point which
I think I mentioned the other day. It is
this: that although the Senate has been so
closely associated with this divorce business
that a common idea prevails outside that the
Senate is a divorce court, a person who petitions for a divorce simply applies for a private
bill, just as anyone might apply for a bill
incorporating a company; so it is not the
Senate, but Parliament, that is the authority.
If this Chamber and the other agree to the
Bill it becomes a statute. If either Chamber
does not agree to the Bill it does not pass.
After thinking this matter over I have no
doubt in my mind as te the authority of
Parliament to deal with divorce. I will take
no time arguing the matter. The way I look
at it is this, that so long as the British North
America Act contains a paragraph stating
that the Federal Parliament shall exercise
power and authority over marriage and divorce,
that power remains, no matter how many
divorce courts we may erect in the country.
Though I have no doubts on that subject,
yet I understand that the honourable members of this Chamber are unanimous in believing that these applications for divorce
should now go to the courts instead of coming to Parliament. It was because of this
belief that we erected the court, and I think
every reasonable and justifiable means should
be taken to let the people know that when a
divorce is desired, and a court is available,
they should go to the court and not come to
this Parliament.
At the same time, I submi.t, it is not desirable to put on record a formal resolution
which, in effect, might intimate that we are
doubtful of our authority, or think that in
this case there are exceptional circumstances,
inasmuch as on some occasion events might
happen which would justify Parliament in
entertaining a petition. To pass in this House
a resolution declaring that this Senate or Parliament should not hear any more petitions
would be in my judgment a futile proceeding,
because it would not stand. The Senate might
the next week decide that there were circumstances that would justify it in entertaining
the petition. For these reasons I think it is
net desirable to pass a resolution on this subject containing excuses for our action.
Now, without any spirit of criticism, let
me read the proposed amendment to the
motion:

119

That the Standing Committee on Divorce
sbould not as a general rule hear petitions for
Bills of Divorce from those whose domicile is
in a province having a divorce court, but that
owing to special circumstances connected with
the case the Committee should hear and report
upon the petition of Mary Ann Ventura.
I am not in favour of putting into a formal
motion anything in the form of an excuse. It
is agreed that the court in Ontario has jurisdiction. There is no question about that. Well
then, what special circumstances can be suggested? There are none that I can see. The
mere fact that counsel happens to reside in
the city of Ottawa is not a sufficient circumstance te justify us in taking action, and it
should be very clearly understood in future
it will not be regarded as a special circumstance. But if we pass this amendment in
these words we shall have set up a precedent,
and it will be easier than ever for an applicant
to come in and say to us: "You agr.ed that
there was a special circumstance in that case.
Why not hear our case?" So I am submitting
that it is not desirable to put ourselves
formally on record in words of that kind.
As I understand it, the committee did hear
all the witnesses. I think it was an error of
judgment on their part, but we will excuse
them. Whether or not they think there should
be a report in favour of the divorce I do net
know; I have not asked, and I have not the
remotest idea. I feel that this is the first
offence. The law in regard te Ontario was
passed only a short time ago. While giving a
warning the Senate might very well, in this
instance-not because of special circumstances,
but as a matter of grace-send the report back
to the committee and let them deal with the
petition.
Having these views on the matter, I am
going to move in amendment te the amendment:
That all the words after the word "instructions" in the third line of the motion be struck
out and the following substituted therefor:-to hear and report on the petition of Mary
Ann Ventura for a Bill of Divorce.
If I have constructed my amendment correctly the motion as amended would read:
That the twenty-second Report of the Standing Committee oh Divorce be referred back to
the said Committee, with instructions to hear
and report on the petition of Mary Ann Ventura for a Bill of Divorce.
I am merely cutting out all reference te the
reasons and excoeptional circumstances, and
am endeavouring to make a plain motionthat the report go back te the committee and
that they hear the petition and report.
Hon. Mr. MuMEANS: I do not know
,whether I am in order or net, but I should
like to withdraw my motion, if that is possible.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It can be done with

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I am in the curious
position that, although I introduced the
motion in order to bring the matter before
the House, I should have to vote against it.
I desire to withdraw my motion, because I
am in favour of the amendment te the amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: May I express the
opinion that it is better for the motion of
the honourable gentleman to stand and be
voted on. Really, I am in favour of the
motion that the report be handed back to the
committee with instructions to take no further
action. That, in my opinion, is the motion
.that should be adoptedHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
When this question was before us previously
I had an idea that we inîlit in some way take
a step towards its final solution. I am inclined
to agree with the observation made by my
honourable friend behindi me (Hon. Mr. Tanner) that it is not simply the Senate that is
involved, but the whole of Parliament. This
case lias come to us and we have been asked
for instructions, and according to the motion
before us it is proposed that we should give
instructions. But there may be other cases
in future years. Then again there is a general
impression, as I understand it, that, having
established a divorce court in the Province of
Ontario, and all the provinces but one now
Hon.

Mr. McMIEANS.

having such courts, it is inadvisable that cases
froin those provinces should come before
Parliament. At the same time I ask whether,
if soneone from some of those provinces came
to Parliament and asked for a Bill, it would
net be a severe denial of his rights to prevent
him under all circumstances from getting his
Bill before Parliament. What I was thinking
was that the amendment might take this
forn:
That the Committee should hear and report
upon the petition of Mary Ann Ventura; that
it is desirable that hereafter divorce cases
arising in the provinces possessing divorce
courts should be heard in those courtsI think we are all of that opinion.
-and that a Committee of both Houses of Parliament be appointed to consider the meaus
best fitted to meet that end.
That covers the whole situation and enables
us to come to such a conclusion as will give
the greatest force to the desire which is
evidenced everywhere, namely, that to the
greatest possible extent the divorce courts in
the provinces which have them should hav
full juriscliction over divorces from those
provinces.

wîillingHon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend nust not forget that if he withdraws his motion we still have the report from
the committee.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Then there is the
amendment to the amendment. I may
explain that since I brought this matter
before the Senate I have received information which leads me to believe that

MAY 19, 1931
divorce petitions from Ontario will be
very rare, and that if they should be filed in
any number the matter can be brought up
again.
May I also correct a statement that I made
the other day as to precedents? I believe that
there were a couple of cases from British
Columbia, and one from Manitoba, both of
which provinces have divorce courts, and that
the committee tried them.
When I introduced the motion I thought
we might have a large number of cases from
Ontario, but I am assured by the Clerk that
they will be very rare, and will come before
us only in cases of mixed domicile. That
being so, I am in favour of not proceeding
further with such a motion unless conditions
should change and we should have a large
number of cases.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable members, we gave jurisdiction to the Ontario courts
to hear divorce, and I think I am stating
what was in the mind of everybody when I
say that we did that in order to try to rid
Parliament of this business.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No, no. Not
altogether.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We could not rid
it altogether? My honourable friend shakes
his head. The purpose of giving jurisdiction
to an Ontario court was to relieve Parliament,
as far as possible, of the obligation of hearing
cases from that province. My honourable
friend must admit that.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I do not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The reason was
very simple. It was a matter of convenience,
not a matter of constitution. We did not
change the constitution at all. Parliament
bas the same right to hear divorce that it
always had; the Ontario Act did not make
any change whatever in that regard.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But it was deemed
that Parliament should be relieved of the
obligation of hearing divorce cases, and that
a court was. the proper place for the parties
to go. I do not see why we should not be
consistent, and why we should not now say,
as is proposed by the right honourable gentleman frorn Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster), that it is desirable that these cases
should go to the courts in Ontario. It seems
to me that that would be reaffirming the intention of Parliament at the time of creating
the jurisdiction in Ontario. I repeat that
we gave the courts jurisdiction in order, as
far as possible, to get rid of divorce. I am

121

entirely in accord with the proposal of the
right honourable the junior member for
Ottawa, and I am going to support it. I
think his suggestion is better than that of
the honourable member for Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Lewis).
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I correct my
honourable friend on one point? While we
were anxious to get rid of the numerous petitions, the fundamental principle was that we
were not in a position to render justice to the
applicants in cases of alimony, custody of
the children and costs.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is what I
meant.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The idea of going
to the court was, in addition to the reasons
given by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt), that the court had power as to
costs, custody of the children, alimony, and
such matters. But there are dozens of cases
in which those questions do not arise.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Quite right. Those
are the reasons enumerated at length, as to
why we tried to get rid of divorce here and
to send it to the courts.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Chairman of
the Divorce Committee, if I understood the
original motion, wanted the Senate to tell
the Divorce Committee what to do. Is that
correct?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman said that he was not wedded to
the motion, but that he wanted the Senate
to give instructions. If the honourable gentleman wants instructions, I may say that I
agree with the honourable member from St.
John (Hon. Mr. Daniel).
Last year we
created a court in Ontario to hear divorce
cases, and these people ought to go there.
There is an old fundamental principle, "Ubi
jus, ibi remedium." If this woman can get
a divorce in Ontario, why does she not go
there?
What is the use of establishing a
divorce court in Ontario if we are going to
continue trying divorces here?
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
members, on the motion of Hon. Mr. McMeans that the twenty-second report. of the
Standing Committee on Divorce be referred
back to the said committee, it has been moved
in amendment by Hon. Senator Lewis:
That all the words after the word "instructions" in the third line of the motion be struck
out and the following substituted:That the Standing Committee on Divorce
should not as a general rule hear petitions for

SENATE
Bills of Divorce froin those whose domicile is
in a province having a divorce court, but that
owing to special circumstances connected with
the case the Committee should hear and report
upon the petition of Mary Ann Ventura.
In amendment to this amendment it is
moved by Hon. Mr. Tanner:
That all the words of the motion after
the word "instructions" be struck out. and the
following words be substituted therefor:
-to hear and report on the petition of Mary
Ann Ventura for a Bill of Divorce.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would respectfully draw to the attention of the Hon. the

Speaker that we must dispose of the subamendment first.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those who are
in favour of the amendment to the amendment will please rise.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
do not know what we are to vote on.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are voting
on the sub-amendment of the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner).
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: What is the effect
of that sub-amendment?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It refers the report
back to the committee.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
want to know what bas become of my little
a.mendment.

The amendment of Hon. Mr. Tanner was
agreed to: contents, 21; non-contents, 5.

Bill. My reason for this is the fact that the
Committee on Banking and Commerce meets

to-morrow, and it is desired that the Bill

Hon. A. E. PLANTA: Honourable members, I must object to the suspension of the
rule. There is too great a tendency to follow
such a practice in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am merely trying
to get the Bill before the Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

Hon. Mr. PLANTA: Let it go before the

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We shall be

Hon. Mr. PLANTA: I think the tendency
in this Chamber to advance bills more rapidly
than the rules permit should be discouraged.
That practice bas been carried to such lengths
that the term "railroading legislation" is being
used in connection with some of the measures
that go through this House. I see no reason
why the regular routine should not be followed
with respect to this Bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this

MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. CROWE moved the second reading
of Bill 31, an Act respecting the Burrard Inlet
Tunnel and Bridge Company.
He said: Honourable members, by leave of
the Senate I am asking that this Bill be read
a second time. I spoke to the Hon. the
Chairman of the Railway Committee, who has
agreed to call a meeting of the committee on
Thursday, and I should like to have the Bill
ready so that it could be dealt with at that
time.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I agree entirely with
the remarks of the honourable member from
Nanaimo (Hon. Mr. Planta). Notice has to
be posted up for a week before the committee
can consider a Bill that comes from the other
House.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: Notice has to be posted
only forty-eight hours in advance. The Bill
would not get before the committee on
Thursday, anyway.

.MAY 19, 1931
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: We have time to take
it in its regular order.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: That may be, but this
matter is very urgent, and the Bill has gone
through the other Bouse.
I would draw
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the attention of honourable maembers to the
fact that suspension of rules lias generally
been asked for only towards the end of a
session, when the time for dealing with bis is
getting short. As far as this Bill is concerned,
it would not; be given the Royal Assent until
another suppiementary supply bill is going
through, probably not before the end -of May
or early in June. I confess that I have noticed
a tendency to abuse the practice of suspending rules. Our Rules and Orders have been
made for the protection of interested parties
and of the publie in generai. After a bill is
introduced in either Bouse it goes through
varieus stages, each of which, is separated,
according to the Rules, by a certain minimum
period of time, and these intervals are
,provided so that ail parties interested and
the public in general may have due notice of
when a bill is to reach any particular stage.
Speaking generally, I think that at this stage
of the session, in the best interest of this
honourable Chamber, we should hesitate before we suspend rules that have been laid down
for our guidance.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 quite concur
in the remarks that have just been made.
Undoubtedly there are occasions when the
House agrees that suspension of the rules is
advisable, because the circumstances are out
of the ordinary; but I think that as a general
thing we should not suspend the rules merely
for the purpose of speeding up somne legisiation which can be passed in its regular order
without inconvenience to the public. Comment has been made in another place, and to
me more than once, that in this Chamber
we are a little too, ready to suspend rules and
rush bis through, although we have abundant
time which we do not see fit to occupy in
sittings of the Bouse. I appeal to honourable
members not to ask for second reading of bis
earlier than the rules permit, nor for suspension of the rules, unless there is a reaI emergen-cy. If there is an emergeney, there is no
doubt that the Bouse will respond to a
request for suspension, when the matter is
expiained; but as to general practice in future,
I agree with the honourable leader on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who has
had long experience in this Bouse.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I hope the honourable gentleman will himself follow out exactly
what he has suggested. I think that lie lias

123

moved as frequently as any other honourabie
member for second reading with leave of the
House.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Notice of motion
should be given when an honourable member
intends to ask that rules be suspended.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I amn glad thi9 point
has been raised. The honourable leader on
the other side referred to the necessity of
abiding by the rides for the protection of
the public. I think that the rules shouid be
followed for the protection of honourable
members as well. I have in mind one Bill
,that wvas given first, second and third readings
very rapidly in this Bouse: afterwards I was
sorry that I had not obj ected, because when
I had time to consider the Bill I felt that I
should not have voted for it.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: I certainly should not
ask f or second- reading of this Bill to-night if
there were not an emergenoy. If the Bill does
not come up again before Thursday, and if
we adjourn for ten days or two weeks-Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No, no.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We shahl not
adjourn before Friday, anyway.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: If the BihI goes th'rough
this week I shahl not objeet.
Hon. Mr. OASGiRAIN: But it wil not be
sanctioned then. That will not do the hon-ourable gentleman any good.
Hon. Mr. OROWE: That is a question.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUJGHBY: In my remarks
a few moments ago I was speaking generally,
and not with reference to t-his Bilh.
Hon. Mr. OROWE: This is a case of
emergency. The bridge involved has been
out of commission since iast September and
the people are anxi-ous to get the Bill through
s0 that contracts to repair the bridge can be
let.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I think the Sonate is
going to turn over a new leaf, by sitting
instead of adI ourning.
Hon. Mr. OROWE: It needs to.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: If any honourable senator gives his word that the second
reading is a matter of extreme urgency, without going into any detail about it, I wili
consent to a suspension. But so far as I arn
concerned, I should not like honourabie members to abuse a concession of that kind.

SENATE

124

I made a motion
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
for second reading a few minutes ago. There
is just as much necessity connected with mv
Bill as with this one, and I do not sec why
they should be treated differently. The soliciter intercsted in the Bill that I am sponsoring
is here

from

Winnipeg

and

is desirous

of

appearing before the Committee on Banking
and Commerce on Wednesday; but he will
have to stay here a number of days. I am
not objecting to second reading for the Bill
now under consideration, because I do not
feel inclined to oppose such a request for
suspension of the rule, but I complain very
bitterly of the treatment accorded to me.
I think what is sauce for the goose ought to
be sauce for the gander. The honourable
leader of this House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
should in future bear in mind the remarks he
made, because in the past he has been as
active as any other honourable member in
moving, with leave, that bills be given second
rcaming.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

The honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able gentleman who is sponsoring this Bill
(Hon. Mr. Crowe) need not be fearful of a
little loss of time, because sanction cannot bc
given te the Bill before the Deputy Governor
coens down. The honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) can perhaps
tell ns whether the Royal Assent is likely to
be given to private legislation before another
supply bill is brought down.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: The City of Vancouver,
North Vancouver, and the surrounding district, as well as West Vancouver, are interested
in this Bill. If it pisses the Senate, they will
feel assured of the Roval Assent being given
later, and they will be in a position to call
for tenders for the work. Delay in passinmg
this Bill would inconvenience a great number
of people.
Hon. Mr-. KING: It is the municipalities
of Greater Vancouver, North Vancouver and
West Vancouver, who desire this Bill. I know
that the Reeve of North Vancouver and other
Hon. Mr.

WILLOUGHBY.

officers have been in Ottawa waiting to be
called before the committee. Now, if it is
net too much to ask that this matter b
facilitated, such action would be greatly
appreciated by the municipalities affected.
Hon.
Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
members, I have no objection whatever to
the legislation referred to in this Bill, but I
would respectfully point out that the Bill
has just been introduced. It has net yet had
second reading. Objection bas been made by
several honourable gentlemen to second reading being given. There is no possibility o
the Bill getting Royal Assent for some time.
This House will continue to sit this week,
and, no doubt, again next week, because interim supply must be granted.
I respectfully suggest that under all the circumstances
there is no reason why we should depart from
the standing rules that we profess to follow.
I do not think our doing so would make any
material difference. I think it is unwise to
carry on a controversy of this sort when thero
appear te be differences of opinion in tLe
House in regard to the Bill.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
am at a disadvantage, because members speak
so low and se softly, or my ears are getting a
little dull. I asked my honourable friend
what Bill was under consideration. He gave
me the name of the Bill, and I looked on the
Order Paper, but the Bill is not mentioned
there.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It has just been
introduced; it received the first reading, and
the second reading is asked for it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
do net think we dare do a thing like that
if we would hold our reputation. Gracious!
The other day a third reading came very
near passing, just like a snap of the fingera Bill that I considered to be a very important
one. If we legislate in that way we shall
lose all reputation as a parliamentary body.
If somebody's life depended on it, or somi
serious thing of that kind, I should not object
to hurried action. We can only justify ouirselves, one with the other, by following our
rules, unless some emergent condition crie

LAW CLERK AND LAW LIBRARY OF
THE SENATE
DISCUSSION

Before the Orders of the Day:
lion. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable menkers,
with the leave of the House I should like
to caîl the attention of the Government to
the fart that the late Mr. Creigiton, Law
Clerk of the Senate, bias flot been replaced.
It is very important that this position should
be filled as soon as possible by the appointment of a competent barrister, because without such an officer we have no means of consulting anybody on legal matters, unless we
go to the Minister of Justice.
I should like algo to eall the attention
of the Government to the fact that Mr.
Creightoni lef t a most valuable library. It
is, I know, a library that cannot be replaced,
and I cannot insist too strongly that it
should be kept absolutely intact as the property of the Senate.
Han. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I will make it my duty to convey
the substance of my honourable friend's
rcmarks to the Prime Minister and to, the
Minister of Justice. I realize the necessity
of having a Law Clerk or someone with
whomn to consult. 1 have not discussed a
change in the present method of procedure,
nor do I know it to be the policy of the
Government to make a change, but perhaps
we should have a Parliamentary Counsel who
would deal with the legislation coming before
both Bouses, and would have a subordinate
official in each House.
As to the lihbrary of the late Mr. Creighton,
I shaîl take that matter up at the very
earliest moment when I can get access to

SENATE
either of those very busy gentlemen, the
Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice.
I do not know accurately to what extent
this library was the property of the Law
Clerk.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is the property
of the Senate, and should be kept intact.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am not unfamiliar with the library. My tastes impel
me to make use of libraries, and I have been
to this one very often. I do net think there
should be any difficulty in keeping the library
intact for the use of the Senate, and I
shall be very glad to take up the matter
and report upon it later.
Hon. R. DANDURA.ND: If my memory
serves me correctly, we had, some years ago,
a joint committee of the Senate and the
Houise of Commons to reorganize some of
the services of the two branches of Parliament uînder a plan providing for joint supervision by the two Houses. It was suggested
that there should be but one Parliamentary
Law Clerk, and that he should have an
assistant in each branch.
The Senate at
that time was of the opinion that it should
retain its autonomy and have its own Law
Clerk. The Law
olerk of the Senate is
appointed, I think, by the Civil Service
Commission on the recommendation of the
Senate itself. or its Internal Economy Committee. At the time I speak of there was
eonsiderable discussion as to what appertained
to fie Government and what to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not reiember that. It îmust have been a good
many years ago.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND: A few years ago.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable iembers, as a former Speaker of the
Houise of Commons I had the privilege of
being in daily contact with the Law Clerk of
that House; and I know that for some years
past, when Mir. Creighton was failing in
healtht, the question whether it would not
bc preferable to have the law clerks of the
House of Commons act also for the Senate
was openly discussed. Everyone knows that
h
in view of the financial position of the
country this is a period of strict economy.
Knowing Mr. Troop and Mr. Ollivier, both
doctors of law and able pairliamentary
counsel, I think they would make excellent
officers for both Houses. Indeed, the late
Mr. Creighton told me that he found very
little to alter in the legislation which came
here from the otheir House. Under such
cireumstances I merely suggest that again there
should be some inquiry into the question
lion. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

whether it might not be preferable to have
those two very able gentlemen act for both
branches of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Wlhere would they be
stationed?
Hon. GEORGE PARENT: Honourable
snembers, I have not much to add to what
the honourable gentleman from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) has just said; only that
as Chairman of the Privalte Bills Committee
of the House of Commons last session and a
few sesions before, I thought it proper to have
a report made by the two law officers whose
names have just been mentioned. Every
time their report came before me in the
committee I wished very much that others
could be there to appreciate the value of the
work of these officers. I fully agree with the
honourable senator's remark that if the services of these two men were available, the
miembers of a committee would know better
what siuld be done with legislation.
With the
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
permission of the House I would make another observation, in reference to wihat the
lionourable senator for Quebec (Hon. Mr.
Parent) lias said. I have no adverse comments to make on the ability of the law
offioers of the other House. I think they
arc both capable, and are giving satisfaction.
Bot it does suggest itself to me that as we
arc the revising House, one of our primary
function
being to scrutinize carefully and
to revise the logislation that comes fron
the House of Commons, we cannot very well
tsk the legal officers of the Commons to
revise a Bill which they have presumably
supervised and put before that Chanber.
That would be a most anomalous position to
place them in.
My own suggestion. made a few moments
ago-and I have no idea whether or net the
change, involving flie expenditure of more
money , would meet the views of the Gcvernment-i. tliat we -hould have an officer of
our own. tlie Commons shoutld have its own
offieer, and over those two there should be
perhaps a Parliamîentary Counsel, a man of
eminente as a draughtsmuan. I think that in
the consideîration of bills in committee wce
oghtl
te hâve at or disposal the services
of a legal authority. Undoubtedly the House
of Commons docs mucli more work than the
Senate. and its sittings are more frequent;
iberefore 1 am afraid that when we needed
a law clerlk to assist us in committee hc would
not alway. be available if we were dependent
on the services of one man. In dealing with
a Bill in committec we want to know whether

MAY 20, 1931
or flot the Bill is properly drafted, and
whether it is competent for this House to do
what is proposed.
That was the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
conclusion arrived at by that joint committee.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
advantage of knowing that.

I had not the

Hon. 'Mr. BELCOURT: 1 desire to say,
in two words, that I entirely agree with the
remarks of the honourable leader of the
Government. 1 think we should. have a Law
Clerk of our own here, and not be dependent
on the Law Clerk of another House, for the
reasons given by my honourable friend, and
for others which I might mention if 1 thought
it necessary to do so.
THE BEAUHTIARNOIS PROJECT
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. L. McDOUGALD: Honourable
memibers of the Senate, 'before the Orders of
the Day, I rise on a question of privilege.
According to the newspapers of this morning
the honour and integrity of myself as a member
of this House have been attacked in ano-ther
place, and 1 désire to draw attention at once to
a statement which I made in the Senate in
April, 1928, regarding my position in the muchdiscussed Beauharnois Power Company. Newspaiper articles had refle'cted on inyseif and
other members of the National Advisory
Committee reporting on the !St. Lawrene
Waterways. It was insinuated that our decisions and recommendations were influenced
by personal interest in power developments
on the St. Law.rence. In this House I stated
at the time that 1 had no interest. in the Beauharnois Power Company nor in the syndicate.
That was absolutely true and correct. I may
say at once that up ta that time I had been
invited on many occasions to become a member of that syndicate, 'but had always declined.
After that date I was asked again, and had
the whole project investigated -from every
angle. When 1 was satisfied that it was a
proper project for me as a member of týhis
Senate, as a business man, and as a citizen
of Canada, ta take a financial interest in, I
agreed to do so. 'Some six months later, in
October, 1928, 1 took an interest in the Beauharnois syndicate. I want to assure this Bouse
and the country that I was not considering
polities or party in any way in 'becoming a
member of that syndicate, and was influenced.
solely by my business judgment.

I may add that I put into the syndicate dollar
for dollar with every other inember of it, and
when it was di.ssolved 1 received my portion
of the common stock in the new company,
and my portion of the money distributed, as
did every other memaber of that syndica-te.
Now I 'have no apology to make for accepting the chairmanship of that company, nor
have I any apology to offer on behaîf of the
company. I state at once that the men who
had the vision and the courage to undertake
the building of that great power canal, with
ail its potential advantages, should be commended instead of being condemned.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McDOUGALD: At the present
moment the Beauharnois Power Company
are employing 3,000 men on the site of the
work, and they are employing 3,000 men in
factories manufacturing parts. That is 6,000
men, and that figure, when multiplied by 5,
which is the average number dependent on
the working man, shows that at the present
time about 30,000 people of this country are
ohtaining their daily bread through the
activities of the Beauharnois Company.
I need hardly point out to honourable
'members of the Senate that a project of
such magnitude is bound to be criýticized
in certain circles, but I can assure you that
hefore the 830,000,000 of debentures were
hought from the Beauharnois Power Company the bankers who unýdertook to underwrite them had every phase of the company
investigated hy the best legal brains in Canada.
To convince honourable gentlemen
that the project had the most careful consideration from, the legal point of view, 1
need only mention a few of the legal lights
who passed upon the undertaking. The firm.
of Lash, Anglin and Cassels were representing the Dominion Securities Company, who
were one of the backers. In Mantreal Mr.
Aimé Geoffrion, who is known from one end
of Canada to the other as one of our ablest
lawyers, was the legal adviser of the company; Brown, Montgomery and MeMichael
were the legal advisers *of Hoit, Gundy and
Company; and the firm. of Meredith, Holden
and Howard were the legal advisers of Newman, Sweezey and Company. The Bank of
Montreal, the Royal Bank of Canada, and
the Canadian Bank of Commerce associated
themselves with the backers and underwrote
the securities; and I say at once that they
would flot be a party to a deal of such magnitude without examining into it very carefully and considering every aspect of the
situation.

SENATE
It was also stated that I had made
$30000,000 out of the deal. The statement is
so ridiculous that I feel it is hardly necessary
to make reference to it. As the market
value of Beauharnois shares to-day is quoted
at $6, it is obvionus to any honourable gentleman and to the country that the statement
is quite erroneous.
I ask honourable gentlemen again to take
my word and my assurance that when I
made the statement in this House it was the
truth, and nothing but the truth. In another
place a committee is to be appointed to investigate this whole Beauharnois project, and
I am confident that the whole thing will be
cleared up there to the entire satisfaction of
both Houses of Parliament and the country
at large.
REFLECTION UPON

THE SENATE

QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLFSWORTH: Honourabl niembers, I ask the indulgence of the
Senate for a moment to bring before vour
attention another matter of privilege, which
to my mind affects each member of this
honourable House. On looking oeor the
official record of proceedings of the House
of Commons of yesterday--not Hansard, but
the Votes and Proceedings of the CommonsI find a notice that to-morrow a inember of
that House will publicly ask the Government,
in regard to the appointment of an honourable in-ember of t'his House, whose name is
mnentioned: "Does he possess the necessary
education?" If that question can be asked

CRIMINAL CODE (ESCAPES BY
FLIGHT) BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON moved the
second reading of Bill G, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bilil is
the same as one that I introduced at a former
session. At the very outset I wish to make
it clear to honourable members that this is
not a bill to disari the police, nor is it a
bill which would circumscribe the right of
the police to use any force they choose in
arresting or seeking to arrest a person
charged with a crime formerly known as a
felony. I feel it necessary to make these
lion.

Mr. McDOU(ALD.

statements because, although the last time
I introduced a similar measure I made the
same point perfectly clear, I have been told
that the purpose of my Bill is to disarm the
police. An honourable
member
of this
House told me last night that he was opposed
to the Bill for that very reason. I hope it
is now distinctly understood that the Bill
has no such object. It is intended simply to
prevent the police from shooting or maiming
a person whom he seeks to arrest for a misdemeanour.
At cominon law, and that is the law of Canada, misdeneanours are generally punishable
by fine or imprisonment, formerly without,
but now with or without hard labour, according to the circumstances of each case. Our
criminal law formerly recognized two classes
of offences, one known as felonies and the
other as misdemeanours. This is one of the
imost important points of my argument, and
I particularly draw the attention of honourable meimbers to it, so that my position may
be clearly understood. Felony is punishable
in various modes, as by death or penal servitude for life, or lessor ternis, mav felonies
having special punishments attached to them.
Where no specifie punishient is provided,
felony is punishable by penal servitude for
not less than thro vears, or imprisonient for
not more than two years, with or without
bard labour. Felony, strictly speaking, includes
ireason, although the terns are generally used
as opposed to one another. Instances of felony
in the more usual sense of the word are:
piracy. murder, inanslaughter, rape, larceny.
robbery, burglary, arson, soime kinds of assault, and certain acts resembling treason.
In order to be concise in my statement of
the law, I took the liberty of writing to the
judge who is perhaps the most eminent in
criminal law matters in England. He was
courteous enough to reply and give me an
exposition of the law as it stands in England
to-day. I asked him if I might mention his
name, and he told me that if I found it
aldvisable to refer to him in the Sonate I
should siiply say he was a member of the
Court of Criminal Appeal of England. I
i-an assure honourable members that he is
regarded by all lawyers in Canada as the
highest authority on criminal law. My purpose in writing him was to ascertain under
what circumstances a policeman or any
officer of the law was justified in, or had an
excuse for, shooting to death or maiming a
flieing criminal or a person charged with an
offence.
Here is what this great English
jurist says is the law:
Au oflicer of justice mîay justify the killing
of a person fl3 ing froi arrest for treason or
felony,-

MAY 20, 1931
I have already stated what felony la.
-but te justify it, it muet bie ehown that the
felon could nc.t bie otherwiee overtaken, and if
he could bie taken in any case without euch
severity it ie at least manslaughter in hiru
who kille him, and the jury ought to enquire
xvhether it was done of necessity or flot. But
where the person has committed a miedemeanour only and ie flying from arrest the officer
mnust net kilI him though, there je a warrant to
apprehend him and though he cannet otherwise
bie overtaken. If he does kiI him, it will in
general be murder, but it may amount only to
mnanslaugliter if it appeare that death was flot
intended.
My contention ha.s always 'been that section 41 of the Crimin-al Code, which is the
section that would be amended Ihy this Bill,
dees net justify the klling of a person under

any cir.cumstances.

The section merely means

that an officer inay use su<rh force as is noces-

sary to arrest a fleeing person alive. But
some inferior tribunals, such as inagistrates'
courts and county courts, have decided that
the section justifies an offleer in shooting anyone, whether guilty or not guilty, ch'arged or
nlot charged, wbo seeks to, escape by ffight.
In a moment or so I shahl give an illustration
of an outstanding case that was decided along
that uine.
'Our law in this connection is exactly the
saine as in England. In England they have
the common law; in Canada we have the
common law codified. At one time a Royal
Commission was appointed in England to consider the question of codifying the law. The
Commnission drew up a code, but it was not
adopted, because the judges took the stand
that its adoption would 'be imprudent for this
reason. ainong others: that some important
cases might be atcidentally omitted fromn the
code, and this might resuit in the introduction
of teclinicalities into the administration of
the law, since, if there is a code, judges are
bound iby the very letter of it. However, Sir
John Thompson, when hie was Minister of
Justice, did adopt a code; but hle wisely included a clause which particularly and clearly
declared that the -common law, unless directly
repealedHon. Mr. BEIQUE: What clause?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Sixteen.
Hon. Mr. LYN'CH-STAUNTON: -should
romain in force. That is provided for in section 16 of the Code, which reads:
16. Ail rules and principles ef the common
i aw which render any circumstanees a justification or exeusp for any aet, or a defence to any
eharge, shaîl remain in force and bie applicable
to any deftnce to a charge under this Act
except in so far as they are hereby altered or
are iniconsistent herewith.

An officer has a right to arrest without a
warrant any person whom he knows or

reasontbly suspects to be guilty of a felosiy,
and if such a person atternpts to, escape and
the officer cannot otherwise arrest him, hie
is entitled to shoot at him. 'Uhat is the law,
beyond a doubt. I1f the offi.cer does shoot
at a person under such circumstances, and
ia later brought to trial, hie justifies himself,
as lawyers say, or excuses himself, under section 16 of t>he Criminal Code, which preserves
aIl the defences that existed before the Code
was enacted.
Now, as 1 have already said, the purpose of
section 41 is net to legalize a fatal shooting.
That is eovered by section ý16. The first
reported case which lays dorwn a deeision with
respect to section 41 is a Manitoba case
which went to the Court of Appeal of that
province and is resported in 13 Canadian
Criminal Cases. That case started the ignorant on their unlawful course, and inepired
the findings of some magistrates and county
court judges. In that case a man who was
caught breaking into a shop with intention
to commit theïft was detected

and chased

by an officer who shot at and fataily wounded
him. The trial judge-I think it was Mr.
Justice Perdue-ioid the jury, in substance,
that if they found that the deceased, man
had been about to rob the shop, or that the
officer had reasona>ble grounds for suspecting
hlm of such intention, the offioer was justified in shooting him, or was excused, if the
man attempted to escape and the officer
could not overtake andi capture hlm exoept
by shooting. Mr. Justice Perdue laid clown
the law exactly as it ia stated by the English
judge whom I have already quoteti. As I
have sa-id, the law was in that case rightly
interpreted by the trial iudige, if I may say eo,
because the decision. was ajflerwarde confirmed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal;
but my objection is that it has been applied
to, entirely different facts.
No 'w I want te cite a few cases in point.
Such instances axe happening ail the time.
The other day two boys escaped from the
Industrial Home in Toronto. As they went
clown. one of the streets cf the city they saw
a inotor car standing by the sida of the road.
Tbey got into, it, but did nlot know how to
operate it. Then they noticed one of the
attendants cf thé Industrial Home talking te
a policeman, and they jumped out cg the car
and ran. The policeman pursued thcm and
shot one cf them.

and fell in a heap. The officer was prosecuted,
and the boy went into the witness box and
told his story. He said that when he saw
the Home attendant he ran away, and that
as he was about to climb over a fence ho
heard shots fired, and he fell. He said that
there was no call te him to stop-nothing to
let him know that he was ibeing pursued, and
that after he had been shot. as the officer
came up to him, he said to the officer, "You
are a dirty coward for shooting me." That
was all the evidence. The offiecer was not
called to state that he could net overtake
the boy, or te show any excuse or justification
wbatever for his action. Yet the magistrate,
a magistrate of the city of Toronto, told the
officer that it was his duty to shoot the boy,
and discharged him on the spot. I have here
a copy of a newspaper containing all the particulars of the case, but instead of reading
them I have given you an exact summary of
what happened. Incredible as it may seem,
the defence was net called upon to present
any evidence.
The other nýight at Belleville an old man was
seen in the railway yards, from which soneone had been stealing brass fittings. When
this man was found there ho started to run
away, and although the constable did not
know what the man was doing, he shot him.
Fortunately he did not kill him.
I think, honourable members, that the
present situation is outrageous. Emerson once
defined civilization as "the sanctity of human
life." According to his test, those peoples
who keep the strongest safeguard against the
takinz of human life are in the most advanced
state of civilization.
Not long ago a Canadian rum-runerCaptain Bluett, I think, was his name-was
killtd by an American officer. In the eyes
of some people rum-rnmning is a greater
offence than miirder. Yet the Toronto Star,

this the Star replied, "Guilty cf no crime ."
In commenting upon the case the Star went

had been .allowed to lie for twenty-four
hours before being identified.
At a meeting held in Fennel Hall the other
night one of the most distinguished citizens
of the United States condemned what he
called "licensed legal murder." People are
becoming outraged by this sort of thing. I
had thought that in the United States a
police officer had the right te shoot a fleeing
man whether be was innlocent or guilty. I have
here, however, an article which commends
the action of a certain judge in a case ef
this kind, and which has caused me to change
my view. An officer was told that a motor
car carrying men suspected of being bootleggers was about to pass a certain place at
which ho was stationed. The car was easy
to identify, because on one side of it there
was a white curtain. When the car came by
the officer shot one of the men in it through
the heart and killed him. The officer was
arrested and tried, and he set up as his defence that ho was aiming at the wheels. The

where, I suppose, the temperance sentiment
is strong. However, a judge ordered that
the officer be indicted and that a special prose'utor he appointed to lay the case before the
jury. The jury convicted this man of manslaughter. and the conviction was sustained
by the Court of Appeal. The report of thi
case is a lucid exposition of the law of th'
United States, and it goes to show that when
their law is enforced it is the same as the law
,f England, and, I am convinced, of Canada.
One of the Appeal Court judges said:
I ai loati te throw any unnîuecessary birdieii

But wien their safety is in no way endangered

of a misertant wanted for a misleieanour, they'\

is a îoisapprehension

as to the

intention of

this Bill, and that certain officers in the provinces, witbout inquiring at all into the Bill,
have

given

opinions against it

to the Min-

ister of Justice. The last time I brought
up the Bill the Attorney General of one of
the provinces-I am net sure now which one
-sent a protest here, and later, after receiving a copy of the Bill, wrote to me apologizing and saying that he had misunderstood
it; that he had thought its purpose was to
prevent the arming of the police.
I have stated the law, of which I have
made a most careful study. I want te satisfy
the Senate that my only desire is to protect
persons who are innocent or are accused of

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
members, my first duty is a very agreeable
one: I wish to congratulate most heartily and
sincerely the honourable gentleman from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) upon the
remarkable speech that lie made yesterday, in
which hie once again demonstrated lus industry and ability. His example might well
be followed by the younger members of this
Huse who are anxious to do something in
the interests of their country. It may be
apropos at this time to remind honourable
meinhers that not only is the honourable gentleman from Montarville a very distinguished
lawyer in Montreal, but hie is possessed of
such energy that when hie once decides to do
a thing there seems to be no obstacle that hie
is unable to overcome.
Some honourable
senators will remember that immediately after
the war, in which France had been bled
almost to death, hie went across to that country and actually succeeded in getting the
French Government to vote a very substantial
sum of money ta provide- no less than forty
huge motor vans, the sides of which would
open, and by means of which Canadian goods
were exhibited throughout that country.
Without remuneration, simply with the idea
of serving this country and showing what
Canada had to seli, hie travelled ahl over
France, from place to place, addressing two
or three meetings a day, and succeeded in
creating n great enthusiasm for Canada and
Canadian gonds.
I do not believe that
Canada has ever been advertised in sucb a
way, either before or since. Ahl this was done
by the honourable gentleman from a sense of
duty as a member of this House.
On another occasion hie was in New York
with some friends wben Marshal Joffre and
Mr. Viviani were in the United States. The
honourable gentleman conceived the idea of
bringing these two famous men to Canada.
Those who were with him were rather doubtful about the suocess of bis efforts. In the
first iplýace, lie did flot know the French
Amnbassador, who was charged with Iooking
-after the wel.fare of Marshal Joffre and Mr.
Viviani; nevertheless, somebow or other,
during the morning bie managed to get acquainted with this Ambassador, Mr. Jusserand,
and before evening Mr. Jusserand was quite
willing to accede to bis proposaI. Then
,another obstacle arose. The chief of the
United States detective service, a man, I
thinik, by the naine of Bihl Nye, said that hèe
was res;ponsiýble for the safety of these gentlemen and that if they lef t the UnJted States
his responsibility must corne to an end. It
was then arranged to have the Government
provide a special train to bring them here-

SENATE

132

I myself telphoned from New York to the
honourable the Speaker of this House, who
asked if it was Senator Beaubien who was
speaking-and we all remember how Mr.
Viviani delivered before both Houses of
Parliament one of the most eloquent and inspiring speeches to which it has ever been
our privilege to listen. The honourable
gentleman from Montarville also succeeded
in inducing Marshal Joffre to come to
Montreal, and the Marshal's visit created a

very good impression in the Province

of

Quebec.

Now the honourable gentleman has accomplished a very great deal in connection with
the Good-will and Trade Mission to South
America and the West Indies. He did not
wait for anybody to tell him what to do, but
personally interviewed the Ministers of Trade
and Commerce in both Argentina and Brazil.
I think I may say, therefore, that our
honourable colleague is a credit to this
House and to himself, and that he is always
willing to work for the publie good.
I wish also to pay my compliments to the
honourable member from Prince Edward
(Hon. Mr. Horsey). As was demonstrated
yesterday, he very ably seconded the efforts
and the views of the honourable gentleman
from Montarville, and a great deal was done
to advertise Canada.
The debate on this question took place only
last night, and as I have not had much
opportunity to condense what I wish to say,
my remarks may take a little more time
than I intend. It was Pascal who wrote: "I
beg your pardon for the length of this letter;
I have not had time to be brief."
Most of us who were not fortunate enough
to make the trip followed the progress of the
Mission day by day in the newspapers. There
was only one thing missing from their accounts.
J thought that the speeches made were reported, but I failed to see that many speeches
were delivered by the honourable gentleman
from Montarville. That was a d.isappointment
to evcrybody who knows the honourable
gentleman. The people of South America do
net know him very well, or they would have
had him speak to then.
The burden of the speeches of yesterday was
that our trade commissioners have no official
status. Why is this? It is because we have no
consuls. Why should we not have consuls?
In another place some twenty years ago the
late Honoré Gervais, who was Professer of
International Law at Montreal University,
made a speech in which he endeavoured to
show the importance and necessity of Canada
having consuls. The honourable gentleman
ion. Mr. CASGRAIN.

from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) will
remember that the gentleman finished his
speech in Latin. But somehow or other the
British Government, or the British people, who
are very keen when it comes to a matter of
shillings and pence, were not sympathetic,
and as a result we have always been at a
great disadvantage in having to try to sell
Canadian wares through British consuls.
Naturally, when the British consuls are asked
where certain things can be bought, they refer
the inquirer to Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield,
or Birmingham before mentioning any place
outside of the British Isles. I cannot blame
them for that; it is part of their business to
bring trade to the British Isles. This lack of
consuls may seem a snall affair when we remember that the British Government allowed
us to have our own Ministers in Japan, France,
and the United States. But these Ministers
are diplomats; they are not -commercial agents.
Our situation in this regard reminds nie of
the time when Britain gave India some of her
splendid regiments; for instance, the Bengal
Incers, a cavalry corps equal to, or perhaps
better than. any other in the world; also the
Sikhs, a regiment of magnificent men comBut Britain

gave them no artillery. Some ye.ars ago, when
there was a threat of war, a parley was
arranged, and they came to the English people
and said: "Look here, we are going to rebel,
but you cannot use your artillery in the war:
it would not be fair." That was very prudent,
becaus", as everyone knows. with artillery the
British forces could do away with the Hindoos
before they could use their rifles.
We were surprised when we heard yesterday of the great amount of interest that the
I
British Isles are taking in Argentina.
understand that the British people have larger
sums invested in Argentina than in Canada.
Naturally they want some returns on their
invest.ments, and they are perhaps more
eager to do business with Argcntina than with
their colonies.
In the report of the Good-will Trada
Mission there are twenty-six recommendations, und they ail appear to be good. It is
easy te have good intentions, but to put
them into practice is more difficult. This
trade with Argentina is not what might be
called new. For instance, in- 1886 Cook
Broth"rs' mills at Servant River were cutting
about 25,000,000 feet. bcard neasure, for
Argentina, and it was being eut on specifications of 13 and 16 feet in length, clear
lumber. Those mills are opposite Manitoulin Island, near Blind River and Spanish
River, and half way on the railway line

MAY 20, 1931
between Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie. In
those days there was one schooner, with an
auxiliary towing two consorts, and I t'hink
those three boats together carried nearly a
billion feet of lumber. Tliey went down
Georgian Bay, through Lake Huron, Detroit
River, Lake St. Clair, and across Lake Erie
to Tonawanda, where the lumber was put into
barges on the Erie Canal, which had only six
f ee.t draft of water at that time, and taken
down to Troy and Alibany, whence Saxe
Brothers, the agents of Cook Brothers, shipped
it straiglit to Argentina. This was forty-4ive
years ago.
In Inter years the Canada Cernent Comipany
did a very profitable trade in cernent with
Argentina, 1 arn told. Eyen in littie Newfoundýland there ýwa9 'a trade with South
America. The last time I was in Newfoundland 1 saw a magnificent four-masted
schooner ioaded with fish right frorn the
warehouse of H.on. Mr. Monroe, the Prime
Minister. whose warehouse for dried codish
was at the sea-shore. I did not take very
much interest in the cargo cf salt codfish,
but I admired the wonderful steering gear, a
contrivince that was absolutely new to me.
It was a beautiful schooner, and I was inf ormed that the trip would take about thirty
days frorn Newfoundland to Buenos Aires.
A Nova Scotia captain who was bowling
down the east coast of South Amenica witli a
fair west wind, after a trip of over 6,000
miles, said to the mate: "In twenty minutes we
should see the lights of Montevideo. Send
someone alof t." Fifteen minutes later a voice
called from the crow's-nest, "Liglit on the
starboard bowl" It was the liglits of Montevideo. The captain was five minutes out in
his reckoning.
The wonderful development of Buenos
Aires is to a very great extent due to an
English engineer called Sir Robert Perks, who
was well known in Canada, as he came here
and wanted to build the Georgian Bay Canal.
He had a great deal of money from the great
Meth'odist banks in London. He told the
people here that lie had dredged the bar of
La Plata River. Alluvium during centuries
had formed an enormous bar, and 1 do not
think there was more than ten or twelve feet
of water over it. Before that bar was dredged
the population of Buenos Aires was around
200,000, but after the bar had heen removed
and the harbour of Buenos Aires properly
excavated, and wharves built, the population
jumped in twenty years from 200,000 to
2,000,000. The channel that lie made at that
time-I do nlot know whether it is deeper
to-day-was twenty-two feet deep; and that
was the maximum drauglit of ships that could
enter the hiarbour.

133

Canadian seamen are also very familiar
with La Plata River, and people fond of sailing may have heard the stories told during
the l.qst fifty years. Our seamen liad been
sailing slips drawing not more than ten or
twelve feet of water across the bar. Going
up' the river they were towed, and tliey came
down with the current on their return journey.
I recaîl these facts simply to show our dear
friends who have just come from that mission
that they need not think themselves new

South America.
Argentina lias a population of over
10,000,000. It extends from Bolivia on the
north to Cape Horn, a distance of twentythrce hundred miles; say 30 degrees of latitude. The greatest width is 930 miles, from
the Andes to the ocean. It is described now
as extending to Cape Horn. But where are
we to find Tierra del Fuego, whicli, I always
understood frcm the geography, was separated
from thc continent hy the Strait of Magellan?
Tierra del Fuego was so ntamed because the
crews of thc slips that wcnt througli the
Strait of Magellan in the old days saw on the
shor7es thc fires that had been lighted owing
to the severity of thc climate. I cannot
understand wliy no mention is made of Týierra
del Fuiego, unless the explanation is that
Argentina lias anncxcd it to lier territory.
In Argentina there is an immense area of
225 million acres available for grazing, ranching, wheat raising, and so on; an area equal,
I believe, to that of our three Prairie Provinces. In a short period the population lias
doubled, because of a large influx of people
from Spain and Soutliern Italy, who find the
climate very mucli like their own. Meat is
vcry cheap there, and is one of the principal
articles of diet; in fact, an average of 198
pounds per capita is consumed annually.
Notwithstanding what the medical profession
may say against the eating of meat in large
quantities, these people seemn to thrive on it.

Monroe Doctrine. Well, as all honourable
members are aware, this was named after
President Monroe, but it really was the work
of one of the Cunnings. There wcrc three
Cannings, and I do net know which one this
was. It was arranged that the United States
should stand on guard to prevent European
powers from taking a share in the politics
of flic American continent. But Canada already was a British country, and Engiand
found it easier to retain possession while the
United States prevented any other European
country from attempting to acquire territory
on this continent.
I believe that Canada should have consuls
in South America. In my hand I have a
sheet published by the United States Government, showing some of the services that
can be performed by consuls.
The sheet
shows at the top the number of American
consuls in various parts of the world, as
follows: 209 in Europe, 90 in Asia, 24 in
Africa, 35 in South America, Il in Central
America, 91 in North America, 17 in Australia and 23 in the West Indies.
Those
figures are very interesting. For instance,
in South Africa we possibly have one or two
trade commissioners who are not possessed
of diplomatie status. I ask honourable members, what chance have they to represent
our country in competition with the 24
trained consuls from the United States, each
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of whom bas a status? Most of the 91 consuls who represent the United States in
North America must bc in Canada, because,
I suppose, there are not very many in Mexico.
This sheet is divided into various sections
to show what can bu donc by consuls for
the separate departments of the American
Government. The Department of State,
which is the first department in the United
States, gives the following list of headings:
Protection of American citizens; protection
of American interests; political and economic
reports;
consular courts;
extra-territorial
notarial services; depositions and commissions; relief of American seamen; estates of
American seamen; citizenship; registration of
Americans;
passport services, Americans;
alien visa control; deaths of Americans;
estates of deceased Americans; witnesses to
marriages; recordation of vital statistics; miscellaneous correspondence.
I might remark here that the United States,
with its population of 120 millions and its
huge wealth, manages to get along witl only
ten government departments, and they seei
to be doing their work very efficiently. Perhaps Canada could learn a lesson froin the
United States in this regard.
Then the sheet gives a list of consular duties
that may be performed for the Treasury Department, under these headings: protection of
revenue:
documentation
of merchandise;
valuation of imports; landing certificates;
pro.tection of public litalth; bills of health;
sanitary reports; disinfection of nmerchandise;
prohibited importations. smuggling; prohibition laws; valuation of currencies; war risk
insurance ; investigations, reports, payments.
The War Departient is third. with these
consular dutits listed: purchases of raw
material;
supplies and equipment;
geographical data; topographical data; Philippine
muatters: military inventions; military progThon the Department of Justice: extradition; estates of American seamen; crimes on
high sras; notarial service s; tdepositions and
cornmissions; reports regarding anarchists, etc.
That is something that would be of interest
to us.
And the Post Office Department has these
htadings: reports on postal conventions and
regulations; parcels post; postal banking;
Anierican Post Office at Shanghai.
Thon comes the Navy Department: reports
on hydrographie data and charts; lighthouses;
harbour and coaling facilities; wireless stations;
river and harbour markings; port rules and
regulations; geographie and marine data;
iiovments of vessels.

MAY 20, 193113
The seventh on the list is the Department
of Agriculture, and the consular services in
connection witb that department are set out
as follows;: crop reports and estimates; mar-ket
reports; plant introduction; weather reports;
disinfection of hides, rags, etc.; plant quarantime; insecticide and fungicide regulations;
reports on irrigation projects; entomology;
biology; horticulture, and general agricultural
matters.
Then under the heading of Interior Department is this list: pension matters; patent
applications; patent interference cases; iÊeportsý
on education; geological surveys; mines and
mining; reclamation and conservation.
The Department of Commerce, which is
No. 9 on the list. specifies these services: extension of American trade; voluntary trade
reports; called-f or reports and investigations;
trade opportunities; navigation; American
vessels; entry and clearance; American seamen; shipment; discbarge; desertion; marine
protests; reports on fisheries; lighthouses;
measures and standards; coast and geodetic
surveys.
Finally, the Department of Labour bas this
list: immigration; Chinese exclusion laws;- section 6 certificates; reports on labour conditions; labour legislation.
Then there is the following list of services
that may be rendered to America~n citizens
in general: general correspondence; replies to
individual trade inquiries; answers to miscellaneous inquiries; receipt and forwarding of
mail; advice and assistance to travellers,
tourists and salesmen; representation; notarial
acts; protection of interests so far as laws
and regulations permit; welfare and whereabouts.
This chart or statement concludes with the
f ollowing remarks:
American, Consuls serve pr.actically eVEry
branch of our Government, every business man,
and either directly or indirectly every private
citizen.
This chart shows how information gathered
by them is concentrated in the Department of
State and then distributed to the various
governinental agencies and to private concerfis
and individuals.
A consul's more important duties are shown,
but by no means ahl of them.
Ministers look after the political end of a
country's representation abroad, but business
matters are attended to by consuls. It is
high time that we appointed more consuls.
Why should we keep ministers in certain
countries when consuls would cost us considerably less? I do not know that the British
Govern'ment has not been in favour of our enj oying consular services in certain countries;
I arn not making any char ge, but the thing

looks strange. I know that when Canadians
try to do business abroad they always find
the British Consul enquires first whether
goods can be obtained in Britain instead of
in any of the Dominions. No one can accuse
me of being anti-British. As I have said before, I do flot believe in having at Washington, for instance, seven differcnt representatives of the King. If they ail are to agree,
one would be enough; and if they are to
di.sagree, there are six tool many. However,
that isHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Settled.
Hon. Mr. CAiSGRALN: The consular service and the diplomatie service are différent
things: although, I am aware, in somne small
Europcan countries, like Denmark and
Sw2Žden, the ambassador--or minister, for there
are. only seven ambassadors in the world-is
minister and consul combined. When I visited
Holland I spoke to the minister, 'who, was
good enough to visé my passport, and I did
not have to, pay for it. I shauld have been
born Scotch.
If this Trade Mission hais demonstrated one
thing more than another it is Canada's need
of more consuls. A country sending ministers
9,broad before consuls is like a child trying
to i-un before he has crawled along the floor.
The consular service should be established
fi-st, and then, if we can afford it, the appointment of a minister may be made. We
should nlot put the cart before the horse.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable senators,
1 arn sure that every honourable member of
this Bouse was deeply impressed with the
importance of the address delivered yesterday by the honourable gentleman from Montai-ville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). I hope that
the honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) will draw to the attention
of the Prime Minister the fact that a great
deal of valuable work may be done for Canada if the suggestions made by the honourable
gentleman are followed.
Hon. J. S. MeLEN.q'NAN: Honourable senators, I amn not able, nor should I care to
attempt, to deal with the vast amount of information which has been given to us in the
address of the honourable member fromn Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) in connection
with South America. We have. had presented
for oui- attention a great deal of matter that
should be given very careful consideration.
Notwithstanding the eloquence of the
hono.urable senator from Montarville, I was
under a misapprehension last night in respect
to bis reference to the British Minister in
Argentina, who, I understand, is a man of

136

SENATE

great experience, energy and ability. However, apparentiy I had heard the honourable
gentleman somewhat imperfectly and had not
clearly understood all the debate that followed.
I learned, on reading Hansard this morning,
that it was a matter entirely concerning our
own commercial agent, and that he was
rescued from what might have been an embarrassing position by the tact and savoirfaire of the two distinguished gentlemen who
had the interview with the Minister of
Argentina. It was not, as I had thought, the
British Ambassador or any of his staff who
did not know the situation. Considering the
fact that in Buenos Aires there is one of the
finest newspapers of Latin America, I was
somewbat astonished that our commercial
representative had net become aware, even
unofficia'lly, that the entire policy had been
changed. It is not easy to believe that such
a vital change of policy by the new Government, or the establishment of a commission
to give effect to that policy, would fail toa
secure a prominent place in the news. It
seems intolerable that information concerning
any suoh thing should be in the possession of
a British embassy, a British legation, or a
British consul, and net be open to an
authorized representative of Canada. If that
is the situation, it should be changed at once.
I find it hard to believe that it is the general
practice not to pass on such information when
it is germane to the interests of Canada or
one of the other Dominions.
There is no question that the relations of
Canada with foreign countries will, as the
years--one might almost say the months-go
by, become more and more important and
vital to our country, because we can produce,
not only in raw materials, but in manufactured
produrts, far more than our ten millions of
people can use. Therefore it must be the
wish of everyone in this country that the way
should be cleared for those who go out to
develop our trade; and it seems to me that
if, as would appear to be the case, our trade
commissioners and the British embassies or
legations or consuls in foreign countries are
in air-tight compartments, it is only necessary
that proper representations should be made
to London in order to remedy the matter.
Our colleague from Prince Edward (Hon.
Mr. Horsey) suggested that the next Imperial
Conference might consider this question with
a view to removing existing difficulties. It
seems to me that one method of amelioration
-and I speak without any special knowledge
on the subject-would be to have a Canadian
commercial attaché at the British legations
and embassies. The expense of maintaining
these attachés would be borne by Canada, and
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN.

they would report to Canada, withholding
nothing, of course, from the representatives of
the Empire in the places where they were
stationed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That has

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: That might be
reconsidered. I am bound to say that I should
like to sec a concentration of the energies of
the Dominion and of Great Britain in that way
rather than that emphasis should be laid on
the apparent disposition of Canada or of any
other British Dominion ta break away from the
Mother Country. I would call the attention
of the honourable gentleman who suggested
the establishment of legations or embassies
to the account in Holy Writ of a young
gentleman of Judea who, when he came of age,
was filled with a desire to show his independence, and took his patrimony, went off
to a foreign country and squandered his
substance, just as we are doing with our money
in building expensive legations. I do not think
that we want to follow the example of that
ill-fated young Hebrew.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What doos my'
honourable friend say of the twenty countries.
ail much smaller than Canada, which hav
their representatives all over the world?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: I would say that
that is a condition which has developed fron
lime past, when countries, even though quite
close together, carried on business with onc
another through such representatives. They
were concerned, not with what we are considering, namely, the development of trade,
but with the larger questions of international
relations and high politics.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend approves, I suppose, of the action of
Sir Robert Borden in establishing a legation
in Washington?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
As a good Conservative I undoubtedly do. As an individual
I think that possibly it was somewhat premature. I am in sympathy with it inasmuch
as in the gradual building up of a regular
diplomatie corps there would be an incidental
advantage. It is this: we are developing, and
with the increasing importance and inereasing
wealth of Canada there will grow up a considerable number of young men who do not
need to work for a livinz, and who, having
financial resources behind them that would
permit them to take an expensive training and
to maintain themselves, no! in splendour, but
without being bitten by the necessity of

MAY 20, 1031
constantly thinking of their daily expenditures, would find in diplomacy a most useful
and pleasant way of serving their country.
Some of these young men may have no great
gen jus for any of the ordinary professions,
and no great incentive to make more money,
but xnay feel attraeted to publie service eutside the ordinary political sphere. To many
of them, perhaps to the ehoicest spirits a¶nong
them, there would be an appeal in a diplomatir or representative life, in working for
the benefit of Canada in supplying hier with
information and suggesting methods by whieh
hier prosperity could be increased.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In order to
devel*op that phase of the mat-ter, I sheuld
like to ask the honourable gentleman whether
hie means that they should be of consular
rank. Are th.ey going ilito what hie calls the
diplomatic service, or what?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I should say the
diplomatie service. None of these things are
absolutely fixed. We are to-day utilizing machinery whieh was invented long ago, and to
which additions have been made through the
ages. That machinery can be modified. As
I understand it, a consul has not access to
the governing body of a state. That is one
of the reasons why I suggest commercial
attachés. Probably within a very short time
a number of young men of the kind I have
mentioned could be trained and placed in the
service of the country, and if we established
a legation they would be fitted to go there.
I have looked uip certain information as to
Argentina, as the honourable gentleman
opposite (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has obviously
done, and I find that in that country England has, first of all, an ambassador. I have
made some inquiries aïbout him, and I find. that
hie is just such a man as I have described.
There are on his staff a counsellor and a coinniercial counsellor. As I understand it, the
counsellor ranks above the chargé d'affaires
and is the highest oficial in the embassy next
to the ambassador himself. In the city of
Buenos Aires theïre are now available for
Canada a consul general and four vice-consuls,
a somewhat elaborate staff even for a very
important place.
Should there be anything in what I have
said that commenâg it.selýf te the representative
of the Government in this House, I should be
glad if hie would calI it te the attention cg
-the Govermment.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable
gentlemen, I have followed this debate with
a great deal of interest, and I wish te offer
my congratulations to the honourable memiber
from Montarvilie (Hon. Mr. Beau-bien) upon

137

the very clear statement that hie gave us
yesterday of his Good-will Mission te, South
America. There is one point that I should
like te commend te my fellow members. The
honourable gentleman from Montarville said
yesterday that the publie mnen he met in
South America-in Brazil and Argentinawere familiar with the French language and
the English language. I have noticed recently that in the city of Torontu), and aIso
in the city of Mentreal, there are two or
three high schools where the $panish language
is taughit te, young men and young woinen;
and 1 understand that in certain schods in
the United States the teaching of Spanish is
compulsory. The language of a nation is one
of the keys that open the deor cf trade with
that nation. If you sen-d te South America
agents of private firmsg or agents of the
Government who cannot speak the language
of the country, whiih is Spanish, or, in the
case cf Brazil, Portuguese, you cannot expect
to advance very far in business. 1 therefore
hope that the remarks cf my henourable
friend on that point will be heeded by the
teachers of Canada, and that the language cf
South America will be taught in our sehools
s0 that we may make progress, commereially
speaking, in our relations with the peoples ol
that continent.
The honourable gentleman imprcssed me,
and other members cf the Bouse, with the
pessibilities cf Canad4ian epxport trade te
Argentina, and te Brazil. We may expect
imports Irom. Brazil, for that country bas
somethîng te sell us, even though practically
all that we could import from Brazil may be
found in the British West Indies. I do net
see very clearly what is to make up the trade
te Canada from Argentina. However, it is
important te us that we should expert cur
goods, and the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) has given a list cf manufactured products which can easîly be seld
if properly advertised and if Canada is preperly represented on the ground.
I regret, honourable members, that my
honourable friend, who is an expert in goodwiIl expeditiens, did net refer te the remarkable speech delivered. by that brilliant young
commercial traveller cf the British Empire.
Bis Royal Highness the Prince cf Wales.
The Prince cf Wales spoke at Buenos Aires
at the opening cf the great exhibition there.
Although hie has net been brought up in an
atmosphere cf business, his speeches prove
that hie is endowed with extraerdinarily goed
common sense. Bis Royal Highness said in
his speech: "To trade means to exchange,
te barter"ý-I arn net quoting his exact words,
but I give their meaning-and hie added that

SENATE

138

i; we wished to trade we must give and take,
and must remove the barriers erected by all
the nations, as being se many obstacles.
Now I do not wish to criticize the policy of
the Government. I am one of those who
believe that in this Chamber we should speak
of the Government with all due respect, and
give it fair play, and thaL we must always
rake it for granted that it neans well.
But I say that if a Government organizes
a trade mission to South America, or to
any other part of the world, it ought to
make an offer of exchange, and not erect
tariff barriers so high that it is impossible
to exchange and to barter with prospective
customers.
The honourable member for Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) did not say-what I
think my friend from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) said a moment ago-that the
pathway between Canada and South America
was an old one. For almost 35 years I have
represented the constituency of Gaspé, and
I have often listened to the tales of my old
friends the pilots, the sailors, or the mariners.
There is net one old pilot or mariner on
that coast who did net, thirty or forty years
ago, take ships from Percé, or Paspebiac,
or from the Bay of Gaspé, and carry cargoes
of dry codfish from the Baie dc., Chaleurs,
which I call the Mediterrancan of Canada,
to South Anerica.
That was the pioncer
pathway between the Maritime Provincein which I include the Gaspé Peninsula-and
those southern countries.
We are already known in the south. Wr
have some commercial affiliations.
I necd
not say that fron Quebec in the old days
lumbering firns like Ross and Hall-to mention only those two-sent to the south shiploads of that magnificent square timber which
caime down in rafts from the Ottawa River
to the St. Lawrence, and te the old city of
Quebec. In fact, the prosperity of Quebec
was due to the lumbcring operations. Therefore we have only to re-open and improve
this pathway, and I am sure that with the
modern equiprment this country can afford to
have there is a considrmrible trade to be
fostered between the Sotih Amoerican nations
and Canada.
I cannot for the life of me understand the
attitude of my friend-and the dearest of
friends at that-fron Sydney (Hon. Mr. McLennan), who seems te contemplate with
some alarm the presence of a Canadian diplomat in South America. All he wants is secondhand Canadian representation through the
British legation or the British embassy, as
the case may be. As the honourable leader
of the Left (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) said
Hona. Mr. LEMIEUX.

yesterday, and quite pointedly, it is about
time that we should appreciate our status.
When I say status. I mean our relative importance in the world.
What has given Canada such prestige in
Europe of late years?
At the League of
Nations, where the representatives of the
peoples of the world are congregated, Canada
bas net only been a member, but has spoken
for North America. Let us not forget that
important fact, honourable gentlemen. Canada is the only nation north of the Rio
Grande that speaks for North America. AIl
those nations of the south are also represented
at the League. I know that a little incident
occurred some years ago at Geneva, which
caused the resignation of two delegates, one
fror
Brazil and one from Argentina; but
that was a question of pique, which can easily
be healed, and I think it will be healed in
time.
We have a great prestige in South America,
first of all through our association with the
British Empire; secondly, because of the manly
efforts which have been made by Canada of
late years to become one of the great trading
countries of the world; also because of the
immense potential wealth of Canada-our St.
Lawrence River, our prairies in the West, our
mines, which have only been scratched, and
very slightly at that. But in order to promote our trade with those countries, as I
have said, we must be in a position to give
and take; and, further, we must send our
agents there.
My honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) tells me
that the Canadian firms which are aiready
represented in Argentina and Brazil are
doing wonderfully well because their men
are on the spot.
Take our great Sun Life Assurance Company. I am net one of its directors, but
I have been insured in that company since I
was a mere student. Wherever I went-in
Japan, in South Africa, in France, in England,
in the United States-the finest insurance
buildings and the most prosperous insurance
operations wre those of the Sun Life of Canada. I am told that in South America that
comxpany has made wonderful headway of late
years. Take the Royal Bank of Canada: it
bas branches all over South America. If our
country were as well represented as such institutions by men of ability, by men of commercial training, and if we had some sense in
our tariff, as I have said, we should succeed
there, in a short time, as we have succeeded
elsewhere, as a trading nation.
The presence of Canadian ministers in South
America would net hurt the feelings of Great
Britain. Britain understands that Canada has

of protection, it is dead and buried; I am
referring to it simply from a sentimental point
of view. I am always surprised at the animosity that was displayed against a trade arrangement with our neighbour at that time, when
each country was a good customer of the
other. If I may say se, I think that the discontent which bas arisen in our own Canadian
West can be attributed to the rejection of
that pact in 1911. I know that there was a
great deal of sentiment against it, especially
in the Province of Ontario and in the MariIt was said that United Empire
times.
Loyalists would not stand for such a trade
arrangement with the United States. However, I remember that in 1891 unrestricted
reciprocity with the United States was endorsed by a majority in the loyal province of
Ontario; and one of the most able advocates
of reciprocity at that time was Sir Richard
Cartwright, himself a distinguished United
Empire Loyalist. I imagine that I can still
hear him saying to his colleagues in Council,
'The battle of the Plains of Abraham bas cost
the Cartwrights a great deal."
After the addresses that we heard yesterday,
particularly those by the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) and
the honourable member from Prince Edwdrd
(Hon. Mr. Horsey), I feel sure that some action will be taken to expand Canada's trade
with South America. But if we are going to
take advantage of our opportunities there we
need to consider the situation very carefully.
Above all things we should cease erecting
tariff barriers, which at present are creating
new animosities all over the world. All countries are surrounding themselves with tariff
walls as high as Haman's gallows. But that
is net the way to expand business.
I regret, honourable senators, that I have
taken up so much time. I am entirely in
accord with the eloquent plea delivered by
the honourable member from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) for the establishment
of Canadian legations in South America. We
should go further and educate more of our
young men to speak Spanish and Portugese,
in order that they may be able to communicate with the people of Brazil and- Argentina. If at the present time it is not convenient to appoint ministers to these two
countries, we should net delay any longer in

moment I am thinking of a South American
country which has one minister aecredited
to both Germany and Austria. That representative travels back and forth from Berlin

Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable senators, I
desire to speak only in regard to one point
that occurred to me when the matter of the
status of our representatives was being discussed.
From ail that I have read about
South America I have gathered the impression
that the people of that continent are very
fond of ceremony and dignity, and that
merchants who have tried to sell them goods
have foind it necessary to adopt leisurely
and ceremonious methods.
Apparently the
British Govornment were impressed by a consideration of that kind when they sent so
dignified a personage as the Prince of Wales
to represent them at the exhibition at Buenos
Aires.
Possibly in those South American
republics the dignified status of a country'>
representatives bas a certain commercial
value.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Explain.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: Honourable mernbers,
I will give you as briefly as I can the history
connected with this Bill. In 1910, by special
Acet, Parliament gave the Burrard Inlet Tunnel
and Bridge Company power to censtruct a
bridge across the Second Narrows df Burrard
Inlet. Under this Act plans cf a bridge were
approved by Order in Council and by the
Board of Railway Commissioners, after being
investigated and reported upon by a royal
commission of Government engineers. In 1925
the bridge wvas completed at a cost, in round
figures, off $2,000,000, of whieh the Dominion
Government contributed about $270,000, the
Bri.tish Columbia Governinent $120,000, and
the City off Vancouver, the City cf North
Vancouver, the District off North Vancouver,
and the District of West Vancouver, the
balance.
In 1927 a steamship proceeding eutward.
collided with the central span off the bridge
and damaged it to some extent. The bridge
company entered action against the steamship company in the Admiralty Court,
and the steamship company counterclaimed
against the bridge cempany. The-trial judge
gave judgment in faveur off the bridge cornpany, wbereupon the steamship cempany
appealed te the Exehequer Court off Canada,
which sustained the judgment in faveur off
the bridge company. The steamship cmipany then appealed te the Privy Council,
which reversed the judgments cf the twe
Canadian ceurts. Hence this Bill te validate

company power te reconstruet the pertion

and drove it against the bridge, the collision
taking out a 300-foot span. The bridge company started to reconstruct the span, but
during this work of reconstruction the Privy
Council gave its decision, which in effect was
a declaration that the company never had
the right to build a bridge that interfered
with navigation. This prevented any further
work of reconstruction, and the company now
comes to Parliament asking it to pass this
Bill to allow that work to proceed.

TRADE MISSION TO SOUTH AMERICA
APPRECIATION OF REPORTS
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable members, with the consent of the House I should
like to mention a matter which, perhaps,
should have been referred to before the
Orders of the Day, or might more properly
have received attention yesterday or the day
before, at the close of the discussion arising
out of the reports of the delegates on the
Mission to South America. I was not present
when that discussion ended, or I should probably have called attention to the matter then.
I had noticed-and I was reminded of it
when I read in Hansard the report of the
discussion-that nearly every member who
took part in the debate paid a very high
tribute to the report presented by our friend
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), but
on no occasion was there any reference whatever to the very able report presented by our
friend from Prince Edward (Hon. Mr. Horsey). This oversight appeared to me to be
so marked that I thought it would be only
fair to raise the point in the House, so that
justice might be donc to our friend from
Prince Edward, particularly in view of the
very able address which ha made on the subject.

LEGISLATIVE WORK OF THE SENATE
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX moved the
following resolution:
Resolved, that in order to expedite the buness of Parliament. Ministers of the Crown
should be permiitted to appear fron tinte ta
tinte before this liouse for the purpose of
explaining and giving information with respect
to Governme nt legislation.
He said: Honourable members, the motion
which stands in my name is, if seems te me,
very clear. In presenting this resolution I
need not say that I have no intention of
secking an anendient of rhe constitution
of our Senate or the House of Commons. I
fully realize that in 1867, after the Quebec
Conference, it was agreed that the British
North Ametrica Aa-t was of the nature of a
compromise, and even of a treaty. This was
declared by the Fathers of Confederation,
Sir John A. Macdonald, Hon. George Brown,
Sir A. T. Galt and Sir George E. Cartier. I
will not weary honourable members by repeating the ipsissima verba of those statesmcn.
The statement that the British North America
Act is of the nature of a treaty was admitted
recently in the course of a debate in another
place. That Act provided for two bodies to

MAY 26, 1931
advise the Crown, and no legisiation is valid
that does flot carry the concurrence of His
Excellency the Governor General-or, to use
the terni that has been employed by some
honourable members, the Viceroy of Canada
-and the Senate and the House of Commons.
We have an elective body and a nominative
body. The Senate was created for the very
purp ose of considering and, if necessary,
revising proposed legisiation before it is
submitted for the assent of the Crown. Therefore, under our constitution, the Senate has
a very important part to play, provided it
does not become merely a dumb oracle.
I regret to say that at the present time
there are many criticisms levelled against this
Chamber. As to that, I shall have more to
say in a few moments.
At the time of Confederation many people
tbougbt that the Senate should be an elective body. W'e ail know what were the
reasons and motives that iinpelled the
Fathers of Confederation to decide that thî:s
body should be nomînated by the Crown.
For one thing, there were minorities to consider. It was necessary also to protect the
interests of those provinces that were
smaller than the provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada. One of the giants of
those days, Hon. George Brown, was opposed body and seul, one might say, to the
principle of a nominative chamber; and al
those who were following in his political footsteps, as weil as even eomne wbo belonged
to the party led by Sir John A. Macdonald,
ivere of the same opinion. However, Brown
yielded; and I might add that l'e yielded
gracefully. I remnember baving read the
speech of our distinguished colleague, an exMinister of Justice (Hon. Sir Allen AylesWorth), in which hie recalled the days of the
Confederation campaign by George Brown in
Upper Canada, when that statesman was explaining to his friends of the Reforni Party
why hie had agreed to the establishment of
a nominative chamber. He said: "I was
wedded, as you were, to the principle of Confederation, and we fougbt the battle for
representation by population." It might ha
said that the causa causans of Confederation
was the principle of representation by population. There wvas also, of c~ourse, the higher
motive of uniting into a strong Confederation
the various British colonies, which extended
froni the Atlantic to the Pacifie; but I think
I arn right in stating, with those who were
witnesses of the battles of those days, that
representation by population was the guiding
prineiple that flnally overcarne ail objections

4to Confederation, and that George Brown,
opposed though hie was to the principie of a

143

nominative body, yieided in ,irder to gain the
principle for whieh hie had fought all his if e.
On the whole, as we are al] aware, the systeni
bas worked well.

There bas been no deadlock

to speak of between the nominative body and
the elective body. But of late, as I said a
moment ago, very bitter critieism bas been

levelled against the Senate. It is not crnticism directed against the quality of tbe distiniguisbed men wbo surround me this evening;
flot against their probity, nor against their
intellectuality. Far froni it. Speaking for tb-2
younger element in the Senate, I may say
that we take pride in the leaders on botb sides

of the House--and wben I say "leaders" I
mean not only those who direc'tly represent
the Government in this buse, but those wbo
because of their success in business and in
their professions have, so to speak, won their

way to the seats which tbey grace to-day.
1 give no names; honourable members know to
wbom 1 refer. Critieism is levelled not
because there is not as iiich intellectual
power in this Chamber as there is in another,
but because of the alieged 'naetivity of the

Senate. We are not in the iimelight. The
public ignores the fact-and it is remarkable
how widespread is the ignorancce in this regard

-that the Senate does not and cannot initiate
money bills, nor can it even amend theni.
U must eitber aceept or relect theni, and it
would always be timid about rejeoting a
înoney bill.
The powers of the United States Senate
are quite different. It is true that tbe UJnited
States Senate does not initiate money bis.

but it is not restrained from making appropriations froni the public treasury. It can
amend a revenue bill, and bas often done
so. If tbe Canadian Senate made appropriations -and initiated revenue bills, or if, like
the American Senate, it could confinni certain
appointments and ratify or rejeet treaties, it
would, in the eyes of the public, bave far
more influence than it bas at present. Honourable members will recaîl bow a few months
ago, wben a Minister Plenipotentiary of the
United States was to be appointed to tbhe
American Legation in Ottawa, the Senate at
WVashington besitated to ratify the appointnment of the very distinguished gentleman Wbo
now re-presents the American nation in this
country. At about the saine tume, or a little
eachier, the American Senate refused to ratify
the appointment. of ope or two judges to the
Supreme Court. The Senate of the United
States bas a greater influence than tbe Senate
of Canada because it possesses powers such
as this Chamber does not possess.
I need not say that the generation preceding my own bighly appreciated the coinposition of the Ameriman Senate. I remeni.

ber how the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in conversation, spoke of the influence it wielded in
the days of Daniel Webster and Henry Clay.
In the United States the Senate is a powerful
institution.
The Canadian Sonate, however, deals with
legislation sent to it by the House of Gommons. In the few months that I have had
the honour of being a member of this
Chamber, and in the many years that I have
been in Parliament, I have observed that
the Senate bias always scrutinized carefully
and dealt fairly witb the legisiation presented
to it. I have attended rnany of the meetings
of committees of the Senate before whicb
outsiders have appeared-tbe Railway Comioittee, the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, and the Private Bis Cominittee-and 1 know it to be the opinion of
outsiders that the committees deal fairly with
the legisiation ýthat cornes to this House from
the Commons. I tbink that my venerable
friend the honourable member for De Salalierry (Hon. Mr. Béique) hias in mind the
)ulishing- of a book on the ex~cellent work
performed by the Senate during the years;
Since

Confederation.

I

know

that

the

honourable gentleman bias ail the material
for sncb a book. Let us hope that some day
it will be published. 1 will say further that
to my knowledge there lias been no partisan
spirit exbibited by the Senate in dealing
with Go, oînîîîoît le.-islatioîî, not to speak
of certain other bills, the namnes of which
still ring in our ears.
1 rernember that some years ago a Bill was
introduced by the Laurier Government-the
right bonourable the junior member for
Ottawa (Rt. Hon. Sir Geo. E. Foster) will also
reniember it-for the construction of a railway in the Yukon district. It was during
the IÇiondyke gold fever. The Government
supporteid a Bill which gave land subsidies to
McKenzie and Mann in return for the construction of a railway fromn Atlin, if I reirîcîner correctlv, to Dawson City. It was
a bold prolcct. At that time people thought
that that district was paved with gold, and,
as the only consideration wvas land subsidies,
the House of Gýommons passed the Bill. Then
it came to the Senate, and here it was defeated. This caused some excitement in the
other Chamber, and sorne complaint, and
criticisrn. Looking backward to-day, a mucb
older man-for this happened twenty-4lve
years ago, if I arn not mistaken-I tbink the
Sonate did well in rejecting that Bill. It did
well also in rejecting other measures, and its
action resulted in a saving to the country of
enormous sums of money. But the public
docs not secim to remember these tbings.

r.

LEMIEUX.

1 say there
is no partisan spirit in this
Chamber; and I go further: the standing and
the character of the memnbers of the Canadian
Senate constitute a moral guarantee to the
publie. It is true that the Senate is blamed
at times fýor rushing business at the end of a
session. But what does the elective .body do
in the awful week immediately preceding prorogation? 1 have myseif taken part in the
race, and I say that in bastening at that stage
of a session the Senate takes its eue frorn
the buse of Gommons. The most important
legistation is sometimes postponed until the
very end. The Senate thon bias to rush it
through, but, generally speaking, it gives to
that legisiation ail necessary attention and
care. The trouble lies in the faet that the
bis are sent bero during the last bours of the
session.
Two reforms have been suggested for the
piîrpose of overcoming the difflculty. First,
it bas been stated not only in the Sonate, but,
elsIewhere, that there sbould be a larger miniterial representation in this Chamber. At
prescrit we have bore but one Minister of
the Crown with a portfolio, the honourable
the Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
a vcry distinguisbed Minister indced. Although
I do not wish to sec him elsewhere, perbaps
ho will permit me to say that the place of the
Minister of Labour is not bero, but in the
popular Chamber. We bave also an honourable gentleman who direetly reprosents the
Governiment in tbis bouse. I ref or to the
leader (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), wbo sits to
the ef t of the Minister of Labour, and
who is a very brilliant and distinguished
counis( . I tbink I expres~s the sentiment of
both sides of the House wben I say that that
hion ourable gentleman should be a full-flodged
Minister of tbe Crown. 0f course the honourable gentleman bias great moral autbority,
but it bas happened recently that witb a-Il bis
imagination and ail bis abilàty ho ýcould flot
answer some questions tbat were put to birn,
becau.,e hoe had not been informed of the
views of the Government in regard to certain
legitIction.
I repeat that the honaurable
gentleman sbould bo vested with full ministcrial powers; ho sbould be ai nember of the
Cabinet, so that-and I sqy it with due doference to him-be might ho a more effective
leader of tbis House.
It lias been suggested by mani., that in
eider to overcorne the difficulty created by
thp absence of ministers we sbould bave
uinder-seeretaries in the Sonate. It is an oli
British tradition tbat there should bo as many
under-secretaries as thore arej uinisters. \Ve

words used by Sir George Murray, but if 1
arn not expressing in effect what he said, the
right honourable the junior member for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
will be able to correct me. At that time the
Government of Sir Robert Borden almost
came to the decision to appoint undersecretaries for our Parliament; but the matter
was left in abeyance and no definite action
along this line was taken, on account of the
War.
I suppose that the financial conditions existing in the country to-day will not permit
of the inauguration of such a system, but a
decision in this matter will be proper when

Postmaster General. All honourable members
know how deeply interested the people of
every constâtuency are in the administration
of the Post Office Department. Rural mail
delivery-which I claim credit for having
estabiished when I was Postmaster Generalwas, as it is now, the subject of much consideration, and I feel that the Minister should
have had the privilege of appearing before
the popular Chamber and explaining his
iegislation.
But the Senate no longer includes in its
membership so many Cabinet Ministers as it
did. The Government that preceded the
present one was represented in this Chamber
by only one Minister, who was without portfolio (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). He acquitted
himself admirably of his Atlas-like task of
carrying on his shoulders the whole representation of the Government in this Chamber. I
do not think that our present system is fair
to the Senate. I believe that a change such
as I have suggested would be workable in
Canada as it is in other countries. In France,
for example, ministers pass from the Palais
Bourbon to the Luxembourg, as I know from
my own observations. And in Germany, at
least before the war, ministers appeared in
both Chambers.
The United States, of
course, has an entirely different system, for
there the ministers, or secretaries, as they call
them, are not elected by the people, and the
work of Congress is carried on under the
leadership of influential senators or congressmen. I believe that in this country both
Houses would work more harmoniously and
members of Parliament as a whole would
have a clearer view of Government legisiation if ministers could appear in the Senatenot at the bar-and explain their legislation.
I do not suggest that they should vote, for
that would entail a radical and drastic change
tu our constitution. My suggestion is simply
that the Senate might politely ask any minister who had not a seat in this Chamber
to appear here and explain legislation standing in his name.
It seems to me that if my suggestion were
put into effect much time would be saved,
and the Senate would not need to have long
adjournments, which are regarded with suspicion by many people. I do not say that
the Senate is responsible for those long adjournments; on the contrary, I might say
that the responsibility lies with the other
Chamber. We are here ready to work-to
study and to scrutinize any piece of legislation, but the wheels are clogged and we are
obliged to await the pleasure of that Chamber while it spends nearly a month in debating the Address in reply to the Speech from
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

the Throne, and perhaps an equal period of
time on the Budget. The country looks on
and smiles, for it does not seem to understand why we are not always industriously
engaged in the interest of the people.
I
resent the attitude of the public, especially
of the press, which should know better, in
regard to the alleged inactivity of the
Senate. It is untrue to say that the Senate
is inactive. The inactivity is in the other
Chamber, and we are forced to mark time
while waiting for legislation.
A number of measures that have been
brought down in the other Chamber this session could have been initiated here. The
debate on the Address lasted only two days
in the Senate. 'If the Secretary of State, the
Hon. 'Mr. Cahan, who is an extremely able
minister, had appeared here then and introduced, for example, the Naturalization Act,
or the amendments to the Companies Act and
to the Copyright Act, is it not likely that we
should have been able to finish this session in
much less time than we now require? As it
i.s now, these Bills will not reach us until
they have been dealt with by the other
Chamber, and our comrnittees may have to
call witnesses, as the committees of the other
flouse have donc.
Judging by the great
niimber of pamphlets, tracts and letters that
I have received, the Copyright Bill is eausing
a great deal of contention.
Honourable members must realize that there
is a link missing between this Chamber and
the House of Commons. Why should we not
forge a connecting link?
I say it is an
anomaly that the Senate should be kept waiting for weeks before Government bills are
sent over. I know that there are objeciions to
the principle involved in my motion. They
were expressed when this matter was considered before. Some able members in both
Houses have stated that an amendn-it to
our constitution would be necessary before
we could give effect to this motion. I have
not gone very deeply into that objection. But
let us suppose that such an amendment would
be necessary. The measure in itself would not
materially affect the minorities or the provinces; it would be enacted as a method of procedure to facilitate the work of the Senate.
Therefore, if it were necessary to amend the
British North America Act to bring about
that reform, I see no great objection to it,
although I am a fervent upholder of the Canadian constitution. But it seems to me that
this reform would necessitate only an amendnient to our rules; and in the rules, both of
the House of Commons and of the Senate,
there is provision for conferences between the

MAY 26, 19fl'1
two Houses. Standing order 66 of the Senate
provides:
In any case where a Bill, originating in the
Senate and amended in the Commons, is returned to the House of Commons with any of
the amendments made by the Commons disagreed to, or where a Bill originating ini the
Commons has been amended in the SeInate, and
has been returned to the Senate with any of
the Senate amendments disagreed to, aud the
Senate decides to insist on such amendments,
or any of them, and returns the Bill to the
Commons, the message accompanying sucli Bill
shahl also contain reasons for the Senate flot
agreeing te, the amendments proposed by the
House of Commons, or for the Senate iusisting
on its own amendments, as the case may be;
and such reasons shail be drawn up by a committee of three senators, to be appointed for
the purpose when the Senate decides to disagree to, or insist on, as the case miay be, the
amendments in question.
A similar standing order is to be found in
the rules of the Huse of Commons:
25. (1) In cases in which the Senate disagree
to any amndments made by the bouse of
Commons, or to which the House of Commons
has disagreed, the bouse of Commons is williug
to receive the reasons of the Senate for their
disagreeing or insisting (as the case may be)
hy message, without a conference, unless at any
time the Senate should desire to communicate
the same at a conference.
(2) Any conference between the two bouses
inay bc a free conference.
(3) Whien the bouse requests a conference
wmth the Senate, the reasons to be given by
this House at the same shahl be prepared and
agreed to by the bouse before a message be
sent therewith.
As honourable members will see, a meeting
between the Senate and the bouse of Cornmous is provided for, flot in the constitution,
but in the standing orders of the Senate and
of the House of Commons. I do not kuow
of any reason why we should raise difficulties
when where are noue. 1 do not wish to detain
the House on that point any longer. I simply submit that the question should be
studied carefully.
Some will say that what is proposed is an
innovation. WeI, the Canadian Senate and
the bouse of Commons of Canada represent
a young, active and energetic nation, and
should flot be afraid of an innovation that
would serve the best purposes of Canadian
legisîstion, facilitate the passing of that
legislation, curtail long sittings of Parliament,
aud, it seems to me, restore to this Chamber
the great credit and influence which it possessed in. former years. I do not say that
the Sena-te does not exercise a great moral
influence in the country to-day. As a young
man, before I was elected to the bouse of
Commons in 1896, I came to Ottawa.
I

the House of Commons and the Senate, and
when 1 came into the Senate Chamber, one
of the finest legislative halls that I have ever
I
seen, it was with awe and reverence.
remember seeing Sir Alexander Campbell,
Sir Oliver Mowat, Hon. David Milis, Sir
]Richard Cartwright, Sir Richard Scott, and
alI the other giants of former days, and
1 assure you, honourable gentlemen, that
the country was inspired with a great respect
f or the Senate. But times have changed.
Since the War we have been passing through
an ordeal and there is another spirit in the
air. To-day people do not adhere so closely
to tradition as they did before the War.
Some talk of the abolition of the Senate.
I do flot know whether they realize what
would happen if the Senate were abolished.
Others suggest that it should be partially
elective and partially nominative. As regards
an elective Senate, let me tell you whiat my
father used to say to me. He was a very
keen politician. He would speak to me of
the elections under the Union, and of the
eections of the legislative counillors-for
they were elected-and the gross corruption.
In those days the districts comprised, as they
do in some cases to-day, several counties.
At that time there were not the same facilities for travel that there are to-day, but the
Alections of the councillors were marked by
a corruption which I need not describe. So,
after aIl, Sir John A. Macdonald and George
Brown and the others were not s0 wrong
when they accepted the principle of a nominative body.
What I propose this evening is an innovation, but we are not afraid of innovations.
Who would have thought some years ago of
our passing legisîstion to, give the Leader of
the Opposition a salary equal to that of a
Minister of the Crown? What a revolutionary thing it wast But it passed, and now
that the excîtement is over, some other
countries, if I arn not mistaken, have adopted
the same principle and have made the Canadian enactmnent the basis of similar legislation. Nobody criticizes it now; everybody
admits that under the British system there
must be a leader of the Opposition, that the
office engages all hîs attention, and that he
must he independent. And what better way
is there of assuring his independence than
giviug him a salary equal to that of a
Minister of the Crown?
I submit the resolution to the judgment
of the Senate. I arn not so sure that there
will be a majority in favour of it, aud I do
not inteud to press it to a vote; but I
should like to hear from members on both

SENATE
sides a frank and open expression of their
views on the subject.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable members, the honourable member from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lenieux) has, if I am net
mistaken, given expression to the general
opinion that the Senate cannot deal with
financial questions. This subject was taken
up by this House in 1918 and was deaIt with
by a committee of which the late Senator
W. B. Ross was chairman, and of which I
happened to be a member. The report of that
committee, supported by leading authorities,
is short, and I will read it for the information
of the Senate. It is dated May 9, 1918, and
is as follows:
The Special Cominittee appointed to consider
the question of determining what are the rights
of the Senate in matters of financial legislation. and whether under the provisions of
The British North America Act, 1867, it is
perinissible, and to what extent, or forbidden,
for the Senate to amend a Bill embodying
financial clauses (Money Bill), have the honour
to mîake their Second Report, as follows:Your Conunittee beg to report tlat in the
latter part of the last Session of Parliament
a similar Coininittee was appointed, but owing
to the late date of appointment oppo.rtunity
was not afforded the Committee for a full consideration of the Order of Reference.
During
the recess the Honourable W. B. Ross, a member of this Commnittee, prepared a memorandum
dealing with the question, copy lereto attached,
which neimorandumî lias been cairefully considered and adopted by this Comnmittee.
The
follow ing summing-up tiereof is sibiitted as
the conclusions of your Comminttee on the rigits
of the Senate in matters of financial legislation:
1. That the Sonate of Cauada lias and always
liad since it wvas created. the power to amend
Bills originating in the Comuons appropriating
any part of the revenue or imposing a tax by
reducing the amounts therein, but lias not the
riglt to increase the same without the consent
of the Crown.
2. That this power was given as an essential
pat
of the Confeder.ation contract.
3. That the prautice of the Imperial Houses
of Parl'iament in respect of Money Bills is no
part of tIe Constitution of the Domîinion of
Can.ada.
4. That the Senate in the past lias repeatedly
amsiended so-ealled Money Bills, in soie cases
withlout protest frous the Coimons. while in
otlier cases the Bills were allowed to pass, the
Counuons p1rotesting or claiming that the Senate
could not amiend a Money Bill.
5. Tiait Rule 78 of tlie House of Commons
of Canada claiming for that body powers and
priviieges in connection with Money Bills identical with those of the Imperial House of Conmous is unwarranted under the provisions of
The British North America Act, 1867.
6. That the Senate as shown by The British
North Aierica Act as well as by the discussion
in the Canadian Legislature on the Quebec
Resolustions in addition to its general powers
and dulties is specially empowered to safeguard
le rights of the provincial organizations.
IHou.

LEMIEUX.

7. That besides general legislation, there are
questions such as provincial subsidies, public
lands in the western provinces and the rights
of the provinces in connection with pending
railway legislation and the adjustment of the
rights of the provinces thereunder likely te

arise at any time, and it is important that the
powers of the Senate relating thereto be
thoroughly understood.

Sections 17 and 91 of the British North

of the British North America Act takes away
the latter riglht from the Senate.
The first paragraph of the preanble where
it is stated that tise provinces desire to be
united federally with a constitution similar in
principle to that of the United Kingdoms is
ielied on.
These words being in the preaible have much
less importance than if they were in the text.
Furtier it is obvious thsat simsilarity in principle does not imean identity in detail; the
Canadian constitution differs froms the British
constitutituon in many and important respects;
the simsilarity in principle referred to in the
preaible is intended to exist only to the extent
stated in tle text.
iparagraph of the preamible states
'Ilie thiird
that it is expedieiit not only that the constituthe
tion of the Legislative authority in
Dominiion be provided for but also that the
nature of the Executive Governusent therein be
declared. and the text of the Act contains many
userely restate rules of the
sections whicl

referred to.
uf the above-mentioned words of the preamble
meant that the British constitution applies to
Canada except in so far as the text of the Act
expressly derogates therefrom the third paragraph of the preamble and all those sections,
particularly section 53, would be useless or
mneaningless.

MAY 26, 19s1
The consideration of how the rule limiting
the powers of the House of Lords in the United
Kingdom came te be adopted affords an additional argument in support of the view suggested by the text of the British North America
Act.
In the early days there was a conflict between
the British House of Commons and the House
of Lords on this question of the powers of the
House of Lords in respect of Money Bills.
In 1678 the Commons resolved:
"That all aids and supplies and aids te His
Majesty in Parliament are the sole gift of the
Commons and that all Bills for the granting
of any such aids and supplies ought te begin
with the Commons and that it is the undoubted
and sole right of the Commons te direct, limit
and appoint in such Bills the ends, purposes,
considerations, conditions, limitations and qualifications of such grants, which ought net te be
changed or altered by the House of Lords."
In 1693 the Lords resolved:
"That the making of amendments and abatements of rates of Bills of Supply sent up from
the House of Commons is a fundamental, inherent and undoubted right of the House of
Peers from which their Lordships can never
depart."
It is true that the Lords did net act in
accordance with this resolution and tacitly submitted te the claim of the Commons, obviously
te avoid a conflict with the latter House, but
this practice was net the law, and this appears
frem the preamble of the House of Commons
resolution of 1910 which announced the proposed legislation curtailing the powers of the
(May's Parliamentary Practice, 12th
Lords.
edition, p. 518.)
It is remarkable that of the two restrictions
on the rights of the Lords which the Commons
by its resolution of 1678 tried te impose,
namely: the denial of the right te originate and
the denial of the right te amend Money Bills,
the British North America Act while mentioning the first in section 53 should net mention the second against which the Lords had
specially protested.
If it had been the intention of the British
Parliament te impose the two restrictions on
the Senate it surely would have mentioned them
both or if content te rely on the preanble as
incorporating the whole British constitution,
it would have mentioned neither.
To those reasons might be added this further
consideration that there is very little analogy
between the Lords and the Senate. The Lords
represent themselves, the Senate represents the
Provinces. The Lords are net in an independent
position as the flouse of Commons can use its
influence over the Crown and induce it te add
as many memberè as are needed te the House
of Lords te obtain a favourable majority.
It is probably for that reason that section 18
of the British North America Act when dealing
with the privileges, immunities and powers of
the Senate refers as the maximum for such
privileges, immunities and powers to those held,
enjoyed and exercised by the Imperial House of
Commons (and net by the House of Lords) at
the passing of the Act.
Under the circumstances, we are of the
opinion that the Senate of Canada may amend
a Money Bill originating in the flouse of Conmons as fully as the House of Commons can do.
Of course the powers of the Senate are limited
te the same extent as those of the House of
•

149

Commons by the fact that Money Bills must be
recommended by a message of the Governor
General.
Yours truly,
É. Lafleur.
Aimé Geoffrion.
That opinion was supported by Mr. John
S. Ewart. On the 27th of April, 1918, he wrote
te the late Senator Ross a letter which, with
the leave of the Senate, I shall place on Hansard.
Dear Sir,--In reply te yours of the 23rd
instant, J beg te say that I have read with
much interest the "Memorandum re rights of
the Senate in matters of financial legislation,"
and I find in it a great deal that, were the
matter now being discussed for the first time,
might well be urged in support of what is
evidently the writer's view.
In considering all subjects of the class te
which the present belongs regard has alwaysand very rightly-been paid te history and
precedents; and the relations between our
Senate and House of Commons are, as I think,
se firmly established that ne change could be
introduced save by constitutional amendment.
I do net mean, necessarily, by amendment of
the British North America Act-amendment of
constitutional practice, agreed upon by both
Houses, would suffice.
From the very earliest time, the Colonial
Assemblies have successfully contended for the
same privilege with reference te financial bills
as that enjoyed by the British House of Conmons. The cases in which contention arose are
very numerous, but I do net know of any in
which the quarrel between the two Houses has
resulted in substantial victory for the Council
in the earlier constitutions, the second
-as,
chamber was styled.
A glance at histories furnishes me with two
instances which may be taken as containing
typical assertion of the privilege of the Assemblies. The first of these is noted in Dickerson'es American Colonial Government, 1696-1765:
The author says (p. 160) that. in the time of
Governor Cornbury, of New York:"The Council sought te amend the revenue
bill se as te remove this objection, but it vas
met by the point blank assertion that the
assembly would permit no amendment of
Money Bills."
The second instance I take from Dr. Kings
ford's book, the History of Canada, volume 9,
p. 217. On that occasion (1818) the Council
and Assembly were brought into sharp conflict,
with the result, as the author says, that:"The Council did net conceive an amendmient
te the money bill as a breach of privilege; but
as it was so asserted, the Council would hereafter forbear frein all amendment and simply
reject any bill submitted to it, should occasion
suggest.
There can be no doubt that the differences
between the British House of Lords and the
Canadian Senate referred te in the Memorandum are of substantial character, but, after
all, the two Houses, with reference te the
subject-matter under consideration occupy the
same position. For the members of neither
House are elected by the people, and the privilege of the Assembly with regard te money
bills bas always been based upon the fait that
the flouse was composed of popularly elected
members.

150

SENATE

In the United States, it is because both the
Senate and the House of Representatives have
always been composed of men elected by the
people-either by direct vote or, indirectly, by
the State Legislature-that the two Houses
have oniurrent authority.

Sir,

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Cannot be increased.

Yours truly,
John S. Ewart.
For the reasons that are stated by these
eminent lawyers, I think there can be no
question that the powers of this louse are
equal to those of the House of Commons.
'Plie House of Commons, of course, cannot
deal with a proposed vote of money unless it
is approved in a message from the Governor
General; and the Senate, likewise, can deal
with money bills only when they come from
the other House, supported by a message that
His Excellency has signified approval. But
the moment that a Bill is before the Sonate,
our powers are equal to those of the House of
Commons.
I think I am right in saying that barristers
and others who have appeared before committees of both Houses appreciate the way
in which legislation is handled in the Sonate.
I say that because of the opinions I have
heard expressed by leading counsel of Montrual, Toronto and other places.

and the Sonate bas acted very freely with

member from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique).
Hn. Mr. BEIQUE.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Our powers are stated
in the report which I have read. The bill
must come to us, as I have said, with the approval of the Governor General, and the
amount cannot be increased.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable members, the question raised by the honourable
gentleman fror Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) is one with which we in this Chamber
are quite familiar. It bas been raised-I wiil
not say at every session, but at nearly every
session since 186'7. The recurring complaint
bas been that this Chamber has not sufficient
work te keep it sitting from day to day, as
the other louse has. Now, my honourable
friend fron Rougemont bas clearly explained
the reason why the Sonate finds adjournments
necessary.
Bills may be divided into two
classes, public and private. In this Chamber
iwe have initiated considerable public and
private legislation. We have had a monopoly
in the introduction of divorce bills. Most of
the public bills that come to us from the other
Chamber, and all that deal with the administration of the various departments of the
Government, are sponsored by Ministers of
the Crown.
The Senate initiates some of
these bills, it is true, but the fact remains
that the important public egislation, which
is mentioned in the Speech from the Throne,
is introduced by the Ministers of the Crown.
Now, the Sonate bas soldon had at one time
more than two ministers among its members,
although there was a period when it had
thrc.
We have had here a Secretary of
State, a Minister of Justice, a Minister of
LabourHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And a Minister
of the Interior.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I can safely
ay that generally we hav had not more
tIhan two ministers and perhaps most of the
time only one. For a number of years the
late Sir James Lougheed represented the
Governient in this Chamber as a ninister
without portfolio, and it was only at a later
-tagu that b was asked to administer a
duparnient. Cenerally a ninister wants to
sponsor the legislation which ho has drafted
or inspired, or which at any ratu nemanates
from his department, and h introduces it in
th Chamber where lie sits. Various kinds of
reforn in our methods of daling with legislation have been suggested in the somewhat
lengthy period that I have bren a nember
of the Scnate, and I have come to the conclusion that the only cure for the present

have done. It seems to me that the adoption
of the proposal before us would involve a
very similar action on our part.
But it takes two parties to make a bargain.
The Senate may amend its rules-and I believe that is all we should have to do-but it
is for my honourable friend, after consultation.
to tell us whether it should be done. If it
were done, the Ministers couid come here
during the long discussions in the other Chamber on the Address, on the Budget, and on
Supply, and the major part of the Government legislation which is now introduced in
the other Chamber could be introduced here
by the Ministers; and I venture to emphasize what has been said by the honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux) and my honourable and venerable
friend from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique),
that much of that legislation would receive
more careful attention in our committees than
it very often does from the committees of
the other House. The committees of the other
Chamber are large, consisting of one hundred
or more members, and frequently I have been
told that the members flock to the committee
meetings in large numbers, but that when some
sharply contested point has been decided they
leave the examination of the Bill to the few.
The Senate committees have fewer members,
and they sit around the table and seriously
test the value of every clause of every Bill
that comes before them. So, if there is the
least desire on the part of the Commons to
share with us the work of initiating legislation,
I think the difficulty can be solved by allowing
Ministers from the other Chamber to come
into this Chamber.
My honourable friend from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) spoke of under-secretaries. I think perhaps his idea in that regard
is not a bad one. But I suggest that perhaps
the time is at band when this Government or
another may feel the necessity of overhauling
the whole machinery of administration and
examining into the question whether or not
fifteen, sixteen or seventeen Ministcrs are not
too many to administer the affairs of this
country, and whether it would not be advisable to join together two or three departments,' and to supplement the Cabinet representation by appointing a certain nlîrber of
under-secretaries.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: .Honourable
members. I wish to engage your attention for

senators as it saw fit appointed in order to
make the Senate amenable to its control.
We are an absolutely independent body, and
our numbers can be inereased only in accordance with the constitution, which governs the
other Chamber as well as our own. There is
only one provision in the constitution for an
increase in our number, and I do not think it
has ever been invoked. Under certain conditions six additional members can be appointed.
If I remember correctly, that provision was
inserted at the behest of Hon. Mr. Mackenzie
at the time of Confederation, as the opinion
then prevailing was that the majority of
members would be Gonservatives, and that it
might becom
necessary for the party ho
represented to have some protection should
he come into power.
I an not going to follow the example of
the honourable gentleman facing me (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand).
Certainly it was worth
while for the newer members of this House
that steps should be taken to get what vulgarly may be called a "showdown." I regret
that my honourable friend was not succesful. What he has told us only shows thc
reluctance of either party in the other House
to meet us in the matter of greater representation in this House of members of the
Cabinet. I think no action could have been
more proper than that taken by my honourable friend, and I tbink it was well timed. I
am only sorry that it did not result in senething more (than it produced.
Our distinguished -new member (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux) deserves the thanks of this body,
I think, for bringing up ýthis subject, which
he has discussed so admirably and in which
manv of us are interested. I always have
been interested in the steps that led up to
Confederation and in the Confederation
Debates. It is quite true that at that time
there vas some question as to how the Senate.
as it was ultimately designated, should be
constituted. Finally it was decided to constitute it through the power of appointment.
There are, throughout the world, second
chambers that can be swamped, because they

MAY 26, 19311
do not stand on constitutiorrel ground, as ours
does.
If I remember correctly, the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) brougbt before the other House some years ago a motion
in tbis connection. If my menlory serves me
aright-I rnay be wrong-he contemplafed
Ministers in this House addressing the ofber
House, and vice versa. I wouid nof be so
favourable f, -tbat as I wouid be to tbe proposai that ha has put f orward fo-night, narnely that members of the Cabinet from. the
other House should be given the rigbf to
address this body. TIare are sorne reasons
which to my mmnd make if inexpedient, constitutionally, for any of us in this Chamber
to address the other House and urge it to
action. One reason je that wc cannof initiate
money Bille and tIat if would. be anomalous
for a Minister from this House to go over to
speak to -the other House in fevour of a Bill
for raising moneye.
I tbink it would be of adventage f0 tbe
other Huse, in tbe way of lightening its
labours, and cerfainly it wouid be of great
adjvrantage to this House, to have tbe Minister
in cbarge of a Bill corne here personally and
expiain if f0 this House and be questioned in
regard to it. No person can substitufe for
tbe Mînister f0 tbe satisfaction of this House.
If we cannot get the Minister we shah bhave
f0 do the best we cen under the conditions
tbaf bave prevailed. in the peet, wbich ware
very good in the days of my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and of rny distinguisbed predecessor, Sir James Lougheed,
who was a Minister, part of tbe time without
portfolio; but this House cannof, to use fhe
vernecuil-ar, "get down f0, brase t acks" unlese
tbe Minister wbo proposes certain legisiafion
cornes lare to explain if and f0 respondl f0
inquirias. No subordinafe cen do that as well
as be cen.
I agree f0 the proposition of my honourable
friend opposite 'that no cbange in tbe constitution would bie required; fbaf ail tbat is
needad f0 enable a Minister in fIe otber
buse f0 appear in thîs House would lie a
simple change of tbe rules. Such procedure,
if foliowad, wouid speed up legislefion very
mucl, would be to fbe edvanfage of tbe legislaf ion passing througî tbe House, and wouid
be f0 tbe adventage of tbe Minister bimself.
Hie would receive every courtesy. Wlen be

are nof going f0 badger birn; in facf, perbape
lie would not lie subjected to bedgering as
much as be je in the other House, wlere fIe

I heartily support fIe resolution of the hon-

153

ouraïble gentleman (Hon. Mr. Lernieux) and
trust that it wil1 find acceptance in this
Chamber.
My honourable friend to my right (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) ie a Cabinet Minister. I do
flot know what bis views may be. In my
remarks this evening I arn simply voicing my
individuai views. Whether they are in
accord with those of the Cabinet, I do not
know; nevertheless, they are my views, and I
have taken the liberty of placing tbem before
you.
Right H1on. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Honourable members, at the risk of causing
a littie discord I rnay say that I ar n ot convinced thaf what has been proposed would
be a goo.d tbing. I admit thaf there is a
somewbet peculiar situation when one man in
this House bas to father the legisiation of
seventeen men in the other House. The
leader of the Government in the Senate has
to look after the Bille of bis colleagues in the
Cabinet-a situation thaf rnight be remedied,
without the constitution. being inj.ured, if the
Government in power would naine at ieast
three Ministers wifbout portfolio to represent if in this House, and to take charge of
G overnrnenf legisiation bere. One man cennot do the work satisfacforily either to himself or to tbis Chamber. 0f course Deputy
Ministers corne here and give details, juet
as they would have to do if tbe Minister
bimself were bere, because a Minister cannof
be expected to, give ail details.
Let me point out sornefhing else. The
Ministers of the Canadien Governmenf do
more detail work tban do the Ministers of
any other Government in tbe world, so far
as I can ascertain; and I may say that I, as
Minister of Railways, was one of the coileagues wbo told my honourable friand to
rny right (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that they
would not corne over to the Senate. I wae
one of the sinners. My reason was that
already I was devoting sixteen hours a day
to tbe business of tbe country. Every Bill
is pretty fhorougbiy explained in Hansard,
and every mernber of tbe Senaf e cen read
the explanation. Aiready Cabinet Ministers
in flue country are over-worked. We bear of
other countries having fewer Cabinet Ministers than we have, to serve more people.
My bonourable friend suggested tbat. I spent
soe years in going tbrough rie miii, carryîng
the load of more tban one Cabinet position,
and I may say that there je no comparison
between tbe work of tbe Cabinet Ministers of
tbe United States and the Cabinet Minister!,
of Canada. There are a greafer number oi
people in the country to -the soutb, of course.
but when bonourabie members consider tbe

SENATE
fact that a Cabinet Minister in the United
States is selected by the President, and therefore does flot have ta be eiected, and that
he is flot a member of Congress, and is flot
bothered and pestered by having ta explain
estirnates and bis in cither house, they
wiii understand the difference. These things
which constitute 70 per cent af the worrying
part of the duties of a Minister in this
country do flot at ail concern the Ministers
af the United States.
The chief reason why I wouid flot favour
the proposition without more argument is that
flic Cabinet Ministers have now too mach
work ta do, to be asked to ýcorne over here
and diseuss their bis. 0f course they would
have ta be subject ta questioning, for witbout tliat their presence would be of no use,
and 1 irubably th'ey îvuuld require ta bring
their deputies. who wouid know ail the details.
If we had the right ta agsk ana Minister over,
we should have the righit ta ask another. Can
we imagine the Finance Minister of Canada
voming aver here ta discuss the details of his
budget with the Senate? Can we imagine
the Prime Minister of Canada being asked by
the Senate ta corne and discuss the Speech
ïrom the Thronc, or bis poli-cies on any qucsion? The ideai is a fine ana, but ta my mind
t is impracticabie, and if will so remain until
.ve get sorne machinery by which the Cabinet
Nlinistr, of Canada ivili have their work reluced.
I do think that sorne way might be found
ta les-sen the difficulties that exist in the transaction oi business between the two Chambers.
If any Government does not wish ta have
Ministers with portfolios in the Senate, I
tlhink it might be represented here by at least
dulice or four Ministers without ýportfolio, ta
whom it couid confide ifs business.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: 1 should lijk ta

meantime. I tbink it rnight be worth whiie
for memibers who are interested in this partieular phase oi aur work, and consciaus, as
everybody rnust be, ai the unsatisfactory way
in which rnucb ai it is done, ta look up thaýt
oid repart. Possibiy a ncw carnmittee might
ba formed, and new recommendations made,
tbough I arn sure rnany af those contained in
the repart wouid meet the approvai af the
flouse to-day.
That repart strongly recommended -the appaintment ai under-secretaries, as suggested
by Sir George Murray, and poînted out thqct,
as the right hanourabie gentlemnan iram Eganville (Rt. Hon. Mr. Grahamn) has said, the
nmount ai work wbich a Cabinet Minister
has ta do is airnost intolerabie.
* Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourribie mcmbers, I have a iew wards I want ta say an
this subjeet. I have no difflcuity ir agreeing,
with the other miembers ai the Senate that if
a Cabinet Minister desired ta camc- daon ta
this Chamber and expiain a Bill we sbouîid ail
be very glad ta bear hirn; but I think the
rigbt banourabie member for Eganvilie (R-..
flan. Mr. Graham) bas pointed out. the impracticahiiity ai that plan from the standpoint
ai tlic Cabinet Minîster.
Thais Chamber bas been uinder a threat ai
reiarm for a great many years. I helieve it
bas bern toid an many occasions tîmat it was
about ta be reiormed. But as I sec the
present proposition it suggcsts the rcforming
ai the House ai Commons rather than the
Senate. ln order ta carry out tbe plan proposed in flic resolution it wouid bc necessary
ta bave bath the flouse ai Commons and the
Cabinet agrec ta reiorrn; that is ta say, ta
carry on their business in a mare expeditiaus
manner than they bave beretofare adopted or
are now ornpioying.
I arn nut favourabiy impressed with wbat
scems. a be an underiying, tbougb p ýrbaps unexpre..e d, idea-that the Senate dIces not ïo
or bas nat done its work weil. Tlv, honourabhi bver ai the resolution bias pa;d a very
bigla compliment ta the rnerbe's ai the
Senate as ta their qualifications for the discharge ai publie business, and I do not know
that any bonourable member of flic Senate
wvill dissent irona that eulogium. I think that
without any boasting it may be saîd that in
respect ta the intelligent and effective discharge ai the business ai this country as it
cames within the contrai and direction ai this
Chianber, the Senate of Canada since 1867 bas
bcad a record ai whicha it rnay weil be proud.
Of course, bcing burnan, it rnay have maade
raistakes, but on a wbole it bas mione good
wvorle, and the country bias been savead millions

MAY 26, 1931
and millions of dollars by ýthe intelligence and
the activities of the Senate. Ther..ore I dIo
flot like to hear it suggested thst in order that
this Senate may do its work better it is or may
be necessary to bring in Cabinet Ministers
to address it. If a Cabinet Minister should
corne, very well; but if lie neyer en-me into
the Senate thjs body could still do its work
well, as it has always done.
I want to allude to another point, which
has flot been mentioned. It is this, that
honourable members of this Chamïber should
flot be carried off their feet by public
criticisms such as referred to by the honourable mover of the resolution. We ail hear these
criticisis on the street and everywhere; sometimes, perhaps, we invite them; but in my
judgment honourable senators should not
be worried by them, for we know that this
Chamber is doing the work that it was intended to do, and is doing it fairly well.
There are fundamental differences between
this Chamber and the other, which. the publie
do flot think about, and which sometimes we
ourselves do not consider. The other branch
of Parliament is an elected body, and we
know very well that in the flouse of Commons-I arn not speaking of one flouse of
Commons more than another-there is in
the carrying on of its business, a constant,
day-by-do.y duel in progress between two
political parties. T-hey are fighting each other
for power. They carry on lengthy debates;
they attack one another; they try to replace
one another. That is the political aspect.
I have no criticismn of that. It is their business--their political business. This Chamber
meets for other business. As my honourable
friend who moved the resolution lias said,
there is little partisanship in this Chamber.
I have made the remark to friends of mine
who have not been in this House-and I
think the statement is correct-that it is a
rare time when there is a division in this
flouse on party lines.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have been sitting
in this flouse since 1917, and I see the condition gradually becoming mellow and more
mellow every year. I see honourable members on either side of this flouse, in the discharge of their duties, actuated principally by
the idea that the country should be well
governed and sound legislation passed. But
the public who have neyer been here and
have never seen thîs flouse at work do not
know that. They think we are fighting and
cutting one another like the members of the
flouse of Commons; which. is a very great
mistake. Instead of that, we are going along
arm in arm, doing our work harmoniously
and effectively.

By way of illustration take this session.
The flouse of Commons and this flouse met
on the l2th of March. It was the 2lst of
April before the members of the flouse of
Commons got down to real business. They
were in the intervening tirne debating the
Addreas, which. we disposed of in a couple of
days. We are here not to carry on lengthy
debates, but to do business; therefore the
public have no right to expect us to be sitting
every day. We do not need to sit every day.
We sit when there is work to do, and do that
work expeditiously, taking our time, so that
the work may be done well. The members
of the other flouse have sat only 44 days
altogether: 16 of those days were devoted to
the debate on the Address, three days to
another debate, two days to another, and two
days to another. I have no fault to find.
r'hat is their work, and they are doing it.
Ever since there lias been a flouse of Coinmons that has been going on, and while there
is a flouse of Commons it will continue. But
it is flot necessary for us to do the same
thing. We have not done it, and we do not
intend to do it. While the other flouse was
sitting 44 days we sa:t 20 days, and in that
time we have disposed of more than all the
business that they have dealt with in 44
days. I say that is a complete answer to the
critics of this Senate.
I make no apology. We do flot need to
inake any apology. We are not a flouse of
Commons; we are a Senate, a revising body.
It is our business to examine the proposed
legisiation, and if we are not satisfied with
the result of our work we have time and
opportunity to study the debates of the other
flouse; so we ean obtain full knowledge of
the Bills without the assistance of a Cabinet
Minister. Sometimes Cabinet Ministers would
be only in the way. A Ca~binet -Minister
may not be able to make as good explanations as the men we have here. So far as I
know, we have got along very well indeed. I
agree with my honourable friend opposite
that we are getting along excellently with the
Minister of Labour and his colleague on lis
left (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), who I hope will
be elevated to a seat in the Cabinet without
portfolio.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Har, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The principal point
1 would impress upon the public, as well as
upon honourable members of the Senate, is
that we have no reýason whatever to be looking around for excuses, or to palliate or mollify the criticisms that are made outaide of
this Chamber. On the contrary, knowing that
our work is well done, that we are spending
al] -the time that is necessary upon that work,
and that we have great reason to be very

SEN'ATE
proud of the record of this Senate, we need
pay no attention to those criticisms.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
members, even though it is a little late, I wish
to trespass upon your good nature for a few
moments, and join in the discussion of the
very interesting subject which the honourable
member from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) bas introduced.
Like my right honourable friend opposite
(Rt. Hon. Mr. Graham), I disagree with most
of what bas been said. With some things
that have been said I am in quite hearty
accord. It is quite possible that some members of this House, or all of us collectively,
nay pin toc many bouquets upon our own
manly breasts; and perhaps the bouquets have
been rather widely distributed this evening.
Should not a man in public life endeavour
to render service to his fellow men rather
than pride himself on being, say, in the Upper
Hoiuse? Or shall those serving in a responsible capacity in another place refuse to come
to this House to give an explanation? My
right honourable friend
(Rt. Hon. Mr.
Graham) has mentioned certain reasons why
they would not come. Their ideas may have
been quite proper, but I frankly say they are
not mine.

My honourable friend our leader on this
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) has said that he
was expressing his own personal views. I
should like it to be clearly understood that in
what J say to-night I too am expressing a
personal opinion and in no way comitting,
or even represcnting the views of, the Govrmunent of the day.
There are reasons, in which I fully join,
why it wou'ld be desirable that Ministers of
ihe Crown sitting in one House should appear
in the other Chamber to give information and
explanations respecting legislation concerning
the Department which they administer. I
think that would be useful. I think it would
be agrecable to public opinion, and to the
members of Parliament in the other House,
for a Minister, particilarly on invitation, te
go fron one House to the other to explain
bis proposed legislation. We all have more or
less of that streak of ordinary human nature
commonly called selfishness, independence, and
so on, and the Minister not invited to corne
and explain would probably net seek an opportunity to do se; but it surely could do no
harm to the constitution of the country, or
even to his own sensibilities, to make the
rules of Parliament such that on requiest any
Minister from one House could appeaur before
the otber House and give information concerning the Department he was administering.

Mr. TANNER.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I bave had the
honour of occupying a seat in this Chambera great honour, indeed, it bas been to mefor more than 15 years, and over a considerable portion of that time I have had the
responsibility of administering the Department
of Labour, under three different Prime Ministers, usually during periods of our national
life and history when more or less difficulty
attached to the problems of that Department.
It is my personal view, based on experience,
tbat from time to time a useful purpose could
bave been served by my standing up in another place and explaining some 'of my
measures.
We do not need to hark back very far te
find an example which demonstrates what I
mean. Only this afternoon, in another House.
a private member rose in his place and read
from newspaper accounts which, briefly stated,
announced that the Premier of a province was
on his way to Ottawa to demand of the

Federal Government $100,000 as an additional
grant te carry on direct relief measures. When
that statement appeared in the public press
of a city in British Columbia, naturally it
was accepted by those who read it as being
correct.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That would not
be on a bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
planation of a measure.

No, but in ex-

Right Hon. Mr. 'GRAHAM: No, that would
not be an explanation of a measure; it would
be an explanation of a newspaper item
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
If my right
honourable friend will pardon me, I shall be
through with the matter in a few moments.
The fact was that the Prime Minister did
come froni the Pacifie coast to Ottawa, but
net for any such purpose as that stated in the
newspaper story, for his Government, in conmon with that in every other province, had
been advised a month before that the Federal
Coernomment intended to continue the relief
of unemployment in accordance with the
scheme approved at the special session last
year. The Premier, on reaching here, had
three conferences with a numaber of officials
and myself, but on no occasion was there
any mention of the matter referred to in the
newspaper item.
Why should there have
been, when ho had been given -assurances of
the Goveirnment's intention weeks before?
Questions were asked in the other House of
the honourable gentleman who bas been good
enough to assumie the burden cf representing

MAY 26, 1931
the Department of Labour there because the
Minister of that Departmerd lias a seat in
this House. H1e was flot famniliar with these
facts, naturally, and information had to be
given to him. He has gone to a great deal
of trouble to familiarize hiniself with information that neither the public nor Parliament expeet hlm to know anything aboutfor he lias enough work in connection with
bis own Department-and lie lias done
exceptionally well.
Who is the

The explanation

cou Id have been given in a f ew minutes
without inconvenience, worry or trouble to
other people. If that course were followed
it might prevent the broadcaisting through the
public press of incorrect statements which set
the public mind agog and cannot be evertaken for weeks or months by the truth. I
submit, bonourable senators, that there are
great advantages to be gained, from the standpoint of the public weal, by following sucli
a course, althougli I amrn ot by any means
advocating it. It is perhaps more comfortable to bave a seat in this House than to
have to struggle for one in the other place. I
feel somewhat as Lloyd George must have
feit xvhen, some years ago, lie indulged in
what I think was intended to lie a bit of
sarcasm in a reference to the House of Lords.
lie said, "Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me ail the days of my life, and I iall
dpell in the House of Lords for ever." Probably honourable memnbers of this House feel
quite content because they are able to, enjoy
tliemselves and be at peace with the world,
bere in the Senate, which is our equivalent
of the bouse of Lords, and are free from the
struggles and the perhaps more active life of
the other bouse.
As I said at the beginning, I think that the
objeet cf every man in publie life ouglit to
be to serve the people; and if that entails
personal inconvenience, lie should be wiiling
to make the necessary sacrifice. As far as I
arn personally concerned, I arn prepared to
support the resolution cf my honourable
friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux).
Hon. G. GORDON: Honourable memliers,
thîs motion reads:
Resolved, that in order te expedite the business of Parliamient, Ministers of the Crown
should be permitted te appenr £rom time te
time before this Flouse for the purpose of
cxplaining and giving information with respect
te Government legisiation.

157

I ask honourable memibers, as business men,
bow much legislation would be expedited by
sucli a change in proce-dure? If ministers came
over here and expl'ained their bills, te what
extent would that facilitate the work cf the
other Chainber, which is the only place where
business is ever blocked? I have been a
member of this lieuse since 1912, and I neyer
knew busineff te lie blocked or unduly delayed here; that sort of thing occurs only in
the other lieuse.. Suppose ministers came te
the Senate and spent a short or a long time,
m.the case might be, in explaining bills, how
mucli earlier would Parliament proregue? I
venture te say that members of the present
Cabinet and former Cabinet mînisters would
answer that prorogation would net be reached
one minute carlier. Therefore I think that
from. tliat standpoint the motion should fail.
Reference lias been made te the criticism
in the press and elsewhere regarding the sittings cf thîs Chamber. Ever since I have
been a member of the Senate the matters
that have corne bef are this lieuse have been
attended te in a businesslike way, and if I
did not believe they would lie se treated inl
the future 1 would net remain here. Tliis
lieuse acts on the principle tliat the work on
hand should be done as promptly as possible,
and wben there is nothing te do we slieuld
adjourn. If that lias resulted in criticism from
the press or any ether element in our country,
then ail I have te say is tliat the criticism
is ill-advised and means nething.
bon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
as the heur is late, I move that this debate
be adjourned until te-morrow. I slieuld like
te make a few remarks abocut this question.
The debate was ad.ieurned.

ARMISTICE DAY BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE, Chairnîcu of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills,
to whom was referred Bill A, an Act to amend
the Armistice Day Act, reported the Bill with
one amendient.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Could we not
have an explanation of the amendment?

SENATE

160

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The amendment is
very simple. The Bill read "legal holiday."
We strike out the vord "legal" as being unnecessary, "holiday" being defined by the
statute. If the word "legal" were left in, it
would create confusion as making a distinction
between a "holiday" and a "legal holiday."
Hon. Mr. FORKE: D'ces this mean that
Armistice Day and Thanksgiving Day will
still be observed on the same day?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

No.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: It is left to the Government to name the time when Thaniksgiving
Day shall be observed?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

Yes.

LIQUOR SMUGGLING FROM ST. PIERRE
AND MIQUELON
PROPOSED

INVESTIGATION

Bcfore the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I wish to call the attention of
the House and the Government to a matter
of some urgency, possibly of national importance. Last winter I read in the newspapers that the Government intended to institute an inquiry into the smuggling of liquor
from the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon
te lower Quebec and other parts on the
St. Lawrence river. But to-day I noticed in
ihe Montreal Gazette a déspateh stating that
this inquiry has not been made yet, and in
lon. Mr. DANDURAND.

fact that there has been no Order in Couneil
authorizing such an inquiry, though it is expected that an Order will be passed very
soon. The despatch is short and as it i the
basis of my remarks I ask permission to read
it. It is as follows:
Rum Probe Not So Dead As Believed-New
Order in Council Extending Scope
Expected to Be Adopted Soon
(Special to The Gazette.)-Quebec, May 26.
.- new Order in Council is to be adopted by
A
the Bennett Cabinet shortly, and a start will
bo made with the rum probe which was to
have opened around Easter, according to information in the hands of prominent Conservatives
here.
The quest for the Quebec-Miquelon-St. Pierre
rum ring, estimated to have muleted the federal
treasury of millions in the last few years
through its smuggling activities along the lower
St. Lawrence. is not as dead as many Liberals
bere profess to know; well-informed Conservatives say the probe is considerably more alive
than some of the Liberals would prefer.
I have nothing to do with the party insinuations.
According to information here, the delay in
starting the inquiry came through discovery
that the original Order in Council was not
framed in a inanner calculated to produce the
The Minister of National
data desired.
Revenue is known to have a keen interest in
w-hat seems to some the astounding gap between
Ontario and Quebec excise tax totals. So the
nerw Order in Council, it is reported, will lay
docw n that the investigation is to be into "the
landing of cargoes on rivers, lakes and harbours
of the Province of Quebec." Power will be
given to subpoena witnesses or representatives
of organizations who, in the opinion of counsel
for the Department of National Revenue, would
be likely sources of fruitful information.
My suggestion is that the Maritime Provinces be included in that inquiry. We who
live in that part of the country know that a
very large volume of liquor is smuggled in
every year from the islands of St. Pierre and
Miquelon. In the circumstances a very large
sum of money is lost to the federal treasury,
but, in my opinion, the most serious aspect
is that the people are being demoralized to a
considerable extent.
This smuggling is largely due to the
high duties that were placed upon spirituous
liquors during the war. I voted for those
high duties, thinking at the time that they
would have a beneficial effect, but since then
I have come to the conclusion that until a
change is made, smuggling on a large scale,
with all its evil consequences, will continue.
There is another view that I should like
to express, and that is that if smuggling is
stopped or greatly reduced there will be an
inerease in illegal home-brewing; and it would
be difficult to say whether that evil would be
greater than the existing one. I think the
inquiry should take this feature into con-

sideration. 1 should be giad if the honourable leader of the House could sce his way
clear to tell me that he will bring this matter
to the attention of the Government and report resuits to us.
Hon. G. D. ROBE RTSON: The honourable gentleman's remarks are very interesting.
I cannot conflrm the statement contained in
the newspaper item that he has read, but if
an Order in Council with regard to this
matter is issued in the near future it will, of
course, be duly published in the Gazette and

COMMITTEE

On the Order:
Consideration of the report of the Speciai
Committee to whom was referred Bill E, an
Act with respect to Hospital SweepstakesHon. Mr. Barnard.
Hon;' Mr. BARNARD: I wiil not discuss
the Committee's report at the present time.
I understand the honourable gentleman from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) intends to
move certain amendments, which, I may say,
are acceptable to me.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would suggest that
this matter be lef t over until to-morrow,
because the amendments that 1 intend to
move need further consideration.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Unfortunately, I
cannot be here to-morrow. If the honourable gentleman wilI leave it until FridayHon. Mr. BEIQUE: I shall not be here
on Friday.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Say Tuesday next.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable senators, as I understand the
matter, the Special Committee that has reported upon this Bill has suggested an amendment to the Iast section. Arn I correct?
Hon! Mr. BARNARD: Yes.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
From that I infer that the Committee
appruves of ail the rest of the Bill. I do not
sec any objection to the passage of a motion

to adopt the Committee's report, for that
does not finally dispose of the matter. I
arn under the impression that the next move
wiih be to give the Bill third reading.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: If it will be in
any way a convenience to honourabie gentlemen, and if my honourable friend from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) wili move this
amcndment on the motion for third reading,
I amn quite satisfied to have the report
adopted to-day.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think it is better
to adhe-re to, the regular procedure by dealing
with the proposed amendments before the report is adopted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the honourabie gentleman intend to move tihat the
Bill be sent back to, tihe GCommittee for
f urther consideration?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, I do not think
that wili be necessa'ry. When we are again
eonsidering the Committee's report I "11al

The Order was discharged, and piaced on

Resohved, that in order to expedite the business of l>arliamnent, Ministers of the Orown
shouhd be permitted to appear from time to
time before this House for the purpose of
explaining and giving information with respect

Hon. F. 'B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
the sui3ject matter of the re-soîntion mioved by
the honourable gentleman from Rougemont

years that I have been a membei, of the

various suggestions that have been made during this debate, it seeme to me there is sueh a
difference -of opinion on the question involved
that it would be very difficult for us to arrive
at any decision that would be beneficiai to,
this Chamber.
I should niot have trespassed at ail upon
,the time of honourable memibers in this connection had it not been that -recenthy I had
occasion to iook into the history of the two

decidedly differenýt from what il bas been

after Confedecation had a strong Cabinet
representation in this Bouse. It was proportionately as great as in the Bouse of
Commons. To illustrate: the flrst Government after Confederation Listed from 1867
until 1873, under the leadership of Sic John
A Macdonald. During that î>eriod of five or
six yeacs thc followiing gentlemen held portfolios and sat in this Chamber: Hon. A. J.

Hon. Mr. B'LACK: I arn coming to that.
Il is quite true that those six gentlemen
wcre not ail members of the Cabinet and
of the Senate at the samne lime. So far as
1 can find from the records, there were at oneý
lime four ministers sitting in Ibis Chamber,
three of them with portfolios and one without portfolio.
Thon wo corne to the second Goveroment,
fromn 1873 to 1878, under the Hon. Alexander
Mackenzie as Prime Minister. The following members of bis Cabinet sat in the
Sonate: Hon. David ChriNtie, Secretacy of
State; Hon. R. W. Scott, witbout portfolio;
Hon. Lue Letellier, Minister of Agriculture;
Hon. J. E. Cauchon, witbout portfolio. AlI
four werc not Cabinot ministers at tbe samne
timne, but the records indicate that at one
lime there were sittîng in Ibis Bouse three
of the Cabinet ministers, two of whom had
no portfolios.
From 1878 10 1,891 Sir John A. Macdonald

there wvere no fewec than ton Cabinet ministors wbo bcd scats in the Sonate. They

MAY 27, 1931
ta support the proposai made by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Lemieux), but to
strengthien the suggestion that we might have
better
Cabinet representation
in this
Chamber.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not better
representation, but more of it.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Yes. After -ail, 1
think that ail of us, before coming to this
Chamber, were supporters of one political
party or another. I agree that after we corne
here our minds become mellow, our ideam
broaden, and our sensibilities perhaps are
blunted. At ail events, we in this Chamber
are not as strongly partisan as we were before comiug here. NevertheIess, we stili owe
and maintain our party allegiance, andI
ask: could we not, since 1896, have exercised
some influence with the Government of the
day whereby adequate Cabinet representation
should be given to this Chamber?
Now 1 want to go haek a littie farther and
give you another impýression that 1 have
gained from perusing the records. It seems
to me that in the earlier days a great many
more measures, both Governrnent and private
bills, were initiated in this Chamber than
have been initiated here since 1 have hecome
a member of this body. If you look back to
the time of the first three Cabinets you wilI
find that a very substantial proportion of the
legisiation of the day was introduced in
this Chamber, and that Cabinet ministers
introduced their bis as they now introduce them in the House of Commons.
Whether or not that led to the shortening of the session is, in my opinion,
open to doubt. The records lead me to believe that when measures initiated in the
Senate came up for consideration in another
place they were discussed at .iust as great,
length as if they had not already been dealt
with in this Chamber. It does appear to me,
however, and it must appear to every memiber
of the Senate, that it would be a great advantage to have many bis orîginate in this
flouse, a more mature body than the Coinmons, and to, have such bills considered in a
much more equable manner than they can
be in an elective Chamber.
We criticize the members of the flouse of
Commons because they spend three, four or
perhaps five weeks in the discussion of what,
after ail, is a purely academie matter, i'f anything discussed in Parliament is acadernie,
nameiy, the Speech ftrom the Throne. AIl
the Speeches from the Throne that I have
ever read were as fine a sort of camouflage
as I have ever seen. The apparent intention
22112-11J

of' the Speech was to say nothing in many
words. But the members of the other Chanaber
feel that'they owe it as a duty to their -constituents to rise and give their opinions on
variaus subjects, and so long as democratie
institutions exist that sort of thing is bound
to continue. I do not attach any blame to the
memibers in that regard. I think we shouýld ail
do the sarne, and many of us have done it,
in an elective Chamber.
If the Senate has been slighted in the matter
of ministerial represenbation, the Governments
or the pa:rties are to blarne, and if we cannot
hring enough influence to bear on the parties
that we have supported in the past, at ail
events, and are supyposed to support now, we
cannot expeet any redress aiong this line.
Personaliy I have no objection whatever
ta Ministers of the Crown coming into this
Chamber and explaining their measures. In
many cases I should be very glad indeed to
have them do so. I think it was the right
honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) who yesterday admitted
his own sins, saying that when hie occupied
an important position in another Chamber
hie refused to be induced or coerced to corne
here. We may have had the right to send
the Sergeant-at-Arms after him, but I arn
afraid that hie would have had an arrnful,
and I doubt very much that hie would have
been able to bring the right honourabIe
gentleman here.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: You would
have had ta get a new Sergeant-at-Arma.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: If that is the position
that ministers in another House are going
to take, what are we to do about it? I do
not think we shauld place ourselves in the
position of beggîng ministers to corne here.
If they w-ish to corne, let us extend to them
the courtesies of the Chamber. If they refuse, they miss the opportunity of addressing a very honourable body, and it is their
bass.
There is a-nother suggestion that I have ta
make. Looking across the floor, I see Privy
Councillors ta whom I give credit for having
the ability to fill any breach or meet any
emergeney. Then I look along this aide of
the flouse and see everywhere men -who
could very well represent the Government
in this flouse, and who, if ministers from the
other flouse did not came over here to
present important measures, might well be
appointed deputies, if you like, ta represent
the va-rious important ministers and explaihi
the measurea coming before us. They coulal
act in the Senate as the representatives of

SENATE
the ministers in the other House, and, having
studied the subject to be disoussed here,
could give us a great deal of information
such as we do not now receive. I am quite
in accord with anything that would have
the effect of giving us more information than
we are now getting.
As to the criticisms that have continually
been made concerning the adjournments of
this House and the attitude of the members,
I have only this to say. I have a very high
regard for the press of this country, and I
think it reports very fairly not only parliamentary proceedings, but the news of the
country. I think few countries are blessed
with as accurate a press as we have in Canada.
It is true that mistakes are made; it is aiso
true that because we are not an elective body,
and because some of our friends of the press
become sometimes a little humorous, they
make us the butt of their humour. If that
pleases them, however, I am perfectly willing
so far as I am concerned, that they should
be pleased, and if there is anything to laugh
about, I am perfectly willing to laugh with
them. I do not think that affects any of the
members of this Hlouse.
As to adjournments, I for one, ever since
coming to this House, have been ready and
willing-as I hope I shall always be-to stay
here when there was anything to be done;
and I think that every member of this Chamber takes the same attitude. But if there is
no work for us here, whose fault is that?
It is net ours. And I maintain that we are
of more bonefit to oulrselves, to the provinces
that we represent, and to Canada, when we
are at home attending to our own affairs than
when we are sitting here twiddling our thumbs
because we have nothing else to do. I do not
think there is any measure of discredit to be
cast on this House because it does not sit
when there is no work to be done. We always
have done the work that has corne to us, and
while 1 do not believe in our patting ourselves
on the back, I would say, from my own observation, that the work that has come to the
Senate in the past has always been well donc.
I think that is the consensus of opinion in
both Chambers and outside. I think it is a
mistake for us to sit when there is no work
to do. To read in Hansard that the Senate
sat at 3 o'clock and adjourned at 3.15 simply
makes us ridiculous. Those who have to stay
in Ottawa may do so, but men who are worthy
of sitting in this Chamber are certainly useful
citizens of the country, and if there is none
of the country's business to be done here
they can be doing it elsewhere. Therefore I
Hon.

Mr.

BLACK.

have not very *much sympathy with the idea
of remaining here when we have really no
business -to discuss.
That, honourable members, is about all that
I have to say. I thought that possibly a
memorandum as to the representation in this
Chamber in earlier days might be of some
interest to those Who did not know or had
forgotten it. It was only by accident that I
became aware of it. I would suggest to the
two honourable gentlemen immediately to my
left, worthy representatives of the Government in this House, that they use their influence to see that the present Government
accords greater representation to this House.
I have no doubt that with their abilities and
powers of persuasion they can effect some
improvement.
Meantime I have no doubt that the country
generally regards this body with favour.
The idea that the Senate is unpopular has
not corne my way, at all events. We shal
always be criticized. We always have been.
Any legislative body, elective or otherwise,
is bound to be criticized. But it is a very
fortunate thing for Canada that we have one
Chamber that is not elected. I consider that
a nominative Senate is just as important
as a nominative judiciary, and I think an
elective Senate would be a greater misfortune
to Canada than an elective judiciary. We
have an illustration in the situation across
the border. Without making any invidious
comparisons I may say that the subversion
of justice across the border is in many cases
solely due to the fact that the bench there
is elective and not nominative. A change
from a nominative to an elective Senate
would bring about just the same condition that
prevails in the Commons. To begin with,
we should talk two or three weeks on the
Speech from the Throne, because we should
have to go to our constituencies; and we
should discuss endlessly every little amendment that we thought might affect our constituency or our interests in it. The safegu.ard of the -constitution is the Canadian
Senate. May it always remain practically
as it is to-day, nominative and not elective.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable
members, it is not my intention to labour
this question. It seems to me that the whole
ground has been pretty well covered, and
while I do not think that I can add very
much to what has been said, I want to point
out one aspect of the question which has
been referred to but once. I take it that
it is assumed--it was by the honourable gentlemen who spoke-that we must amend our

MAY 27, 1931
rules in order to enabie a Minister of the
Crown to corne to us with his measures. I
do not think that is at ail necessary; and
even if we did amend the ruies we should
stili have to persuade the me mbers of the
Cabinet to corne here. So I do not think
we shouid consîder this matter at aIl with a
view to the amend.ment of the rules, and if
that is regar.ded as an objection to the proposai advanced by the honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lernieux)
I think it must disappear.
Judging fromn the discussion that bas taken
place, I take it that nearly everybody here
wouid welcome the presence of any Cabinet
Minister for the purpose of explaîning his
measures to us, and I do not know why we
do not put the question to the test. Soon,
perhaps within a very few days, the Secretary
of State, who has charge of the Bill amending the copyright law-a very important
matter andi one which I think miglit very
properiy have been introduced in this House
-will be bringing in lis Bill. I think that
the Senate, to 'be logicai, ouglit on this
occasion to put to tlie test the very proposai
tliat we have been discussing.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAGH: By what procedure?
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: Let us see whetsler
there is any disposition on tlie part of any
of the members of the Governmnt to corne
to us to efiplain their measures.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: By what procedure ?Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn coming .0o
that., I would suggest that the leader of the
Governrnent in this House invite the Hon.
Mr. Cahan, Secretary of State, to corne to
us with his Bill wben it is passeti by the
House of Commons, a.nd explain it; and I
would urge that the invitation be extended
as eoon as possible. We should then kniow
,wlether there is any disposition on the part
of Cabinet ministers to corne here and explain their bills. We may then be in a position to do sometbing more deifinite, or at
ail events we sliouid be batter able to judge
wliether it is advisable to press the resolution
which lias been moved liere, or to drop it for
good.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I ar n ot thinking so much of our getting a better understanding of Governrnent bis. I do flot take
that to be the ob.Iect that the honourable
Mr.
(Hon.
Rougemont
member f rom
Lemieux) had in mind. At any rate, wbat I
arn more interested in is the expediting of
legisiation. We are able to understand any
bis here without the assistance of members
of another Chamber. What is desired, as
I understand, is sorne means of shortening
the session. I think ail lionourable miembers
have that in mind, and if we can achieve
that purpose in the way that bas been suggested, so much the better. The point is, can
we ohorten the sessions by carrying out the
suggestion of the honourabie member frorn
Rougernont? But I arn not greatiy irnpressed
with the tbought that if this suggestion were
put into effect we could do our work better.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourabie senators, we have had a very
pleasant and, I think, instructive discussion.
I rise to suggest that something should be
done so that the discussion may be fruitful of
resuits. Fromn the time that I have taken an
interest in public affairs I have been in
favour of a Senate that is mainly nominative,
but I have sometirnes thouglit that provision
might be made for the selection, by the
Governrnent or sorne other authority, of mnen
who have flot been participants in party
confliet, but are noted for their educationai,
business or professional achievements. My
experience lias led me to believe that the
Senate shouid be mainiy or wholiy nominative.
The temptation for a Government to appoint
to the Senate men who have been supporters
of that Government and given it good service
13 naturaiiy very strong and is comrnonly
yielded to. Because of thîs fact, perliaps in
some instances nominations have been made
wbich were not quite sQ advantageous to the
Senate as sorne that miglit have been made
had the conditions been different. But to
have an elective Senate, composed of mnembers who would go to the samne constituencies

166

SENATE

as the members of the other House, or even
to different constituencies, would, I think,
introduce conditions which would not be
favourable to the best work being done by
this Chamber.
I have always been of the opinion that,
whatever Government is in power, a certain
number of Cabinet ministers should have seats
in the Senate. There is a wide diversity in
the portfolios of our country. Some are said
to be of a class which necessitates that the
ministers concerned should be members of
the other House; but it could be taken as a
rule that at least two of the seventeen or
e'ighteen departmental portfolios should be
held by senators. The method of having information brought by tunnel into the Senate
by a member who is not in the Cabinet and
has no portfolio has worked fairly well, but
not well enough. The time when information
on any topie is wanted and can be put to the
best advantage is when the topic is being considered. Let us take for example the period
during which my honourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was Government
leader in this House. He was a mendber of the
Cabinet without portfolio. and when we
wanted information with reference to any
department of the Government it had to come
through him. We were, let us say, discussing
some affair of state, a public bill or a matter
of administration, and after various opinions
were expressed it became necessary to get
certain facts. At that stage perhaps I would
rise and ask my honourable friend for the information, but ho would quite properly say,
"I have not a portfolio, and therefore all I
can do is to promise to make inquiry and to
bring the results of that inquiry to this House
later.' That imniediatelv threw a wet blanket
ovier the whole discussion. Had an answer
to the question been available at the time, it
would have been of very great advantage, but
the House would probably not receive the
information for two, three, tive or even ton
days afterwards. Whrn the information was
obtained it would frequently be founod inadequate, and in the m(eantime
ost of the interest in the discussion had been lost. After
a few experiences of that kind, sometimes
made worse by adjournments, one felt it futile
to press the matter further. Now, I think
that for the sake of the honour, the strength
and the self-respect of the Senate, there ought
to be at least two Cabinet ministers, with
portfolios, permanently in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I believe the policy of having two ministers
bere would be of very great advantage to us.

ninety-six members, all more or less experienced in public affairs, and many standing
high in the business or professional world.
Some of our members are intimately concerned with the management of great industries. Is our combined experience not
worth something?
Surely it is. Yet is it
not a fact that most of that experience is not
made use of in the Senate? Now, I should
like to know if it is not possible for us te
devise some means whereby this ripe experience represented here shall be utilized
more extensivelv than it is. The administration of government has not been brought to
i state of perfection; there is no mould or
pattern which we are bound to follow. I take
it that it is a question whether or net past
and present parliamentary usages are not becoming a little staleHon. Mr. BELCOTRT:

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
-and a matter of some dissatisfaction to the
ountry. In other words, it is a question
whether governmental and political administrative methods are net likely to be greatly
varied by new conditions. The members of
this bodyi are brought bore frocm all parts of
Canada, are free from party bias and stand
ready, willing and able to project thenselves
into the public service of this country. Then
why is all this ripe and mellow experience
that we have hore net being availed of to the
extent that it might be? In the future, I believe ,
the tendency will be away from the
making of laws on academic an:1 theoretical
grounds, and in legislative natters there will
be more and more use for reearch, supported
v skill and experience. Horein I think that
the Senate lias now, and in the future will
increasingly hae. scope for the exorcise of
its abilities.
Now, after ail the talk that we have heard
on this resolution, why should we not examine
the matter a little further? A new Governmient is in office. and I feel sure that it has
some new ideas with regard to administrative
affairs. Should we not ascertain what the
opinions of the new Government are in this
respect? My suggestion is that we should,
if possible, have a joint committee of both
Houses to consider and frankly discuss what
can be done towards bringing about a more

SENATE
After iistening to the speeches, and coming
to the conclusion that we are unanimous in
regarding the Sonate as a revising body, it
seems to me that it would be contravening
the rules to initiate Government legisiation
here. My honourablc friend to my right (Hon.
Sir Allen Ayiesworth) hias called my attention
to the fact that it was intended by the constitution that the Sonate shouid be a revising
body. It was meant to be composed of men
of a certain age, men whose political passions
were meilowed. as hias just been said by the
right honourable the junior member for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster).
The
constitution
provides
that anyone
appeinted to the Senate must be at ieast
thirty years of age, and that, once appointed,
hoe romains a senator for life; and it is my
oxperience that we do not grow any younger
by sitting bore. Somo may say that we are
given a new lease of ]ife, but as the years
pass age overtakes uis. If wo initiate logislation in this Chamber, we are not allowing
the Sonate te play the role that it was intended to play, but are making the House of
Commons-which is composed of young and
aggressive men uipholding particular intorests,
believing them to be the interosts of the country-a revising body to reviow the work that
wo have done. Has. that aspect of the question been takon into consideration?
As te I he coming bore of Ministers of the
Crown. I for one should bc deligbted to listen
at any timo to any or every Minister of the
Crown explaining bis legisiation on the floor
of the Senate; but aIl of ui.. especialiy those
wvbo bave sat in the other bouse, know that
a Minister of the Crown very seldom brings
legislation before the bouse witbout ba-ving,
seatcd by bis side the Dcputy Minister, or an
accounitant, or an ongineer, w~ho furnishcs hum
with detaîls which enable humi to answer the
questions that may ho put to him. A similar
priviloge is recognized in this House. 1 romember very well that wbcn the logisiation
concerning a certain department was before
the Sonate the officers of that department
were ailowed to sit alongside the benourable
gentleman wbo represented tho Gox ernment,
in order to give Iimi the necessary information and expedite matters.
What have w'e to comiplain about?
We
nover have delayed logisiation; we have nover
been accused of passing legîslation hastily.
Though 1 have not been in this bouse as
long as some honourable gentlemen, I have
heen struek hy the fact that the committees
of the Seato are attended by a greater
numbor oi menmbers t han are the committees
on the other side of Parliament; and, speakHn. Mr. BUREAU.

ing frein an experience of thirty yoars, I
arn of opinion that most of the detail work
is donc in the committees. It is there that
questions are asked. In the bouse we carry
on academie discussions, we .ive buis second
readings, and discuss the principle, but when
wo want te know whether we shouid aceept
or rejeet a bill we send if te committee.
WT
ýhy is that done? It is in ordor that we
may obtain ail the detailed information that
is necessary for the purpose of forming an
opinion and making a pronotincement upon
the bill.
1 tbink the honeurabie miember froin Pictou
(Hon Mr. Tanner) struck the right note yesterday.
Wbat is the object of raising this
question bore?
Is it te discuss the prerogatives and powers of the Sonate? That lias

for that purpose secured the opinions of
ominent legal ligbts on the question, and that
committee mïade a report. So wo sbould ho

honourable gentleman on the othier side (Hon.
Mr. McLennan), that in 1919 a commiittoc
wvas appointed te inquire into the macbinery

at that timoe. If any senater on perusing the
statutos finds anything that sbould ho amonded

I always admire my right bonourable friend
frein Ottawa (Right bon. Sir George E.

and gees back te tbe days wben hoe was more
fiery than hoe is to-day. In the days of youth
we wero ail filled withl a more exuberant spirit

Wo do net want that spirit te ho renewed

to be given to the House, and it is net given
by a senator, wo may find that wo are not as

Sonate, the sleeping political partisan migbt

That is enly human. AIl our
arguments must ho made frein a buun
standpoint as weli as frein a business standpeint. If the presence of a Mînister is going

MAY 27,193-1
to expedite matters, for goodness sake let us
know how. Nobody has yet shown that it
would. On the other hand, if we adopt the
practice of initiating legisiation in this House
and letting the other House revise it, we may
be sorry for it some day. That that was
the fear of my honourable friend the leader
of this House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) was
apparent when he suggested to my neighbour
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) that there was no mistake
about the Senate being a revising body.
My main purpose in rising was to askr how
business is going to be expedited by Ministers who are flot mem-bers of the Senate
being permitted to address us. If anybody
can enlighten me, I arn willing to say: "LIet
themn corne." Otherwise I cannot see but
that we should be wasting not only our time
but theirs iu having thein repeat what they
had already said in another place, ail of which
could be read in Hansard.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:

pleasure, honourable members, to adopt the

Somne Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. R. DANDURAND:
I arn perhaps
late, and surely out of order; but as we have
been discussing this matter for some time.
and as my honourable friend from, La Salle
(Hon. Mr. Bureau) has put a question, perhaps it is as well that we should speak our
minds freely and fully. -As to the question
whether we can expedite the business of Parliament by allowing Minîsters from the other
Chamber to corne here, I suggest that it can
be approached from only one angle.The
House of Gommons takes two or three weeks
to discuss the Address, two or three iveeks
to deal with the Budget, several weeks to
vote supply-all matters that do not concern
this Chamber. During ail that time the
Gommons cannot deal with anything else. If
in those periods, amounting in ail to perhaps
two months, Ministers could appear in this
Chamber and place before it the other
important legislation of the session, that legislation could be thoroughly scrutinized here in
our standing committees or in Committec of
the Whole and then sent back to the House
of Commons. Would such procedure not
shorten the discussions in the House of
Gommons? That is the question that I put.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Do I understand that
the honourable gentleman suggests that these
measures should be deait with in this House
before being introduced in the House of
Commons?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

169

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Only a certain clams of
legislation could be dealt with here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, of course,
money bis could not be introduced here. But
it seems to me that the House of Gommons
would not find it necessary to spend as much
time as it now does on important measures
of other kinds if they were deait with in the
Senate first.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE': There is nothing to
prevent the doing of that now; there are no
rules against it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It can be done to-day,
or any day.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: Yes. But is it
advisable to invite Cabinet mînisters to corne
to this Chamber and present their legisIation?
And the question has been asked: if ministers
did appear here, what advantage would resuit?
Would the sessions becoane shorter? Would
business be expedited? I suggest that business
might be expedited if more buis were passed
through the Senate first and, as a resuit, the
other House spent less time on them than it
would if those bills had originated there. My
honourable friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux) was Speaker of the House of Gom.mons for some eight years, and I think that
he will bear me out when I say that on many
occasions the members of t'hat House have
been so satisfied with the work done by the
Senate on certain bis that they have passed
them with littie or no discussion. As an
instance, we gave a great deal of care te a
Bill that made a number of arnendments to
the Bankruptcy Act, and when that Bill was
sent over to the other House it was approved
there without delay.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Honourabie senators, I
fail to see how we could possibly expedite
the business of- Parliament by following the
c ourse suggested in the resolution. It is true
that we might obtain valuable information
from. Ministers of the Crown with respect to
bills that they are sponsoring, but the bills,
after their passage through this House, would
have to be sent to the House of Gommons
and go through the usual course. As I listened
to the discussion it seemed to me that the
resolution was wrongly worded. If the honourable member fromn Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux) had drafted a memnorial asking the
House of Commons to put its legisiation
through more quickly so that we might have
more time for considering it, or if the resolution had been to the effect that cer-tain types
of legisîstion should be initiated in this
House, the discussion might have had a more
practical outcome.

Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators, I desire to make but a few remarks before the discussion is concluded. There is a
very important committee of the other flouse,
known as the Public Accounts Committee,
which goes over the Auditor General's report
of the preceding year. As honourable meinbers who have attended that committee
know, the discussion at times is rather acrimonious. Could a committee of this flouse
perform that work well? There is in the
minds of the people sometimes a doubt as to
the actual axcount of the public debt. Would
a finding of a committee of this flouse on a
matter of that kind give useful information
to the country? There are so many comxnittees of the other flouse that the members there often find it difficult to attend
them al, and occasionally perhaps the work
is not so well done as otherwise it might be.
Now, could soume of that committee work be
apportioned between the two Houses? At
the present time committees of the Senate
deal with bills that hav e passed the other
House or have been initiated here, but as
far as J know none of our committees deal
with xmatters like those handled in the Public
Accounts Committee.
In the other flouse
there is a surplus of work and here there is
a shortage. Could we not, to the advantage
of the country at laxrge, assume a larger share
of the burden?

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
Before the discussion closes I should like to make a few
observations that I think are relevant. The
suggestion has been made that under-secretaries might be appointed to represent the
Government departments in this Chamber,
but my opinion is that the system we now
have is preferable. Each department has a
Hion.

Mr. GILLIS

deputy minister who is supposed to be, and
I believe is, non-political in his attitude.
These deputies are familiar with the details
of their respective departments and are of
great assistance ta their ministers; in fact,
the ministers rely upon them. We have had
deputy ministers in this flouse assisting the
Government leader at various times, and, as
all honourable members know, it is a common
thing for a minister in the other flouse to
have his deputy sitting beside him when
matters concerning his own department are

appearing here ta explain their legislation we
should be in danger of considering matters
from a partisan point of view.
To appoint senators as ministers with partfolios is, it seems to me, ta discriminate, for
a minister who has a seat in the other House
is obliged to go to his constituents for election, whereas a senator is not put to that
trouble. Furthermore, I think it is generally
considered in the other House that the portfolios should be held by members of the
clective body because, for one reason, appointment to the Cabinet is looked upon as a
promotion and as one means of rewarding the
faithful service of some who have fought in
the ranks. I am net saying that J agree with
sentiments of that kind; J am merely
expressing what I think is the fact.
We should never forget that the people of
Canada look upon the Senate as a judicial
rather than an initiating body. Throughout
the country it is generally felt that the members of this House have dispensed with their
former political sympathies and deal with
every piece of legislation impartially on its
merits. As the honourable member for Westmoreland (Hon. Mr. Black) remarked, all
legislative bodies are open to criticism. On
the whole, though, the Senate is well regardod.
What would be the situation if we had two
or three Cabinet ministers sitting in this
Chamber? Of necessity we should be urged,
more strongly than we now are, to put through
legislation for the Government of the day.
The ministers would naturally attend Council
meetings, where the whole policy of the
Government is discussed, and ways and
means for putting through Government legislation are considered. Consequently we might
fxnd considerable pressure being exerted here.
We do not want that kind of pressure, and
therefore we should be careful before we open
the door to what perhaps may be called, not

legisiation, and then we shall run up against
the difficulty mentioned by the honourable
member frorn La Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau).
I submit that if we reverted to the practice
of having in this Chamber more Cabinet
ministers with portfolios, we should flot be
in a position to consider legislation in the
impartial way that we do at present.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: 1 desire first
to make a brief staternent in reference to
the remarks of the honourable member for
La Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau). It always should
be borne in mind that this House acts as a
revising body, and 1 think we ought flot co
atternpt to make any change in that respect.
Inasmuch as we are a revising body, we cannot very well be to the sarne extent an
originating body. But it seems to, me that
more of one class of legisiation might be
initiated in this House: 1 refer to private bis.
1 en well imagine that members of the other
House, particularly junior members, may be
eager to introduce private legisiation that is
popular with their constituents, and that tbey
are desirous of getting ail the kudos that
may result froin the passage of their bis,
but I do not know why ail private bis could
flot originate in the Senate. It would need
only a slight revision of our rules to make
this possible. Members of the other House
who are interested could appear before Our
committees and give al the information at
their disposai, with a view to assisting in the
passage of the measui.res. Honourable members who, unlike myseif, have had the privilege
of sitting in the other Houýe know that -a
considerable amount of time is spent on some
private bis there. If we initiated all such
legisiation here w,ý should not be abdicating
our important position as a rdvising body.
It rnight be said that the tirne of ministers
would flot be saved by a change of this kind,
since they are flot interested in most of the
private legisiation; but the faet is that they
do have to give some attention to it and
are constantly being importuned to support
or oppose sorne of these bis. I think that
if al] private bills originated in the Senate
and the in'terested members of the Commons
appeared before our committees, the measures
would be so thoroughly deait with that the
other House would need to spend very little
time on them.
I ar nfot going to attempt to add any
general remarks to those 1 made yesterday
on the subject-matter of this resolution. The
vvhole question has been considered and presented to the Huse more fully than at any
other time since I bave been a member. lJntil
thé matter is definitely settled one way or

the other it will, no doubt, be a subject of
discussion., I desire to say that I shahl carry
out what I feel is my duty as leader of
the House, in association with the honourable
gentleman to my right (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
who is a mernber of the Cabinet, to bring
to the attention of the leader of the Government and others in authority the representations that have been made here. My honourable friend to my right will deal with
the matter hirnself. 1 cannot state what the
result will be, but at any rate we shahl carry
out the implied mandate of this House in that
respect.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend if he will go the logical
step further and accept the suggestion which I
humbly made to him, to test the matter out
by requesting the Hon. Mr. Cahan to corne
ta this House and explain the Copyright
Bill?
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Replying to
My honourable friend frorn Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt), 1 think it would be unhecoming
for the Senate to invite a Cabinet minister
from another place to appear here and address
thîs House unless we had first consulted with
the particular minister and the Government
itself in the matter.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is exactly
what I arn suggesting.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The, suggestion
made by rny honourable friend hast night, I
thought, was rather to this effect: "Let us
invite thern, and if they do not want to corne
that is their misfortune and ours."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, I did not say
that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I hardly think
we should adopt that method of approach.
Perhaps in the remarks that 1 made hast night
1 intirnated that I should not be averse to
such procedure, but I feel that wliatever is
done should be the result, not of the separate
action of either House, but of co-operation by
the two bouses after inquiry has been made
of the Governrnent and the minister concerned, as to whether an invitation would be
acceptable.
I[f I may go a step further, I wouhd say thîs.
I take it that this bouse consents to, the
question being brought to the attention of
the Prime Minister and bis colleagues. If
that is so, I shaîl be glad to bring it to their
attention, and perhaps at an earhy date I shail
be able to give the Senate -an idea as to, how
the (lovernment views the proposai 'that for

order to expe.dite the business of Parliarnent,
the mernbers of this House sbouid be given
an opportunity to ask questions, and receive
answers thereto, concerning legisiative or
administrative matters coming within the
jurisdiction of any Minister. I think, however, that before wve actually play our card,
and rather tha;n have somebody trump it, we
ought to kniow bow the Ministers would regard such a move. If it is agreeable te the
bouse I shall be glad to bring to the attention of the Prime Minister the discussion that
has taken place, and to give him my conception of the vicws and desires of the honourable momber who introduced this motion.
I think that the more or 'less academie discussions of departrnentai matt-ers and the
cross-firing of question and answer that sometimcs oceurs in another place rnight not; be
dosirable or wise bore. I feel confident howevor, that if a Cabinet Minister in the other
House received a courteous request to come
to the Sonate and give it information, be
would accede to it. I speak perbaps without
knowiedgc. In view of the statement of my
right bonourablo
friend
from
Eganville
(Right bon. Mr. Graharn) that he might object if be were in the Governrnent, I may be
pardoned for saying that maybe it is not unfortunato, that ho is not a momber of the
Governrnent at the prescnt time. I wvilI sec
that the ruatter is broughit te the attention
of the Govcrnrncnt.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 would draw
my honourable friend's attention to the notice
of motion I gave in 1922. which had in view
the safeguarding of the Minister's freedom
of action. It rcad:

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourab-le members, I arn out of order, as everybody is, or luas been, but since my bonourable

which we should be looked upon as a coefficient with the other House in matters of
legislation as well as in responsibility. Just how
that is to be accomplished is the question. I
think the suggestion made by the honourable
gentleman froma De Salaberry (Bon. Mr.
Béique) is not a bad one. But we must not
rush into it. It is somethîng to be considered.
We do flot know just what the response might
be. If we were to ask a Minister to come here,
and he were Vo refuse, the fat wouldl be in the
fire. Government policy as well as ministerial
responsibility would be largely involved. The
members of the Government would probably
come if such action were in accordance with
Government policy.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Unless the
Prime Minister told them they had to corne.
Then probably th-ey would corne. I neyer
operated under a Prime Minister who talked
to me in that way. I usually talked first.
However, it strikes me that this discussion
has reached a point where we need to do some
thinking, rather than take any precipitate
action; and, as the Minister of Labour (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) and the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) say, it is better
first to approach the Government to sce how
such a proposai would be received. One suggestion might get a good reception; another
one might not.
I have no right to make any sug.gestion to
the honourable gentleman from Rougemont
<Hon. Mr. Lemieux), but yesterday he said
that h-e did not intend to press bis resolution
to a vote-that he only wished it to have full
consideration. I think bis attitude in that
respect was the right one. If this resolution
were voted down, the door might be for
ever shut against negotiation; if it were to
carry, the Government might reasonably say
we had not f ollowed the proper procedure in
passing such a resolution, and tihat we should
have negotiated with it first. While the
method suggested in 'the resolution is not,
I think, the proper one, nevertheless good
wili corne of this discussion if we only get as
far as bringing Vo the attention of the Government what has been so clearly established
here, namely, tihat we are desirous of dloser
co-operation between the two Houses of
ParElament. Such being the case, if the
resolution were withdrawn, the Minister of
Labour could discuss the matter with his
colleagues; and in their own good time-f or
governments cannot be rushed-we should
receive an answer. Then, I think, everything

7

would have been accomplished that can be
accomplished through the rnedium of discussion, and conference might follow.
Hon. R. LEMIEUX: Honourable members.
I wish first of ail to thank the Senate for the
attention that it has given to this resolution.
I did flot expect it to carry the day the first
time it was presented. I desired only to
propose some remedy for the existing situation.
Let us make no mistake about it, the people
to-day are not -as favourably disposed towards
the Senate as they should be, because, rightly
or wrongly, it is represented throughout the
country that the Senate is inactive, and wilfully so; which is not the truth. I have
pointed out that the fault lies elsewhere, and
have very modest-ly presented certain suggestions to remedy the situation. I have
suggested the presence of a larger ministerial
representation in this House; 1 have suggested
the presence of under-secretaries here; and,
flnally, I have suggested free consultation
between the two branches of Parliament
through members of the Cabinet comaing from
the Commons to the Senate to expl-ain Government policies and legisiation.
My right honourable friend from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) said a moment ago
that we seemed to muddle more and more as
we discussed this question. That is in accordance with British tradition. In the old days
in England the power of government was
centered in the Star Chamber; then the centre
shifted to the flouse of Lords, and later to
the Bouse of Commons, so that to-day we
may say that the Bouse of Gommons in
England rules the country and Vhat the Prime
Minister of England has more power than Bis
Majesty the King. The British, as usual, have
muddled through, but finally each branch of
the Government bas obtained its share of
work and influence.
We must not imagine insurmountable
obstacles where they really do flot exist. A
conference, as suggested by the honourable
senator frorn De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique),
is quite feasible. The Government would
listen to a proposai from this honourable
Chamber to facilitate and expedite the business of Parliament. My honourable friend
from La Salle (Bon. Mr. Bureau) does flot
find that what has been proposed- would
expedite business. WelI, we have to mark time
for almost a month at the beginning of the
session while the members of the Bouse of
Commons discuss the Address, and we are
again obliged to mark time for probably a
month while they discuss the Budget; so I
say that it is worth while to consider any plan
whereby the Senate xnight save several weeks

SENATE
by taking up in this House legislation that
now has to be left in abeyance in the other
Chamber because the Government is represented here by only one member, or because
it will not consent to legislation being
initiated, promotcd and passed in this House.
I claim that when this House had studied the
Igislation and passed it through the mill the
House of Commons would be responsive to the
arguments that had been adduced in favour
of it.
I said yesterday, honourable members, that
I did not intend to press my motion. I did
not want to approach the Government with
a club in my hand and ask it to say yes or
no. Therefore I prefaced my resolution with
% pions

wish.

My

right honourable

friend

from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham),
who is an old-tine Liberal, a Reformer, says
that if you wish to reform you must begin
at the- beginning. I say that if you are content to leave matters as they are to-day you
will not carry with you the sentiment of the
countrv.
The right honourable gentleman
knows that in bis own province, which in the
ald days was the nursery of constitutional and
responsible government in Canada, there is
to-day a large body of public opinion opposed
to the Sonate. The right honourable gentleman is a journalist, one of the best and most
enlightcned, and be can tell me whether or
not I an right in saying that the press
of his province generally is opposed to this
Chamber. I refer him to the organ of the
late George Brown, the Toronto Globe. The
Toronto Globe at times expresses sorrow that
the Senate is only marking time, and wants
to reform it. I appeal to mv right honourable
friend as an old Reformer to follow the
example given by the two members who so
ably represent the Government in this
Chamber. I was agreeably surprised to find
that the honourable the Minister of Labour
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the honourable
leader of the Gov-ernment in this Chamber
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) heartily supported
the principle of my motion; and I was more
than happy-I was proud-when it was supported also by the venerable mcmber, the
junior senator from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster), with his long experience
in parliamentary life. But the rigbt honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Lon.
Mr. Graham) is right: I said last night that
I would not press this motion to a vote. I
intend to keep my word. I regret to learn,
however, that one of my old leaders is satisfied with the present condition.
I want the Sonate tio be restored to its
original place in the public opinion of this
country. I want the Senate to occupy that
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

position which it held for many years after
My honourable friend from
Confederation.
Westmoreland (Hon. Mr. Bl'ack) bas shown
how highly the first five or six Governments
of the Dominion regarded this Chamber.
Though, as I said a moment ago, I shall not
press the resolution to a vote, I believe that
public opinion is now in favour of the change
hat I have suggested. The wind of democracy is whistl'ing about the walls of Parliament,
and the Sonate must so act as to make unnrcessary any drastic move by the people.
I have the greatest respect for and confidence
in this honourable body. I am perfectly satisfied with the promise given by the honourable
the leader of this House and bis colleague,
the Minister of Labour, that they will convey
to the Government the representations that
bave been made in the course of this debate.
My honourable friend from La Salle (Hon.
Mr. Bureau) said a few moments ago that
the Sonate is a revising body. Anyone who
reads the British North America Act-as I
did last night, in company with my honourable friend from La Salle-will see that our
powers are equal to those of the House of
Commons, except with respect to subsidies
and aids, which may be initiated only in the
other House. The general legislation of this
country may originate in either House. If I
mnay say so, I think that the absence of
Cabinet ministers from this Chamber indicates a lack of appreciation of the Senate.
We are becoming, in the eyes of the country,
merely a rubber stamp. Well, I for one object
to being considered a rubber stamp. I take
my tasks as a senator seriously.
When I
observe in countries like Germany and France
a system that permits ministers to pass from
one House to the other and give explanations on government measures in either House,
I do not sec why we cannot have something
along the same line in Canada.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The ministers
in France are not members of either House,
are they?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
An Hon. SENATOR:

Not necessarily.
They are elected.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
The members of
the Assemblée Législative are elected by the
people, but the members of the Sonate are
elected by the second degree rule of the Conseils Généraux for a period of nine years.
Sometimes it happons there, as in the United
States, that Cabinet ministers are not members of one House or the other, but they can
appear before both.
I thank honourable members for their kind
attention and for the able expressions of

MAY 27,,1931
approval and criticism that have been given
on my resolution in the course of the debate.
1 desire especially to thank the Government,
through the leader of this House and the Minister of Labour, for having so willingly
accepted the principle of the resolution.

louder,

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is a practice that is deprecated by most
speakers, but, nevertheless, seems to persist
in our transaction of business. I notice that
in another place the present Prime Minister
has firmly taken the stand that the business
should be carried on in accordance with the
rules of the House. The leaders on both sides
of this Chamber have again and again subscribed to the same principle in relation to
the Senate, but one is allowing the principle
to be contravened, and the other is raising
no audible protest.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

But

I

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
A number of bills have been before the
Banking and Commerce Committee-a very
careful and experienced body: it has dealt
with them all, and the Chairman has brought
in reports upon them. Naturally, when he
has presented a report to this Chamber he
wishes to get the business off his hands as
quickly as possible, in order to be ready
for new business when it comes. That is very
praiseworthy. But a large proportion of the
members of the Senate are not members of
the Committee and consequently are not
familiar with the action that has been
taken. The rules of the House provide
for orderly stages of procedure so that anyone who is attending to his business may
know what is being done, and cannot complain that legislation has been passed without his having had an opportunity to comprehend it. When my honourable friend brings
in the reports of his Committee, item after
item is read before the Chamber. In one
Committee
recommends the
report
the
passage of a Bill without amendment. That
Bill has already been discussed in the House
and we are quite conversant with its provisions; so there cannot be much objection
to its immediate passage, though it might be
preferable to proceed by regular stages in
every case. As we meet here from day to
day, there is no reason why even a bill that
the Committee has not amended should not
be allowed to stand until the next sitting of
the House. There is practically nothing to
be gained in time or efficiency by our putting
it through immediately. But the situation is
worse when a bill comes from the Committee
Riglit

with an amendment. I defy any member of
this House who bas not been in the Committee, and consequently does not know what
has been done there, to understand just from
the reading of the report the effect of that
amendment. We must have some respect for
the wisdom of age, and equally for the infirmity of age. One whose hearing is not
very acute does not always get the sense of
what is read, and when there is an evident
desire on the part of the Chairman of the
Committee to get the measure through, one
very much dislikes to intervene, and so remains in bis seat and lets it pass. Would it
not bu better to proceed by regular stages
and thus relieve us all of the onus of having
to object?
I may say to honourable members that my
hearing bas considerably improved within the
last six days, for I took occasion to say
to His Honour the Speaker: "You have a
good voice, which has been beard on many
a platform in the Province of Quebec and
is capable of reaching the outermost ring of
a large outdoor audience.
What is the
reason that you cannot reach the limits of
this Chamber, or speak so that I «an hear
you?" Since then I have heard every word
His Honour the Speaker has said-with the
possible exception of the prayers, which I
am able to follow without hearing all the
words. I have noticed also that my hearing
of the Assistant Clerk of the House has improved. When bu stands up and reads I hear
every word. I suspect that he bas been
prompted by the leader of the House to
raise his voice somewhat. I thank both hirn
and the Speaker very much for my improved
hearing.
I make these remarks just because I deem
it my duty-I may bu censured for performing it-to ask that in future, unless there is
a case of prime emergency, the regular stages
bu followed so that it will bu possible for an
aged and inefficient member like myself to
understand exactly what is going on.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I would not
venture to say that.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable members, I am in accord with ail that the right
honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Sir Geo.
F. Foster) bas said as to the desirability of
observing our rules of procedure. Last week
the honourable leader of the Senate and I
suggested that the rules should bu more closely
followed. As the right honourable gentleman
seems to thinik that in this instance I share
in the responsibility for allowing the motions
of the Chairman of the Banking and Commerce Committee to bu immediately adopted,

were adopted at the suggestion of the Superintendent, of Insurance, although he was flot
quite sure that they were absolutely necessary.
In the regular course of procedure the third
rcadings of these buis would have been deferred until tomrorrow. I should have been
inclined to suggest that pastponernent but
for the fact that I a.m flot quite certain when
we shall have a Supply Bill, Royal Assent,

rea.gon. that actuated the Chairman of the
Banking and Commerce Committee in proceeding as he did.

Right Bon. GFO. P. GRAHIAM: Honourable members, there is another angle to
what my right h-onourable friend has said
about rules of order. If we were sitting constantly we could adhere strictly to the rules
of the Bouse, but sometimes applicants for
legisiation are not sure, after their bis are
reported, when they will be rend the third
time if the regular procedure is followed, and
they urge that the third reading be given
immnediately so that they may not have ta
run the risk of being delayed by an adjournment. The solicitor for a big company that
has some bis ta corne before the Railway
Committee came to me to-day and explained that under ordinary cîrcumstances
his clients preferred that the Railway Committee .should not deal with their bills until
next week; "ibut," he said, "you may not be
here next week, and if there ia to be an
ad.Iournment they may change their rninds."
I think the reason why chairmen of committees are sametimes urged to mave the
third reading as soon as possible is the fear
that the legislation may be delayed by an
adjournment of the Senate.
Right Bon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER: In
that case the situation could be explained,
and no reasonable man would objeet.

Hon. G. D. ROBERTISON: Bonourable
members, while this Order is on the Order
Paper, 1 have just discovered that the Bill

whether other honourable gentlemen are in
the saine predicament. I-f the Bouse agrees,
I can give a synopsis of what the Bill contains. There is only one slight arnendment ta
the law as it exists. If honourable members
prefer to have the second readinýg postponed,
I have nio objection to letting the Bill stand
until copies are dist.ributed.
H-on. Mr. LOGAN: Go on.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
When the Bill does corne up, I shall have a
question or two to ask in regard ta the heavy

The honourable Minister will kindly inquire

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: We cannot hear.
Hon. Mr. ROlBERTSON: There is no, need
ta delay on that score. Since January last
there has not been a dollar spent for advertising in connection wîth anniuities.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But I did not limit my rernarks ta January

$1 '200. The roason for the change is this.
Only a few of the annuities puichased amount
to more than $1,200 per year, or $100 per
month. The average of the aunuities purchascd during the p.ast ycar, for exampleand there w1ere roughIv 1.700 of themamnounted to about $444. Occasionally,' howevor, some person wilI como along and Iay

alluring prospects held out in advertising, the
poorer classes were induced to put their
money. We have seen evidences of them
lately in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, and
elsewhere. When we have a solid institution
like our system of annuities we should do our
best to maintain it and propagate it. When
this legislation was being promoted I was a
member of the Government; and I well remember hearing Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Sir
Richard Cartwright telling the people that
it was for the purpose of meeting a demand.
The people wanted to place their savings
with the Government, because they knew
that the money would be safe iii their hands.
I shall await the further explanation to be
given by the Minister.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I wonder whether the
Minister could say off-hand what amount of
money is required to purchase a $5,000
annuity?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: While I may be
prone to get out of order, I understand
that we should not discuss details on the
motion for the second reading. I shall be
happy to provide all the information that
has been asked for when we go into Committee on the Bill. I could answer most of the
questions from memory now, if that were
desired; but I feel that this is not the time
to do it.
I may say that my right honourable friend
from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) is somewhat mistaken as to the cost
of the advertising. For the last couple of
years it has run to about $12,000 or $15,000
a year.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER:

How much?

From $12,000
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
to $15,000 a year. My right honourable
friend referred to an amount of S57,000 that
he saw mentioned in answer to a question
asked elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: The amount mentioned by the Minister scems very moderate.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It may be proper to explain that apparently it has been
the custom of more than one department
during recent years to pay the advertising
accounts net out of the current year's appropriation, but out of that of the following
year. That has happened in this particular

to say -that the cost of advertising for 1930
was roughly $14,000, net $57,000.
I think honourable members will agree that
it is desirable that the annuities fund should
be self-supporting.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hear, hear.
Hion. Mr. ROBERTSON: That has not been
the case for several years, and obviously there
must have been some reason for it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is likely to
become worse in the course of years.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. Perhaps my
honourable friend will give me an opportunity to 'state the facts. From the year
1928 onward the annuities increased very substantially in number and in size, and as a
result of the policy followed numerous annuity
salesmen were authlorized to operate on a
commission basis. The larger the annuity
they sold, the larger the commission they
collected. Then it became apparent that the
business was not self-supporting, and the
officials of the Department, after investigation-and I can assure you that I also
gave the question some careful thoughteame to the conclusion, of which the Government has approved, that from several
standpoints it is net advisable to continue to
send out agents to solicit the purchase of
annuities by people who have $50,000 or more
available for the purchase of insurance. If
those people want to spend so much money
on insurance there are plenty of companies
operating for a profit to whom they may
go. It is not intended that the Government
sliould continue this method of oanvassing.
lon. Mr. LEMIEUX: The rate to the
annuitant is much lower than the. rate of the
ordinary insurance company.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Slightly lower.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Materially so.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No; slightly so.
When you take into consideration the cost
of soliciting business you find that the business is net self-sustaining.
What I was
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
saying was, net that it is self-sustaining, but
that the cost to the annuitant is much less
than it would have been had he applied to a

MAY 2S, 1931
leads me to believe that we should put the
benefits at the disposai of those classes that
can least affard to pay for an annuity.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend is right sa far as the cost to the
individuai, annuitant is concerned.
May I say one word with reference to
advertising? Receutly there has been adopted
in a smali way a method of advertising that
has brought real resuits. I refer to radio
talks in various parts of the country, bringing to the attention of the public the benefits
of the Annuities Act. People will listen ta
a radio talk on annuities when, perhaps, they
will flot rend advertisements occupying a
couple of inches in the newspapers. In this
respect the advertising has, in my judgment,
been profitable-profitable ta the annuitant.
But 1 question the advisability of continuing
to solicit subscriptions where the annual
return from the annuity is more thian $1,200
a year. That method is open to abuses and
seems to be undesirable. Commission payments necessarîly are high, and they have ta
be made out of the amaunt required for the
-purpose of making the scheme self-sustaining.
Those are the reasons why the Bill is introduced. I shaîl be glad to furnish details tu
the House when the Bill is taken up in Committee.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Did I uuderstaud the
honourable gentleman ta say that there was
na sucli advertising cantract as was mentioned by the right honourable member ta his
right (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is quite in
error.
Hon. M.r. MURPHY: There is na contract?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There was a contract which. rau, flot for a set period, 'but fram
month to month, and the cost of which
amounted ta about $12,000 or $14,000 a year
as long as it continued. That contract was
abrogated last January.
Hon. Mr. BEÇLCOURT: Would my hionourable. friend add ta the information that
1 have already requested the rate of commissions paid for aninuities?
Hoa. H. W. LAIRD. Speaking with ail due
deferenoe ta the Minister, 1 do not thiuk hie
lias givefi suflicient ressous for the pa.nsing af
this legisiation. The principle of annuities is
either riglit or wroug. If it is riglit, I can see
no good reason why it should be limited in

its application ta the man who wants $1,200,
and should nat be extended ta ane who wants
$1,500 or $2,500. On the other hand, if the
prinriple is wrang, theTe is no reason why the
Governrant should engage in the business
ut ail. Fuirthermore, if the principle is right,
and the Goverument do eugage in the business, it is within the-ir own power ta put it on
such a basis that it will not cause a loss ta
the country. We ahl know that in the matter
of aninuities, as well as in the matter of insurance in general, the charges are fixed an the
basis of figures determined and furnished by
competent actuaries. We know further that
when actuaries furnish figures of that nature
they iraclude iu them a charge for the administraticrn of the business. This beiug sa, there
i.s no reason why the Governrnenit should lose
money on the business, if it is right in principle
and they are bound ta con.tiuue in it. The
Goveruiment have it in their own hands ta
remove any possibility of loss; for instance,
by increasing the rates so that they will caver
the cost of admiuistratiou.
As for advertising, I do flot see haw th-at
enters into the question at ail. In any case

the

be iràcluded in the cost

of administration. In the second place, I do
flot thin-k that what has been said an that
subject is a good reason. ta advauce in faveur

the greaterT the volume of business done by
the Gaverument, the lower the overhead ta
be charged against the country. Perhaps the
Insurance Department oau fu.rnish samne
rea.son why this legisiation should be passed.
As yet I do nlot think the Huse has that information. Reserving the right ta discuss the
principle of the Bill, I have na objection ta
its passing the present stage; but I thixik the

the data necessary ta caver the points raised.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BLACK moved the second reading of Bill 28, an Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act (Priority of Claims).
He said: Honourable senators, I shall give

suggest tiat it be referred to one of our cominittees, where it may be examined in more
detail.
The amendment to the Bankruptcy
Act is requested by the commercial travellers'
associations of Canada, of which I am told
there are five, comprising a membership of
40,000 or more. Briefly stated, the object of
the Bill is to give protection to that class of
commercial travellers who sell on commission.
The need for tie amendm ent may be illustrated by a hypothetical case.
Suppose a
traveller goes out from a wholesale house in
May and takes orders for goods to be delivered
in November. The terms of payment may be
thirty, sixty or ninety days. Now, before the
goods are delivered, the firm for which he is
working on commission may go into bankruptcy, and as the Act stands at present, lie
would find himself out of court if
e endeavoured te enforce payment for his serviocs. The purpose of the amendment is to
give more protection to commercial travellers
who sell goods in cicumstances of that kind.
I am not sure to which committee this Bill
should be referred.

amendment is ndt strictly correct, from a
grammatical point of view, and I suggest the
substitution of the words "may have been"
for the words "may be" in the second line of
subsection 2.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before we considqýr that, will my honourable friend explain
whât the Bill means? The proposed new
subsection reads:
(2) If any judge of a Superior Court of
Canada or of any province of Canada is or
mnay he, since the first day of January, 1931,
appointed Chief Commnissioner or Assistant
('hief Comrinissioner of the Board of Railway
Commissioners for Canada, and cesses to bold
such office, lis Majesty may, by letters patent
under the Great Seal of Canada, grant to him
an annuity equal to that, if any, which, he
woiuld have received if he had continued in
office as such judge, and had vacated the said
office of judge on the date upon which he

ceised to hold the said office of Chief Commaissioner or Assistant Chief Comniissioner.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is ail it
means. I do not know that I can clarify it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As I understand the amendment, it provides that the
number of years that the Chief Commisioner
or Assistant Chief Commissioner serves on
the Railway Board would count, for pension
purposes. under the Judges Act, as if hie had
continued to serve as a judge; and that,
further, bie would be eligible for a pension

only if hie had been on the benclh and on the
Railway Board at least fifteen years in ail,
unless hie had been retired on account of iii
bealth.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

scrv'ed on the Railway Commission hie wouid

remained on the bench, with every advantageHon. Mr. BELCOURT: And the disadvantages as welI.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Everything.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is my honourable friend suggesting a change in the wording of the amendment?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I amn suggesting the substitution of "may have been" for
"may be."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why "may have
been"? I do net see why the word "may"
is necessary. 1 suggest the words "or has
been."
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 amn just passing on the suggestion that came from the
Law Clerk's Office.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
The wording
would be sensible if the words "or has been"
were substituted. I do not think "may have
been" covers the case at all.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: How could there
bc any doubt as to whether a man may or
may not bave been appointed? It seems to
me that my bonourable friend from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) is right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If a man has flot
been appointed, thien hie does not corne under
the Act. Therefore, 1 repeat, we should
use the words "or has been,."
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not, see
any objection to that. As I say, the change
that I suggested was recommended by the
Law Clerk's Office. I concur in the suggestion
of the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt).
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: What happens if a
judge is appointed as an ordinary commissioner, but not to the office of Chief Commissioner or Assistant Chief Commissioner?
Would this amendment apply to a case of
that kind?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think it applies oniy when a judge goes froma the bench
to the Commission.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: This Bill refers only
to the Chief Commissioner and the Assistant
Chief Commissioner. Why does it not apply
to an ordinary commissioner?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: A judge would not
take a commissioner's position.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do the Ohief
and Assistant Chief Commissioners receive a
salary equal to that of a judge of the Supreme
Court?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, I think it
is the same; S10,000, if I remember correctly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So the only object of this BiH is to give an ex-jud.ge who
becomes Chief Commissioner or Assistant
Chief Commissioner of the Railway Board
the same pension benefits that he would have
Lad if ýhe had continued on the bench?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes.
Section 1, as a'mended, was agreed to.
The title and the preanble were agreed to.

Section 5, line 13: Insert after the word
"accordance" the words "with the provisions of
this Act and/or," and in the same line insert
the word "/or" after the word "and."
I do not know exactly what tha.t means.
It is suggested that two new sections, to
be numbered 5 and 6, be added, and that the
present sections 5 and 6 should be numbered
7 and 8, respectively. The proposed new
sections read:
5. Tickets for a sweepstakes authorized to
be conducted in accordance with the provisions
of this Act chall not be sold in Canada by or
througli the mails except for delivery within
the province wherein sucL sweepstakes bas been
so authorized.
TLa.t is quite consistent with the proposed
new section 4.
6. Notliing in this Act shall prevent the sale
outside of Canada by the Connittee or its
agents authorized in writing so to do, of tickets
for sweepstakes as authorized t hob conducted
in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, June 9,

PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES
GENERAL

ACT

OF 1928--RESOLUTION
APPROVAL

OF

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the following resolution:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the accession, in respect of Canada,
to Chapters I, II, III, and IV of the General
Act of 1928 for the Pacifie Settlement of International Disputes, subject to the following conditions:I. That the following disputes are excluded
from the procedure described in the General
Act, including the procedure of conciliation:(i) Disputes arising prior to the accession,
in respect of Canada, to the said General Act
or relating to situations or facts prior to the
said accession;
(ii) Disputes in regard to which the parties
to the dispute have agreed or shall agree to
have recourse to some other method of peaceful
settlement;
(iii) Disputes between His Majesty's Government in Canada and the Government of any
other Member of the League of Nations which
is a member of the British Commonwealth of
Nations, all of which disputes shall be settled
in such manner as the parties have agreed or
shall agree;
(iv) Disputes concerning questions which by
international law are solely within the
domestic jurisdiction of States; and
(v) Disputes with any party to the General
Act who is not a Member of the League of
Nations.
2. That His Majesty in respect of Canada
reserves the right in relation to the disputes
mentioned in Article 17 of the General Act to
require that the procedure described in Chapter
Il of the said Act shall be suspended in respect
of any dispute which has been submitted to and
is under consideration by the Council of the
League of Nations, provided that notice to suspend is given after the dispute has been submitted to the Council and is given within ten
days of the notification of the initiation of the
procedure, and provided also that such suspension shall be limited to a period of twelve
months or such longer period as may be agreed
by the parties to the dispute or determined by
a decision of all the members of the Council
other than the parties to the dispute.
3. (i) That, in the case of a dispute, not
being a dispute mentioned in Article 17 of the
General Act, which is brought before the Council of the League of Nations in accordance with
the provisions of the Covenant, the procedure
described in Chapter I of the General Act

185

shall not be applied, and, if already commenced,
shall be suspended, unless the Council determines that the said procedure shall be adopted.
(ii) That in the case of such a dispute the
procedure described in Chapter III of the General Act shall not be applied unless the Council
has failed to effect a settlement of the dispute
within twelve months from the date on which
it was first submitted to the Council, or, in a
case where the procedure prescribed in Chapter
I has been adopted without producing an agreement between the parties, within six months
from the termination of the work of the Conciliation Commission. The Council may extend
either of the above periods by a decision of all
its members other than the parties to the dispute.
and that this House do approve of the same,
subject to the same conditions.
He said: The reservations made are the
same as those made by Great Britain in connection with the ratification of the General
Act. The term "General Act" is perhaps a
little misleading and may not be fully understood. The General Act of 1928 for the Pacifie
Settlement of International Disputes is rea-lly
a consolidation of some four agreements made
from time to time touching this subject.
This Act consists of four chapters, the first
dealing with conciliation, the second with
judicial settlement, the third with arbitration,
and the fourth containing general provisions,
with which most honourable members are
doubtless familiar.
Chapter I of the General Act refers to conciliation proceedings that have in a number
of cases been agreed upon by certain nations.
It is not the purpose of the General Act to
supersede, or interfere with the operation
of, those efforts towards conciliation. Under
Chapter II certain disputes that may not be
capable of adjustment by conciliation may
be referred for adjustment by judicia. settlement; and if that should fail there is provision under Chapter TII for arbitration.
Chapter I, containing Articles 1 to 16, inclusive, provides for the reference of disputes to either a temporary or a permanent
conciliation commission composed of five
men, two to be chosen from the two disputant
powers, one representative from each, and
.the other three members from other powers,
of different nationalities. The commissioners
are to be appointed for three years and to be
eligibIe for re-appointment. The commission
is to choose its own president from among
its members.
Chapter II, concerning judicial settlements,
contains Articles 17 to 20, inclusive, and provides that disputes between parties as to their
respective rights shall be submitted for decision to the Permanent Court of International
Justice unless the parties agree to arbitrate,

186

in which case they shall draw up a special
agreement wherein are set out the subject
of the dispute, the names of the arbitrators
selected, and the procedure to be followed.
The provisions of the Hague Convention of
October 18, 1907, for the Pacifie Settlement
of International Disputes are to apply in the
absence of sufficient particulars from the agreement.

Then came the War and the lessons it
brought, and subsequently the setting up of
the Covenant of the League of Nations.
N-ations which subscribed to that Covenant
undertook, under Article 12, that if any dispute arose which was likely to lead to a
rupture, they would submit it either to
arbitration or to inquiry by the Council,
and further that they would in any case not
resort to war until three months after a

JUNE 9, 1931
and after approval by the appropriate authorities, acceptance of the Clause was ratified
on the 28th July, 1930.
Simultaneously there was developing a
movement -for more comprehensive means of
settling international disputes. A committee
of the League of Nations drafted in 1928 a
comprehensive multilateral treaty known as
the General Art, which is now before us. This
Act, as I have already mentioned, covers the
three methods of conciliation, judicial determination and arbitration. Recourse may
first be had to conciliation, either in justiciable
or non-justiciable disputes, by either a temporary or a permanent commission of five
men. The second part of the Act deals with
judicial settlements. It provides for the submission of disputes to the Permanent Court
of International Justice. This section covers
much the saine ground as the Optional
Clause, the chief difference being that under
this section a preliminary resort to conciliation is provided in case both parties so desire. The third section deals with nonjusticiable disputes. If the conciliation commission provided for in the first section does
not effect a settlement, such disputes are to
be brought before an arbitral tribunal of
five members.
At the Imperial Conference of 1930 the
British Government indicated its desire to
accede to the General Act with certain somewhat extensive reservations. The Governments of Canada. Australia and New Zealand
intimated that they favoured acceptance on
substantially the same terms, and that they
proposed to recommend such action to their
respective Parliaments. The Irish Free State
expressed its intention to accept with fewer
reservations, while the South African Government was not at that time prepared to arrive
at a ; final decision without further study.
The Parliament of the United Kingdom has
recently approved accession by its Gove'rnment, and a similar resolution bas since been
adopted by the Parliament of Australia. The
British Government proposes to deposit its
instrument of accession at the meeting of the
Council of the League of Nations to be beld
this month.

do not become binding until the second step,
ratification, bas been taken, following such

187

approval by the proper constitutional authoritaes as the law or practice in each country
provides. In the present case acceptance is
indicated by a single action, namely, accession. The document before us was not drawn
up by plenipotentiaries of different countries,
but was drafted by a committee of the League
of Nations. Article 43 provides that the
General Aot shall be open to accession by all
the heads of states or other competent authorities of the members of the League of Nations,
and of non-member states to which the Council
lias communicated a copy. The General Act
remains binding upon all countries which accede to it for five years from the date of its
coming into force, namely, 1929, and for fiveyear periods thereafter unless deaunciation is
effected before the expiration of each current
period.
The resolution, of which notice bas been
given, declares that .t is expedient that Parliament do approve of the accession in respect
of Canada to the four chapters of the General
Act, subject to certain conditions. These conditions are the same as those which have been
adopted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parlioment of Australia. They
are substantially similar to the reservations
agreed to by this House in connection with
the Optional Clause. They provide for excluding from the scope of the Act disputes
prior to accession or relating to facts prior to
accession, disputes in regard to which the
parties have agreed to some other method of
settlement, disputes between the members of
the British Commonwealth of Nations, disputes concerning domestic questions, and disputes with any party to the General Act who
is not a member of the League of Nations.
Probably the only question that might arise
is one regarding this last reservation as it
applies to our friendly relations with the
United States. So far as Canada is concerned, however, aside from the unlikelihood,
for a time at least, of the United States
becoming a party to the General Act, it must
be remembered that we have under Article 10
of the Boundary Waters Treaty a provision
whereby any dispute whatever between the
United States and Canada, and not merely
one regarding boundary waters, may be referred for decision to the International Joint
Commission by the consent of the two parties.
Further conditions provide that, if so desired, the conciliation machinery of the Council
may be utilized before recourse is had to the
machinery of conciliation or arbitration set
-up under the General Act. It is felt that the
Council, with wide experience in international matters, may very well succeed in

188

SENATE

effecting a settlement, and if it doos not do
so within twelve months' time or such extension as may be agreed upon, the machinery
of the General Act will come into play.
It would appear to me unnecessary to attempt to dilate more fully on this subject,
although there are some further particulars
available. Therefore I will say nothing more
at the moment, as most honourable members
may wish to speak upon it, especially my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who has ha-d a good deal to do with
the events that led up to the passing of this
Act, or have occurred since. My right honourable friend the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir Geo. E. Foster), as we all
know, is an expert in international affairs.
Hon. R.
DANDURAND:
Honourable
members of the Senate, I am sure that I voice
the sentiment of every meiber of this Chanber when I declare that the Government's
action in seeking approval of the General Act
is most welcome to us all.
We have often heard, perhaps even in this
Chamber, tat the League of Nations did not
seem to make any considerable headway in
finding means of reassurinag public opinion by
establishing peace on a permanent basis. We
have heard that the Geneva conferences
seemed to accomplish very little, and to be
merely marking time. I would point out to
honourable members of the Senate that the
institution as at present organized under the
Treaty of Versailles is an absolutely new
venture in international affairs; that the
delegates of fifty nations assemble to discuss
from every angle the questions submitted to
thern, and that if progress is slow it is not a
matter of surprise when it is remembered that
the rule of unanimity prevails. Against the
advances that are suggcsted from year to year
stand the old traditions, based on the principle of the sovere'ignty of each nation, and
anything that seemas to encroach on that
sovereignty is naturally resented in some
quarters.
The Covenant, which forms the first chapter
of the Treaty of Versailles, did not outlaw
war. The public mind in most nations was
net ready to accept the principle that war
should be abolished, and consequently there
are in the Covenant gaps through which war
may pass.
The principle of compulsory
arbitration was net enacted, because it went
counter to the principle of sovereignty. Yet
what strides have we not already made
towards the attainment of the ideal that international disputes should be settled by pacifie
means!
It is needless to say that since 1920 the
small nations-the secondary powers, as they
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

are called-have been unanimously in favour
of compulsory arlbitration. It stands te reason
that, not having might on their side, they desired justice. Hence they have been clamouring, though in vain, for the great powers to
corne diown to a footing of equality witJh them
at arbitral tribunals.
In 1924 we had for the first time a splendid
lead from the great powers, Great Britain and
France. Their governments of that day represented perhaps more closely thian the preceding
governments the popular will. For the first
tirme a Labour Government w'as in office in
London and a Socialist Government in France,
under Mr. Herriot. So we bad the happy
circurnstance of those two radical leaders of
their respective countries joining hands and
affirming the principle of compulsory arbitration. They would leave nothing behind. They
wanted peace, and they wanted it based on
compulsory arbitration. Amendments to the
Covenant were made in order to fill ,those
gaps which permitted the possibility of war.
Those amendnents were called the protocol
of 1924, and involved the acceptance of cornpulsory arbitration in justiciable disputes as
well as in political affairs.
But within a month the MacDonald Government met with a reverse and a Tory
Government came in. Sir Austen Chamberlain, representing the Baldwin Government,
took a very decided stand against the protocol; net merely against its form, but against
the underlying principle, and not only in
political matters, but also as applied to
justiciable questions.
Owing to Sir Austen
Chamberlain's opposition the principle of
compulsory arbitration went by the board.
I need net say that this stand of the
British Goverrnent virtually paralyzed the
action of the League for five long years.
Sir Austen Chamberlain proposed regional
agreements, so that instead of being bound by
the general obligation of arbitrament in all
cases he might know with whom he was entering into an agreement. There was an impression that he wanted a free hand in
certain regions, which were not disclosed at
the time. When the United States offered the
Paris Pact, by which every nation bound
itself te abandon war as an instrument of
national policy, Sir Austen Chamberlain stated
that Great Britain, like the United States,
had its Monroe Doctrine in certain regions
where it would brook no interference, and at
that time all -the chancelleries understood what
those regions were.
Canada's stand in regard te compulsory
arbitration had net been one of uncompromising hostility. Canada had rejected the
protocol because, by reason of its form and

JUNE .9, 1931
tenor, it seemed unworkable in case sanctions
were asked from Canada against a country
with which the United States would have
amicable relations. At the same time, Canada's message of 1925 declared her willingness
to consider adherence to the Optional Clause
aud the enlargement of the principles of
arbitration generally. This difference in policy
between Canada and Great Britain played an
important part in 1927.
I have stated that for a number of years
the negative policy of the British representatives created considerable depression in the
minds of the other delegations. In 1927 the
Netherlands delegation moved that the underlying principle of the protocol be examined
again for the purpose of ascertaining whether
a solution could not be found that would be
satisfactory to all. Sir Austen Chamberlain
took strong objection to the motion. Canada
could not do so, because her expressed policy
favoured the acceptance of the underlying
principle of compulsory arbitration. She reaffirmed the principle contained in her
message of 1925. The election to the Council
took place under these circumastances, and
the success of Canada was largely due to the
fact that she had expressed sympathy for
arbitration and for the Optional Clause. Canada's policy did not vary, and could not be
influenced or altered by the changing moods
of the British electorate, which in eight years
had changed four times. Lord Robert Cecil
commended Canada's attitude, and in an official message congratulated Canada upon
standing for the Optional Clause.
The Kellogg-Briand Pact, referred to by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and
signed in 1928, provided for the renunciation
of war as an instrument of national policy.
To that Canada adhered without reservation,
but it was recognized at the time-and I so
stated when I moved for the adoption of the
Kellogg Pact-that it would have to be
supplemented. The Kellogg Pact has two
articles which read as follows:
Article 1. The High Contracting Parties
solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war
for the solution of international controversies,
and renounce it as an instrument of national
policy in their relations with one another.
Article 2. The High Contracting Parties
agree that the settlement or solution of all
disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of
whatever origin they may be, which may arise
among them, shall never be sought except by
pacific means.
, War as an instrument of national policy is
renounced, and disputes are to be settled by
pacific means. Nevertheless, parties to a dispute may not be able to agree or to reconcile
their respective points of view. What will

follow if there is no means of arbitration to
settle their differences? Their grievances will
remain. Is that a healthy situation, interNecessarily the body
nationally speaking?
must be cleansed of any abscess. Hence this
General Act, which is an agreement to submit
to ompulsory arbitration.
To this General Act Sir Austen Chamberlain
has demurred, and in 8o doing he has cited
the example of the United States. In his last
speech on this subject in the House of Commons he said that although the United States
were the authors of the Paris Pact, they had
not felt the necessity of implementing that
pact by arbitration. Well, we are all aware
of the attitude of the United States in relation
to international engagements. We know the
average opinion of the masses in that country
on this question. Naturally the leaders in the
United States must act with cireumaspection.
Nevertheless, the intellectuals of the United
States know very well their shortcomings in
this matter, and even Mr. Hoover has felt
the necessity of speaking his mind to a de.gree, and in so doing has no doubt reflected
the thoughts of what might be called the élite
of the nation. On the 11th of November last
he said:
There has been much discussion as to the
desirability of some further extension of the
pact so as to effect a double purpose of assuring methodical development of this machinery
of peaceful settlement and to insure at least
the mobilisation of world opinion against those
who fail when the strain comes. I do not say
that some such further step may not some day
corne about.
Such a formula would be stimulative and
would appeal to the dramatic sense of the
world as a mark in the progress of peace. But
less dramatic, and possibly even more sure, is
the day to day strengthening and buttressing
of the pact by extension from one nation to
another of treaties which in times of friction
assure resort to the well-tried process of competent negotiation, of conciliation, and of
arbitration.
From this it will be seen that Mr. Hoover
admits the propriety of strengthening the
Paris Pact by enlarging the principles of arbitration.
In speaking of what took place in Geneva
and in London, I do so in order that the
Senate and the country at large may know the
various currents of opinion that existed in
the British Empire. Sir Austen Chamberlain
and the Tory Party, which he represented,
were quite consistent all along the line from
the day they assumed power in November,
1924. It is true that Sir Austen allowed the
General Act to pass at Geneva in 1928, but it
was not his intention to have it ratified. He
opposed the adoption of the Optional Clause
and of the General Act in the House of Gom-

190

SENATE

mons. Of course he was facing a new order of
things. Great Britain had returned Ramsay
MacDonald to power, and Great Britain's
negative policy had been replaced by one of
forward
action,
which
was
acclaimed
by the League, and Great Britain then
gave a leadership which the other nations
followed. My right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster) and I were at
Geneva in 1929, and I may say that I never
before saw in the Assembly such a buoyant
spiiit as I witnessed when Great Britain
rcsuned its leadership.

I desire to say a word as to the reservations contained in the resolution presented by
my honourable friend. He stated that these
five reservations were contained in the resolution submitting approval of the Optional
Clause. Only the first four are inscribed as
reservations in the resolution on the Optional
Clause. The first reservation, I confess, has
always seened to me somewhat obscure, and
has never be-n explained satisfactorilv.
The follow-ing disputes are excluîded from the
procedure described in the General Act, inciuding the procedure of conciliation:(i) Disputes arising prior to the accession,
in respect of Canada, to the said General Act
or relating to situations or facts prior to the
said accession.
It has been said in many quarters that disputes may arise from situations anterior to the
signing of ihe General Act, and that many
of them are quite apparent in Europe even
to-day and thrcaten conflict. I bolievo the
reservation was meant to cover the treaties
and maintain the status quo. Moreover, it
conforms to clause 39 of the General Act,
which says:
These reservations nay be suti as to exclide
firoi flic procediure described in the present
Act:
(a) Disputes arising out of facts prior to
the accession either of the Party imaking the
reservation or of any other Party with whom
the said Party nay have a dispute.
However, treaties which, because they are
anterior to the signing of the General Act, do
not fall under this arbitration instrument are
mueant to be revised only through and under
clause 19 of the pact, which says:
The Assenibly may fron tiie to tinse advise
the reconsideration by Meinbers of the Leaguîe
of treaties w-hich have becone inapplicable and
the consideration of international conditions
whose continuance miglit endanger the pcace of
tise world.
Even if we do not sec eye to eye with the
framers of the resolution, there is this consideration to be kept in mind, that all matters,
past, present and future, are covered by the
Paris Part, and that the nations that have
Hou. Nr. DANDURA

N

D.

signed that part have bound themselves not
to make use of war as an instrument of
national policy.
The third reservation relates to disputes
between His Majesty's Government in Canada
and any other member of the League of
Nations which is a member of the British
Commonwealth of' Nations, all of which
disputes shall be settled in such manner as the
parties have agreed or shall agree. In the
session of 1929 there was considerable effort
on the part of the representatives of Great
Britain and of the British Dominions to reach
an agreement which would dispense with this
reservation, but the Irish Free State was
obdurate and claimed the right to submit any
constitutional difficulty, or any difficulty in
the interpretation of the treaty upon which
its constitution is based, to the international
tribunal. To meet this objection I suggested
that an arbitration tribunal
should be
organized by the various members of the
Commonwealth, to which could be submitted
any differences that might arise between the
msembers of the Commonwealth, and that that
tribunal should be substituted for .the Privy
Council, which was deemed unacceptable in
such matters. This proposal was discussed
for some time, but there was difficulty in
reaching a conclusion as to the form that the
tribunal should take, and the Irish Free State
instructed its delegates to sign without reservations.
In reading the speech of tlie
Right Hon. the Prime Minister I was happy
to find that he expressed the same view that
I expressed in favour of the constitution of an
Imperial tribunal to deal with any difficulties
that might arise between the members of the
Commonwealth.
I confess that I cannot understand paragraph
(v) of clause 1 of the resoluition, which excludes(v) Disputes with any party to the General
Act wiho is not a Menber of the League of
Nations.
Only two great countries are non-members
of the League, the United States and Russia.
Now, why should we exclude countries that
are outside the League? They are invited to
accede to this Genieral Arct by Article 43 of the
Art, which reads:
1. The preseat General Act shall be open to
accession by all the Heads of States or other
comsspeten't authorities of tihe Members of the
League of Nations and the non-Menber States
to which the Council of the League of Nations
las comiisunicated a copy for this plrpose.
This exclusion certainly is not meant to
apply to the United States. for there is no
indication a-t the present time that that country intends to sign the General Act, although
no one can afflirm it will never do se. Canada

JUNE 9,19M1
certainly would flot exclude the United States
fromn the opera.tions of the General Act. Our
general disposition is to arbitrate aUl disputes
that may arise between us. Does the paragrapli refer to Russia? If it were ta join the
League., efvery other member nation would
be obliged ta arliitrate any differencés that
might arise between itself and Russia. Why
go out of a.ur way to single out that country?
Or is the reference ta Egypt? This reservation
is suggested by Great Britain and Australia.
Canada lias acceded, but no explanation has
been given as ta, why Canada has done so,
nor -why there should lie this objection ta
non-4member nations. Sa far as Egypt is concerned, Canada lias no interest there ex.cept
the mnainteniance of peace. This cauntry has
been uniformiy in favour of arbitration. We
signed the Paris Paot, in common with Great
Britain and Australia, and we are ail bound
ta settie disputes without exception by peacefui means. Public opinion in Great Britain
likewise is solidly hehind compulsory arbitration of ail disputes with any country. In this
conneetian we have the officiai statements of
the Labour Government and of the Liberal
Party.
But this unexplainied reservation will not
stand in the way of my approval of the resalution. Our accession ta, the Art wil remain
effective for only three years, and then it may
lie reconsidered. The ail-important policy of
international co-operation is developing more
rapidly than could have, been f oreseen or hoped
for, and loyers of peare everywhere are deeply
grateful.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable senatars, when I came into this
Chamber to-niglit I had no intention of taking
part in any discussion on this resolution.
Honourable members on both sides of the
House have had access ta ail the sources o
information, and I do not wish ta intimate
that they have not fully avai]ed themselves,
thereof. I am not going ta apologize for what
the League of Nations lias not been able ta
accomplish, nor shall I enter into any exposition of the great forward steps that the League
*has taken. I do think, however, that the
honourabie leader on the other side (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) lias omitted one or two
observations which wouid have ta some extent
qualified his apparent strictures upon the
actions of the Government of Great Britain
in power from time ta time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A statement of
fart only.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I desire simply ta make a f ew observations
with respect ta two particlar points. First

191

I would refer ta the position assumed by the
then British Government in relation ta the
protocol of 1924. The League had a membership of 55 nations, each equal in representation
on the floor of the Assembly, but ail differing
widely in traditions, in responsibilities and
in other respects. Therefore it was not to
be expected that they would be unanimaus
on thc important questions brouglit up for
consideration. For instance, a smali country
sucli as Liberia, or Cuba, might not always
see eye to eye with the great powers. The
position of Great Britain was quite different
from that of a smaller nation, with regard ta
the protocol and the obligations which it
involved. Great Britain had, for exampie, a
heavy responsibility in relation ta, the possible
necessity of enforcing obligations imposed by
the Covenant. She had to look at the thing
in a practical way and ta consider the situation
that probably would arise when effeet had
ta be given to the sanctions. If the United
States of America had been a member of the
League and had worked in unison with such
countries as France and Great Britain, f or*
instance, and had assumed obligations sucli
as those conutries assumed, I believe the
British would neyer have raised thc question
of the protocol. What was tlic situation?
Great Britain realized that if peaceful methods
faiied to settlc a dispute with a nation that
bad violated its obligations, the question of
the enforcement of the sanctions would then
arise, and that the ultimate means for their
full enforcement was essentially the naval
blockadc of the ports of the offending nation,
witli the consequent cutting off of ail crmmercial operations betwcen those ports and
the rest of the world.
I have ailuded on previaus occasions ta the
situation which arase during the Great War
before thc United States took an active part
therein. Honourable members an bath sides
who have foilowed the diplomatie correspondence that took place and are aware of the
sensitive relations that existed know ta what
I refer. Time and again, whulc thc United
States was neutral, its comm-ercial intesrests
clashied with the policies of the Allies, and
the resulting friction was expresscd in exchanges that became almost ultimatums from
the United States ta, Allied world powers.
Now, the British Government, in considering
the protocol, knew that as it possessed the
most powerful fleet of any nation belonging
ta the League, its ficet would have ta take
the leading part should it become ncessary
ta blorkadc the parts of an offcnding nation.
Since it was not known what stand wouid be

GOVERNMENT ANNIJITIES BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson, the
Senate went into com.mittee on Bill Dl, an
Act to amend the Government Annuities
Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-limitation as ta persone and
amount:
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable senators, I
think when this Bill was given the second
reading it was understaod that we reserved
the right to oppose the princîple of it. I do
not know whether this is the proper stage,
but I should like to go upon record as
opposed to the principle of the Bill. I
thoroughly a>gree with the observations that
were made by the honourable gentleman from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux), that the
Annuities Act is an admirable means of promoting thrif t, and I arn decidedly opposed ta
restricting its operatians in any way. I do not
think that a sufficient reasan was advanced
for so drastie a change as a reduction in the
maximum annuity fromn $5,000 ta $1,200. The
honourable the Minister of Labour said that
there was a possibility of abuse by a person
investing a large sumn in an annuity for the
purpase of defrauding bis creditors, but he did
not say that there had be-en any actual case of
abuse of that kind. I repeat that I amn
opposed to the principle of the Bill, and I
should like ta have the opinion of the bouse
tested upon it.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: The honourable
the Minister af Labour will remember that
when we were previously discussing this Bill I
asked for certain information. Among other
things, I enquired whether he couhd give us
figures ta show the economnic result of the
aperation of the Annuities Act up ta the
present-time. What I wish ta knaw is whether
the scherne has been self-sustaining or
whetber it has entailed the expenditure of
public money.

22112-13
REVI5ED EDITION

SENATE
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: With the leave
of the House, I would ask the Superintendent
of Annuities to take a chair on the floor.
Efforts have been made to obtain the information requested by my honourable friend
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), and I am
able to tell him that the annuities plan has
not been wholly self-supporting. The intention was that it should operate on the basis of
a four per cent return, but it lias not been
possible to realize fully that ambition. I
have a statement, compiled by the Department, showing the amount which bas been
added to the fund from 1914 to 1931, and this
shows that the average cost of carrying the
Annuities Act of 1908 lias been 4-51 per cent;
so it is clear that the fund lias not been
wholly self-sustaining on a 4 per cent conpound interest basis. Several reasons for the
fact may be mentioned, 'the chief reason being
tliat the annuitants themselves have, on the
average, slightly exceeded the normal span of
life, on whicli the cost of 'the annuities was
based. It was intended originally that the
annuities should be self-sustaining and that
the cost of administration should be borne by
the Governmcnt. In recent years, in conmon
with the cost of nearly everything else, the
cost of the operation of this Act has risen. It
is believed that if the maximum annuity were
reduced from $5,000 to $1,200 the scheme
would probably carry itself without an inThe departmental
irease
n preninums.
officers who have considered this matter are
experienced men, and they have recommended
the reduction in thei maximum amount of
annuity only after very careful thought.
I should like to correct one remark which
I made in connection with this matter at a
previous sitting. I stated that the original
maximum for annuities was $600, and that
this was subsequently raised to $1,200 and
later to $5,000. My statement was made
from memory, and I find that the increase
was fron $600 to $1,000, and from $1,000 fo
$5,000 in 1920, I think.
It bas been asked. What is the reason for
reducing the maximum? The fact is that in
the last ten years 95-6 per cent of all the
annuities written have been for less than
S1.200, and only 4-4 per cent for more than
tîat amount. As I have already stated. the
purpose of the Act, which was introduced by
Sir Richard Cartwright in 1907 and finally
passed in 1908, was to encourage thrift among
people of small means and to enable them to
make provision for their declining years. It
was not expected. nor has experience proven,
that a poor man could purchase an annuity
for more than $1.200; and inasmuch as th
Ho

Mr. BELCOURT.

average of the annuities written last year
amounted to only about $444, I think lionourable members will agree that it would be
a good thing to reduîce the maximum annuity
obtainable to $1.200, particularly if thereby
the Government would effect a saving in
expenses. The reduetion would not be unfair
te commercial companies, and would be fair
to the class of citizens for whom the Annuities
Act was originally intended. I submit that
the experience gained from years of operation
of the Act should have some weight in the
consideration of the proposed amendment.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
What are the elements of the increase in expenses, to which reference lias been made?
I have a similar
Hon. J. J. HUCHES:
question. Will the Minister state how the
reduction in the maximum would lessen the
operating expenses?
The principal
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
increase in the cost of operation has come
about during the years since the maximumîî
was raised fron 81,000 to $5,000. Wlien ihe
Act was first passcd, postmasters were the
mediun through which most annuities were
sold. The number of sales was net large, bhcause postmasters in large centres, who are
paid a salary and not a commission. naturall
did not exert themselves to sell annuitie-.
But after the maximum was raised to 35.000.
if it was thought that a man could be inducd
to buiy a large annuity lie was regarded as, in
insurance language, a good prospect, for the
commission was quite suLbstantial. That increased the operating costs.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would the commîission not be in accordance with the amount of
the annuity?
Hon. Mr. R:OBERTSON: Net necessaril.
Tie rate of commission varied according to
the size of the annuity purchased. The per-ne who solicited the business miglit sell a
large annuity with little effort and therelby
nake a comparatively big commission.
My rigit honourable friend from Ottawa
(Riglt Hon. Sir George E. Foster) stated
when we were previously discussing this matter
that there had been a heavy expense in advertising annuities, and in reply I expressed
the opinion that le had been misled, owing to
the fact that in recent years the advertising
costs were net always paid out of each year's
appropriation and some amounts had been
carried forward. The information at hand
indicates that there has been considerable increase in the cost of advertising during the
last five years, when the volume of business

JUNE 9, 1931
ivas rapidly increasing. Whereas, say, five
years ago advertising expenses were $8,500,
last year they had grown to more than three
times that amount. But since January last
the advertising of annuities has been wholly
abandoned. Higher commissions paid on the
larger annuities have resulted in an increase
in expenses. It is feit that it would be to the
advantage of the Government and of that
cîass of citizens for whose benefit the Act was
originally designed, to reduce the maximum
annuity to $1,200 and put the scheme on a
self-sustaining basis.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
What is the rate of commission?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The rate of commission varies. On annuities for small amounts
I think it is one per cent of the amount
paid, and if the payments are to run over
more than one year the commission is larger.
For example, if it is two years the commission is two per cent, payable in instalments,
some of them quarterly and some of them
half-yearly, as the case may be. Instructions
have been issued for some time now that commission will flot be paid to an agent on an
annuity of over $1,200. That action was
deemed to be justified from an administrative
standpoint, and now it is desired that the
Act itself should be brought into harmony. If
in the future the Act becomes more than selfsustaining., perhaps there would flot be any
great objection to again increasing the maximum amount, but if that is done the annuities will be subjeet to the criticismn that
-%vas made last year by insurance companies. I
can give honourable members information that
may be useful, in connection with the comparative costs of annuities purchased from the
Government and those from insurance comnpanies.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What is the
difference in rates?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: A man forty years
of age, for example, would pay 81,548 for a
Canadian Government annuity of $100; The
lowest cost that we have on record for a
similar annuity issued by an insurance coinpany is $1,567, which is only a slight increase
over the ýGovernment figure. If the annuitant
were a lady,. the cost of a Government annuity
wouId be $1,595; with an insurance company
the annuity would cost $1,652.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the hionourable gentleman give the first figures hie
cited?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The cost is $1,548
as against $1,567. That is for a man forty
years of age. For a lady of the samne age the
22112-13a

variation in cost would be greater. Now if
we take a person further along in lifeHon. Mr. RANKIN: Take the age of
twenty-flve years.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have nothing
under forty years. At sixty years of age a
man would pay $1,003 for an annuity of $100.
The expectancy of life would be slightly more
than ten years at that time. With an insurance company the annuity would cost him
81,050. For a lady, the premium on the Governmént annuity would be 81,119; if it were
with an insurance company it would be $1,199.
At age seventy a man would pay for a Government annuity $701 for $100. a year, as
against $752 to an insurance company. The
anticipated span of life would be shorter. For
a lady of this age the cost would be 8788 as
against $879. At seventy-five years of age the
pioportions would be relativeîy the samne.
The annuities granted for the year 1930-41,
for example, totalled 1,772, of which 1,694
wvere for less than $1,200. 0f the total number
83-6 per cent were for less than $600; *(03 per
cent exceeded $2,500, and -00 per cent exceeded $2,000. It is apparent to the Department and to the Governrnent,,who have had
the matter reviewed by the Superîntendent
of Insurance, that the suggestion contained
in this Bill is sound from a business standpoint, and that it will not debar any man
of moderate means from the enjoyment of the
benefits of the legisiation. That being true,
the.Government feels that it is arnply justified in asking Parliament to approve of the
suggested reduction from 85,000 to 81,200.
Rigbt Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
As to agents who receive a commission, will
anyone wbo brings forward an annuitant with
the necessary paymient receive the commission?
Hlon. Mr. R*OBERTSON: I think not. I
think that every postmaster who is working
on commission may seil annuities, and if hie
is in a commission office hie will receive the
scheduled rate. The Government cannot permit the public to solicit annuities any more
than the insurance companies can. It bas
its representati%,es, commonly called agents.
Naturally they are to be found in the larger
centres. When they get a prospect, or when
someone makes an inquiry of the Superintendent of Annuities at Ottawa for information on the subject, literature is furnished,
and if there is an agent within reasonable distance of the locality where the prospect resides,
hie is very apt to caîl and discuss the matter
and give complete information. That is one
of the reasons why the business has grown

in volume during recent years. The profits
have not grown, because the cost of administration has increased somewhat. Therefore
it is proposed that we should not encourage
the man who might buy a big annuity, but
should give the poor man a better chance
than he has enjoyed heretofore of getting an
annuity that is ample for his requirements,
and probably all that he can afford to purchase.
Are the annuity
Hon. Mr. HORSEY:
rates of all the insurance companies the
same?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The rates of the
insurance companies doing an annuity business are, I believe, virtually the same.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
members of the Senate, the last time this
Bill came before us for discussion, before it
was distributed, I expressed on the spur of
the moment a tentative opinion as to the
proposal submitted to us. The press generally stated that I was unfavourable to the
Bill, but, as indicated by the Report of the
Debates, the contrary was the case.
I may say that I am particularly concerned
about the federal treasury. The annuities
system is practically in its infancy. Spasmodic efforts have been made to develop
it by the appointment of agents here and
there, but it is only by seeing the results in
the long run that we may know what we
are undertaking. We must not forget that
the Act in the first place was intended to
provide frugal persons in the humbler walks
of life with a safe method of investment for
their savings. I am disposed to think that
we should be willing to assume a certain
burden in order to assist that class of people,
but I am not prepared to admit that we
should shoulder a financial responsibility to
assist people who can afford to purchase anIn
nuities at regular commercial rates.
establishing the system to encourage the
humbler classes to purchase annuities we
were not thinking of old age pensions. A
low rate was fixed, on the assumption that
the cost of administration would be met out
of revenue. Why should the citizens of this
country carry the load of a man who desires
and is able to buy a $5,000 annuity? It takes
considerable capital to ensure the payment
of an annuity of that size, and it is very
seldom that a man in the humble situation
that I have mentioned can pay for a $1,200
annuity.
It must not be forgotten that the Government pays the whole cost of the administration, and that the existing rates are
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

apparently too low to make the fund selfsupporting. An annuity fund may carry a
certain number of larger annuities when
reserves are accumulated regularly to enable
it to meet such liabilities. Rates undoubtedly
play an important part, and in my opinion,
if they are not high enough to meet the cost
of operation, the public treasury should not
be called upon for the payment of annuities
for the well-to-do classes. I confess that in
this matter I am in the hands of the experts
of the Department. I have only my own
business intelligence and my common sense
to guide me. If we are to assume a burden,
let it be the burden of the humble people,
not the burden of those who are in a position
to pay for annuities at the regular commercial
rates. I am speaking only for myself. This
is a matter which interests us all, and the
views of other members would be most
enlightening.
There is one
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
further brief observation that I might make
touching the original purpose of the Act.
Those who romember Sir Richard Cartwright
will recall that he gave a great deal of time
and thought to this question, and that in
1907, when he was Minister of Trade and
Commerce, ho introduced it in this House by
way of a resolution. ln 1908, as I remember,
the Act was adopted on a basis calculated to
make the system self-sustaining. It happened
that in later years. particularly during the
War, the rates of interest paid by the Government rose from the level of 1908 and thus
to sone extent the cost of administration was
increased. I should like to refer briefly to
what was said when the legislation was introduced. 1 think the real object of the legislatien is clearly explained in the preamble to
the original Act, which reads as follows:
Whereas it is in the public interest that
habits of thrift be promoted and that the
people of Canada be encouraged and aided
thereto so that provision may be made for old
age; and whereas it is expedient that further
facilities be afforded for the attainment of the
said objects: therefore Bis Majesty by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate and
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as
follows:
Froi this it would appear that those who
were intendcd to benefit were not that class
of persons who could afford to purchase an
The
annuity of more than $1,200 a year.
experience of the years from 1914 to the
present time indicates that the average cost
to the Government of carrying the burden is
a little over five per cent, and, as has been
pointed out by my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), it would seem that a person
who is able to buy a large annuity, for which

JUNE 9, 1931
hie would pay $60,000 or upwards, should not
need the assistance of the State, and that the
State should not have ta bear that load. Sncb
a persan should be able ta purchase an annuity
in the commercial field.
Hon. Mr. ROBIN SON: I should like ta
understand what is meant by a cost of five
per cent. Five per cent, of what? I also fail
ta understand how the increased cast af money
ta the Governiment would make the burden.
heavier. I should think it would make it
lighter. I understand that the Gavernment
is allowing only a certain fixed rate of
interest on the money paid in. If it is allowing four per cent, and is borrowing money at
five and a haîf per cent, it is saving money
instead of losing it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do nat quite
follow my honourable friend when lie says
that if the Government pays four per cent,
excluding the cost of administration of annuities, and is borrowing money at five and
a half per cent, it is making maney.
Han. Mr. ROBINSON: Yau are nat paying
out rnoney ta the people; you are taking it
in fromn them. Instead of borrowing money
by way of boans throughout the country you
are gettàng it froni the annuitants.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend perhaps overlooks the fact that every
dollar received is a liability of the Federal
Gaverament, for which. it agrees ta pay the
annuitant four per 'cent; aînd in addition ta
that four per oent. the Government has also to
carry the cost of administration. But if the
Governent has ta step out and pay five per
cent, or five and a haîf per cent, on the money
il borrowsHon. Mr. ROBINSON: It borrows fromt
these people at four and a haîf per cent.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No, it does not.
Rates are rapidly coming dawn. The recent
Conversion Loan has braught the rate down
ta four and a haif per cent. Ail the moneys
that have came into the annuities fund since
its inception have cast the Government a
littie over 4.51 per cent. Therefore the time
bas corne when the fund is not quite selfsustaining.
Han. Mr. ROBINSON: It is 4.51 per cent
of what?
0f the money
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
invested in annuities.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can my honourable fricnd give us the exact propartion of
the expenditure on adrninistration? Has lie
that figure by itself?

197

Hon. Mir. ROBERTSO'N: Yes, for a number
of years.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If you are borrowing rnoney from these people at 4.51 per cent,
that is cheaper than borrowing it from the
public at tive per cent or five and a haif
per cent.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It would be if
there were nothing to meet but the interest;
but if you are paying a substantial. commission for securing the business you are i the
same position as an insurance company. That
is why their premiurns must necessarily be
higher. The Government cannat bear that
cost. and feels that it is not necessary umder
existing circumstances.
Now, in answer to the honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hen. Mr. Belcourt) I May
say that the cost of administration is not
altogether a penny postage proposition. In
1930-31 it amounted to 3-9 per cent of the
re.ceipts. The receipts for last year werc a
little over 83,500»N0, and the total administraThe Goverument does
tion cast was $141,W5.
not feel that it should be called upon ta pay
moneys out of pocket for the purpose of
carryîng on an annuity seheme that supplies
to the poor man-f or originally it was not
intended to help any others--anything ini
excess of $1,200 a year, or $100 a manth. That
income is regarded as being within the reach
of many men in the more humble walks of
life; but any man who wants an annuity of
8,5,000 a yearHon. Mr. RANKIN: Why penalize a man?
Hon. Mr. RO'BERTSON:- -might very well
do business in the commercial field, in whieh
the Government ought not ta compete.
Hon. R. LEMIEUX: There are many
other services administered by the Governnient that could be as well adnfinistered by
private campanies. Take the Post Office
Department, for instance. This ycar there is
a huge deficit. In the aid days pastmasters
were given the privilege of rendering the
postal service: now the postal service has
been takzen hold of by the Governiment.
Because there is a deficit one year the Government does not think the Department
should be abolished.
Hon. Mr. ROBE RTSON: May I interrupt
My honourable frîend ta say that there is no
thaught of abalishing annuities.
Han. Mr. LEMIEUX: No, but you are
dealing the first blaw at the annuities system.
I say with ail due respect ta the hanourable
gentleman that I arn sarry the Bill is in his
hands. I do not like ta see the Minister of

198

SENATE

Labour promoting this legislation before this
Chamber. I am aware of his sympathy for
the poorer classes. He said that the original
intention of the Act was to benefit the people
of small means. Now, will my honourable
friend tell me whether the purchasing power of
the dollar in those days was the same as it is
to-dav? He knows it was not the sane. And
will he not agree with me that if we make it
impossible for anyone to obtain a Government annuity for more than $1,200 we shall
be doing an injury to those workers who today, because of their higher wages, can afford
to buy larger annuities? Only the other day,
in the Railway Committee of the other House,
Sir Henrv Thornton stated that there are
railway conductors who have salaries as large
as that of a judge of the Superior Court.
That was not the case in 1907.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is not the case
now, either.
lon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Well, under the McAdoo Award it is not far from being the case.
Now. why strike a blow at the annuities
systeim? The honourable gentleman knows
wvhat regard I have for his ability and his
sincrrity, but I must say, with all deference
to him, that he bas not convinced me that
the cost of operation is the impelling motive
behind this measure. I really believe-I may
be wrong-that the big insurance companies

annuities, because it is donc in competition
with their business. But, honourable senators. this is a legitimoate business for the

not only in Canada but in Great Britain, the
United States, France and every other demoratic country, like to rely on the solid credit
of the nation?
Iton. Mr. ROSS: Hear, hear.
HJon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I believe, as I said
a inoin-nt ago, in iiy honourable friend's

spread among the postnasters throughout the
country, but that did not add to the costs of
administration.
Let me remind my honourable friend that
if this Bill is passed, as it probably will be,
under the pressure of the big insurance companies, soon there will be pressure exerted by
the banks with a view to the elimination of
the postal savings offiées. Now, I have something to do with banks and insurance, asnd I
know that one of the grievances of the big
bankers is that the Government is doing a
business which comes within the powers of
the chartered banks. As I have said, the
present tendency in democratic countries is
to enable the poorer classes to rely more upon
the Government for the security and wise
administration of their savings.
I had something else to say, but I forget it
now.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Forget it.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I will forget it. I
repeat that I am opposed to this Bill. I think
that the honourable Minister bas not convinced this House that the amendment to the
Act was necessary, especially from the point
of view of administrative costs.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable senators,
I intend to vote in favour of the Bill. I think
that if the maximum of $5,000 is retained it
will be the means of enabling a person to put
a capital of as much as $100,000 out of the
reach of his creditors. I believe that such a
situation should net exist, and that consideration will be the principal one in determining the way I shal vote.
Hon. Mr. RANKIN: A person could do
that with an insurance company also.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the moncy would
not be exempt from seizure then.
Hon. J. MURDOCK: I want to extend my
congratulations to the honourable the Minister
of Labour for bringing down a measure of this
kind, which in my judgment is in the interest
of 92 per cent of the people of Canada. My
honourable friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux) spoke of railway conductors having
as large an income as that of a Superior Court
judge. That is the greatest exaggeration I
bave heard in many years. As a matter of
fact, no railway conductor gets anything like
hailf of the salary of a Superior Court judgeHon. Mr. ROSS: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Some conductors get
more than a judge.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: .- unlss in certain
<ases the railway company, for the purpose of
evading the full cost of two conductors,

JUNE 9, 1931
chooses to permit one conductor to work what
i.. practically time and a half. In that case,
a conductor may make something niear $4,500
or $5:000 a year.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

Seven thousand.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 want to see the
figures.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I can get them.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But the railway
couductor has to workHon. Mr. LAIRD: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman for a moment?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I think my honourable
friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux)
got a wrong impression of the statement made
by Sir Henry Thornton. 1 heard the statenient, and it wvas to the effect that there were
railway conductors who received as mucli in
waiges as inembers of P-arliament receivedi by
way of indemnity. At the same time he
suggested that members of Parliament should
forim a union and then raise their own pay.
There was nothing said, so far as 1 remember,
about the salary of a Superior Court judge.
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 belong to one of
the unions, and have just been ele-cted to
office for another three years. I know something about this ýmatter. The men do get
subst.antially good wages, but 1 rememiher the
time when they did not. I repeat tha.t it is
a gross exaggeration to state that railway
conductors m-ake anything like the amounit
that was suggested a few moments ago. It is
only in cases where it is cheaper to let one
cooductor work extra miles or longer hours
than it is to psy two eonductors, that a conductor makes higher wages than are usually
paid. But ail this is aside from the question
here. Who are the average citizens of Canada,
for whomn the Annuities Act wvas passed? Are
thcy the people who can afford to pay $65,000
for a guarante-ed annual income of $5,000? 0f
course they are not. I think I know a little
about annuities, because they were transferred
from the Post Offi-ce Department to the Labour
Department a few ycars ago, and I have some
knoivledge of the cost od operation. When
I was Mînister of Labour there were thirteen
cmiployees connected with the operation of
this Act. I am not aware whether that number bas increased or decressed since then, but
1 cari say that the overhead is suibstantial.
In the Annuities Act tbe Government has donc
muich to help the ordinary citizens of our
countrv provide for their old age. 1 eau give
the nàmes and addresses of a number of

peopie who, in -order to evadle their obligations to the community and to business concerris of Canada, wanted to put $50,000 or
865,000 into the Government coffers and be
gusranteed an annqaity for life. It has been
unýfair to the average citizen, for whose benefit this Act was passed, that large annuities
have 'been paid. Such a thing was neyer contemplsted when -the Act was originally passed,
and in my judgment the change was only
brought aibout by the work of some special
favourites in yesars gone by.
1 cannot compliment my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) too highly for bringing
down this Bill, which, as I have already said,
will work to the sdvantage of 92 per cent of
our people. I only regret that I did not have
an opportunity to do such a thing when I was
Minister of Labour, because it was just as
necessary then as it is now. I hope the House
will pass thîs measure, which is the tirst real
gesture in the interest *of the ordinary citizen
that I have seen since I became a member of
this Chamber.
Hion. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do flot desire
to delay honourable members, but may 1
make a brief reply to my honourable friend
from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux)? He
implied that the purchasing power of the
dollar had increased since the time the original
Act was introduced. That was true for a
number of years, but since 1920 there bas
been a substantial decrease.
I repudiate the suggestion thaÀt there was
any collusion, or thought of collusion, between
the Goverument or members of Parliament
and insurance companies, in connection with
this matter. No representations have to my
knowledge been made about anything of this
kind by insurance companies in the ten or
twelve years that I have known something of
government. I therefore suggest to my honourable friend that while ha may profess to
be disappointed because the Minister of
Labour-who he says is a friend of the poor
man-is bringing down this measure, ha should
ponder the question whether the Bill will not
benefit chiefly the poorer classes of our people,
although perhaps it may work slightly to the
dissdvantage of a few persons who can afford
to invest $50,000 or $65.000 in a Governiment
annuity.
Hcn. Mr. MURDOCK: Would the honourable Minister state what commission is paid
to, an agent for securing the sale of a $1,200
annuity, and also of a $5,000 anmiity?
Hion. Mr. LEWTIS: The honourable the
Minister of Labour read, as I understood it,
the preamble of the original Act, in order to

200

SENATE

sustain his contention that this mneasure was
intencied only to benefit persons in the
humbler svalks of life, as was stated. But I
heard no restriction of that kind as the
preamble was read, for the statement there
was simply that thc Act was intended to
encourage habits of thrift, without specifyingany c]ass of citizens.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The preambie
of the -average Act does flot contain the
details; they are always in succeedingparts. 1 repeat that the underlying motive
of the original Act was te give the peorer
,lasses reasonabie protection at cost. It is
only in an effort to maintain that purpose
that tbis Bill is brought dewn.
In answer to riiv hionourable fric'nd froni
Parkdalo (Hon. Mr. Murdock). I may say
that where a payment is cempieted in one
year, the cemmizsion is one per cent. If a
person paid down $65,000 for an annuity, the
salesman who got one per cent would miake a
gond day's pay, which would bc chargcd
against the public fond. If the payments roisi
cver a nniber of vears and the agent bas te
receive the premiums and renoit them to
Ottawai, and (Ie the necessary accounting, hie
d.oes net receiv e a lower commission, but it
takes a longer tinte for p.cyments te be made.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does the saiesman
receive renewai commissions?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There is ne renewai of the cenlract. A contract may bc entered into for payments running into two \'ears
or ten years, or an-, numnber of years, as thse
case inay be.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is one commission, ence for ail?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But it is paid in
instaiments.
Hon. Mi'. MLJRDOCK: What wouid bc the

Hon. Mr'. ROBERTSON: At wvhat age?ý
Hon. Mr. ML'RDOCK: Wlsas' at forly,

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think there is

The coal mines of Canada have been the
recipients of a large proportion of their
business from the Canachian Pacifie Railway,
whose purchases from Canadian mines in the
nine years from 1922 ta 1930, inclusive, have
amounted to a value of $9.330,568 £rom the
Ea.stern mines, and $65,562,122 from mines in
Western Canada. The average annual sum
paid to Canadian coal mining companias during this period was thus $8,321,410.

Steamships.-In addition to operating one
nf the two big Canadian railway systems, the
Canadian Pa-cifie is engaged in many other
enterprises of great importance to the Canadian people. First among these we may place
the steamship fleets, whiceh constitute a link
in Canadian trade facilities of immense value.
We eau hardly overratc the importance of
regular and rapid ocean transit to a country
such as ours, which depends so largely upon, the
export of varîous produets in keen competition
with other producers for the markets of the
United Kingdom, the Etiropean continent and
the Orient.
Without prompt and regular
shipping facilities, our exporters would be

opportunity with these products. The regular
passenger services, which bring so many
people to our shores, are supplemented by
winter cruises, concerning the value of which
to this country I shall have something to
say later.
Hotels.-The Company owns and operates
a chain of 16 hotels, which are well and
favourably known to all travellers in Canada,
and by means of festivals and the f-acilities
provided for golf and winter sports these
hotels attract a large number of visitors to
this country every year. They have been
largely instrumental in popularizing the Canadian climate. Among these hotels which
have become favourite resorts of visitors from
other lands are the Banff Springs Hotel and
the Chateau Lake Louise in the Rocky Mountains, with their incomparable scenie attributes, the Empress Hotel at Victoria, with
its climatic advantages, and the Chateau
Frontenac at Quebec, with its winter sports.
The Royal York Hotel at Toronto has become a centre for conventions on the American continent, and this hostelry has the
distinction of being the largest hotel in the
British Empire.
There are also operated 10 bungalow camps
in lake and mountain districts, which allow
tourists who so desire to live closer to nature
than the ordinary hotel would permit, and
yet to be surrounded with the means of comfortable living.
There is still under construction the Lakeside Inn near Yarmouth, N.S., which will contain 55 rooms in the main guest building and
have 5 three-room cottages attached. This
addition to holiday resorts of Nova Scotia is
designed to aid in the further progress of that
province as a magnet for tourist travel. Also,
as is well known, there is projected an hotel
in London, England, for which a suitable site
has been secured, but the actual construction
will not be undertaken at the present time,
owing to the business conditions prevailing.
Looking into the future, one feels that this
hotel will serve to introdcie the Canadian
Pacific most favourably to the enormous
number of travellers passing through that
city, and thus form another link in the chain
of facilities which the Canadian Pacifie provides from Europe to the Orient.
Telegraphs.-The Canadian Pacifie Telegraphs are another of the services whieh assist
the prompt conduct of business in our country. They were officially opened for service
in September, 1886, and at that time had but
4,525 miles of pole line, with a wire mileage
of 14,508, but the system has grown from
year to year until now there is a pole line
mileage of 17,718 miles, with a wire mileage

of 162,615; in addition to a cable mileage of
approximately 400, providing 6,132 miles of
wire. The development of the carrier channel
system bas increased the wire facilities to the
extent of 60,420 miles. This increase, added
to the physical wire mileage, gives a total
channel mileage of 223,035.
The system connects directly with the Postal
Telegraph Cable Company of the United
States, and with the Postal Telegraph systenm

linking up Central and South America. It

systegn has kept pace with the recent strides
in radio communication, and a broadcasting
system operated by the Canadian Pacifie Telegraphs has been eomnpleted from Halifax to
Victoria. linkingi up a chain of 21 stations.

their irrigation system with 130,000 acres of
irrigable land, all of which is now occupied.
Mineral and Industrial Development Organizations.-The Company also maintains
development branches for the purpose of
collecting information as to miscellaneous
resources of Canada and of assisting in the
development of such resources.
Its staffs
include men trained along lines of engineering, mining and geology. In pursuance of
these objects, extensive field surveys have
been carried out. The furnishing of accurate
information regarding these varied material
resources, combined with the necessary facts
as to suitable locations, available buildings,
sites, labour conditions, taxes, power rates,
water supply, transportation. etc., to business
men interested in establishing factories and
warehouses in this country, is a service rendered by industrial agents and ha- been instrumental in bringing a large number of new
industries to Canada.
to
Publicity.-A service of great -alue
Canada rendered by the Canadian Pacifie
lies in the manner in which our country is
advertised all over the world, and accurate
information regarding it disseminated. The
Company is spending at the rate of upwards
of $1,750,000 annually in advertising Canada in foreign countries. through the medium
of newspapers, magazines, advertising booklets, exhibitions, moving pictures and lectures, and radio broadcasts, extending to 29
countries, exclusive of Great Britain and Ireland. Each office of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway abroad is a focussing point for this
work, and as there are 159 principal traffic
agencies in Europe, in the United States and
elsewhere, the value of this organization to
Canada in drawing traffic from all over the
world can be readily imagined.
To encourage the immigration of capital
by directing attention to opportunities in the
Dominion, there iN published a twenty-page
monthly review under the title "Agricultural and Industrial Progre-s in Canada."
It goes to 45 countries of the world, its circulation being 15,000. and many of the articles
contained therein are reproduced in newspapers and periodicals of this and many other
countries. As a supplement to this a weekly
news sheet of progre-iv e Dominion news
items is published in issucs of six thousand.
Iou.

Mr. BEIQUE.

It is in handy form for newspaper insertion
and plays an important part in keeping the
progress of Canadian affairs before the public
of Canada and other countries.
In recent years the company has maintained a bureau of Canadian information at
Montreal and branch libraries in Great
Britain and the United States and has
advertised its willingness te supply information on Canadian affairs. Its slogan, "Ask
us about Canada," is well known and has
resulted in thousands of inquiries reaching
headquarters and branches each year. The
libraries keep abreast of the time to meet
these requests. A large library of motion
picture films illustrating various phases of
Canadian progress is kept in Canada, Great
Britain and Europe and in the United States.
These are available for loan to boards of
trade and other commercial organizations,
colleges and clubs.
The Canadian Pacifie fleet of steamships
advertises Canada net only in the regular ports
associated with the Atlantic and Pacifie services, but also in the ports of call on the
various cruises. On the Round the World
cruise of the "Empress of Britain," for instance,
twenty foreign 'countries will be visited, and
thirty scparate ports used; on the Mediterranean crutise of the "Empress of Australia"
fifteen additional foreign ports will be visited;
on the West Indies cruises thirteen more ports
wvill se the "Duchess of Bedford," and on the
iwo summer cruises of the "Empress of
Autralia" to Norway there are fifteen foreign
ports of call. So there will be a total of 75
foreign ports which will get to know of Canada
through these Canadian Pacifie cruise ships.
The new "Empress of Britain," a 42,000-ton
liner embodyin.g the very latest improvements
in ocean passenger ships, is expected to prove
a grear a--et to this country in drawing traffic
through the St. Lawrence seaway, and the
news of it- construction, launching, and superb
accommodation has already advertised Canada
and the Canadian Pacifie throughout the
world.
All thee means of publicity represent the
titribution throughout the world of a con-idtable volume of information about Canada
and tl -tinulation of interest in the country.
Iight Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable senators, at the risk of being
v otd a nuisance, I am going to claini the
attention of the Senate for a short time. In
the first place I want to congratulate mY
honourable and honoured friend from De Salaherry (Hon. Mr. Béique) for the service that
he has rendered to us and the country at large
in 'resenting what has scmed to me to bc a
wondvrfully -pectacular show.

JUNE 10, 1931
My honourable firiend has kindly alluded
to me at times and intimnafed that he ljked
me best when 1 was giving reminiscences.
Well, if lie will provoke reminiscences lie will
have to shoulder a portion of the responsibility for them. As I remember, it was
about flffy-one years ago that, as a Young
man., I was one day aftracfed to the gallery of
thie buse of Commons by the announcement
that Sir Charles Tupper infended to infroduce
a Bill witli Teference to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway and the mardi of 'transportation
fowards the Pacifie. I had a comparatively
unoccupîed brain, witli no parficular affiliations. As I sat in the gal'lery and listened
wifh an open mind f0 Sir Chiarles Tupper's
long speech, which, 1 believe, lasted some
six boucs, I had varying sensations. At first
my thouglit was, "What is lie letting us in
for?" The projeet was so immense and our
resources at that time were to such an extent
unknown and to sucli a stili greater extent
undeveloped that I wondered whetier the
burden that if was apparently intended f0
impose could be borne 'by this Young country.
So my reaction f0 the first pairt of the speech
was rather unfavourable. But at the end of
the speech I had to con-fess myself a complete
convert to the magnificent proposition that
had heen unfolded. My first aanbifious speech
in tic Huse of Commons was delivered, some
years laVer, in -support of a loan f0 the Canadian Pacifie Railway. Afferwards, for a fime,
I was strongly impressed with 'the possibilify
of tic failure of the vast underfaking, but as
to tiat I had only one conviction, that once
the project had been begun we must support
if. I was an earnest and somewliat efficient
advocafe of the second boan, as of flie
first.
I remember well a doughty opponent of mine,
on the other side of the bouse, madea
prophecy-and prophecies were cheap at that
timebon. Mr. CASORAIN: They are yet.
Riglit bon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
-that I would neyer sec a sufficient return
of interest or principal in connection with
that loan to tlie Canadian Pacific to pay one
year's indemnity on my buse of Com-mons
service. Well, things have -happened since
then. I arn not going to take up the fime of
h-onourable members witli recounfing tlie
various phases flirougli whici Vhis great project lias gone; if is enougli Vo say that in it
and tlirougli it Canada, as well as the
Canadian Pacifie Railway, lias been amply
justifled. This is flot simply a railway; if has
developed great subsidiary activities. If is
said fliat corporations are soulless. Well, I

205

think that if one corporation more than
anotier can lay dlaim Vo the possession of a
soul, the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company,
wif h ail ifs enterprises, can do so wifi the
approval of aIl Canadians. The road has iad
a series of great promoters and managers, who
have liad imagination as well as a practical
sensýe of wiat could be effectively undertaken
and carried out from fime to fime.
One who reviews tic history of fthe Canadian
Pacific Railway Company is inevitably impressed by tie multifarious agencies whicli it
lias nurfured into an enterprising vitality,
ail fending- to the dev elopment of the country
and consequentially to tic prosperity and
permranency of t he road if self. I have travelled
somewiat extensively, and af no place in the
world that I have visited have I failed Vo
meef enferprising and successful agents of tlie
Canadian Pacific Railway, wlio whilst primarily engaged in the inferests of fliat road,
have also been extending the good reputafion of tie Dominion of Canada. The
Canadian Pacifie Railway lias been successfuI in identifying if self witli Canada and
working for the development of Vhis country
in all the phases of ifs world enterprise. So
fhe magnificent. record of undertakings and
activities which lias been set before us this
afternoon by my honourable friend merifs
our admiration and demands our approval and
gratitude.
The Company lias been subjeet to criticism. It lias met that criticisma witli action
and lias relied upon resuits Vo justify if in the
long run. Ifs justification, I Vhink, is now
recognized, and I believe ifs future will continue to lie marked by fliaf particular feature.
We have anof ler railway system in Vhia
country, and whilst I extend my congratulafions f0 rny lionourable friend, I wanf f0 say
that I do flot take any back seat wlien if
cornes to supporfing our own Canadian National Railway System. Had Canada's hands
been free, Canada would probably not have
taken over the sysfem; neverflieless, in flie
progression of events, this great and mulfifanions enferprise lias been adopted by this
country, To this enterprise I remain loyal
and truc, and whilst I give to the Canadian
Pacifie Railway my admiration and my best
wislies for its confinued dcvelopment and success, and consequenfly our continucd development and success, I stili stand by fie other
railway system, our own, f0 whicli wc sliould
lie loyal, and whicli we siould reasonably
and practicaily support and uphold.
Honourable members will excuse me for
taking the finie of tie bouse in Vhis manner.

JUNE 10, 1931
physical differences which would affect operation costs. In any event, the law of inereasing rcturns should operate under these
conditions in favour of the Canadian National
Railways, as they are doing the larger volume
of business.
For the sake of convenience
I have adopted a ratio of 1,000 to 800; in
other words, the different comparable items
of operating expense of the Canadian National
Railways and the Canadian Pacifie Railway
should vary. in this way. That is to say, the
Canadian National Railways would be justified in spending $1,000 where the Canadian
Pacifie Railway would spend $800.
iNow, the governing factors in arriving at
this datum point, or index figure, are the
inilcage and the business done. There are
other factors, but those are the two principal ones. I repent: the mileage of the
Canadian National Railways is 28,200; the
mileage of the Canadian Pacifie Railway is
20,651. 1 am dealing with the actual mileage,
which in.chîdes double tracking and yard
trackage-the whole of their mileage. With
r egard to the freight carried in 1929, I
find that for that year the Canadian National
Railways carried 55,338,665 tons, and the
Canadian Pacifie Railway earried 38,221,961.
Those are the main figures which I use for
the purpose of getting my datum poinit, if
you like to caîl it that, or my index figure,
which I fix at '1,000 for the Canadian National
Railways and 800 for the Canadian Pacifie
Railway.
I will now read to you the net operating

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is, due to the
publie, or including everything?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Everything. As
I said in my opening statement, the general

In 1930 the interest charges had grown to

The references arc as follows:
Canada Year' Book, 1930, page 641, and the
Annual Report of the Canadian National Railway System for the year endcd Decesuber
31, 1930.

Now I corne to the comparative statements
which are the foundation of my observations.
I will read the statements and comment on
them afterwards. I have before me a comparison of details of Transportation Expenses.
Canadian National Railways and Canadian
Pacifie Railways, 1929. First is the item;
then in the first column is the Canadian
National Railway expenditure; in the second
eoluman the Canadian Paeifie Railway expenditure; and in the third column, having used the
index figure or datum point, 1 show the aanount
which the Canad-ian Pacifie Railway management would spend ifor the same service if
instead of spending $80 they spent $100; in
other words, it is the amount the Canadian
Pacifie Railway would spend if they had the
mileage and the business of the Canadian
National Railways.
I will elaborate these
figures later on. Hlere is the comparison:

Let me explain again that the third column
shows what the expenditures would have been
under C.P.R. management, on the basis of
their actual expenditures, if they had the
saine mileage and the.same amount of busine« as the Canadian National Railways.
According to this statement, the Canadian
Pacifie management would probably have
saved the Canadian National Railways $2,980.025.38.
The next statement is a comparison of
tic ta ils of General Expenses, Canadian National
Railways and Canadian Pacifie Railway, 1923.

That was the year of the consolidation. I
repeat that I am dealing with comparable
items only, and that a comparison of the
third column of figures with the first column
indicates what would have been the probable
saving to the Canadian National Railways
if they had been under Canadian Pacifie
management. And I point out again that these
figures are prepared in accordance with the
standard method of railway accounting. The

These items are brought to a conclusion
an! totalled hcre.
The Canadian National
Railways expenditure, excluding traffie expenses, is $71,157,290; the arnount that tbe
Canadian Pacifie Railway mangeinent would
have spent if they had the saine mîleage and
did the samne business would have been $57,390,400; so t here wvould have been a probàble
sax ing in 1929 of $13,766,890. The comparative
items of expense of the Canadian National
Railway Systern are taken fromn the Canadian
Nationlal statement of railway opcrating expenses. I would draw atitention to the fact
that theïr operating expenses in 1929, excluding traffic costs, were $217,223,886, and of
thai amount I have found that I could properly and reasonably compare only certain items

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Is it the argument of
the honourable gentleman that the remainder

National Railways?
Hon. Mr. GRIISBACH: I can express no
opinion as to that.

I conclude the statements by reading one
of net railway revenues for the first four
months of 1931, and newspaper clippings attached. The net revenue of the Canadian
National Railways for the first four months
of 1931 was S993,351; that of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway for the same period was
84,505,751.
The decrease in the earnings of
the Canadian National Railways, according
to these clippings, was in that period $5,846,559; in the narniings of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway it was $1,067,232.
That is a very
striking contrast.

that these companies have.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before my honourable friend passes on, would he permit me to
ask if he has a comparative total of all the

grand total comparison?

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I could net do
that. It is beyond my capacity.
The Board of Directors of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway are prominent and influential
men in Canada; they have been successful in
their own businesses; for the most part they
are heads of large organizations and own or
represent large blocks of stock in their respective companies, and are able te influence

a couple of hours to be persuaded that the
management of a great transportation system
by Parliament, even remotely, is out of the
question.
The C.P.R., although privately owned, :s
in effect a national enterprise. It is closely
interwoven with the financial and industrial
life of the country. So much is this the fact
that it is commonly stated that the condition
of this railway is a business barometer in
Canada. In our desire to make the Canadian National Railways a success, by the
spending of hundreds of millions of dollars,
we should be very careful not to create such
a condition of unfair competition as to comDromise seriously the future stability of the
?.P.R.
I should like to emphasize what I said at
the outset, that enormous sums of public
money have been spent on the Canadian National Railway System. Our present investment is close to the three billion dollar mark.
From the comparative statements that I have
presented honourable members may be ablk
to draw some conclusions as to the manner in
which much of that money has been spent.
Can it be denied that the expenditure of this
huge total of public funds has resulted in
unfair competition with our other great national system, the Canadian Pacifie Railway?
There is grave danger that in supporting the
principle of government ownership we may
end by making a failure not only of the Canadian 'National Railways, but of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway as well.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Writers on government and municipal ownership many years
ago pointed out that one of the dangers of
public ownership was the fact that under such
a system there would be a large number of
einployees whose voting strength might prove
tu be a factor in any discussion involving the
enterprise. We have precisely that situation
to-day. The vote of the employees of the
Canadian National Railways is in many constituencies a determining factor, and any
discussion of the merits of the question is
beclouded or side-tracked, especially at election time, by the influence of this vote. The
dangers inherent in such a situation must be
apparent to all. I think it is not necessary
to labour that aspect. I do not know how
many employees there are in the Canadian
National Railway System. Perhaps the honcurable the Minister of Labour can give me
that information.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There are 89,000 just now.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In the Canadian
National Railways?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Well, nearly
sixty per cent of them are laid off at present.
Perhaps it would be safe to say that in
normal times there are 150,000 employeesHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is, on both
railways?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am speaking
only of the Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: About 89,000
now, and just about 105,000 a few years ago.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We will put it
at 100,000 in normal times. Most of them
are heads of families, and they represent a
substantial vote in many constituencies of
the country. They resent any suggestion that
the Canadian National is not a good railway,
or that the people of Canada should not
continue to stand behind it. As I have
already said, this sentiment exerts a powerful
influence at election times and there is
a danger that the influence may result in
the continuation of a situation which should
be very seriously questioned. I am inclined
to think that now is the time to question
the whole matter. I am certainly not in
favour of postponing the discussion until the
next election. For that reason I have taken
the liberty of bringing these figures to the
attention of the House to-day.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
senators, my only reason for rising to say a
few words at this time is that I think parts
of the discussion, particularly some of the
remarks of my honourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), have not
been quite fair to the Canadian National
Railways. It has often been said, and no
doubt with truth, that comparisons are odious,
but my experience has been that business
men sometimes find much benefit to be derived from occasional comparisons with other
businesses of the same class. However, it
seems to me that the comparisons that have
been made by the honourable gentleman
from Edmonton are of very little account.
Everybody knows that the C.P.R. was originally built as one great line from the Atlantic
to the Pacifie, and it has always been managed and operated, as my honourable friend
has pointed out, by directors and officials
whose efficiency and loyalty cannot be excelled. From time to time the management

of the road has built feeders and branches
which it was considered would add to the
profits of the company. Now, the circumstances in the other case are entirely different.
The Canadian National Railways were taken
overHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Went bankrupt.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: -by the Government,
because of the failure of individuals to
operate successfully the conglomeration of
roads that they had built. Instead of one
line that had been constructed to operate as a
single unit, there were a number of lines
that had been designed to operate in competition one against the other. The result
is that to-day we find the Canadian National
operating competing lines, such as the old
Grand Trunk Pacifie and the old Canadian
Northern. Similar conditions prevail from
one end of the system to the other. Now, I
am sure my honourable friend does not mean
to tell us that we can fairly compare a uni-

fied roa.d like the C.P.R. with a number of
roads like those we find under one management in the Canadian National.
Let us
consider for a moment the Canadian National
line that runs from Quebec to Cochrane, for
example. The country through which it
travels is sparsely populated, but this line has
to be manned in many respects as heavily as
the line that runs from Montreal through a
comparatively well populated territory to
Port Arthur and on to the Pacific coast. When,
some years ago, we took over the operation
of the roads that run through northern Quebec and northern Ontario, they served a very
small population. By 1923-and I mention
that year because it is one of the years on
which my honourable friend has based his
comparison-the population had increased
somewhat, but it was considerably less than it
is now. I am sure that, as time goes on,
these districts will become more and more
thickly peopled. I feel confident that honourable members agree that the figures presented
by my honourable friend constitute, at the
best, a very poor basis of comparison of the
operating expenses of the two railway systems.
I suppose there are very few persons in
Ontario who travel on our railways more than
I do. I do not pretend to be a railroad
man, but I have been engaged in different
businesses that are extensive users of railroao
freight services. I know that when Sir Henry
Thornton took over the management of the
Canadian National the lines in places with

which I am familiar were in an extremely bai
condition. The so-called railways were only
tracks, and there was no loyalty among the
employees.
He lias instilled into the employeesHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: An esprit de corps.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: -a spirit of loyalty
no surpassed by that of the officers and men
of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
My obsorvation is-and I should like te make it
clear that I am a strong admirer of the Canadian Pacific Raiivav-that at tie present
time neither of our roads is being operated
more efficiently than the other. I think that
bothi are under first-class management.
At
this period, when the co'untry is depressed,
when the, railroads are not paying, when the
hotels are not paying, when nothing is paying,
is it a good policv to make charges-for that
is what I consider have been made here today-against the management of this corporation, which I believe is being well served by
its officers? I believe that the business of
the Canadian National Railways is handled
as efficientiv as that of any railroad in the
vorld.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable senators, I desiie to call to the attention of the
right
honourable the junior member for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) a
;oint which he oer
elooked-urnintentionally, I
am sure-rn his interesting reminiscences of
the early davs of the Canadian Pacifie Railwav Company. The point is that that coinpany introducel a new principle into the
financial conduct of railways, not only in Canada, but all over this continent, namely, that
the profits, not merelv from the railway itself,
but fromi everything connected with it, should
eiure to the benefit of the shareholders of
the road and to no one else. Formerly it had
no been uiconnion for persons closely connetted with the management of a railroad to
operate steinships, telegraph lines, or elevat ors. A friend of Sir William Van Horne,
whomi soime of us here have known, stated
thait he and Sir William were both juniors in
a raia
company that ran from Chicagolion. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Milwaukee.
Hon. Mn. MeLENNAN: -and

iand over again Sir William had said, with
characteristi gestures, "If I ever have control
of a railroad, the shareholders will get every
dollar of profit there is in it." And when he
did have a say in the control of a railroad he

JUNE 10, 1931
was backed up in this sentiment by his president and by important directors. I think
whenever one is dealing with the history of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway that should be
credited to the early management of the road.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators, I
desire to congratulate the honourable senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) utpon
the statements that he has presented. I do
not quite agree with the contention of the
honourable gentleman from Nipissing (Hon.
Mr. Gordon) that the expenses of the two
roads are not comparable. I am quite willing
to admit that it is almost impossible to arrive
at a basis for an accurate comparison of railway figures, but I believe that if honourable
members will read in Hansard the tables presented by the honourable gentleman from
Edmonton they will find that as to the items
with which he deals be -has made a comparison
that may be very useful to this House and the
whole country. Now, I am sure aH honourable
members are anxious for the success of the
Canadian National Railways. I do not think
for a moment that the honourable gentleman
from Edmonton had in mind any desire to
discredit the nationally owned system, but
it seems to me that every mermiber of Parliament has a right to criticize extravagances in
the expenditure of public moneys.
Hon. MS. GASGRAIN: Espeoially in the
Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Yes. We are economical
down t.here and we believe in criticizing overexpenditure. I do not believe that in any
branch of government more money has been
wasted than on the Canadian National Railways. After all, it is a branch of Government.
I agree that there is among the employees on
tbat railway to-day an esprit de corps that
did not exist before the present management.
That is an excellent thing. But from one end
of the country to the other we have railway
hotels that are not payingHon. Mr. STANFIELD: The politicians are
to blame more than the management.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: -and will never pay in
the lifetime of any member of this Chamber.
Money is still being spent in constructing
hotels. Those expenditures should not be
made, and would be stopped forthwith if this
Parliament did its duty. While I admire the
good work that has been done by the management of the Canadian National Railways, I
say without doubt that the management has
been and is extravagant. And this is not to
be wondered at, because the management has
been able to rely, in the almost total absence
of criticism, upon tihe full financial resources

215

of the Dominion of Canada, and because the
Board of Directors have not had to risk their
business reputations when considering the
budgets for the system. Could anyone who
had the same opportunity of calling on an
unlimited purse withstand the temptation to
be extravagant?
I intend to study the figures that have been
presented this afternoon more closely than
I was able to do when listening to them. As
I have already said, I believe the comparisons
that were made will be very useful to this
House.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I trust the figures will
be brought to the attention of a committee
of the other House, to whom, I believe, they
would be very useful. Whether the Canadian
National Railways have a longer mileage than
the Canadian Pacific, and whether a large
percentage of that mileage is not revenue producing, it is an important fact that we have
in the system an investment of more than two
billions of dollars and we are paying annual
interest charges of 380,000,000 or $90,000,000.
A further important fact is that almost all
departments of the system-whether the railroad itself, or the hotels, or the steamshipsare not breaking even.
In this connection I may say that I saw
in an Ottawa paper not long ago a statement
to the effect that certain hotels of the Canadian National System were paying, but right
there, in black and white, were figures that
proved the opposite. That kind of deceitI do not think tt is intentional, and I withdraw that word-that kind of misrepresentation is the worst thing that can happen, because any person reading such a statement
might think that five hotels are paying and
seven or eight are not, whereas the figures
show that not one of them was paying its
way last year, and that some of them lost
enormous sums of money.
I submit that with these facts in our minds
we ought, as the representatives of the Canadian public, to consider very seriously any
thoughtful statements put before us, such as
the one submitted by the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griqsbach).
I can only say that I hope each and every
member will read that statement and digest
it. Then perhaps our idea of the management will be different from what it is at
present. Is it not a significant fact that in
another place question after question has been
asked as to the amounts paid in salary, not'
to the head of the whole system, but to the
heads of its various departments, yet the
question has been side-tracked every time?

216

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Did the shareholders of the Canadian Pacifie Railway ever
get such figures?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do not know, but
every shareholder of the C.P.R. has a right
to ask for the information.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It has always been
refused, for forty years.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do not believe it can
be refused legally.
They may succeed in
their refusal, but whether they do or not, I
say that the people of Canada, who own the
Canadian National System and pay the
expenses of it, have a right to know what it
costs to run it, and how many hundreds of
thousands of dollars are being paid to the
beads of its departments, or, for that matter,
to the heads of any departments of the
Government. They have a right te know,
and they do know, wvhat a Minister of the
Crown receives; thev have a right to know,
and do know, what a Deputy Minister is
paid; and they have an equal right to know
what is paid to the head of the Canadian
National Railway System or any of its departments, or to other emnployees of our railway.
The faut that such information is not given
to us, that it has been refused us year in and
year ont, is a pretty clear indication that too
much noney is going into overhead, and I
say that if no other comparison is worth having, one giving the relative costs of the head
office staffs of the Canadian National Railways and the Canadian Ptcific Railway is
w,1l worth consideration by this House.
HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
REPORT OF SPECIAL CONMITTEE-DEBATE

ADJOURNED

The Senatu proceeded to the consideration
ofi the Report of the Special Conmittee to
whon was referred Bill E, an Act with respect
to loS-pital sweepstakes.
Hon. G. H. BARNARD:
Honourable
member.
since this Bill received its sccond
rcading and this Ordur was placed on the
Order Paper, I have received a good many
comnunications, sone in favour of and sono
against the neasure. One in particular, which
was sent to the members of this House, I
think as a circular, was signed by Commissioner James Hay of the Salvation Army in
Toronto, and as it probably sunmarizes most
of the arguments which will be adduced
against the passage of the Bill, I will deal
with one or two statements contained in it.
Hon. Mr. flLACK.

The first objection raised by the Commissioner is that the passage of this Bill will
have the effect of drying up the wells of
charity. I will quote the language of the
Commissioner, because it is much more
picturesque than any that I could use. He
says that "it is prostituting the noble quality
enjoyed by most Canadians, wherein we listen
to the call of need and freely give of our
ability."
It seems to me that there is a
very short answer to that contention.
In
reply I would say that if every hospital in
the country were supplied with ail the means
that it could by any possible stretch of the
imagination require for the carrying on of its
work, there would still be thousands upon
thousands of avenues through which the
charitable would be able te exercise the noble
quality of listening to the call of need and
freely giving, and not the least of those would
be the institution of which the gentleman who
writes this letter is a very worthy official.
The next proposition-and this is the gist
of the vlieI opposition to the neasure, I
taku il-is that it would encourage the spirit
of gambling in this country-a country whomo
the stock exchanges are open six days a week
for the purpose, largely, of enabling the public
to ganble in stocks on margin; where the whuat
pit is open six days in the week for the purpose of allowing the public te gamble in wheat;
where continuously for five or six months
in the year the race tracks are open,
from which the provinces take a purcentage
of the monev that goes through the buttina
machines; wlec ru every newspaper from Halifax to Vancouver publishes daily the forin
charts of the different horses, the betting odd:,
the advence information as to entries, and
the results, al for the purpose of giving the
public full information to enable then to bct
intelligently, if yen liku-or otherwise if y&u
îlo net. I say that to prohibit a person from
buying one, two, three, or half a doz"n lottery
tickets in the corse of a year, in such a
country, is suîruly straining at a gnat and
-wailowing a caniel.
Sene people take great objection to betting.
To my mind betting in itself is not wrong
unlcs the consequence of it is to impoverish
the person naking the but. I think I can
demonstrate to the House that certain bets are
not only not wrong, but are highly prudent
and praiseworthy. Who in this House would
say that it is a reprehensible act for a
traveller who is about to take a journey to
pay fifty cents for an insurance ticket in
addition to the prieu of his railway ticket?
Yet what is the transaction but a but of
$5,000 on the part of the insurance company
to fifty cents on the part of the traveller that

JUNE 10, 1931

217

he will not be in-jured? Who would say that
there is anything wrong or imprudent in a
man putting fire insurance on his house? If
he buys a policy of $1,000 on his house, the
transaction, analyzed, is nothing more nor less
than a bet that within twelve months of the
payment of the premium his house will not
burn down, the odds being the face value of
the policy as against the premium. I think
my legal friends will bear me out when I say
that it is not very many years ago that the
'ourts were inclined to hold-and did hold,
if I am not mistaken-that an insurance contract was contrary to the Betting Aot, being a
wagering contract. I am glad to say that since
that time the courts have seen some light.
Now, what is the situation? The hospitals
in my province are virtually starving for want
of money, and I doubt very much that they
are better off in other parts of Canada; certainly they are not in the more sparsely
populated parts. I have here a sheaf of telegrams, with which I am not going to weary
the House unless someone wishes to hear
them read, from eleven or twelve different
hospitals in the Province of British Columbia,
all asking for the passage of this measure.
There are thousands upon thousands of
dollars going out of this coun.try every year
for sweepstake tickets. Why should we not
divert the flow of that money to our own uses,
particularly as it is contributed by people who
might in the ordinary course of events give
nothing of their own accord to our hospitals
at home? Whatever the fate of this Bill, the
condition I have mentioned is not going to
change, the simple reason being that the
people of the country want these sweepstakes.
Otherwise they would not be spending their
money on them. Why, as honourable members
of this House know perfectly well, in practically every social club from Vancouver to
Halifax there are at least two or three
sweepstakes a year, all contrary ta the
Criminal Code; and the other day we had the
edifying spectacle of a high official in this
country, a high judicial official, winning a
prize in one of those sweepstakes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman lowered his voice as he was finishing his remark.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: A high judicial
official won a prize in one of these sweepstakes.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: That does not mean
a judge.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
Not necessarily.
To show how general is this desire for
lotteries, sweepstakes, gambling, or whatever you like ta call it, I may mention an
incident that occurred the other day. I went
into a store on Sparks street ta buy something, which I will mention with bated breath
because of the delicate susceptibility of some
of my listeners. I do not like ta mention it,
but I wanted a pair of garters.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: We did not hear the
latter part of the last sentence.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Before my honourable friend stops, would he
give some information ta lay members as ta
what a sweepstake is, and how it is operated?
I am puzzled.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Innocence abroad!
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

knows more about it than you do.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I was shown a pair
taken out of a very fine brass-bound cedar
box. The garters were worth fifty cents, and
the box was worth five dollars, and the
proprietor of the store said: "If you buy a
pair of these, you may win the box, because
when the last pair is sold out of the box we
draw, and whoever has the lucky number gets
the box." I took a chance, but I didn't get
the box.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Did you get the garters?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I got the garters.
Now, as I say, whatever the fate of this
Bill, this practice is going ta continue. By
killing the Bill you do not stop the people
from buying sweepstake tickets, but by passing
it you legalize a custom that is general in the
country and will provide ample funds for
what are considered by all ta be necessary
and deserving institutions.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I think my right
honourable friend is quite well aware of what
a sweepstake is. He is really altogether too
intelligent to bc unable to understand it. He
has perhaps a far better idea of it than I have
myself.
I beg to move the adoption of the report.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable members, I was absolutely serious
in asking my honourable friend for information. A Bill is brought in to establish
sweepstakes to assist hospitals. I do not
know just what a sweepstake is, or how it is
operated. If my honourable friend were
properly sympathetic he would give us from
his practical knowledge and his evident intimate co-operation with this animal, whatever
it may be, information that would help us to
come to a conclusion as to the nature of the
gamble. But, as he prefers to let me go my
own way, I shall have to approach this subject
without the information; and in some respects
that throws me into the discard. Probably
other members of the Senate have from their
own practical experience been able to come to
a conclusion which satisfies them.
I think that the situation as we come to view
it at the present time is a little unfortunato,
because of the speed with which the measure
introduced by my honourable friend was
passed through the different stages up to its
reference to a special committee. My honourable friend has correctly stated that this Bill
has been given the second reading, but I am
certain that it did not receive the attention
which it should have received at that stage.
Not only did it get the second reading, but
it probably would have had the third reading
had not His Honour the Speaker put a
motion for reference to a committee. My
honourable friend was then stricken by conscience, or something of that kind, and
apparently thought it would be better to
transfer some of the responsibility to a committee.
Now, it seenùs to me that this Bill introduces a principle which we should not approve without very careful consideration. I
intend to examine the matter, even though I
have to take up a littie time in doing so. I
shall not deal only with the phase referred to
in the letter which my honourable friend
read, from the representative of the Salvation
Army. I do not agree that the question ought
to be decided out of regard only for the principle referred to in the protest of the Salvation Army, and by the different churches or
societies that have expressed disapproval of
Hon. Mr. CASCRATN.

the measure, for I think we should consider it
upon a wider basis than that.
My first point is that the Bill proposes to
reverse the legal position in which lotteries
have been placed virtuadlly since Confederation. That position is defined by the Criminal
Code. Now a Bill which seeks to make such
a change as that is by no means unimportant,
and demands very careful thought. The assumption in favour of the Bill at first was
that the revenues from sources that had been
relied upon for the support of hospitals in
British Columbia were no longer sufficient.
It was understood that neither the Provincial
Government nor the municipal authorities
would increase their grants, and that private
subscriptions were not large enough to provide for the adequate maintenance of hospitals; and, further, that the proportion of
patients able to pay for the services they
reeeived was diminishing. I was curious as to
whether this was the opinion simply of my
honourable friend, or of the general supporters of hospital work in British Columbia.
I do net know that up to the present moment
a single petition has been presented in this
louse supporting this opinion. We have heard
from no hospital, no municipality, no governmental administrator.
My honourable friend presented a Bill
which. had it been passed, would have i liminated from the Criminal Code the only barrier
against lotteries of all descriptions in any industry, trade or society. I am sure that if
honourable members had realized that this
was one of the objects of the Bill they would
hav.e hesitated before agreeing to 'the second
reading. Now, the committee has recommended that the barrier should be lifted only
for British Columbia, in so far as it suits the
purposes of that province to arrange a lottery
system for its hospitals.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I am sure the right
honourable gentleman does net wish to misstate facts.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
do not wish to do that.

I

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: In the first place,
the Bill is not confined only to British
Columbia; and in ·he second place, notwitht
standing the section which was amended by
the committee, if the original Bill had carried,
lotteries other than hospital lotteries would
still have been illegal in Canada.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: As
I read the Bill, that section of the Criminal
Code which prevents lotteries would have
been completely eliminated.

JUNE 10, 1931
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: There was to be
complete elimination of a section which
allows an informer to sue the winner for the
prize. That was ail. The law regarding the
holding of lotteries in Canada would have
remained precisely the same as it is now,
except with regard to hospital lotteries.

Then my honourabla friand from Hamilton
argues in this way: "I have a certain amount
of taxes to pay, and the tax-gathering authorities say to me, 'If y-ou pay your taxes on
Monday you will gat a certain discount.' Do

Ivas a slight clerical change made in the Bill
after it camne fromn the House of Commons.
On page 1, lina 7, we struck out the words
"1may be," which our new acting law officer
considered to be ungrammatical, and we substituted the words "bas been." The bonourable
the senior membar for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) suggestad substituting those words,
and I1 acceded to hais suggestion, because it
was axactly in accordance with my opinion. It
turms out, upon reference, that the Frencb
version of the Bill is quita correct, cuntaining
as it (loes the words "ýou a été," and that the
amendment that we made should apply only
to the English version. The Bill is now in
the hands of the Clark of the House, as Clark

COPYRIGHT BILL
SECOND

READING

Hlon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the second reading of Bill 4, an Act to amend the
Copyright Act.
He said: Honourable members, the leader
of the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), the
honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) and myseif had a consultation
as to speeding up the passage of the Copyright Bill. It is known to every member of
the House, I think, that it is highly desirable
that this Bill should be passed immediately,
so that it may receive the Royal Assent and
corne into force in time to permit of Canada's
adherence to the Rome Convention by the
fir.st of next month, and there should be no
delay whatever, if it is possible to avoid it.

SENATE
I may add that the fact that honourable
gentlemen who have objections to clauses of
the Bill have waived the right to raise those
objections now does not prevent them from
being taken up at another session, when the
matter can be brought before us at an earlier
stage.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I do not wish to
interfere with the speeding up of the adoption
of this Bill, but I think that we are entitled
to a short explanation from the leader of the
House as to the principal features of the proposed measure.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Honourable members,
I am not at all sure that I should like to be
called upon to deal with this Bill at the
present time. I do not desire to interfere
with or block business in any way, but this is
a very important and very controversial Bill,
and I should like to have a little time to
study it before being called upon to render
a decision upon it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I can only
suggcst, in answer to my honourable friend,
that if we were to discuss the Bill to-day it
would be impossible to take advantage of the
presence of the Acting Governor General when
ho comes here for the purpose of giving the
Royal Assent.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is the intention to
take up the whole subject early next session.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
ning of the session.

At the begin-

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
Perhaps this Bill
should be allowed to go through as it is,
on the understanding that at the beginning of
next session we shall take up the subject by
introducing a Bill in this House. Several
amendments should be made to the Act, but
to go into that matter now would be to
defeat the object which the honourable
leader of the House bas in mind.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is impossible
to go into it now.
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, this Bill, providing amendments to
the Copyright Act, is -a very important one.
The main object which the Secretary of
State has had in mind has been the passage
of certain amendments which would permit
Canada te adhere to the Rome Convention.
The other House appointed a special committee, who gave considerable study to this
matter. My view is that though the measure
is a forward step for the protection of authors,
it leaves them in a very weak position in
the event of their finding it necessary to
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

establish their rights before the courts. I
have heard complaints on both sides of the
ocean regarding the laxity of our legislation
in protecting the rights of authors, and I find
that this Bill does not afford them sufficient
protection. I had intended, and so had my
honourable friend from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Beique) and perhaps some other honourable members, to bring forward some amendment to provide sanctions giving greater protection to the beneficiaries of this measure.
But we were faced with this difficulty. In
the first place, it is necessary that our adherence to the- Convention should reach Rome
not later than the 1st of July, and cousequently we are left with very little time to go
seriously into the matter.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And the chief object
should be to have our ratification reach there
in time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That is the
Government's principal object.
If we entered into a minute discussion of the Bill,
clause by clause, we might prevent the
realization of that object. Furthermore, it
bas been intimated that if we more amendments to provide sanctions for the protective
features of the Bill we shall undoubtedly encounter hostility from the other Chamber
and some time will be needed to reconcile
many of the members of that Chamber to
[fiese amendments; also that the Government
will not undertake to sponsor in that Chamber the amendments we should like to make.
The Canadian delegates attached their signatures to the Rome Convention last year. and,
as it is important that Canada should officially
signify its adherence within the time limit
that I have mentioned, my honourable friend
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique) and
I have decided not to oppose the passage of
this Bill. In taking this stand, however, we
declare that the Copyright Act needs an overhauling, and we hope that the necessary
amendments will be introduced next year by
the Government with a view to giving efficient
protection to authors, composers and producers.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honoirable senators.
I venture to add a few remarks to those inist
made byx my honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). While realizing that it is cessary ro act in this matter as quickl
as pos-

sible. I humbly submit that we should not
uînduly delay Canada's official adherece to
the Rone Convention if we referred the Bill
to a special committce. That commîittee, could
sit to-morrow, and the passage of the Bill
would probably not be he!l u p more thn

vitally interested in the copyright problem,
and I venture to state that most of them will
be sorely disappointed if we do flot carry
sorne of the provisions of this Bill a step
farther. I therefore suggest that there should
be a reference to a special committee, which
could study the whole problem and, if necessary, hear evidence from interested parties.
By way of
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
answer to the honourable gentleman, I may
say that I happened to be a member of the
commi*ttee that considered a previous Copyright Bill that was before this House. The
copyright questicr is one of the most contentions of aIl matters that corne before
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUJE: And one of the most
difficult.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHIBY- That committee to which I arn referring held a number of
sittings, and a great many persons interested
in the matter took advantage of the opportunity to express their opinions.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable senators, I wish to protest against the
proccdure that is suggested. I do not desire
to unduly delay the Bill at ail, but I have
received so much correspondence deaiing with
this subject that I should have liked a fuller
discussion.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LE MIEUX: We have not had
even the features of the Bill explained to us.
If, as my honourabie friend the leader of this
side (Hon. 'Mr. Dandurand) says, the principal object of the Bill is to confirm the
adherence of Canada to the Rorne Convention, I say aye. But if there are other proviin of importance in the Bill, I think it
is quite improper for the Senate simply to
register, without further consideration, its
approval of what the House of Commons
has done, even though a great deal of work
on the matter has been done by a committee
of that House.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
rcad the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third timc, and passed.

acquainting him that the Right Hon. F. A.

REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 2S, an Act t'o amend the
Bankruptcy Act (Priority of Clairna), and
move d concurrence therein.
He said: Honourable senators will remem.ber that at the time this measure was introduced here I explaîned briefly the principle
of it. The Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce recommends a few technical
amendments, which. do not affect the principle,
but merely make the wording of some clauses
a littie more grammatical. The Bill refers
solely to priority of dlaims.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. BLACK moved that the Bill be
piaced on the Order Paper for third readingto-morrow.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable senators,
I had intended to, present a number of amendments to this Bill, but I changed my mind
after reading the discussion on the measure
in another place, and particularly the statement of the honourable the MinisteT of
Justice that he wouid bring down a number
of amendments to the Bankruptcy Act at the
next session. However, it was suggested to
me that I should give to the flouse the text
of my proposais. I amn willîng to, do that,
and as I need to give further consideration
to some of the clauses, I suggest that the
third reading be postponed until next wcek.
Hon. Mr. BLA'CK: I arn quite agreeable
that the Bill should be put down for third
reading on Tuesday next, and I so move.
The motion was agreed to.

JUNýE 11, 1931
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: "Well," I said, "I
have flot got to the Bill yet," and, as 1 was
sincere, I was going to speak against -the Bill
and vote against it. What, had taken place
I do flot kinow, and 1 arn not sure that I care
to know. I arn giving you the faîcts, and they
eau be verifled by anyone who oeres to Iook
up Hansard.
So that you may appreciate the Bolshevik
peril, may I say that Bolsbevism is a monstrous political and social system whose aim is
the total destruction, by a worid-wide revolution, of the present social state, together with
its moral and religious ideas, and the creation
of a Communistic world based on materialism
and atheism. Any apparent deviation of this
aim is of a tactical order, caused by the necessity of gaining time or for the purpose of
deceiving us. The aim remains the samne,
the Bolishevisation of the world. Lenin himself declared it when hie said to his followers:
0Our victory in Russia will flot be complete
until the proletariat of the world has couquered power. We are doomed to perish if
revolution does flot break out in other countries.
AAt
this time, when distress is so great, the
Bolsheviks are making an extra effort. Sir
Wilfrid Laurier it was who said that hie knew
of no iadder sight than that of a man, able
and e ger to work, leaving Mis home to seek
emploý ment and not finding anytbing to do.
As bie walked through the city the noise and
activit;', perhaps better than alcobol, mnade
bim forget Mis hunger. At noon hie did not
return home, knowing that perbaps his wife
and children were dividing the last morsel
of bread among them, and at uight hie came
back weary and footsore, again to find the
children bungry. The good wif e, without any
sign of reproach, would meet him and teill
him that the childreu had had to go to bed
without supper. They resigned tbemseive-s
for that night. The next day prospects werc
no better. Imagine, honourable gentlemen,
the condition of a mean in sucb circusestances.
How would any of us feel if in our homes
there were nothing to give to our cbildren,
and this through no fault of our own? It is
then t.hat people are an easy prey to the
-Moscow agent. How does the unemployed
man feel wheu bie sees his former employer
passing by in a beautiful Rolîs Royce car, the
interest on the cost of which would keep
himself and bis family cosefortable for al
time? It is not bard ta understa-nd bis feeling of dissatisfaction and to realize that bie
wiIl easily fall into the bauds of any agitator
who bappens along. But there is sometbing
still worse than hunger, as the workers În
the Salvation Army or tbe St. Vincent

225

de Paul Society know.
The St. Vincent
de Paul Society is the Catholie Salvation
Army.
Wben, during One of Our winters,
they go into a house in which there is
no fuel, what do tbe poor people say? Tbey
de not complain so much about baving nothing to cat, but tbey say: "Can you give us
a littie coal or wood? That is wbat we want."
As soon as there is a littie heat in the bouse
tbcy seese to revive, and then tbcy ask for
food. When we are facing sucb a condition
of distress--and we shall probably face it next
wintcr-the Goverument and every one of us
should do everytbing possible to prevent the
terrible menace of Bolshevism.
Tbe Goverument of Russia pretends that
it bas notbing to do with the Third International. It bas organized wbat is called the
"Komintern." This word is an abbreviation
of two Russian words, namely, Kommunicheski Internationale. This organization was
created by Lenin bimself. As the Russian
Goverument cannot act in ail the countries of
the world, it maintains in these, at great expense, numerous agents. Thbis country, hionourable members, is swarming with these.
You do not know that they are bere; tbey
keep themselves well hiddcn. Neverthelcss,
they are pursuing incessantly and relentlessly
a formidable subterranean work of destruction, of which tbe great indifferent mass of
the public only perceives from time to time
somne indication, to which it gives but slight
passing attention. These agents spy, excrt
secret influence, buy consciences, create Coinminist celîs in tbe factories, workshops, banks,
industrial enterprises, tbe railways and State
administrations, and endeavour to sap ahl ideas
of honesty and morality, respect for parents
and marriage, patriotism and religion, ahl witb
a view of inciting everywbere hatred and
class war and fanning every discontent; in a
word, waging war against the internal security
of states and tbe principles of law-civil,
moral and religious-which lie at the foundations of tbe modern state.
Now listen to wbat bas taken place in
Spain. It may be tbougbt that it was just a
revolution against Alfonso XIII, 'but it was
nothing of the sort. It had been contemplated
by the Bolsbevists for a long time. I have
here a summary of what bappened, whicb
shows that tbe 'Communist International at
Moscow had been for sorne years preparing
for the Spanisb revolution.
In February, 19M, a delegation of the
Spanisb Communist Party presented itself
before the enlarged Executive Committee of
the Communist International at Moscow, and

22112-15
REVISSE EDITION

SENATE

26

it was decided that Spain should henceforth
be represented by two delegates on this conmittece.
In 1923, eight years ago, the Fourth World
Congress of the Communist International
met at Moscow and the Spanish delegates
declared that the Spanish Communist Party
was prepared for the struggle and was capable
of drawing the working classes into it. Eight
years ago was exactly the time when there
was so much rioting in Spain that King
Alfonso called Primo de Rivera and made him
a sort of dictator, a Mussolini, in Spain, and
with the support of the army, which remained
unaffected, he was able to keep order for six
or seven vears. If there is anything that will
keep the Communists quiet it is an army of
loyal troops well supplied 'with ammunition.
We talk of disarianient, but I think it would
be very imprudent for the countries near
Russia to think of disarming before they
know more about the power of the huge army
in Russia to-day.
The Communist International then began to
dictate its ordrrs to the Spanish Communist
Party and instructed it te draw in,to the
movement the anarcho-syndicalist elements as
classes and te rewel,l as the working
organize the party on the basis of factory
cells, with the result that the party became
exclusively proletarian.
In 1930 the party launched an appeal te the
workers, peasants and soldiers, calling on
nonarchy and
them to fight against the
capitalist regime and to establish a workers'
and peasants' government. The appeal urges
the party to show its revolutionary combativeness and its political maturity by placing itself at the hcad of the masses in the
great struggle which is approaching.
In July last the official organ of the Con
muni;t International at Moscow declared that
the influence of the Spanish Communist
Party among the masses was profound and
tîat the task of the moment was te organize
this influence among the different strata of the
working population and thus prepare the
ground for the victorious proletarian revolutien.
Now, let us consider the position of the
working man in Russia. I regret very much
that the Minister of Labour is net here.
Last night before he left the city I went te
his room and told him that I regretted he
was going to be absent, and that I would
refrain from any, disagreeable remarks about
him. The Minister of Labour, I know, is not
a Red-he is neither a Bolshevik nor a
Communist. He is a good, loyal citizen, and
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN.

means well. But, I ask, why do not the
labour leaders-and the MinisteT of Labour
is one of the greatest of thein-tell the people
the truth about the condition of the working
man in Russia? The order of the Soviet
Governnent, No. 374, dated the 23rd of
December, 1930, may be summarized as
follows:
First, there is no free labour market in
Russia. That does not need any explanation;
it means that a man cannot say, "I will work
He has no
here or I will work there."
choice; he must work where lie is told to
work by the Government.
Secondly, the employer, that is to say the
Government, ýalone has the right to choose
the kind of work and the factory in which the
worker will be engaged.
Thirdly, the Government fixes the place of
residence and the quarters of workers. A
man cannot live where he likes.
In the fourth place, if the worker refuses
to submit, the penalty imposed on him is
a sentence to bard labour.
Fifthly, there is no appeal possible against
the decision of the Government.
The sixth point is that these provisions also
apply to the workers on collective farms.
The seventl point is that there is no right
to strike. The right to strike is refused
absolutely. I should like to know what our
union people would think if they were told
that if we had this samne syste-m in Canada
the right to strike would bo refused. I think
that would be unpopular with labour unions,
and woild be especially objectionable to the
Minister of Labour.
The worker can procure the food and
clothes that lie needs for himself and his
family only by means of cards which may be
obtained from the employer, that is to say
the Government. I have here a letter which
was sent from Russia by a working man to
his cousin who works in a mine in Sydney,
"Stay in
The letter says:
Cape Breton.
Canada. Here in Russia you may work a
year te get a pair of boots, and then it is
doubtful that you will get them at the end
of the year." I have net time te read the
letter, but if any honourable member is
interested I shall be glad to show it.
Under the Soviet regime the worker has
become a serf, taxable and liable te forced
labour. The Government disposes of him as
it likes. The worker is no longer anything
but an inert portion of the mechanism of
the state, to be moved about or thrown aside
at the will of the dictators.
In the Gazette a couple of days ago the
Duchess of Atholl was quoted as saying that
the workers in Russia are absolute slaves.

JUNE 11, 1931
But really there is no comparison, because
the Russian workers are not even well fed.
The slaves in the Southern States were well
fed. Slavery was abolished only in 1864;
that is within my own lifetime. They were
kept as a good farmer keeps his stock, well
fed and well housed. Many slaves regretted
that they were given freedom. Those that
used to go down the Mississippi, for instance,
on those old boats of which we see so many
pictures, would say: "Why, we were better
under slavery. Now if a poor nigger falls
overboard nobody bothers to pick him up."
In the days of slavery a nigger was worth
from $1,500 to $2,000.
I do not think that any honourable member will deny that there is slave labour
in Russia.
Indeed, the workers there are
treated worse than slaves. Is it any wonder
that Russia can sell her goods very cheaply
when she does not have to pay for her
labour? That explains why at the great
exhibition at Milan the largest building there
is given over to the showing of the products
of Russia. The Russians were selling better
macaroni and spaghetti in Italy than the
Italians could make; macaroni as big as one's
thumb and spaghetti as thin as a piece of
thread. And they even sell razor blades in
Germany. It has always been thought that
the Germans were leaders in steel manufactures, but the Russians are underselling the
Germans right in Berlin. They also seli coal
to Pennsylvania and textiles to Lancashire.
These facts show what can be done with slave
labour. It is well known that the pyramids,
which we still admire thousands of years
after their erection, were built by slaves.
Who knows but that the rest of the world
would follow Canada if we were to say
simply that we did not wish to deal with
Russia? When the Right Hon. William
Stevens Fielding introduced the dumping
measure it was a new thing, but it hlas become
an international thing; so much so that the
word "dumping" is commonly used without
translation in France and has even been
adopted by the French Academy. Now, why
could not Canada lead the rest of the world
in a refusal to trade with Russia? There is
no reason why it should not do so.
The question of trade with Russia is at tha
present time occupying public opinion, and
it seems worth while just now to recall a
manner in tvhich this question should be
viewed. Whoever buys goods from Russia
does these things:
(a) He helps to provide the Russian Government with the funds which it needs in
order to maintain its diotatorship and to
finance revolution, in the purchasing country
as in others.
22112-5J

227

(b) He receives goods which are the outcome of confiscation, for it is well known
that the Soviets confiscated the money in the
banks and the savings of the people, and
lately they have even taken away the farms
from the Kulaks. It is because of this confiscated or stolen money that they are able
to compete with the rest of the world.
And whoever buys goods from Russia also
takes advantage of the exploitation of the
Russian people and aggravates the shortage
of food and other articles of prime necessity,
from which these people are suffering. We
remember that not xpany years ago the great
explorer Nansen led into Russia an expedition that was financed by funds from all over
the world, to prevent the starvation of Russian
people. But to-day those who buy goods
from Russia are actually depriving the people
of that country of the necessities of life.
On the other hand, whoever sells goods to
Russia, directly or indirectly, contributes to
the realization of the Five Year Plan,* a war
machine of which the workers will be the
first victims, and which is directed against
the economic prosperity of other nations. And
whoever extends credit to the Soviet Government has an interest in the maintenance
of that regime until he has been paid; and
lie may have that interest for a long time.
Further, it is by entering into apparently
normal commercial relations that the Soviet
Government has succeeded in introducing its
agents everywhere. As honourable members
will remember, those agents were in London
under the pretext of being engaged in commeroial relations, but, as was discovered when
Arcos House was raided, they were really
spying on Ris Majesty's subjects.
Any trade, therefore, with the Soviet Government, directly or indirectly, is immoral
and dangerous, as everyone who will think
over the points I have mentioned will agree
These Soviets are busy in Canada. Why,
when small boys and girls in Montreal come
out of school, if there is no policeman about,
they are shown obscene pictures.
The
curiosity of the children is aroused and they
say, "Give us some." On the back of each
picture there is printed some sort of Soviet
propaganda. The Soviet has a gospel, which
is called the A-B-C. The first question asked
in that is, "Who is Jesus Christ?" The
honourable senator from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) and I heard of that first in
Cape Breton, but I would not pollute the
walls of this Chamber by repeating the
answer we heard. I am speaking of something that happened not yesterday, but five
or six years ago, at the time when the Bolshevik agents of Moscow had got hold of a
lot of workers in Nova Scotia.
Honourable

SENATE

228

senators will remember that the Dominion
Government had to send troops down there
and keep them there for about six weeks.
The Bolsheviks were so well informed that
they knew exactly where they could do the
greatest damage most quickly. There was a
huge pipe, more than thirty inches in diameter, carrying water for the cooling of certain parts of the steel works, and that pipe
was blown up by dynamite inserted through
a manhole. The whole works would have
been ruined had it not been that fortunately
it was possible to pump in water from the
ocean. At that time $127,000,000 in actual
money were invested in those works.
It is easy to cite instances to show how well
posted the Soviet agents are. For example,
they wanted to select an engineer and approached Mr. Svenington, the Chief Engineer
of the Shawinigan Engineering Company in
Montreal. He is a very modest man, but one
of the best hydraulic engineers in the country.
When there were some defects in the plans of
the Gatineau River Power Development he
came up and helped to straighten things out.
If anyone in this House wanted to choose an
engineer in Russia I do not know how the
thing would be done, but these Soviets apparently know how to go about making a selection in this country. Mr. Svenington was
asked to go to Russia for only three months
and to name his own fee, which would be
deposited in a bank here; but he refused
to go.
The Russian agents went to Colonel Hugli
L. Cooper. I have spoken of him in this
House more than once. He is the man who
built the Keokuk dam on the Mississippi
river, and who reported to the United States
Government that the enlargement of the St.
Lawrence Waterways would cost not merely
$300,000,000 or $600,000,000, but $1,300,000,000.
Since lie made that report our engineers have
already raised their estimates from $300,000,000
to $600,000,000. Anyone knows how common it
is for estimates of this kind to be increased.
The Welland Canal was to have cost
$30,000,000, but we have now spent four times
Well, Colonel
that amount-$120,000,000.
Cooper insisted that lie would not leave for
Russia unless the Soviets deposited $100,000
in a bank in New York. They did se, and lie
went. Now lie has come back to America and
says we must trade with Russia; but Colonel
Cooper is being w.ell ,paid to make speeches
like that. As far as Keokuk dam is ,concerned,
the little Gatineau River Power Company
will be able to develop three times as much
power as can be got from the Keokuk dam.
Some honourable members visited the Gatineau
Hon. Mr. CAGRAIN.

plant a short time ago, on the invitation of
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Smeaton White).
I will now deal with the matter of religion
:nd Communism. Buharin, Lenin's right-hand
man, declared that "Religion and Communism are incompatible, both theoretically and
In other words, there is an
practically."
irreconcilable conflict between the principles
of Communist tacties and the commandments
of religion, so that no one can be consistently
both a Christian and a Communist. Communism excludes religion and logically involves atheism, and it is the strict duty of
all Communists to fight against ail religions.
Hence the very first article in the general
program of the Communist International. the
"Komintern," published by the "Inprekor,"
its official organ, in its issue of October 18,
1924 (German Edition), is to "fight against
religion." The total extirpation of religion is
therefore one of the essential political principles of Communism; the destruction of all
religious belief is a condition sine qua non
of the maintenance and spread of the Bolshevist power in Russia and in the world.
Consequently, any man who professes a
religious belief can only bc irreducibly opposed to Communism.
Hence in Russia ecclesiastics and laymen
who confess their faith are regarded by the
Soviet power as political adversaries, merely
on the ground of their religious convictions.
That is the real reason why believers are
executed, imprisoned or deported to concentration camps in northern Russia or Siberia,
where they wallow in filth, misery, hunger
and cold and perish by inches, carried off by
privations, sickness and torment.
The immediate suppression of Bolshevism
is the greatest of the problems which present
themselves at the present moment. Unless
Bolshevism is immediately extirpated it will,
in one form or another, spread throughout
Europe and the entire world. The aim of that
monstrous social and political system is the
Bolshevisation of the world, that is to say,
the total destruction by a sanguinary revolution of the present social state of the world,
including its moral and religious ideas, and
the creation of a Communistic world based on
materialism and atheism.
The Soviets are hoping for a world revolution. Lenin, on his accession to power, said
to his followers: "We are doomed to perish
unless revolution breaks out in other countries." Again, on the 13th March, 1919, lie
declarcd: "Our victory in Russia will not be
complete until the proletariat of the whole
world has conquered power." I am glad to

229

JUNýE 11, 1931
repeat that, so that it will he understood.
All Bolshevik leaders have expressed themselves in like manner.
Now let me briefly describe the ri~e and
growth of Bolshevism. At the outbreak of the
Great War, there were two principal political
parties in Russia, namely, the Mencheviks
and the Bolsheviks. The word "Menchevik"
means moderate, while "Bolshevik" means
extremist. The Mencheviks were far more
numerous than the Boloheviks, whio were then
a smaîl minority. The former admitted the
necessity of defending their country against
Germany, while the Bolsheviks declared themselves internationalists. They refused to defend their fatherland, and in consequence of
their antipatriotie attitude the leaders were
arrested and deported. It was only at the
end of 1916 that Lenin and Zinovieff, then
living at Geneva, succeeded in renewing relations with what remained of their partisans
in Russia.
Unfortunately, the abdication of the Czar
and the Russian revolution of 1017 opened a
wide field of action for the Boîsheviks. The
Proviwional Government at Petrograd under
Keren3ky allowed aIl political -offenders to,
return to Russia. This was a fatal mistake.
Lenin and his f ollowers were, of course, given
every facility by the Germans to return ta
Petrograd via Germany. The Gxermans knew
full wedl what the return of these Russian
revolutionists meant to them, and gave thern
every assistance to carry on their defeatist
propaganda in Russia. Lenin began lis infamous propaganda by a Bolshevik conference at Petrograd in April, 1917. Bis partisans were still not numerous; but this small
minority, whose chief aim was the disorganization of the army and the provocation of
a rising, was active and well-organized.
On the l7th and lSth July, 1917, occurred
the fi.rst attempt at a Bolshevik insurrection
at Petrograd. It was, however, premature;
the army was not yet sufficiently demoralized,
and it easiiy suppressed this rising. But in the
autumn, the army, now heing thoroughly
suppress
further
disorganized,
faileýd to
Bolshevik risings at Petrograd and Moscow,
and after a f ew sanguinary collisions power
was seized by Lenin and his followers, who at
once formed wha.t they termed the Government of Workers and Peasants. Lenin placed
himself at its head, with the powers of a
dictator, and since that day, November 7,
1917, the Bolsheviks have been the only party
in Russia, every other party having been declared illegal and "counter-revolutionary."

IDENTIFICATION OF ALIENS BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed consideration of the
motion for the second reading of Bill Ai, an
Act to provide for Alien Identification Cards.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We are now up to
1917. When I was interrupted by -the arrival
of the Deputy Governor General I was referring to Lenin's declaration that the Bolsheviks were the only party in Russia and that
every other party was illegal and counterrevolutionary.
Honourable members will
realize what that means. Suppose the Government of Canada, for instance, were to declare
that any party opposed to it was illegal!
Lenin with his monstrous but incontestable
genius, and with consummate science, immediately took possession of all the nerve
centres of the State. The Bolsheviks know
how to attack the nerve centres of Canada,
if they want to do so. On a word from
Moscow, not from the Soviet Government,
but from tle Komintern, whieh might be
called a holding eomipany ýfor the Soviet
Government and the Third International,
these agents would disorganize our telephone
and telegraph systems. They know what
viaducts or bridges could be dynamited in a
few minutes to disorganize all traffic. It is
enough to say that they have in this country
215 unions, of which 131 are in Ontario.
Toronto is their headquarters in 'Southern
Ontario. In the city of Winnipeg, a few years
ago, as the Hon. Minister 'of Labour would
agree if he were present, His Majestys mail
could not be moved for three whole days, and
invalids and sick children couid not get milk
for a considerable time. Yet an ex-Minister
of Immigration, who lives not far from Winnipeg, says the Communists are not very
dangerous. Well, that a man can be blind to
that degree is certainly trying on one's
patience. How he can make such a statement
is hard to understand.
After Lenin took control all resistance in
the immense territory of Russia was crushed.
Lenin, master of all the means of communiHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

cation, master of ail the arsenals, with -their
arms and ammunition, master of all the banks
and financial institutions-now I wou'ld ask
the bank presidents who are here to listen and
not to talk while I -am dealing with this-and
master of all industrial undertakings, in a
word, of the entire resources of ' Russia,
aided by a political organization more than
disciplined, enslaved, by a police force whose
cruelty knew no bounds, was able to construct and perfect as he pleased the instrument of torture under which the Russian
people have writhed since he 'came into power.
The question naturally arises, Why do not
the people rise against such a monstrous Government? Russians have often been asked
that question. Their answer is always the
same. "What can we do without arms and
ammunition?"
There are spies everywhere
and if a man complains he is -arrested and disappears--to be shot or exiled to Siberia or the
Aretic regions.
The truth is that the Bolshevik power reposes upon terror. Lenin has declared that "90
per cent of the Russian people may perish,
provided 10 per cent survive till the day of
the world revolution." And another leader has
said: "We represent organized terror. . . . .
We know no quarter."
To terrorize the people the Bolsheviks
required a powerful police organization,
together with an army of spies and executioners. This terrible police organization was
first called the "Cheka," but is now named
the G. P. U. Incidentally I might mention
that the Cheka became so unpopular that
the name had to be changed. The G. P. U.
is at one and the same time a police force
and an extraordinary tribunal with unlimited
powers. That is to say, it not only arrests
people, but has the power to try them and
execute them. Honourable members of the
legal profession should mark this. This police
force, that is, the G. P. U., is supported and
protected by a large body of troops consisting of about 80,000 men who are trained
for the purpose of suppressing any risings
among the people.
Every town in Russia
has some G. P. U. troops among the garrison, and these troops are always held in
readiness te proceed to any place where the
people attempt to rise. The G. P. U. is
recruited among liberated convicts, assassins
and the most disreputable scum of Europe
and Asia: Jews, Letts, Poles, Armenians,
Hungarians, Asiatics, Negroes, etc., etc. It
is a cosmopolitan force with absolute power
of life and death over a helpless people.
There is a formidable organization with its
headquarters at Moscow, where an entire
quarter of the city, the Loubjanka, has been

JUNE 11, 1931
transformed into offices, prisons and torture
chambers. It is in this gloomy repair that
the executioners of the Russian people do
their deadly work. It is in the Loubjanka
that the orders are issued condemning to
death or deportation thousands of innocent
victims. I may say that the executions generally take place at midnight or in the early
morning. I have here some newspaper clippings, but I do not want to take up the
time of the House in reading them. One of
them refers to a man who was tortured day
by day for a whole month before he would
inform on his companions. Shortly afterwards
lie died from the ill treatment lie had
received.
Now I will refer to the heads of the
G. P. U. The first head of the Cheka, Ouritzki, who was assassinated by a Socialist, was
succeeded by Dzerjinski, one of the most
odius of all the criminal Bolshevik band. He
caused floods of blood and subjected thousands of innocent persons to frightful tortures.
His subordinates were worthy of him. There
was Advokme, bespangled with jewels, cocaine
addict and debauchee, in a constant state of
brutal excitation. When his little furtive
eyes rested on a prisoner, it was a death
warrant. At Poltava, Griska, who caused 18
monks to be impaled, would drive through
the streets in a car, with a rose in his button
hole and a woman by his side. Chernovsky,
cocaine addict, was out of humour if lie had
not killed a certain number of victims. Rosa
Schwarz, at Kieff, counted ber victims by
hundreds; took cocaine and, with cigarette
in mhouth, used to go and see the prisoners
naked in their cells and kill them with a
revolver, or burn their eyes with her cigarette.
During this reign of terror, people suspected
of being counter-revolutionary were executed
en masse, first by way of reprisal for the
attempt of Rosa Kaplan upon Lenin's life,
and then to suppress insurrections which were
breaking out everywhere against the tyranny
of the Bolshevik Government. Thousands of
hostages shut up in the concentration camps
were put to death. The Cheka simply proceeded to the extermination of all those who
happened to be in prison.
These executions en masse did not, however, produce the impression the Bolsheviks
had expected. The people looked upon the
victims as martyrs and venerated them as
saints. And so the Bolsheviks changed their
method of persecution. Assassinations are
now carried out secretly, and counter-revolutionary suspects are deported to concentration camps in Siberia and the Arctic regions,
where victims of both sexes wallow in filth,

w3

misery, hunger and cold and perish by inches,
carried off by the awful sufferings they undergo in these infernos.
Fifty per cent of the Catholic clergy of
Russia have perished since the Revolution,
through judicial murder, starvation, exile or
imprisonmient in concentration camps.
It is quite impossible to know the total
number of victims of the Bolshevik reign of
terror, but the official statistics of the Bolshevik Government, published in 193, accounted for about two millions. That was
eight years ago.
You will remember that when Lenin seized
power he declared: "We are doomed to perish
unless revolution breaks out in other countries." It was necessary, therefore, to create
an organization for the propagation of Bolshevism throughout the world. It was for
this purpose that Lenin founded the Third
International, and in doing so he forged a
formidable instrument of destruction. Incidentally I may say that I have clippings
showing that the budget for propaganda for
the current year is $17,000,000. The Third
International is a society composed of the
Communist leaders of every nad!on. Its aim
is the Bolshevisation of the world. The headquarters are at Moscow, where the general
meetings are held. They are attended by
the representatives of the Communist parties
in various countries. The executive committee of the society sits permanently at Moscow,
and issues instructions from there to the Communist parties in other countries. For instance, the Canadian Communists send delegates to Moscow to attend the general meetings there, and the Canadian Communist
party receives its instructions from the executive committee sitting at Moscow. Still
the ex-Minister of Immigration says there is
no danger. Take for instance the sinister role
just recently played by the *Third International in Spain. Moscow stands in the same
relation to the Bolsheviks throughout the
world as Rome does to the Catholics of the
world. The Catholics receive their instructions from Rome; the Bolsheviks receive theirs
from Moscow.
I will mention to you very briefly what
the instructions to the Bolsheviks are. They
are well known, for they were published in the
official paper of the Bolshevik Government.
The Bolsheviks all over the world are instructed, firstly, to fight against religion;
secondly, to oppose all doctrines that preach
the union of capital and labour; and, thirdly,
to sow discord between the employed and the
employers so as to cause a class fight to a
finish.

Hon

Mr. CASGRAIN.

JUN-E 1,1, 1931
Yet the Bolsheviks, in spite of their cruel
and constant persecution, and notwithstanding
the anti-Christian propaganda, carried on by
them since their accession to power, by means
of their press, their theatres, their cinemas,
their radio, and innumerable anti-Christian
propagandists, have not succeeded in rooting
out the faith fromn the hearts of the people.
The great majority of the peasants, who coustitute the bulk of the population of Russia,
have been impervious to the propaganda and
many thousands have sulTered martyrdom for
their faith.
Now I would draw special attention to the
perversion of youth. The Bolsheviks, quickly
realizing the hopelessness )of destroying the
faith of the older generation a.nd making them
Communists, concentrated their efforts on the
younger generation, and systemati-cally undertook to corrupt the youth of the country. Their
aim is to make the child a convinced Communist by teaching him. to ha.te the social and
moral order of civilized nations. The deliberate and systematic depravation of children
scems te us utterly incemprehensible, but it
is the logical outeomne of Communistie education. Aithougli it is incomprehensible to us,
yeFt te the BioAsheviks it is of capital importance, for it produces three resuite: firstly,
it destroyis all sense of morality in children
and thus makes them tkorough Communiste;
secondly, it destroys fâmily life, for children
thus educated lose ail respect for their parents,
despise them, and treat Vhem with contempt
and as enemies; lastly, it makes Coinmumsm
attractive to the average child, wlho, of course,
would much rather live in idleness and without any sort of restraint than have -te study,
and keep the commandments of Qod and of
His Church.
The officiai journal of the Bolsheviks, "The
Godkess," is widely circulaited among the
Gbjîdren. It is profusely illustrated with immoral pictures, and one page is specially deveted to the children. It centains playlet.9
of unhelievable grossneas and immorsLlity. The
children are taught te perform these filthy
plays in the Bolshevik theatres. Several universities have been founded for the purpose
of training professors of atheism, and te show
how it is te be taught te the rising generation.
In Canada atheism is taught in a more simple
but perhaps more effective manner. Monsigner Hlelenowski told me that in some Bolsheviks' schools child-ren are taught that there
is ne Qed, in the following manner. The
teacher would lie down and issue a challenge
te Qed, in the presence of the children. H1e
would say, "If rbhere be a Qed, let Him prevent me from rising," just as the Jews said
te Our Savieur when H1e was dying on Cal-

233

vary, "If Thou art the Son of Qed, come
down from the cross;" and, as Qed does net
usually punish blasphemers instantly, the
teacher would rise and the children would be
sadly and decply impressed by this sacrilegieus
performance.
In Russia the chi.ld.ren are foeed te take
part in mest infamous masquerades. 1f they
fail te attend, the parents are punished by
beixig deprived of bread cards, which means
starvatien, or else they are imprisoned. like
the worst, criminals. The children are made
te dress up in cîcrical vestments, or as sisters
or monkcs, te take part in these masquerades,
and are taught te make sacrilegious and immoral gestures. In a word, everything is dene
te completely demoralize the chiîdren.
There are millions of deserted children in
Russia, family if e having becn destroyed.
Newspapers devete columns te the problem,
of deserted children, but no solution bas been
found. They may possibly be destined te constitute that future Red wave -that is te sweep
over Europe and annihilate Christian civilizatien.
The headquarters of Communism in Canada
are in Toronto, and they kccp in constant
communication wjth the executive ut Moscow,
from whom they receive their orders, which.
through their organization are transmitted te
all parts of Canada. They have divided Canada into nine large arcas, extending from
Halifax te Vancouver, and each area is subdivided inte districts, and each district into
groups composed of a certain number of cells.
The ceil is the fundamental unit of the Bolshevik organization.
As smon as a few
Bolshevik workmen in a factory, werkshop,
milI, railway, mine or any other undertaking
get te knew one another, they constitute a
celI whose function it is te sow discord between
the workmen and their employers in order te
prepare the greund for strikes and te cause
trouble generally. It is the duty of the cel
te keep in teuch with the head of the group
te wbich it belongs. The head ef the group
reports te the head of the district, who reports
te the head of the area, whe in turu reports
to headquarters at Toronto. I am talking
about "Toronto the Qood." It will be seen
that by this system orders from Mescow can
reach workmen in every part ef the country,
se that in the case of a general strike combined
action may be taken te create a revolutionary
situation in the country.
Bolsheviks are aware that tbey will never
succeed in establishing the dictatorship of the
preletariat, in other wards seize pewer, until
thcy have won over te their ideas the labour
uniens. As I have said before, I regret that

SENATE
the Minister of Labour is not here, and again
I ask the question: Why do net the heads of
the labour unions tell the truth to the workmen about the state of the workers in Russia?
If they did that, the men would not join the
movement. I cannot understand why the facts
are not made known. I know at the time of
the trouble in Cape Breton only one man
in ten was a Bolshevik; the others were good
native Scotchmen, law-abiding people. Nevertheless, the one in ten terrorized the others,
and I was told by a priest down there-the
honourable senator from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) will remember this-that one
in ten was sufficient to upset all the others.
The Bolsheviks rely on their workshop-cells
to win over the labour unions by their Conmunistic propaganda. They call it "boring
from within."
Meanwhile they seek to be
chosen as leaders or secretaries in the unions.
It is true that at present a very small
minority of our population are Bolsheviks; but
their newspapers, in French, English, and
foreign languages, and printed chiefly at Winnipeg, circulate everywhere and carry on
active propaganda, and they will, if net suppressed, cause Bolshevism to grow until
eventually it becomes a very serious menace.
Let me refer to a letter recently sent to
the Solicitor General, drawing his attention
te the propaganda of the Communistic press.
That letter contained three newspaper clippings, the first of which was from a Conmunistic journal published in Ukrainian in
Winnipeg. I do net know whether the Government has many in its employ who understand
Ukrainian, which is net like Russian or Polish,
but is a separate language. That clipping gave
a report of a meeting of Finnish Communists
held in Porcupin-e, Ontario, at which the
chairman of the meeting announced that a
speaker had just arrived from Moscow to
give them the instructions of the Communist
International, called the Komintern.
The
second clipping speaks of a meeting of the
young Commiunists of Winnipeg, called for
the purpose of explaining te them the education of young Communists in Russia; and the
third clipping gives the program for world
revolution. This. honourable gentlemen, will
give you some idea of what is to come.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If my Bill is
passed, the regulations will be Ieft to the
Governor in Council. I have a diagram which
shows that Canada is regarded by the Soviets
as one of the most favourable countries for
a revolution, because of the fact that people
have been coming here for years without any
restrictions. The fact is that under our
assisted immigration scheme we have been
paying money to bring people in here, and
that is the reason why our own Canadians
have had to leave the country and go to the
United States in search of work. If we had
not brought in so many immigrants there
would not be nearly three million Canadians
across the line to-day.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Shoudd they not
come under my honourable friend's Bill?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I wish to refer to
only one more matter. The League of Nations
has issued a pamphlet which deals thoroughly
with the Bolshevik menace. People who have
any influence with the League could not do
better than see that every honourable member
of this House is supplied with a copy of this
document. It is signed on behalf of the
International Entente against the Third
International, by the President of the Permanent Bureau at Geneva, Théodore Aubert.
I am sure the honourable leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will know that gentleman. Certainly no one will be scandalized if
I read anything that is published by that
august assembly called the League of Nations.
On page 6 of the pamphlet there is this statement:
Clemenceau well understood that the criminal
domination of Bolshevism would net have
resisted isolation. Ail the efforts of the Soviets
have been directed to breaking the economic
and moral blockade whicl condemned them to
death.
Then on page 71 are "Technical instructions
for carrying out the revolution." It reads:

From this moment the bourgeois can no longer

Control of private arims: this gives pretext

On page 95 there are these statements:

GOVERNMENT
THIRD

ANNUITIES BILL
READING

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY moved the
third reading of Bill Dl, an Act to amend the
Government Annuities Act.
He said: Honourable members, in response
to the request of the honourable member for
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) I promised
to get a certain statement from the Superintendent of Insurance, if it were possible.
I have already placed on Hansard a short
statement made by him. I have now received
from Mr. Finlayson the following statement:
Re Amendment to the Government
Annuities Act
I have read the discussion in yesferday's
Senate Debates and am glaid te give the additional information asked for, se far as I am
able te do se.
At the time of the amendment in 1920 it was
strongly urged by the then Superintendent of
Annuities that the rate of interest payable
on Government borrowings was in excess of the
cost to the Government of the Government
annuity system. At that time this was true
as te the nominal cost of 4 per cent and probably also truc as ta the effective cost when the
actual mortality experience was taken into
acceount, although at that time no investigation
into the experience of the Fund had been made.
The foregoing argument was used to urge the
use of the annuity systea as a means of obtaining additional revenue for the treasury, and
this was at least one of the reasons for the
increase in the maximum amount of the annuity
purchasable.
Since that time an investigation into the
mortality experience of the annuitants and the
state of the Fund, as well as investigations into
annuity experience elsewhere, has demonstrated
the inadequacy of the present annuity rates,
and with the lapse of time the arguments urged
in 1920 have ceased ta be applicable.
At the present time, with all the facts before
us, I think that the provisions of the Bill now
before the Senate are in the publie interest.
I have also been able to secure some extracts
from the speeches made in 1920 by Sir Henry
Drayton and Mr. Fielding in connection
with the resolution to increase the maximum
annuity from $1,000 to $5,000. This is an
extract fron the speech of Sir Henry Drayton,
then°Minister o'f Finance, delivered on March

12, 1920:
Mr. Ohairman, the ebject of this resolution
and the legislation to be based upon it is ta
make Government annuities more popular than
they are at present, ta stinmuhîate public interest
in them, and te raise larger sums of money than
have been raised in the past nnder the Government Annuities Act. The changes proposed are
not very great, but they are considered necessary by the department having the matter in
charge in order ta make possible a greater sale

239

of the annuities, in the interest not only of
the country, but also of those who purchase
them.
The original intention in connection with the
sale of annuities by the Government was te
provide for an income ta the annuitant of
comparatively small amount. Of course, the
first idea of the annuity was thiat it was entirely
for the benefit of the annuitant, not of the
country. That idea has long since been exploded, at any rate in so far as matters on
this side of the Atlantic are concerned. The
large insurance companies have gone very extensive'ly into the business of selling annuities
and in this connection are making very large
sums of money. The sale of annuities ought te
be a good thing for the Government; it is a
transaction in connection with which the country
ought te receive a large amount of money. If
it pays ordinary commercial companies ta sell
annuities, it ought ta pay, anid I have no doubt
viJl pay the country te sell them. Now, the
total amount payable yearly by way of annuity
bas been $1,000; the department have requested
that the amount be increased ta $5,000 se that
they may be enabled ta do business with individual or joint annuitants ta the extent of that
amount.
Mr. Fielding made the following remarks,
among others:
The objects of those who devised the original
annuity scheme are not quite the sane as
those of the Minister of Finance. The original
scherne was devised for the benefit of the annuitants, whereas my hen. friend is devising
a scheme for the benefit and convenience of
le wants ta draw more
the Government.
money into the public treasury, and I suppos no objection can be taken to that, because he need-s it badly. This Bill is designed,
not for the benefit of the annuitant, but ta
get more money into the public treasury. It
was never intended that this should be a
scherne to compete with insurance companies.
Inasmuch as it was a privilege that was
granted, it was not considered necessary to
give it ta everybody. But I do not think any
harn can come from extending it as my hon.
friend suggests. Then it was intended that
the 'annuitant should receive a moderate sum:
I do not think it was intended that he should
get $5,000; I think the original sum was $600
-at all events, the sum was a small one. The
scheme was never intended as one ta compate
with insurance companies, but to meet the
case of muany simple people who did not
understand insurance, who had great faith in
the Goverurnent and who would take up a
Government sherme when they might not take
up an insurance scheme. Therefore, it was not
intended to be a scheme te pay large annuities.
My hon. friend is now going into competition
with insurance companies. I do not know that
any great harm can come from that, but it is
cuite evident that his viewpoint is not quite
the same as that of the former minister who
devised the scheme.
The scheme was devised, I believe, by Sir
Richard Cartwright, and the legislation originated in this House.

PRISONS AND

REFORMATORIES BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY moved the
second reading of Bill 72, an Act to amend
the Prisons and Reformatories Act.
He said: Honourable members, this too is
a very simple Bill, and the marginal references explain the end to be accomplished. It
provides that Roman Catholic females in
Nova Scotia may be sentenced to reformatories instead of to gaols or prisonsRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Why in Nova
Scotia?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
-and
that
Roman Catholic females in New Brunswick
who are found guilty of an offence punishable
by imprisonment for less than two years may
be sent to the Good Shepherd Reformatory
in the city of Saint John. The other provisions are for the sending of such prisoners
to some institution under the control of a
religious body, instead of to a gaol or prison
in the ordinary way.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is for reformation rather than punishment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Justice can be
administered more cheaply and certainily more
effectively if they are sent to a religious or
charitable institution.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend whether the Attorneys
General of the two provinces have been consulted about the measure?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I cannot answer
that.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: May I ask the 41onourable gentleman why the provisions of the
Bill are confined to persons of one religious
faith, and to only two provinces?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The only suggestion I can offer-it is an intuition, and I
give it for what it is worth-is that perhaps
these institutions have volunteered to take
charge of these convicts.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the reason.

241

JUNE 11, 1931
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The duty couild
not be imposed upon them. I think it has
come to the attention of the Government that
these institutions are willing to take charge
of these convicts.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: They are doing so
now. 1 am quite in favour of this Bill, but
I should like a little information wiith respect
to subsection 3 of section 121A, on page 2,
which is new. That subsection reads:
If any female person, sentenced to the Good
Shepherd Reformatory under the provisions of
she
this section, escapes fromi such institution, warnay at any time be appreliended without
rant and brought back to the said institution,
there to be detained under the origmal commitment.
The honourable senator from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has now pending before
this House an important amendment to that
section of the Criminal Code which permits
a peace officer to shoot an offender who is
seeking to escape by flight. That section of
the Code as it now stands is:
41. Every .peace officer proceeding lawfulhy to
arrest, with or without warrant, any person for
any offence for which the offender may he
ar.rested without warrant, and every one lawfully assisting in such arrest, is justified, if
the person to be arrested takes to flight to
avoid arrest, in using such force as may be
necessary to prevent hie escape by such flight,
unless such escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a les violent manner.
Under that section, it seems to me, any
wonan escaping from this reformatory, being
by this Bill made liable to arrest without
warrant, couid be shot and killed by a pursuing officer. This. I think, is a very serious
matter. The Criminal Code permits a peace
officer to shoot at any fleeing offender who
may be arrested without warrant, and the
honourable senator from Hamilton contends
our law should be made to conform te that
of England, where an officer is not allowed to
shoot at a person seeking to escape arrest,
unless a felony has been committed. I submit
that we should very carefully consider what
we are doing before we legislate that people
of the types confined in reformatories shall
be subject to the same perils as other offenders
who nay be arrested without warrant.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend docs not mean to differentiate between
a male and a female?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. My honourable friend makes, and I think very properly,
a distinction between a misdemeanour and a
felony.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Under the Criminal
Code a person who is guilty of a misdemeanour is just as likely to be shot as one
who has committed a felony.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I agree. Is it not
a fact that if the Bll proposed by the honourable member from Hamilton is passed it
will cover the case of a woman who escapes
from a reformatory?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: But the Bill is not
likely to carry, I am afraid. We are waiting
now for the opinion of the Justice Department.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If it carries, it will
cover such a case?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If it does not
carry, a woman in such a case will still be
on a parity wi'th every other class of offender
who may be arrested without warrant. Therefore I do not think it is necessary to deal
with this particular matter now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
there has been any instance of an escaping
woman in Canada being shot by a police
officer. The officers would know better than
to do a thing like that.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I have no objection
at all to this Bill. It would simply extend
to the whole province of New Brunswick the
practice which is now and has been for some
time in vogue in the city and county of St.
John, where women and girls of the Roman
Catholic religion who are sentenced to a term
of imprisonment under two years may be
sent to the Good Shepherd Reformatory instead of to an ordinary jail. This reformatory is, of course, an institution under Roman
Catholic auspices. So far as I know, there
is no objection in New Brunswick to the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

efforts. We must not lose sight of the end
they have in view. It seems at first blush that
it is only anti-religious propaganda. We must
not be so ingenuous as to believe that it will
stop there:. social transformation is their
objective.
Their tactics are easy to understand.

and its teachings and consolations enlighten the
mind and fortify the will, one is invulnerable.
To warp the mind, to embitter the soul, and
bring them both to Communism, religion must
first be destroyed.
This recrudescence of activity is to be
found not only in the city of Montreal or in
the Province of Quebec. As an evidence of
this I will quote from the Financial Post
of Toronto, a well informed and sober-minded
paper. This is what it says:
Communist agitators are finding the present
depression in business an opportunity for much
subversive propaganda. From various Canadian
centres disturbing reports of Red activities are
coming. These activities are not isolated and
localized affairs, but are all part of one
shrewdly conducted campaign which "% the
ultimate objective of weakening or destroying
Canadian institutions. Those who are directing the work are foreigners and they work
through other foreigners in centres such as
Port Arthur, Sudbury, the coal mining towns,
etc.
No action is being taken by properly constituted officiais of either provincial or
Dominion governnents to deport the foreign
born agitators who lead these Soviet activities

cruelly, ruthlessly deporting helpless women
who are giving this country no real trouble,
and at the same time are protecting publie
agitators who wish to destroy Canadian and
British institutions. If some of the time and
money spent on deporting the women whose
cases have been prominent recently in the
papers were spent on routing out and deporting
the men back of the Red agitation in Canada,
a more constructive work would be done by
government officiais.
This state of affairs, honourable members,
has been apparent not only to the law
authorities and to the Church; it bas not
escaped the attention of the Government.
Perhaps I may answer the question that was
put yesterday by my honourable friend and
colleague from De Lanaudiere (Hon.Mr.Casgrain) to the now absent Minister of Labour.
The Minister has had knowledge of this
offensive of the Red element and has made it
a point to give warning ta the whole country.
This is what he said quite recently:
The present world-wide industrial depression
has naturally given to those people who seek
to undermine the present social and political
system the impetus to carry on propaganda
among the unemployed in the large centres.
22112-16

There has been, during the year, a score of
Canadian delegates attending Communistic conferences in Russia. and evidence is not lacking
to indicate that, under the direction and control of a few persons on the North American
continent, efforts have been made to spread
revolutionary doctrine and arouse in the minds
of the people dissatisfaction with existing
systems.
If any further evidence is required to prove
the activities of the Communists, and the
effect of their recent propaganda, let me
add the testimony of a gentleman whose
opinion, I know, will be acceptable to you.
I refer to the venerable Sir William Mulock,
Chief Justice of Ontario, who says:
If Canada is content to have her laws made
by those who deny the existence of God; who
would suppress religion; who would destroy the
sacredness of marriage and who would nationalize women; who would extinguish the love of
parents for their children or children for their
parents; who would abolish home life-one of
the chief sources of human happiness; who
would deprive children in their tender years of
a mother's care and expose them to the
imminent danger of growing up as criminals;
who would rob all citizens by any degree of
force, up to that of murder, of all their worldly
goods and leave them penniless; would make it
a crime for one to save; would deprive people
of liberty and would make slaves of them to
the State--if, I say, those are the conditions
which Canada is content to have established in
Canada, then let lier open lier doors wide and
admit into full citizenship the millions of the
people of that class. But if Canada does not
wish to become a hell on earth, she should rid
herself at once of those who would, if they
could, make lier such, and let her prevent any
of that kind of people ever setting foot on
Canadian soil.
This outbreak of the activities and propaganda of the Communists has not been confined either to my own province or to the
Dominion; it has been general throughout
America, and I think I may say throughout
the world. Perhaps honourable members
would not think it amiss that I should quote
from a very important and interesting report
lately made by a special committee created
by the Congress at Washington to investigate
Communistic activities. 'Tis committee took
evidence in nearly every large centre throughout the United States and· heard testimony
from people of all classes. Strange to say,
the chiefs of the Communists in the United
States dared, for the first time, to come forward and offer their testimony. Previously
the Red element had always worked underground at their nefarious trade. Now they
fight brazenly in the open. Just listen for a
few moments to what William Z. Foster,
the chief of the Communists in the United
States, had to say before the commission.
This gentleman was twice nominated as the
candidate of the Communistic element in
the presidential elections of the United States.
This is what he said:

244

SENATE

The Chairman: They are opposed to our
republican form of government?
Mr. Foster: Most assuredly.
The Chairman: And they desire to overthrow
it through revolutionary methods?
Mr. Foster: I would like to read from the
program of the Comnunist International at
this point.
The Cuiomunist International
program says:
Mr. Bachmann: From what page are you
reading?
Mr. Foster: P. 34. "The conquest of power
by the proletariat does not mean peaceful
capturing of ready-made

machinery by means of a parliamentary
majority. The bourgeois resorts to every means
of violence and terror to safeguard and
strengthen its predatory property and political
domination. Like the feudal nobility of the
past, the bourgeoisie can not abandon its
historical pasition to the new class without a
desperate and frantie struggle; hence the
violence of the bourgeoisie can only he suppressed by flic stern violence of the proletariat.
The Chairnan: My question was-you read
something from the Third International-just
what is the Third International?
Mr. Foster: The Communist International is
the world party of the Communist movement.
The Cliairmnan: Is the Communist Party of
the United States connected with it?
Mr. Foster: It is.
'lhe Chairman: In what way?
Mr. Foster: It is the American section.
May I quote further from his depositions?
The Chairmnan: That is, what you advocate
is a change of our republican form of government and the substituting of the Soviet form of
government?
Mr. Foster: I have stated that a number of
times.
The Chairman: Now, if I understand you,
the workers in this country look upon the
Soviet Union as their country, is that right?
Mr. Foster: The more advanced workers do.
The Chairman: Look upon the Soviet Union
as their country?
Mr. Foster: Yes.
'lie Chairman: They look upon the Soviet
flag as their flag?
Mr. Foster: The workers of this country and
the workers of every country have only one
flag and that is the red flag.
The report further shows that in the sixtecn
states where the Communists had candidates
for public office the number of votes in support of Communist candidates has increased
no less than 229 per cent from 1928 to 1930.
The report especially emphasizes the fact that
no less than 70 per cent of the active Communists in the States are aliens possessing no
right to vote.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The Red element
have made a determined but unsuccessful
effort to capture the American Federation of
Labour.
They have created havoc among
different branches of the legitimate labour
unions. It is very interesting to compare the
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

nefarious attempts of the Reds in the United
States and in Can.ada, and if the House will
permit me I shall quote further:
If it were not for the fact that the American
Federation of Labour, under the patriotie
leadership of William Green and his predecessor, Samuel Gompers, have refused to compromise with the Comnunists in the United
States, who have been trying to bore from
within in order to gain control of the labour
unions, Communism would be a serions threat
to American industry. Great credit should be
given to the American Federation of Labour
for conbating and exposing the aims of the
Communists to undermine our republican form
of governument and destroy our industries.
While the Communists so far have been
unsuccessful in their plans for "boring from
within," and "capturing" the American Federation of Labour, they have succeeded in weakening and virtually breaking up and destroying
a number of the important unions of the Federation, notably in the garment, needle, textile
and ininiug trades. In the coal mining fields
of Pennsylvania and Illinois, in the garment
and fur trades in New York City, in the mills
at Passaic. New Jersey, in the woollen textile
mills in New England centering at New Bedford, and in the cotton mills of the South
centering at Gastonia, the Communists have
foimented strikes or gained the leadership of
strikes already called. Those strikes were most
violent and destructive, culminating in riots.
violence, destruction of property, assaults and
murders; necessitating the calling out of troops,
and a virtual state of civil war in the various
sections ensued.
This report is dated the 19th of January last,
and has only recently been submitted to the
Congress at Washington. Therein I find also
a probable answer to those who criticiznd
Canada's embargo against importations from
Russia, for it is clearly shown that Russian
trade is much less profitable and much more
hazardous in its consequences than is generally
believed. Here is what it says:
The sale of thousands of tractors, harvesters
and threshing machines ta the Soviet Government by American concerns is one of the
causes that have begun to seriously affect the
wheat growing fiarmers in the United States.
For the past eight years the average value
of wheat and flour exported froum the United
States to all other countries amounted to
$257,000.000 annually. The total amount of
American goods sold and shipped to Russia
during the last three years anounted to
$224,000,000. or less than the total amount of
wheat and flour exported annually.
Sources favourable to Soviet Russia have
been issuing grossly exaggerated stories regarding the actual value of our expnrt trade to
Russia. The following are the official figures
of the Department of Commerce showing by
cars the amount of the export and import
trade:
Year

JUNE 12, 1931
These figures appear very small when compared with the grossly exaggerated sums of
money which our friends across the line were
supposed ta be coining froin their trade with
Russia. The report goes on:
Although the balance of trade is in our
favour, the actual amount of cash that has
been paid by the Soviet Government in the
last few years has not averaged over fifty cents
on the dollar, because of the long time credit
extended by American firms.
The Committee considers that it is justified
in placing ahl the facts before the American
people and particularly the wheat farmers at
saine length. The fact is that the quarter of a
billion dollars of wheat exported annually is
dwindling down rapidly ta a vanishing point.
Wheat, next ta cotton, bas been our biggest
export erop, but is now on the way ta the
scrap heap, as it cannot compete with wheat
produced in Russia on confiscated lands and
by labour receiving fourteen cents gold per
day, backed by American tractors, combines,
credit and brains.
Finally, the report clearly states that the
five-year plan of the Soviet Union is net intended only to benefit the home Union and
Government and to improve the conditions of
the Russian people. It goes much further.
Its purpose is not to build up, but to tear
down and destroy. "Pravda," the Communist
organ, .of August 29, 1929, fuUy defines its
purpose:
Jt is a plan ta undermine capitalist stabilization. It is a great plan of world revolution.
Now, is there any practical benefit that we
can extract from this report? May I quote
the two most important recommendations
made in it?
(1) Enlarging the authority of the Bureau
of Investigation of the Department of Justice,
for the purpose of investigating and keeping
in constant touch with the revolutionary
propaganda and activities of the Communists
in the United States; and ta provide for additioual appropriations for skilled agents ta
devote their entire time ta investigating and
preparing reports on the personnel of ail
entities, groups, individuals, who teach or
advocate the overthrow of the Government of
the United States by force and violence.
(2) Strengthening immigration laws ta prevent the admission of Communists into the
United States, and providing for immediate
deportation of ail alien Communists.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I pause here to inquire whether both these recommendations
could not be advantageously fol-lowed by
Canada. If Canada did adopt them, we
should have in the first place a better check
on all the Communistic people who enter our
country, and, secondly, by keeping in constant
touch with those people we could keep a better control on their nefarious work. In my
opinion the passing of the Bill before the

House would enable us to follow these recommendations. By putting such a law into force
Canada would give notice to Bolshevik agents
at Moscow that if they come to Canada a full
record will be kept of their names, addresses,
ages, nationalities, occupations, and so on, and
that they may be followed, shadowed and, if
necessary, arrested and deported to the country which they seem to be so eager to serve.
Does any honourable gentleman think that
Communism is being carried on in our
country gratuitously? Is payment not being
made for ail the propaganda issued through
the medium of the press and in leaflets
and by means of certain schools open in
Montreal every Sunday? My honourable
colleagues from Toronto and other parts of
the country know whether such schools are
being conducted in their localities. All that
work is being paid for by somebody. Honourable senators will remember that a few
years ago the coal mines and the iron and
steel industries in Cape Breton were almost
ruined by constant strikes. To my own knowledge those strikes were financed by money
from Moscow. Would not the Soviet agents
be deterred from coming ta Canada if they
knew that after crossing our border they could
at any time be asked by an officer to produce
their cards?
I have gone ta a good deal of trouble to
find out what the views of the police are
about this whole matter, and they tell me
that i is virtually impossible ta keep in touch
with the activities of Communists in our
land, because these people keep changing their
names and addresses. Under the present law
the police cannot do much unless they have
definite evidence upon which ta work. How
different it would be if an officer could ask
for the card of any person suspected of being
a Communist. Such a person either would
or would not be able to comply with the
officer's request. If a card were produced, the
police could check up the sworn statements
it contained, and anything found wrong in
the identification of a suspected person would
be used against him in any proceedings that
might be deemed necessary.
This Bill is by no means new legislation.
May I read to the House a clause of the
law of France in regard to the identification
of foreigners:
Every stranger who wishes ta reside in
France more than fifteen days and who is more
than fifteen years of age is obliged within fortyeight hours of his arrival in the first locality
where he intends ta reside, ta request from
the Prefect of the Department a card of
identification. A receipt for this request shall
be given te him. If during the period of residence mentioned in the card the applicant is

SENATE

246

obliged to travel, the receipt handed to him
will serve as a passport. He must have this
receipt viséed upon his arrival in any locality
or upon his departure therefrom, and the card
of identification shall be accepted as a passport.
There is an analogous, but perhaps more
stringent, law in Norway. In that country
a stranger is obliged to make his request for
an identification card within six days of his
arrival. Similar laws are enforced in Italy,
Switzerland, Roumania and, no doubt, a great
many other European countries.
I have taken the liberty of requesting an
apinion on the principle of this Bill from
zertain persons both in the office of the Crown
Prosecutor and in the Police Department of
Montreal who have been in touch with the
activities, especially in recent times, of Communists in that city. I refer only to the
principle of the Bill because I know that my
honourable friend from De Lanaudiere (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) does not contend that the
drafting of the Bill as it stands is perfect. In
my opinion amendments are required, and no
doubt will be made by the special committee
to which, I hope, the House will send the Bill.
All the Montreal police officers whom I
have consulted have agreed that a law of
the kind suggested here would be of great
help to them-that it would strengthen their
hands in dealing with the Communistic
menace, which, honourable senators, is becoming far more serious than those who have
no direct evidence of it are inclined to beI received yesterday the following

I have but one last word to say. It has
often been truly said that Canada is a rich
country. Yes, it is a rich country, a countrv
blessed by Providence with enormous natural
resources. But Canada's most precious asset
is her people. We have a hard-working, lawabiding, moral, God-fearing population. In
the Province of Quebec many of these sterling
qualities are due to the influence of the
clergy. When a man is down and out, or
when he is dying, he looks to the clergy
for relief and consolation. Honourable members, if you wish to know the truc condition of
things in that province I would advise you to
visit some one of our Catholic institutions in
Montreal at meal time. There, even at this
season of the year, which is supposed to be a
period of activity -in nearly every line of work,

ceive sustenance for themselves and their
families. While I respect the opinions of those
who differ from me in the matter of religion, I
cannot help remembering with pride what has
been said to me, time and again, by persons of
a different faith in my province: "We owe a
great debt of gratitude to your clergy, because they have contributed mightily towards
keeping the people of this province hard-working, law-abiding and God-fearing." Now, for the
first time, Bolshevik ideas have attacked and
are penetrating the very soul of our people.
Now, for the first time, these ideas are perverting people born and brought up in the
province, notwithstanding their traditions and
their faith. Is it not time for us to protect our own citizens? We have our troubles,
like everv other nation, but this is a young
country, immensely rich in natural resources,
and if the quality of our citizenship is maintained we shahl emerge from the slough of
stagnation sooner than any other nation. First,
however, we must do aill we can to maintain
the high quality of our people, and in these
days of reaction we cannot do that unless we

Honourable
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
members, with most of the remarks of the
honourable member who introduced this Bill
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) and of the honourable
gentleman who has just taken his seat (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) I fully agree. I realize that
the Soviet propaganda being carried on in our
great cities and in the remote parts of our
country is a very serious menace. Nevertheless, I fail to see that the legislation that we
are now considering is going to improve the
situation to any great extent. Many of the
people who would be affected by this legisla0tion came here in the best of faith and with
the intention of being good Canadians, and
their children are growing up with the same
intention. If we enact this legislation we at
once segregate them, as it were. In effect
we say: "We mistrust you; we have to earmark you; we are going te watch you." My
experience of human nature is that if I have
a man working for me and I wish to obtain
good results I have to place my confidence in
that man. If he believes that I distrust him
he will never ha faithful. I fear that the
effect of this legislation will be the opposite
of what is intended by the honourable gentleman who introduced the Bill. I think the
tendency of the legislation would be to
solidify a certain element and put them into
one class.
There is another objection that I have to
the Bill. It degrades people without giving

JUNE 12, 1931
them a trial. We have in this country lega!
means whereby we can deal with people who
violate our laws. We can, if necessary, deport
them. But we have no right to, say to aliens
in Canada: '"Without any trial, without any
charge being laid against you, we are going
to, classify you as dangerous people." For this
reason I cannot support the Bill.
Honourable
Hon. N. A. BELCOUPJ:
members, 1 intend ta say but a few words in
support of what my deskmate (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) and the honourable gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) have 50 well saïd.
I tboroughly agree that this Bill is to-day
an urgent necessity. I do not know that a
few years ago I should have been as ready
ta respand ta the appeal which bas been made
to us as I am to-day. The activities of the
lieds in Canada have~ no doubt increased very
mucb of late, and I think it is only prudent
to take precautions so as to be able ta, watch
these people and deal with them.
That is not the only justification for a law
of this kind. In the last few years we have
bad a great many immigrants from different
parts of Europe, some of them fromn parts

where criminality is very much in evidence.
and fromn my knowledge, gained from the
records of the criminal courts of the city of
Montreal, for instance, I may say that a great
many of those who are responsible for criminal
activities in tlue cauntry are aliens who have
not applied for naturalization and wbo, if
they did apply, would not receive it. 1 believc that is the case also in Toronto and in
other places. In the seaports, sudh as Halifax,
Saint John and Quebec, these people, wbo are
not responsible ta our laws, who are liera
ta-day and gone to-morrow, and who when
hero c9nnot be found, contribute largely to the
list of crimes.
I do not agree with my honourable friend
who bas just spoken (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
that the registration of these people would
be degrading. We are not degraded wben
the census is taken. Every Canadian must
submit ta the census: lie lias ta give bis namne,
bis age, bis occupation, where be resides, and
50

oni.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:

That applies ta

everybody.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Hon. Mr. DON NELLY:

0f course it does.

That does not

classify the people.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

But wby sbould

it not apply ta these aliens, wlio, as is weil

known, do not give their names, their occupations or their addresses. Surely people wbo
are biding ail the time ought ta, be under a

247

greater obligation than good Canadian citizens
to disclose their whereabouts and their
nationality. I do flot think they are being
singled out for special attention; they are
only being compelled to do exactly wbat good
Canadians are expected ta do. It seeme ta
me that the legisiation proposed by my lionourable friend ought ta appeal ta, every mernber of this House. To my mind it bas become,
as I said in the beginning, an urgent necessity, and 1 hope it will be accepted by the
Rouse.
Hon. JAMES MURDOGK: Honourable
members, yesterday and to-day I listened to
t.he most distressing discussion that has
reached my ears in a long time. To my
mind the whole discus.sion so far might be
summed up in the old saying that Nero fiddled
,while Rame burned. The menace of Bolshevism. is in my judgment the least of
Canada's troubles to-day, and in my view
notbing that could transpire would improve
the status of Boishevisma in Canada more
than does the discussion that has taken place.
My honourable
What is Communism?
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) talked
about and quoted Foster, the leader of the
Communists. I know him. very well.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is nothing to
boast about.
Hon. Mr. MIJRDOCK: I do not think it is
any discredit to me. I know himn to have
been, in the days gone by, one of the warmest-hearted enthusiasts for the under dog.
He has been driven, as I think, to desperation by the failure of those who have the
opportunity of changing certain conditions ta
alleviate the suffeTings of the downtrodden,
and at last, with a view of vengeance, bas
gone to unreasonable lengths, which of course
wc will not tolerate for a moment. But in
this discussion-and I say this with ail due
respect to every honourable gentleman in
this House-we are giving that man and
athers of his kind a distinction that otherwisc they could not have hoped for. To me
it seems very unfortunate that the Senate of
Canada sbould bring up a subject of this
kind in the way we have done, thus giving it
an importance that it does not deserve.
While I say that, I am ail in favour of
placing identification cards in the liands of
the aliens in -Canada. At the samne time 1 am
wondering what will liappen by way of retaliation. In the city of .Winnipeg, for example, it would be necessry for us to label,
I think, sorne 20,000 American citizens, possibly
more, who have neyer become naturalized
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Wihy not?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then what about
the 200,000 or more Canadians who are to be
found in the highways and by-ways of the
United States, and who by retaliatory legisJation might be required to take out such
a label? I can see that honourable gentlemen opposite-yes, and on my own side of the
House--will not be unduly influenced by my
views; but I want to assure you that those
views have been derived from looking in the
eye more Communists than I think any other
member of this House has ever seen. For
five week's recently I was, as I knew, looking
in the eye and talking to a number of Com;munists who were sitting among the delegates of the organization to which I belong,
a part of the great labour system of this
country, which was sO highly complimented
by my honourable friend across the way (Hon.
M\r. Beaubien). What nust we do with such
men?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Deport them.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Not necessarily.
Let us nake conditions so reasonable and
fair that they will see the necessity of being
good and decent citizens of Canada. That
is what we must do.
Last night and to-day we listened at great
length to a discussion of a real or an
imaginary condition. To my mind it is wholly
imaginary. We did not dignify the discussion with any mention of the fact that in
this capital city the other night, as we are
told by the press, sixty-eight men of twelve
different nationalities, who, being without work
and without a roof over their heads, had
erected a shelter out at the dump by the
Rideau river, were taken in patrol wagons to
the police station, where they were given
bread and hot coffee--"I was an hungered,
and ye gave me meat: I was a stranger, and
ye took me in"-then they were turned loose,
with the understanding that the only bit of
covering they could get was to be destroyed.
They were not to be permitted to have even
that crude shelter. There have been no reams
of eloquence from this Chamber on that
incident, which has occurred right in the
capital city of this land of plenty.
To me it seems unfortunate indeed that we
should not devote more of our time and
energy, and the great wealth of experience of
honourable members of this House, to
remedying some of the conditions that exist
in this Canada of ours, so that it will become
impossible for the seed of Bolshevism or
Communism-or call it what you like-to
germinate and grow. When all is said and
done, Bolshevism or Communism is only

for vengeance; nothing more and nothing
less. In a humble way I have been fighting
Bolshevism for many years, and I do not fear
it. I repeat that it is one of the least of
Canada's troubles to-day, and I say that there
are many others to the rectification of which
we should be devoting our time and energy
in order that the seed of Bolshevism may not
grow in this country.
I am in faveur of the registration of aliens.
Why? Merely so that we may know who
we are, what we are and where we are going.
But I regret that this discussion should have
taken place here, because I know from experience that it will be carried broadcast
throughout the length and breadth of the
land, accompanied by the statement that the
Senate of Canada is scared and on the run.
I think such a discussion was a mistake, and
I wish it had not taken place. So far as the
Bill is concerned, if it were amended so as
to make reasonable exception for bona fide
American citizens, I should be in favour of
it. I hope that what I have said will not
be regarded as an attempt to deal with the
underlying purpose of the Bill. My point
is simply this, that I feel we have been
dealing with the matter in a wrong way
and that the discussion we have had here
will be made too much' of by those to whom
we have been referring.
Hon. ROBERT FORKE: Honourable sonators, when the honourable member from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) initroduced this matter yesterday I had no intention of taking part in the discussion; but I
feel it is necessary to make a few remarks
now, since he alluded to me a number of
times and indicated that I was at least partly
responsible for the fact that a considerable
number of foreigners have immigrated to
Canada in recent years. I think it is necessary to make a few explanations, because I
fear there is a good deal of misunderstanding
about the question of immigration from the
continent of Europe. When I was in charge
of the Department of Immigration, every
speech of criticism of that Department that
was made in another place included, I think,
a statement to the effect that the Governmentt
was spending money to bring immigrants to
this country or to aid themr to come here,
The honourable senator who is sponsoring this
Bill (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) made some remarks
to the sane effect. Now, I take advantage of
every opportunity I can get to contradict that
statement, because the fact is that the Dominion of Canada bas not expended one
dollar to bring immigrants from the continent
of Europe. I hope honourable senators will
remember that.

trouble. A little trouble did occur on that
occasion, but nnthing serious. The people
walked along the sidewalks as they were
ordered, and there was merely some scrambling.
These people were not Communists exactly,
but Socialists and unemployed. Later they
applied for and were given permission to
parade in the city streets. They lined up
on the square in front of the City Hall. I
saw that parade and, as perhaps I have
mentioned here before, the whole thing was
conducted in an orderly fashion, with no disturbance whatever, and ended in speeches.
Had these people been refused the use of the
streets and been herded on to the sidewalks,
had they been tormented by the police supervision, it is likely there would have been
violence. This second parade was so quiet
that there was hardly any mention of it in
the local newspapers, whereas the previous
affair was herslded all over the Dominion.
Nothing will foster the spread of Communism like persecution of people who are behaving themselves and obeying the laws of
the country.
The honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) said a great deal
about Russians. In the last four or five
years very few people have come from Russia
to Canada; in fact, it has been difficult to
get them to come. My friend the Lieutenant
Governor of Manitoba was desirous of getting from Russia a family of Mennonites
named Penner to work on a farm. He
appealed to me when I was in charge of
the Department of Immigration to see if I
could do anything to assist him in the matter,
but I could not. It seems that the people
had some money, and the Russian Government try to prevent people who have any
money from leaving the country. The
system is to bleed them white by raising
the cost of passports, which was at first $50
a head and was increased to $100 and later
to $200.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
asking $250 for a passport.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: So those people were
never able to get out of Russia. As I say,
we are not getting any immigrants from there
now. Last year a large number of Mennonites who had no sympathy with Soviet
ideas were dispossessed of their farms by the
method of excessive taxation. They camped
around the city of Moscow, but the Soviet
Government notified them that unless they
moved they would be transported to Siberia;

that is, loaded on cattle trucks and taken to
the plains in the dead of winter to starve and
freeze to death. They were German Mennonites, and the Consul of Germany in this
country inquired of me whether they would
be allowed to come to Canada. I told him I
would not say anything in reply until I had
consulted the provincial governments. I might
explain tîat the German Government undertook that Canada should be put to no expense
for the transportation of these people and that
arrangements should be made to take to
Germany any of them whom we might wish
to deport. I passed on these representations
to the Premiers of the three Western Provinces and asked for their advice. From two
of the provinces I received the advice that
although it was believed that the Mennonites
in question were of a good class and would not
be any burden on the country, for they would
be taken care of by the Mennonites already
in the W,<est, yet, owing to the present feelings in the West, it was considered unwise
to bring in these immigrants. The third
Government made a statement to the newspapers to the effect that it had prevented me
from forcing a large number of foreign immigrants upon the province. That is another
illustration of what happens in politics.

JUNE 12, 1931
I noticed in a newspaper the other day a
paragraph, which perhaps was seen by some
of my honourable friends, referring to a poor
couple who lef t Poland some years ago and
settled in the United States. The man continued ta work at the same trade that he had
liad in the aid world. They had three children,
two girls and anc boy. One of those daughters
has become a famous editor, the othier a
novelist, and the son is Dr. Albert Michelson,
anc of the greatest scientists in North America
and, indeed, in the whole world. The parents
af this brilliant family were poor immigrants.

I have really no objection ta the registration of ahiens. There might be a little friction, as my hanaurable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Mu.rdock) lias pointed out, if
we required Americans, for exampIe, te register; but if thoey oomne to, this country and

Han. Mr. -CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: As ta aliens from other
foreign countries, there will nat be sa many
of them, because a great majarity of them are
taking out citizenship papers. It is surprising
what a long list is .published in the Canada
Gazette every month of immigrants wha have
become naturalized. I heard it said the other
day that immigration ta Canada had heen
entirely stopped. I think I shaîIl do no harm
hy stating that I am perfectly in accord with
the palicy that is being carried on by the
Immigration DepartTnent at the present time.
Immigrants are still coming here. The iast
year I was in the Departinent about 160,000
entered. and I notice from a recent repart
that over 100,000 came in in 1930. It is not
sa easy as many people may suppose ta put
an end ta immigration. There is a regulatian
which permits any Canadian citizen, whether
native born or naturalized, ta bring to Canada lis father, mother, brother or sister, s0
long as it can be shown that they will nat
be a burden upon the country. Sa long as
that law remaîns in farce it is likehy that
there will be at -least 100,000 persons coming
ta ýCanada from. the continen.t of Europe every
year.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Do we want tliem
now?

251

lion. Mr. FORKE: Perhaps we do not
want them, but I do flot think they will be any
great source of danger. The great mai ority
of people in Canada are fine, sane, lawabiding people, and a few Communists
among thema will nlot make much progress.
Perhaps the danger i.s greater under present
circurestances than it would be in normal
times, and I agree with the last speaker (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) that it is the duty of every one
of us to do what we -cani to, improve conditions
and bring in the day when aboundîng wealth
shall fot exist alongside of abject poverty.
One does flot need to be a Communist to
entertain these sentiments, or to desire to
level tbings as far as he is abl~e. I cannot,
understand how rich people can be happy
when others are in want of food and raiment
and shelter, and I think it should be the
effort of every senator and member of the
Huse of Commons to remedy tihe situation. 1 do flot want to, pretend that 1 am
any better than anybody else, but I sometimes
think that in these bad times we should forget
aur political partisan-ship and try to effect an
improvement in present conditions.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask'the
sponsor of this Bihl a question?
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If this Bill became
law, would it be neoessary for the senator
from Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke) and the
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
ta carry identification cards?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Are they aliens?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They were not born
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Are they aliens?
The honourable gentleman ought to know
that. He bas been a Cabinet Minister, and
if he does not know that, he neyer should
have been.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
the discussion of this question has directed
our attention to Russia and to the revolution
that took place in that country a few years
ago. As a rule, man is not a revolutionary
animal, but would rather live in peace, and
the history of mankind proves that lie will
suifer a great deal before he will resort ta
revolution.
Revolutions may not he always bad in
themselves. There was a revolution in France
nearly two hundred years aga, and I tbink
it produced good resuits: it made a better
country of France, and I think it had a good
effect an the world. The revolutiona.ry war

SENATE
in the United States had a good effect: it was
well for that country, and I think it was well
also for Great Britain. The overthrow of
Spanish rule in Sou'th America had good
results, and the revolution in Russia may produce some good. A short time ago the
Toronto Star had an editorial to the effect
that Russian Socialism or Socialism of that
brand, might bo Christianized, but that it
would be difficult to Christianize capitalisin.
Our friend who introduced this Bill (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) called attention to the horrible
state of affairs in Russia at the present time,
but he failed to mention the conditions in that
country under the old regime. They were
intolerable. The Church at that time, being
a department of the ýGovernment, seemed to
condone, and perhaps did condone to some
extent at least, the official depravity of the
ruling classes. As a result, hatred was ground
into the marrow of the bones of the people,
and they identified the Church with the State.
There were causes in Russia that "produced
the revolution.
If we concentrate entirely
upon conditions in that country we may lose
sight, as my honourable friend to my right
(Hôn. Mr. Murdock) has sai-d, of the situation
in Canada and the rest of North America.
We shall not have revolution here unless there
is cause for it. We need not worry about
that.
Are conditions in Russia to-day as bad as
they are painted? 'There is a suspicion in the
minds of many people that a great deal of
what we hear is propaganda. The honourable
gentleman who introduced this measure (Hon.
iMr. Casgrain) referred to an eminent engineer
of the United States, Col. Cooper, who went
to Russia some time ago, lived there, and took
part in the work of the country. Presumably
he should know the circumstances pretty well.
When Col. Cooper came back to the United
States he said that conditions in Russia were
not at all as they had been painted. My
honourable friend who introduced the Bi-l said
that Col. Cooper was paid for saying that kind
of thing. That is an insinuation that I do not
think was justified.
Lest in our eagerness to improve the situation in Russia we lose sight of conditions in
Canada, I will refer to an editorial appearing
in the Montreal Star of June 4 of this year.
It is headed "The Unemployed," and reads:
An imediate crisis faces the city. There
are vast numbers of genuine unemployed still
walking our streets in dire need. A certain
amount of proniscuous, uneoncerted aid is
being given by charitable organizations and
individuals. The Dufferin School was elosed
in April. but it will soon be necessary to do
somnething to relieve the distress. People cannot be left to starve to death, with suicide as
the only alternative.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

Such is the situation in the city of Montreal, and it is worse in the West, although this
is the spring of the year in Canada, the land
of plenty, and it can, I think, be truly said
that Canada is better off than any other country in the world, even the republic to the
south. Is there anything much worse than
that in Russia?
Now, the origin of the conditions prevailing not only in Cenada and in the United
States, but all over the civilized world, does
not date from yesterday. They must be due to
causes that have existed for a great number
of years-for decades, perhaps for centuriesand our attention might well be devoted to
trying to effect some improvement. I think
the attention of the whole world ought to
be directed to that phase.
I read in some of the newspaperns a few
days ago that Sir George Paish had said-I
believe I am quoting him correctly-that
revolutions were inevitable unless drastie
changes were made in the economic condition
of the world. What is the economie condition of the world? I have much fault to
find with what, for want of a better term, I
will call capitalism, a system under which the
strong have very little regard for the weak.
Almsgiving can never take the place of
justice. There is a good deal of almsgiving
in the world, but there is not much justice in
the business world of Christendom. We should
seriously reflect upon the situation in Canada.
There should not be in this country acute
destitution, following widespread unemployment, while we have also wealth and abundance. If we take care of that situation we
need not worry about revolution; if we do
not, we may have something to cause us
concern.
In the last century a thoughtful and forceful
writer compared the human race to a caravan
crossing a desert. I will try to paraphrase his
views. In order that the caravan might fairly
represent the human race, it had to consist of
all kinds and conditions of people-the weak
and the strong, the prudent and the imprudent, the generous and the covetous. In
the desert water would be a prime necessity,
and presumably those composing the caravan
would have sense enough to carry with them
sufficient water to supply them to the end of
their journey. The prudent, however, knowing
that the imprudent would not carry enough
water for their needs, provided themselves
with more than enough for their own use.
Now, by natural justice those persons who
through their own intelligence and physical
efforts had that extra supply of water and
provided it in a place where water did not
naturally exist would be entitled to sell it

a person believes that the natural resources
of the country, such as the land, should be
used for the common good, he is not a Comnunist at al], but an individualist. Henry
George believed in that sort of thing. But
I am not so much concerned with that point
now. I am inclined to think that the extent
to which Communism has taken hold in Canada is very much exaggerated.
The only
place about which I have any definite information in this respect is the city in which
I live, Toronto. Last year the alleged menace of Communism there resulted in a great
deal of police activity and alarm, which were
at their height at the time of the Dominion
election.
Yet a candidate who stood for
election as a Communist received only 623
votes out of a total of about 158,000 cast in
the city, or approximately two-fifths of one
per cent of the total vote.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is because so
many of them are not naturalized.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I do not know exactly
how many were naturalized. Certainly there
was a strong agitation, as I have said, and
everyone expected that the Communists would
make a big showing.
Whatever the situation is in regard to
Communism. I do not think that identification
cards are the best means of dealing with it.
We cannot defend religion or family life by
making men register in the way suggested
here. These are spiritual matters and ought
to be attended to by the churches and
similar organizations, because a merely legal
regulation will not produce the desired results.
I agree with my honourable friend from King's
(Hon. Mr. Hughes) that social discontent cannot. be prevented by a measure of this kind.
Hon.

Mr. vORKE.

The only remedy is social justice. I have
no doubt that our institutions and general
conditions in Canada are ýfar superior to those
in Russia. On the result of a comparison of
that kind may depend the solution of the
problem which we have been considering. We
must kee.p our institutions superior to those
of Russia; we must offer the Russians better
social justice than they can get in their own
country. So long as we offer men a better
chance here than they can get in Europe, I
do not think we shall need to worry very
much -about Bolshevism. I do not know
much about Russia, and I do not pretend to
be able to tell what will happen in that
country, but I know that in the long run the
issue of the question that we have been considering will depend upon whether Canada or
Russia makes the best provision for the social
justice and welfare of its people.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, may I take this opportunity of disclaiming any intention through this Bill of insulting people who come here from other
countries. Of course, everyone is free to place
whatever interpretation he may choose upon
a measure of this kind, but I cannot sec how

gentleman who was formerly in charge of the
Department of Immigration (Hon. Mr. Forke)
lias told us that registration bas been carried
on for a long time; the difference being that
if this Bill is passed the immigrants can
prove their registration by an identification
card. Under our law people who corne here
with the intention of remaining cannot become Canadians for at least five years. There
is a distinction made with regard to them:
they have not all the privileges that the 'rest
of our people enjoy; they cannot take any
part in the government of the country. But
does any one of them consider that as an insult? May I say to the honourable gentleman fron South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
tlat those who have sponsored and supported
this Bill have no intention that it should be
interpreted as a slur upon immigrants.
Let me remind honourable members that
legislation of the kind proposed here is in
force in almost every country of Europe, and
there is no resentment on the part of those
who have to submit to it. People who obey
the laws are not put to any inconvenience,
and besides they get a certain amount of protection by registering. Enemies of a country
are the only persons who would be interfered
with by legislation of this kind. They are the

JUNE 12, 193125
people who have to be wa-tched and dealt with
as necessity arises, and they are the ones who
objeet te registering. It may be of interest
te honourable members te know that Montreal recently passed a by-law providing for
voluntary registration and identification by
means of cards. I have one of the carda in
my hand now. There is nothing compulsory
about it, but the holders of carda flnd them an
aid te identification whenever there is an
election, for instance. Up to date no less than
65,000 of these carda have been iasued, ail at
the request of citizens.
Now, I should like te say a few words in
reply to the remarks made by my henourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
who is an officer of a railway union. I read
te the Bouse this afternoon a report which
clearly stated that the legitimate unions have
expelled Communists fromn their membership
and have waged a determined flght against
them.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I say just a
word in explanation? Among the railroad services there are five organizations: the Order
of Railroad Telegraphers, to which my honourable friend 'the Minister of Labour (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) belongs; the Order of Railway Conductors, which the other day e ected
a Canadian as its President; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen,
and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen,
te which I belong. One of these organizations is affiliated wi.th the American Federation of Labour, of which the President is
William Green, the gentleman who was referred te by my honourable friend from
MontarviHle (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). The other
four unions are net se affiliated. The organization te whioh I belong, fer example,
has a membership of 185,000 and does net
belong te the American Federation , although
we co-operate, as do the other organizations
mentioned. Now, perhaps I can assume-I
have ne right te state this definîtey-that any
labour erganizatien, whether connected with
the American Federation or net, probably has
within its ranks some members who would
like te do this and that, if they had a chance
and could succeed in their object.
Dees my honHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
ourable friend's union expel Communists from
membership? Bas it expelled them?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If we could prove
that they were Communists unquestionably
we would. We have expelled time and time
again men who participate in illegal strikes.
It is often bard te prove certain things in a

labour organization; one dees net know who
the jury will be and with just what views
they wiIl sympathize. But, as organizations,
we try te bit the Communists on the head
and keep them in their place.
Hon. Mr. CAiSGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DONNUIULY: In the remarks I
made I had ne intention of implying that one
of the purposes of the honourable gentlemen
who moved and secended this Bill was te insuIt immigrants. But as I listened te the discussion the thought occurred te me that it
wou:ld be an insuit te require registration of
people who have been here for two or three
years and have net yet taken eut citizenship
papers; and I am still of that opinion. If this
Bill passes we shall be f orcing these people
te go threugh a precess of registering, just as
they did when they first entered the country.
And consider how young people of sixteen
or eighteen years of age, for example, will
feel. They will thînk that they have been
placed in a suspected. class and earmnarked, if
we require them te register.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
senaters, on the previeus occasion when xny
honourable friend from De Lanaudiere (Hon.
'Mr. Casgrain) brought in a similar Bill, I expressed my views on the question of the registration of aliens. I still hold the same views.
I have net based my conclusion on pointa
that have been stressed in the argumenta we
have heard against Bolshevik propaganda. It
seems te me that the principal object of the
propesed legisiation is te prevent the spread
of propaganda in this country hy foreign
agents. I am net quite satisfied that the danger is as great as has been pictured te us.
There may be a certain number of undesirable
aliens in our midst, but I have been told that
the most advanced propagandists are Canadians.
Hon. Mr. PORKE: Scotchmen.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: If that be true,
it shows that Communism may well be developed from within. Can we stop the influx
of ideas by barriers at our frontiers? I doubt
Communisma will grow
it very much.
wherever the soil is suitable for it, and misery
is a splendid breeding ground.

article in which it was stated that capitalismn

would be tested during the year 1931. The
capitalistic system can survive only if it allows
every man to live. That is why I have come
to the conclusion that we must provide unemployment insurance, to which the employer
will subscribe. The employer who engages
men when industrial activity is at its peak
and he needs the maximum amount of labour,
must learn that when orders cease to flow in
he cannot lay off ten, fifteen or twenty per
cent of the men, many of them with families,
just as he would stop a piece of machinery,
and expect to be able to recall them in two
or three months, when conditions improve.
The employers and the State must both contribute, as must also the employee for his
own satisfaction and in order that he may
retain his self-respect. This in my opinion is
the solution of the problem. and the necessity
of it, I believe, will be impressed upon us
before the end of the present Parliament.
Some years ago a student in mechanics
devoted himself to a study of the psychology
of labour. In order to carry on his investigations he put on overalls and for two years
moved about among the labouring element
of Pittsburg and other places. What he found
led him to the belief that what poisoned the
minds of the labouring people was the conA man who
stant fear of unemployment.
while employed could keep his family in
confort was always confronted with the possibility of being laid off because of lack of
work, and this insecurity was the torment of
his soul from one end of the year to the other.
The fear of hunger, more especially for his
little ones and his wife, is one of the elements
of a man's discontent; and apart from unemployment insurance I have not yet seen
any proposal that would meet the situation
and allay that fear.
As to the registration of aliens, what is now
asked, as has been stated by the honourable
gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), is that everv alien shall apply for and
carry a registration card. In view of the very
illuminating statement made by the honourable member from Brandon (H-on. Mr. Forke),
Ihat everv alien is now, as a matter of fact,
registered in the Department of Immigration,
I do not see that there can be any great
iîfficilty in the registration cf aliens, or any
great reluctnce on their part to receiving
and carrying such a card. In many countries
in Europe it is necessary to register. A newcomer signs a statement giving particulars as
to the time he came into the country, where
he is going toHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This statement
is made in duplicate, and the copy is sent to
the police authorities at the next place that
lie is goina to visit. There are in Paris from
day to day, on the average, about 250,000
foreigners, and on the coast of the Mediterranean and elsewhere in France there are
many others, ail of whom obey the law and
register.
The idea of registration interests me particularly, as I said the other day, in connection with protecting Canada from invasion by
criminals from the United States. With our
great ]ength of border it is quite easy, as we
ail know, for criminals in motor cars to enter
this country. I an sure that within the last
three months at least a dozen of these men,
armed with revolvers, have been arrested for
holding up citizens or entering banks in the
eity of Montreal. With the modern methods
of rapid transportation something of the kind
proposed is becoming more and more a neThe foreigners already in Canada

are registered under our immigration laws. If
they are not, they are in the country illegally. M4y honourable friend from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) has spoken of thousands
of Americans in the West. I do not know
whether hey are there permanently or only
teml)orarily.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Or legally?
lon. Mr. DANDURAND: If it is their
intention to remain in Canada I should be
surprised to learn that they had continued to
live in this country for five years without
taking out Canadian citizenship papers. The
only inconvenience that an alien would suffer
under the proposed legislation is the necessity
of having to carry an identification card for
five years, as at the end of that time he can
apply for naturalization. I believe that protection from the scum of the cities of the large
country to the south of us, with its population
of 120,000,000, would be welcomed by the
cities of Canada.

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Would the honourable gentleman have the Act apply to the
hundreds of thousands of American tourists

I do not know whether under the iaw of
Canada to-day Americans who cross the
frontier are askcd for passports, but I know
that whenever I go to New York I arn asked
for mine. I suppose a similar law could be
enforced on this side.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It seems to me
that in the minds of some honourable gentlemen there is an idea that this legisiation will
apply oniy to aliens. Section 3 says that

Ai.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I miglit explain that
when tourists corne into Canada tliey register
as visitors and get autliority fromn the Immigration Department to remain in the
country for a certain length of tirne. Also,
when any alien applies for citizenship papers
an inquiry is sent from the Secretary of State
to the Department of Immigration to ascertain
wlietlier lie is properly in the country. In
rnany cases it is discovered that lie lias no
riglit to be liere at ail.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable members, I do nlot rise to discuss
the general question. I expressed rny views
witli reference to identification wlien my
honourabie friend's (Hon. Mr. Casgrain's)
first Bill was introduced. I have no objection
at ail to the Bill being read a second time,
provided tliat it is sent to a speciai committee
to be thorouglily exarnined, and that I arn not
bound to the principie of the Bill.
There are grave difficulties, I think, in the
practical application and administration of
sucli a Bill. A dog on the street is tagged,
maybe rnuzzied; a cow is xnarked witli a slit
in the ear or some mark on the liorn; but
there is somcthing repugnant to that sovereign
being, Man, in being tagged and met witli a
demand for lis photograpli and identification
card, especialy if hie lias been in the country
for years, lias raised a family, and lias been
a good, law-abiding citizen. There is another
class of people that I sliould like to see tagged,
and thus made capable of identification.* In
fact. I sliouid like t-hem to he kept in leash.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And muzzled?

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
They pass our frontiers and resid-e for a
period in Canada in our hotels or boarding
houses, or thc like. I should like to differentiate. Possibly, after exarnination, we can
produce a ineasure that wiil be fair to ail;
that xviii not bic burniiating to any who are
undescerving of humiliation, and yet xviii catch
the law.-breaker. Wlien twenty automobiles
pss in over a certain route, in order to catch
the bandit we have to stop and examine every
one. There rnay be a rnethod of avoiding
offence to a very large and wortliy class of
people who are living in this coun'try and are
helping to develop Canada and its resources.
I stili adhere to the opinion I expressed
before that this measure is more necessary
and more easily applied in the large cities
than clsewliere; and I iinderstand that it is
within the pyower of the municipalities to
make sucli regulations as are necessary in order
to identify criminals.
I listened to the disquisition of my lionourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
as to the cure of aiýl our ilis. The numaber of
"ecures"~ is arnazing, and equaliy arnazing is
the number of "soie causes" of ail our present
troubles. Ail this teaches me that we have
to bic very patient, very discriminating and
very wise, and that we must go deeper than
identification cards before we strike bottom,
so to speak, in rearranging our social and
economie systems-maybe even our political
systern-in readiness for the new marci forward which to my mind is certainly in sig.ht.
AIL social and economic systerns are undergoing a change. There is a ferment in
the co'untry that reaches througli ail these,
and it is only by experience, by'experimentation perhaps, that we shahl corne te a plan
by which ail the activities of the human
race will be raised to a higlier plane, in
which co-operation and human synipatliy will
play an important part. The maldistribution
of wcalth is the great trouble. As a remedy
one offers the old age pension-that reaches
a cl'ass; another offers unempioyment insurance-that reaches everybody wlio is net at
work; another offers co-operation between
labour and capital-and I incline to the
belief that this is the medium through which
betterment wilI ultimately corne. When a
iabouring man lias not -merely the w.ageearner's interest, but an actual interest in
the industry in whieli lie is employed, and
when there is a prohibition, so to speak, of
over-returns to capital, I th-ink we shal have
peace. I do not believe that identification
cards and tags xviii soive the problem. Neyertheless, I amn willing that haîf a dozen of our
ablest members sliould apply their best

RELATIONS OF SENATOR WITH
DOMINION GOVERNMENT
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable senators, I crave the indulgence of the House
for a few minutes while I reifer to a matter
which concerns me personally. I want to state
at the outset that no honourable member
feels more deeiply than I the obligation resting upon me to give my colleagues an explanation with regard to certain articles that
have appeared in an Ottawa daily newspaper,
one on the 9th of this month and the other
this morning. I had hoped to give the House
a thorough and candid explanation before this.
Until a few hours ago I expected to be in
a position to do so to-day, but I now find
that I shall not have the necessary documents
until the House meets again. The case with
which I was concerned was tried here at Ottawa before Mr. Justice McEvoy. On the 9th
of the month I requested the reporter to
furnish me at the earliest possible moment
with a certified copy of the evidence, together
with the remarks of the trial judge and his
reasons for judgment. I had hoped to have
these documents to-day, but I have not yet
received them, although I have telegraphed
the reporter almost daily to have them sent
on to me at once.
The matter referred to in the newspaper
was fully dealt with by the trial judge, Mr.
Justice MeEvoy, early in the month. In his
judgment be decided that there had been no
breach, not even a technical breach, of the
Independence of Parliament Act. I repeat, it
is necessary for me to have the judgment and
the other papers to which I have referred in
order to give my honourable colleagues the
full and thorough explanation to which they
are certainly entitled. Since the trial judge,
after considering the whole question, found
that there had been no breach whatever of
the Independence of Parliament Act, I have
consulted a number of very eminent lawyers,
some of them honourable members of this
House, and they entirely concur in the judge's
decision. Personally I feel I have nothing
whatever to reproach myself with in the
transaction in question. At no time did I
have the slightest share in the voting of these
moneys by Parliament, and it was only after

JUNE 12, 1931
the matter was through that I knew that the
moneys had been voted, for the specifie purpose of advertising; so at no time did my
parliamentary position or connection become
mixed up or concerned in any way whateverx
with the voting of these moneys. It is true
that when the matter was put into the hands
of a committee I did endeavour to place
before the chairman of that committee the
proposition which the newspaper in England
asked me to make. That was done openly
and squarely, and the correspondence which
has been filed in the court records will show
that there was absolutely no attempt whatever at any improper use of influence. The
proposition was submitted on behaif of my
client exact]y as it had been made to me. I
did flot seek it. He wrote to me and asked
me to undertake it, stating that hie had
already discussed the matter with two or three
of the Ministers--and I think hie mentioned,
among others, my honourable friend from
Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke).
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do flot know ta
what the honourable gentleman is alluding.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn referring ta
the committee of which I think my honourable friend was a member. in connection with
advertising for the Government in 1927. 1
think the honourable senator from Brandon
(Hon. Mr. Forke), Hon. Mr. Malcolm, Hon.
Mr. Heenan and Hon. Mr. Stewart were
members of that committee. 1 did not see
my honourable fricnd (Hon. Mr. Forke) at
ail in that matter; my dealings wcre entirely
with the chairman of the committea. The
matter Ivas submitted to him and ta the
committee, and the committee decided ta
continue the contract, which had been. in
existence with the newspaper for nearly
twenty-five years beforé. There were certain
modifications, of course. It had new features,
which I ,undertook, at the request of the
editor, to place before and explain to the
committec.
Now, that is the whole thing. There is
nothing else in it. It was entirely a departmentai matter. It was not in any sense a parliamentary matter. It had ceased to be that.
I feel absolutely confident that when the
facts are before my honourable colleagues in
this House they will agree that there could
not possibly have been any breach of the
Independence of Parliament Act. I hope
ta be in a position -on Tuesday next, when
the House resumes, to place before honourable members ail the evidence given at the
trial, as well as the judgment. In the mean22112- 17).

time I hope I amn not asking too much when
I request my honourable friends io suspend
their iudgment unt-il they are fully advised
of ail the facts. I admit that the matter
has worried me considerably. The mere fact
that somebody may have thought that there
had been on my part a breach of the law
has giveu me a great deal of worry, and my
great regret is that 1 have not been in a
position before thýis ta place ail the facts hafore this honourable House.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
senators, a large number of members on this
side of the Huse had asked me ta caîl attention to the matter referred ta. I decided to,
do so, and since I came into the CharnIer
this afternoon I wrote to my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) notifying him of
my intention. This is a question which is
important to ail honourable members. As
leader of the House I feel I am concerned
with its dignity and honour, and I thought it
was my duty ta intimate to my honourable
friend, as 1 did this afternoon, that I wou.ld
speak on this subi ect, and that lie could make
his reply. He stated to me verbally, after
receiving my note, that lie was flot prepared
ta go on to-day, but would be prepared at
the next sitting of the House, which will be on
Tuesday night. I amn not going ta comment
on the statement of my honourable frîend,
nor anticipate any remarks that hie may make.
Many honourable members held the view,
saine of them even more strongly than I did,
that because of the two editorials that had
appeared in the Ottawa Journal, which. is a
very important and representative newspaper,
the matter should be brought to the attention
of the House. If the honourable the senior
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) had
omitted to make an explanation it would have
been the duty of myself, as guardian of the
lionour of the House, ta hring up the question. As my honourable friend lias stated
that hie will make a fuller explanation when
hie has the necessary documents at hand, whidh
will le at aur next sitting, I arn satisfied that
honourable nmbers will understand that
nothing further can be done at present.

Prayers and routine proceedings.
STATUE OF SIR JOHN A. MACDONALD
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the Government:
Whether the department of government
having authority in regard to the grounds at
Parliament Building, Ottawa, is aware that
during several months the memorial statue of
Sir John A. Macdonald on said grounds bas
been discoloured and unsightly; and why action
bas noft been taken to restore said statue to
normal condition.
I have a
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
statement from the Deputy Minister of Public
Works, as follows:
With reference to the above inquiry in
regard to the statue of Sir John A.
Macdonald it is found that the discolouration
on this monument is verdigris and that otherwise the statue is clean.
Monuments and copper roofs in Ottawa
become discoloured on account of there being
sulphuric acid in the air as a result of the
pulp and paper plants operating in the vicinity
of Ottawa. This is a condition over which the
Department bas no control, and nothing can be
donc to have the copper in monuments in
Ottawa kept a brown colour.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I should like to ask the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) whether the proximity of the
Parliament Buildings has anything to do
with the sulphuric acid that affects the
monuments on Parliament Hill. The window
of my room overlooks the statue of Sir
John A. Macdonald, and I have often
wondered why the tarnished condition of
this monument had never been drawn to the
attention of the House. I am glad that the
honourable member for Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) lias^ referred to it. But there are
other statues on the Hill that need furbishing. That of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria is one.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In answer to
the honourable gentleman I may say that
the atmosphere in this Chamber, in which
we live and have our parliamentary being,
is always placid and pure, and I am sure it
would not tarnish any of the monuments.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Paper, which relate to private bills, were
both on the Order Paper for second reading

discussion to-night, and if honourable members have no objection I would ask that the
bills to which I have referred be given the
second reading now, so that they may be sent
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce
for consideration.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
have no objection to giving way to the request of my honourable friend behind me.
Some matters have intervened since I made
the motion that the Order in which I am
interested be placed at the head of the list,
and, all things considered, it probably would
be as well for me to more that this Order
be discharged, to be placed first on the Order
Paper for to-morrow, so that I may give way
also to the statement which my honourable

thereon.

PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable
members of the Senate, may I now make the
statement which I arn expected to make respecting the matter with which I deait briefly
on Friday hast?
The action taken by Belcourt, Leduc &
Genest, and myseif as a member of the flrm,
was for a fee (not a commission, as alleged)
offered in writing by thie dlefendant, the
Canada Newspaper Company, for professional
services in a departmental matter.
For many years and under different Governmentms, the Canada Newspaper Company
had been advertising Canada and the activities of its departments, and had been paid
for such publicity. My services covered
about one year, and consisted in explaining
and completing the proposed arrangement
which the 'Canada Company inf'ormed me ini
their first letter they had already submitted.
to the departments concerned.
In that letter the Company also informed
me that modifications in previous arrangements or contracts of the same nature had
been already submitted and explained to the
departments concerned.
When I started the negotiations with the
Department, it was aware that I was acting
for the Company merely in my professional
capacity as departmental agent.

:52

SENATE

The business was taken up and carried on
in the manner and in accordance with usages
of local solicitors who act as agents before
the Supreme Court of Canada, the Exchequer
Court, the Federal Railway Board and the
several departments of the Government. I
did not have, never had, never asked for, and
never was promised, any interest in the defendant company or in any contract they hai
or hoped to havs with any department of the
Government. I was not seeking, and at no
time did I seek, personally to take part
in or be concerned with a contract involving
the expenditure of publie money.
The action brought did not claim, and the
judgment rendered did not in any way affect
or concern, public moncy. The money involved covered merely my services and those
of my firm and was payable by the Canada
Newspaper Company.
If never occurred to me that anyone could
suggest that in doing what I did, that is,
acting professionally as a departmental agent
in a departmental matter, J could possibly
be accused of a breach of the Independence
of Parliament Act. It must be obvious to
everyone that if I had had any doubt as to
the correctness of my situation, no legal action
would have been taken against the company.
With the permission of my honourable
friends, I shall read the judgment itself:
In the Supreme Court of Ontario
Belcourt, Leduc & Genest vs The Canada
Newspaper Co.. Linsited.-Tried before the
Hon. Mr. Justice McEvoy at Ottawa,
Noix-Jury Sitting, May 29, 1931 and June 2,
1931.
A. E. Fripp, Esq., K.C., and Paul Leduc, Esq.,

counsel for the

Plaintiffs;

O. M. Biggar, Esq., K.C., Counsel for the
Defendants.
Oral Judgment
His Lordship: This is an action brought by

Senator Belcourt

against

fie Canada News-

paper Company to recover a fee for services
rendered in the securing or endeavouring to
secure an arrangeisent by which the Govern-

ment of Canada should place the publication of

the defendants in a large numuber of reading
roonis and public places in the United Kingdon.
It is not contended by either of the parties,

nor is there anything in the evidence which

would indicate, that the manner of seeking to
bring Canada favourably before the people of
the British Isles was not desirable, nor that the
inanner proposed by the defendants to procure
a usefuxl kind of publicity was not a riglxt and
proper and fair way to proceed.
There is not the slightest indication that the
services which the niewspaper coipany proposed
to give to the Governmîeînt of Canada were nlot
services worthy of the price that the newspaper
compaiy were proposing they should be paid,
nor is there any indication thatf the Government was paying fori anything except what iwas
fair and reasonable for the services that the
Coveriiient were to give.
Hoi.

Mr.

BELCOURT.

I find upon the evidence that there was a firmx

contract

between

fendant.

J need not go into the details of it.

the

plaintiff

and the

de-

For the purpose of determining this case the

details are of no importance.

The contract was

in substance one arrived at in this way.

The

defendants w rote to the plaintiff and said, "If
you will sec to it that we get a contract that
the Governnent will pays us a certain price for
placing 3,000 of our publications in publie places
in the British Empire, we will pay you $5,000."

I find as a fact that the Senator accepted
that contract, and that there was a firm contract made in that way: that for getting the
payosent for 3,000 subscriptions for placing

these publications on public tables lie would
get $5,000. and the detail about it dces not

seen to nie to be of any importance. That is
the substance of the contract.
I find as a fact that the Senator made some

efforts.

I think the efforts were not efforts

that required a great deal of time, but J find

as a fact that his efforts were effective and useful to the defendants in the securing of a countract. H1e wras not able to make a contract with
the Goversnsement of the kind that was in the
mind of the Senator and in the minds of the
newspaper comîpany when they made their contract. They eaclh one thouglt then. and contracted then, that it w-as to be $5,000 for 3.000
subscriptions.
Wlat happened was that the best efforts
that the Senator could inake, and aided and
abetted by sucb help as thle defendants thei-

selves could give-and they gave some help,

becauîse they interviewed members of the Governmîîîent when they were in the Old Country,
and no doubt lent some help, but when they
hiad expended the very best that they all had
put together, they were not able te get an
order for 3.000 copies. The most they could
get was 2,200 copies.
Mr. Fripp:
Subscriptions, msy Lord.
His Lordship: You may call them subscriptions.
What the Goverînent were wanting
was 2.200 copies placed on the public tables.
There is no doubt upon the evidence that in
order to place the 3,000 copies, or 2,200 copies
upon the public tables effectively, contemxplated
in the mind of the newspaper people, I aim
satisfied looking at the whiole of the corre-

spondence, before the matter wras finally set,

both parties realized. that is, the Senator, the

Governmîent and fbe newspaper people, realized

that to produce the kind of paper that it was
proposed to put iupon the tables, meant an investing of a considerable amsount of capital by
the newspaper people; and the newspaper
people correlated that with the fact that they
needed the 3.000 copies to work out their plan
in such a way as to make it a commercial
proposition. What I nean by that is, if they
got 3,000 they believed that they could proceed
to maike the extension they had in mind, do the
work in the way they had represented to the
Government wlien they were trying to get the
contract that they would do it.
I think further that all the parties liad it
in mind that if they got less thanî 3,000 of
these subscriptions, or paynents for placing
papers on the tables as they suggested, that
financially that vas not going to be worth while
to theinewspaper people. I do not think that
there w as any lack of knowledge on the part
of the Senator, or on the part of Mr. Lefroy,
or anybody concerned about that. They all

JUNE 16, 1931
knew it, and they were working away at this
proposition with that in their minds all the
time.
I find as. a fact that when the Senator had
:lone the best he could, and the correspondence
time when
I think shows it plainly, there was Ia cannot get
he came te the conclusion, "Now,
2,000 is about my
3,000 in subscriptions, and
limit." I find as a f act that he communicated
that te Mr. Lefroy. The correspondence indicates it, and the evidence of both Lefroy and
the Senator make it plain te me that there
was a time when that situation arose, and when
that situation arose I find as a fact that the
Senator then said in word and act, "I cannot
get you 3,000 subscriptions. I cannot get the
Government to pay for that, and I am ready
to quit."
The defendants then were not ready te quit.
They thought, and I think they believed they
had a good reason te think, that further effort
and further struggle would raise the number
of subscriptions up te the desired amount, and
they led the Senator then te proceed further.
i find that at the meeting in the defendants'
office in London, upon the oral evidence and
the correspondence, that there never was any
figure settled as te the amount of the reductien that it was proposed the Senator should
take in his fee, but it was discussed and
suggested that if they could net get the 3,000
subscriptions, that he ought te take a reduction in his fee, and both the Senator and Mr.
Lefroy say the Senator rejected that. Sometimes it is said he rejected it indignantly, but
I find as a fact that he did reject it. And I
find as a fact that in those circumstances the
defendants in effect asked-I do net know
whether they did in actual words on any occasion-but the result was that the Senator was
induced or encouraged te proceed on with the
matter and sec what he could do.
In the result a contract was obtained for
2,200 subscriptions. The defendants were content te take that contract, and I hold as a
matter of fact that they took the contract
in substitution for the whole 3,000 subscriptiens. They were at all times, up till they began
te dispute about the payment, in a position
te have said, "We will net accept the contract
you bring us at al]." Or, they were in a position in which they might have said, "We will
accept the contract, but we will net pay you
the full amount we agreed."
''hey did net do either. They accepted the
best he could bring. and he brought the best
he could get.
In those circumstances I am net able te see
that I ought te consider the matter upon the
ground of a quantumn meruit. In my view
either the Senator did them a service that they
vere willing te accept as the service that they
contracted for; net that it was all that they
contraeted for, but it was a service that they
were willing te accept as in lieu of what they
contracted for.
I think if he has net gone far enough te
establish that, then the position taken by Mr.
Biggar must prevail, because he has net claimed
under a quantum meruit. What he bas said is,
"I gave you what you accepted instead of the
thing you contracted for, and therefore you
must pay me what you agreed."
None of the statutory defences raised work
a defence for the defendants.
T think my judgment must be upon that basis,
and therefore, there will be judgment for theamount, etc.

I desire to add just these few words
Repeating the words,
to the judgmeut.
"None of the statutory defences raised work a
defence for the defendants," I think they mean,
of course, that in the opinion of the judge, or
court, in acting as I did in the matter referred to, merely as agent, I infringed in no
way the statute known as the Independence
of Parliament Act.
To this statement I would merely add a
letter which I received yesterday from a
very eminent counsel, an ex-judge of the
Superior Court of the Province of Quebec,
and then I shall have finished:
Montreal, June 16, 1931.
Honourable N. A. Belcourt,
Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir,You ask me what is the meaning of the
word "concerned" in the first paragraph of
section 21 of chapter 147 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927.
Sections 10 to 24 of said chapter 147 concern
the independence of the members of the House
of Commons and of the members of the Senate.
Section 21 reads as follows:
"No person, who is a member of the Senate,
shall directly or indirectly, knowingly and
wilfully be a party te or be concerned in any
contract under which tlie public money of
Canada is to be paid.
"2. If any person, who is a member of the
Senate, knowingly and wilfully becomes a party
te or concerned in any such contract, he shall
forfeit the sum of two hundred dollars for each
and every day during which he continues to be
such party or se concerned.
"3. Such sum may be recovered from him by
any person who sues for the same, in any court
of competent jurisdiction in Canada.
"4. This section shall net render any senator
liable for such penalties, by reason of his being
a shareholder in any incorporated company,
having a contract or agreement with the Government of Canada, except any company which
undertakes a contract for the building of any
public work."
The purpose of the Statute is quite evident.
A member of the House of Commons, or a
member of the Senate, should net be in a position where he will have te choose between his
interest and his duties towards the public.
What is prohibited by the Statute is to be
a party te a contract, or te take a share in or
a concern in a contract under which publie
money of Canada is to be paid.
One may net be a party te a contract, but
may have a share in. and interest in, or a
participation in a contract.
The word "concerned" as used in the Statute
clearly means "pecuniarily concerned or interested" (Section 16 uses the words "concerned
or intersted").
The exception contained in paragraph 4 'of
section 21-as te the interest of a shareholder
in an incorporated company-indicates that
what is prohibited is for a member of the
Senate te have a pecuniary interest in such
contract.
Yours very truly,
Charles Laurendeau.

SENATE
Having made my observations to the members of the Senate, I intend now to withdraw.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Before the honourable member withdraws will lie kindly give
me a little information on this point? I have
never seen a Government contract, as a
matter of fact, but in looking over the
statute I find that section 19 states:
In every contract, agreement or commission
to be made. entered into or accepted by any
person with the Government of Canada, or any
of the departnents or officers of the Government of Canada, there shall be inserted an
express condition, that no member of the House
of Commons shall be admitted to any share or
part of such contract, agreement or commission, or to any benefit to arise therefrom.
Now, would my honourable friend tell me
if that clause is always inserted in such contracts?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot say, but
i might be permitted to tell my honourable
friend that the section he bas just read is
entirely in accord with the other sections,
those which J have read, and to which the
judge has referred. The meaning is exactly
the same; there is no difference.
Hon. Sir ALLEN
B. AYLESWORTH:
Honourable memibers. mnay I be permitted to
say a few words with reference to this discussion before anything further is said?
J
wish to premise that I never heard of this
malter in any shape until Friday last, a few
minutes before the House sat, and I was not
here on Friday when the matter vas spoken
about on the floor of this Chamber.
But
since then T have read what appeared in
Hansard, and while I have not heard what
the honourable gentleman who has just left
the House (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) has been
reading or saying, I have understood that he
was enitering into a justification, I may call
it, of that with which he is charged. Now,
that is preciselyi what I think is not right,
and I wish, at the earliest possible moment,
to submit to the consideration of all honourable gentlemen that the discussion of the
matter should not be proceeded with.
As I understand. the whole conduct of the
honourable gentleman is the subject-matter
of a lawsuit which is now pending and has
not yet been finally decided. Certain charges
involving the conduct of the honourable
gentleman were made by a newspaper, and
thereupon he brought an action against
that newspaper-the ordinary action of libel,
defamation. In that action he has succeeded,
and judgment has been pronounced in his
favour, holding that in the opinion of the
Hon

Mr. BELCOURT.

judge he had conmitted no parliamentary
offence. From that decision the newspaper
has appealed, and, that appeal not yet having
been heard, any discussion of the rights or the
wrongs, the legality or the illegality of the
honourable gentleman's conduct, is necessarily
a discussion of the very question which is nov
standing for hearing before the Appellate
Court, and I humbly submit to you, honourable members, that it is not seemly or proper
that such a discussion should take place.
The honourable gentleman, as I understand,
read the opinion of the learned judge who
heard the cause and decided in his favour.
Suppose that decision had been the other
way, and suppose the honourable gentleman
were appealing from that decision to the higher
courts, would it not be manifestly improper
that he should exercise his right as a member
of this House to appeal to his colleagues?
Would it not be manifestly unfair to his
opponents in the case? Is it not equally unfair that this House should at the present
stage of this litigation enter into a discussion,
pro and con, perhaps, of the views which the
judge who has already heard the case has
expressed ?
Once the case is finally determined it is a
proper enough subject for discussion by the
public, or by anyone who pleases to discuss
it, and particularly by this House, which is
concerned with the privileges, duties and
obligations of its members. But I submit
that until that litigation is finally disposed of,
one way or the other, discussion would be
wrong. I say nothing about the rules of the
Senate; I am thinking, not of our rules, but of
what is right as between litigants whose cause
is before the courts; and I urge respectfully,
but as strongly as I am able, that it would
be a wrong thing for some members of this
House to express one view, and other members
of this House probably a diametrically opposite view, with regard to the merits of the
judgiment or decision which has already been
pronounced.
I urge, therefore, that any
further discussion of this subject should be
postponed.
The
Day.

Hon. the SPEAKER: Orders of the

Some Hon. SENATORS:

No, no.

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I shall make only a few remarks.
Personally I was not aware that the case in
question was under appeal. As a matter of
fact, I do not think that on this question of
privilege I am strictly in order; still less was
the honourable gentleman who preceded me;

JUNE 16, 1931
but this is a case in which we want to be, in
the highest degree, not only fair to but considerate of our honouraible colleague.
The honourable gentleman pleads the benefit of a judgment in his faveur. We learn
that that judgment is in the Court of Appeal,
and the honourable gentleman who has just
spoken (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) indicates
the impropriety of discussing, even in Parliament, a case pending before the courts. There
is a great deal to be said for that view, I
think.
There is another feature and I am not enlarging on the case at all. As I stated, I had
no animus in bringing this matter to the
attention of the House; my purpose was quite
the reverse; but the feeling of a large number
of honourable gentlemen on this side of the
House-

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: And on the other side
too.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: -on the other
side too, I have heard since-was that it was
a matter that should be brought before this
House, and that the honourable gentleman
should be invited to make a statement. In
the most pleasant way that I could, I invited
him to do so. The honourable gentleman has
made that statement, and, the question being
under appeal, it is quite in order, I should
think, for it to stand for the time being. The
Independence of Parliament Act provides for
a pecuniary penalty, and, under certain circumstances, for the forfeiture of a member's
seat; but in this House we frequently appeal
to a higher code and discuss what is in keeping with the dignity and the honour of this
House from the moral and ethical point of
view. I am nat going to enlarge upon that.
The honourable member from Toronto
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) has said that we
should not proceed further, and I am in agreement with his opinion. I hope my honourable
friends behind me will accede to that view.
The case is before the courts, and when it is
finally decided the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) will probably want to
supplement what he has said to-night. As
I said in the beginning, I was unaware that
the suit was in appeal.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
members, while I agree with what has been
said by my leader (Hon. Mr. Willoughby),
I would point out that the honourable the
senior member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) in a frank statement of his case shows
us that the root or kernel of the whole matter
is that he was offered $5,000 as a commission
to secure a contract from the Government-

265

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Not a commission.
Hon. Mr. COPP: A retainer.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: In my opinion it
boils down to a commission, nothing more
and nothing less; and whether or not it comes
within the scope of the Act which lie quoted,
or under the penalty provisions, I feel that a
principle of British justice has been violated,
a principle which should not need a law to
enforce its observance. Under the circumstances I will say no more about it. At present, that is my opinion.
Hon. I. R. TODD: Honourable senators,
I think there is one point in connection with
this matter that should be cleared up before
tte subject is dropped. The honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) has referred to a libel suit. I
understand that there has been no suit for
libel in connection with the matter.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I had not
heard of libel before.
Hon. Mr. TODD: The suit was brought
against the Canada Newspaper Company for
the payment of an account, and it seems to me
that the Senate will be put in a rather queer
light if the statement goes out that it was
discussing a libel suit when really there was
no libel suit. I think that point should be
eleared up. If there was a libel suit, I should
like to hear of it.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Is the action
brought by the honourable member from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) against the Canada Newspaper Company in appeal?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Yes, it has been
appealed.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I understand
that it has beçn appealed.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: That is what is referred to, I imagine.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable members,
I fail to see how the question of an appeal
affects this matter in any great degree. The
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
admitted quite frankly that lie acted in the
capacity of a go-between for this concern in
its dealings with the Government of Canada.
That being admitted, what difference does it
make whether the case is appealed or not? I
may state frankly the view of the general
public after reading the statement that appeared in the press. If the man on the street
was asked his opinion after reading the article
in regard to a certain senator having been
accused of securing a contract with the Government, his reply was: "I have read it, and

SENATE

Î6

I consider the affair a public outrage." That
is an expression that I have heard on more
than one occasion during the past few days.
Why this matter should be held over until
the appeal is heard I cannot see. If the honourable gentleman is guilty of doing what
the public press has accused hinm of doing,
then I cannot see the use of splitting hairs
about the law. The point is that the statement has been made publicly that this senator
has had a contract with a certain newspaper
to act as a go-between for it in its dealings
with the Government.
Honourable
DANDURAND:
R.
Hon.
members, I knew nothing of this matter until
it came before the Senate on Friday of la.%t
week, and now I have heard read the judgment rendered by the court. I surmise that
the defendant raised the question of the right
to recover in view of the statute that has
been a'lluded to, and that the judge who heard
the case dismissed that plea. Surely nobody
would expect any legal gentleman in this
Chamber who had just heard the reading of
the judgment and the opinion of an eminent
member of the Bar to express an opinion before he has been given an opportunity of
studying the case more closely.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is no libel
suit that I know of.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, there is no
libel suit. I am speaking of the documents
There is the questhat have been read.
tion of the violation of the Independence of
Parliament Act. That, I understand, was discussed before the tribunal, and the learned
Justice deelared that he could not entertain
the plea that there had been a violation of
that Act. If such a defence had been good,
judgment would have been entered against
the plaintiff.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: As a lawyer I do
not think that would follow at all. I think the
violation of the Independence of Parliament
Act might be raised as a defence; and while it
might net be a good defence te the action,
still there might be a violation of the Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not entering into the merits of the case, but I for
one am not prepared to controvert the
opinions of the learned judge and of counsel
that have been placed on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. TODD: In making his explanation I do not think the honourable gentleman
stated that the Independence of Parliament
Act was brought up during the trial. I am
told on the best of authority that. it never
Hon. Mr. GILLIS.

was pleaded, never was mentioned, and never
was considered by the court. I may be wrong,
but that is my understanding.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It was discussed. The
whole question was discussed, and for my part
I quite agree with the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) and the
honourable member for Toronto (Hon. Sir
Allen Aylesworth) that it would be neither
proper nor according to the customs of this
honourable House to discuss the matter
further while it is pending before the courts.
I think the honourable member from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) was quite justified in
making the statement that he did. He was
challenged to make a statement, and on
account of the article which had been published
it was his duty to do so; but in my opinion,
for the reasons that have been referred to by
the leader of the House and the honourable
member frorn Toronto, further discussion of
the matter should be deferred.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Why not dispose
of it now?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand from the
declaration of the Minister of Justice that it is
the intention to bring in, at next session, a

my intention to offer certain amendments, but
after learning of the Minister's statement I
concluded that it would not be proper for me
at this stage to move any amendments to the
present Bill. I was asked to state to the House,
for the information of honourable members,
the amendments that I have in mind. I am
not yet ready to do so, as I have not completed my consideration of the amendments.
That is why I ask that this Order be allowed

to -incorporate The Army and Navy Veterans
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the hionourable gentleman explain?
Riglit lon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is that a new
organization?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The Army and
Navy Vet erans in Canada is the oldest exsoldiers' organization in the British Empire.
It was established in or about the year .1860,
and was incorporated by federal charter in
1917. It bas branches scattered throughout Canada, and annually in the last six, seven or
eigbt years has conducted sweepstakes, fromn
the proceeds of which, up to about a month
aýgo. over $674,000 bas been spent in veteran
relief and charfties. Donations to other good
caùses have heen made as follows: Canadian
Red Cross Society, $35,000; St. Vincent de
Paul Society, $5,000; the Amputations Association, $15,000; Newfoundland tidal wave
disaster, 82,00; Canadian National Institute
for the Blind, $18,845; Great War Veterans of
Newfoundland, $39.268 and general charities
of Newfoundland, $11,000. A few days ago
a. cheque. for about $56,000 was sent to the

267

Canadian Legion; and I know of some other
grants, but cannot definitely state the amounts
at the moment. The hast and most illuminating one of which I know Ivas $5,000 to the
League of Nations Society.
I should like to empbasize the fact that
the sweepstakes activities of this organization have been carried on for a considerable
time. Its headquarters for that work are now
in Newfoundland, to which country it pays
some $60,000 a year in taxes. This is a
Canadian organization, and ail the charities
that have benefited from the sweepstakes are
worthy and deserving of support. The country
is concerned with a distinct issue in the
matter of sweepstakes and the Association is
eager to go to the mat-if 1 may be allowed
to use the expression-on this question, and
offers for the consideration of honourable
members its record in the donating of funds
to worthy charities. I arn asking now that
the Bill be referred Vo the Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bis.
Hon. Mr DANDURAND: We are dealing
with the motion for second reading.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We have passed
the second reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I intend to move,
if the motion for second reading is passedHon. Mr. FOR.KE: We are not going to
pass it, if I can help it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: -that the Bill be
referred to that committee. Many charities
that have received donations fromn this Association are very short of funds, and would be
in an extremely desperate situation had they
not received these gifts. I understand the
League of Nations Society is virtually on its
uppers. This Association, as 1 have said,
gave the Society $5,000 the other day, and
that is more money than any others have ever
given it. There has been a great deal of
talk by others about the League of Nations,
but when it came down to brass tacks the
Army and Navy Veterans came forward with
the most generous support.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANJ):
Would my
hon-ourahie friend allow me to make a suggestion? Inasmuch as this Bill conternis the
principle of the Iottery systemn and we shall
perhaps disc-uss that principle more fully whien
we resume the debate on the Hospital Sweepstakes Bill than we might on this occasion,
would not my hcrnourahle friend be agreeable
to allowing the motion for second reading to
stand until we have disposed of the other
Bill?

SENATE

268

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am not sure
that the principle of both bills is the same.
I think that the Hospital Sweepstakes Bill is
a proposal to do something in the future that
has not been done in the past, but the measure
now before us concerns an association with
a record of transactions over the last seven or
eight years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
or against it?

Under the law

At the present
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
moment, with our headquarters in Newfoundland, we are under the law of that country.
The law there permits us to operate the sweepstakes. Therefore I think I may say we are
operating under the law, but not the law of
Canada. Exceptions have been made in our
criminal law to cover matters of the class
referred to in this Bill, as I found to my
astonishment a few days ago. I am not prepared to admit that the principle of this Bill
is the same as that of the Hospital Sweepstakes
Bill, and I question whether it would be fair
to the promoters of this measure that I
should agree to its fate being decided in
accordance with what is done in the other
matter.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable members. I was about te rise to
my foet at the same time as my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and
to make the same suggestion as ho did, which
I consider to be a very reesonable one. I
spoke to my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) and asked him
if he could postpone the consideration of this
Bill until after we had dealt with the whole
principle that it involves, but he thought ho
ourght to .proceed and get the measure before
a committee. The difficulty is that before we
gave this Bill a second reading we should have
to discuss a principle that we shall deal with
more fully when we resume the debate on the
Hospital Sweepstakes Bill, which bas been before the House for some time. It scems to
me that the suggestion to postpone the motion
for second reading is only reasonable.
My honourable friend from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) said that it was advisable to "go to the mat" on the question.
I submit that we had better go to the mat on
the whole question wlhether or not we shall
open up in Canada a lottery system; for
nothing more nor less than a lottery system
is involved in the Bill. The fact that a body
has been acting illegally for a number of
years and bas distributed gifts obtained from
the proceeds of its illegal action shouId not
influence the Senate to look favourably upon
this measure at present. The Association's
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

activities to which my honourable friend
referred are illegal in Canada; indeed, this
very Bill is an indication of the position in
which the organization has been for a number of years. It has had t> go outside of
the country to establish headquarters for its
operations. I do not think we should endorse
the principle of the lottery and authorize
sweepstakes in Canada simply because this
Association has given $5,000 to the League
of Nations Society and certain sums to other
deserving and law-abiding charities.
It is not necessary for me to say anything
more at present, except to repeat that I think
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
should accede to the wish of the honourable
the leader on the opposite side (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) and myself, and allow this Bill
to stand until we have finished our discussion
and come to a reasoned decision as to whether
Canada is prepared to introduce lotteries
I am
and ally them with our charities.
absolutely opposed to lotteries. I think that the
opinion, and I am quite sure the practice,
of the foremost nations of the world are
against the principle of lotteries, and that this
opposition is evidenced by the legislation of
the various countries and the actions of certain societies therein.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I cannot consent
to the suggestion that has been made, because,
as I should have mentioned before, this Bill
should have at least as favourable treatment
as the other received. The Hospital Sweepstakes Bill was given second reading and sent
to a committee, which reported. It would
be unfair to refuse to send this Bill to a
committee. It would also be unfair te consider the two bills jointly. As a matter of
fact, this measure may have merit which the
other one lacks. I do not say that is true,
but I think it is a point for a committee to
consider. I could not agree to a procedure
which would net give this Bill the same degrec of fairness that the other one received.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: I think the honourable gentleman should allow the second reading to stand until the Hospital Sweepstakes
Bill is disposed of. The measure now before
us is far more vicious than the other one.
No restriction at all is provided for here. If
this becaine law, sweepstakes would he thrown
wide open, whereas in the other case there
are definite limitations. I will not object
to our giving this Bill the second reading
for the purpose of getting it before a committee, so long as it is understood the House
is not endorsing the principle of the Bill. But

269

JUNE 16, 1931
if the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) is flot agreeable to that understanding,
1 arn opposed to the second reading.
Honourable senators,
Hon. R. FORKE:
as a new memiber of the Senate 1 do flot want
to say too much, but I certainly wish to make
an emphatic protest against our rushing this
Bill through in the manfler that lias been suggested. The Hospital Sweepstakes Bill was
given a second reading so quickly that. I
scarcely knew what was going on, and I fear
the saine thing would have happened in this
case had not some honourable members asked
for an explanation. When the Order was
called I began to look up the matter on my
file, and by the time I had found it there
was a proposai not only to give the Bill
second reading, 'but to send it to a committee. We have plenty of time here, and there
is no necessity ta hurry the procedure in this
way. Bis are not rushed through so quickly
in another place. I want a littie time to
consider measures that corne before this
House, so that 1 may be able to express my
mature judgment. Therefore I hope that
the honourable member fromi Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) will accept the proposai that lias been made to him.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
If I may speak again -for a moment, I would
assent ta the position taken by my honourable friend from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Gihlis). My honourable friend to my right
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach), in urging that thîs
Bill should go forward, has argued that the
preceding Bill had been given a second reading, the principle of it had therefore been
affirmed, and it had been sent to the coinmittee.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. I did not
say that, and 1 had no intention of saying it.
Rîght Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That was the argument.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No; the argument was on the point of fairness. The other
Bill had received a second reading and had
gone to committee, and 1 argued that in fairness my Bi-I should likewise receive a second
reading and go to committee. I did not argue
that the principle of the Bill had thereby
been agreed to.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
members of the Senate, I feel a certain re.ponsibility in the fact that when the -first
Bill came before us for second reading I did
not immediately challenge it. Having glanced
at it, I had na idea. that lt would meet with
the approval of this House without an initeresting and prolonged discussion.

Some thirty ycars ago I took a dccided
stand against the art lobteries which were
taking root especially in the city of Montreal.
1 do not know to what extent they were becoming established elsewhere, but I succeeded
in hav'ing Canadian territory cleared of them.
In the present instance, not having made up
my mind ta take the lead, I was inclined ta
await an expression of opinion fromn my calleagues. Although the Bill passed its second
reading unopposed and was referred ta coinmittee, there was objection ta it among a
number of our memýbers; so when the camninittee presented its report it was quite proper
that the Senate should decide an the principle
involved. Undoubtedly this should have been
done on the second reading.
Now my honourable friend from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) suggests that we shoul<l
let the second reading af this Bill pass, but
I think we owe it ta aur own dîgnity to proceed according ta the rules of the Senate,
which at this stage cali for a pronouincernent
on the princile of the proposed legislation.
The fact that three weeks ago, when the flrst
Bill came up, we failed ta discuss it on its
merîts is no reason why my honourable friend.
should ask us ta do likewise in this case. I
would suggest that the present Bill ouglit ta
be lef t in abeyance until we dispose of the
other one. Otherwise we shahl have ta diseuss the principle now. If my honaurable
friend thinksq that it is in the interest of the
pramoters of the Bill that we discuss and
settie the principle now-that we go ta the
mat on it-I arn ready; but I shail await his
decision as ta that.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I will go this
far: I will move that the Order be discharged
and placed an the Order Paper for to-morrow.
We shaîl sec how things turn aut ta-morraw.
The -motion ta postpane the Order was
agreed ta.
The Senate adjourned until to-.morrow at

STATUE 0F SIR JOHN A. MACDONALD
DISCUSSION

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. E. TANiNER: Honourable senators,
I ask permission ta refer 'briefly ta the answer
that was brought down yesterday ta an inquiry I made in regard ta the statue of Sir

270

SENATE

John A. Macdonald on the Parliament grounds.
The honourable member for Brandon (Hon.
Mr. Forke), I am pleased to observe, was
good enough to join me in the matter, and
stated that there were other monuments on the
grounds in need of attention. The answer to
my inquiry, which is on the first page of
Hansard of yesterday, states that the Department of Public Works bas no control over the
condition of the statue to which I referred,
be.cause "nothing can 'be donc to have the
copper in monuments in Ottawa kept a brown
colour." It is also stated that "Monuments
and copper roofs in Ottawa become discoloured on account of there being sulphuric
acid in the air as a result of the pulp and
paper plants operating in the vicinity of
Ottawa." Now, as far as I am concerned, I
am not satisfied to accept that answer as
conclusive.

vinced that we are beyond help in regard to
the monuments on Parliament Hill. We are
supposed to have a large number of eminent
scientific men in the service of this country
at Ottawa. We spend an enormous amount
of money in maintaining a Research Council,
which, I presume, employs a considerable number of persons of scientific attainment. If these
do not come to our assistance in a simple matter
of this kind, why are we paying them? I am
going to ask the Committee on Publie Buildings and Grounds-I do not sec the Chairman
present in the House at the moment-to investigate this matter, call soine of these experts from the Publie Works Department and
endeavour to show the way, if possible, te
those who tell us that nothing can be donc
in this matter.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:

Hon, Mr. SCHAFFNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have found from
experience that there are high officials in the
Department of P.ublic Works who cannot
always be accepted as authorities. For example, a few years ago we had under consideration the question of the regulation of
traffie and we were curtly informed by that
Department that nothing could be donc in
the matter. However, we followed up the
question and succeeded in having sonething
donc, although I do not think that everything
possible in that connection has been accomplished yct. Then, not long ago, I had occasion
to inquire of that Department in regard te
the stalling of elevators between floors in this
building. I have in my possession a letter
from a high official in the Department stating
that the doors of any one of these cars cannot
be opened if it stalls between the floors; but,
unfortunately for that thcory, I have had it
demonstrated very clearly th'at the doors can
be opened under such cireumstances, by any
person with common sense, because there is
a lever which on being pressed will;open the
doors.
And now I am told that nothing can be
donc to restore this disfigured monument to
its normal condition. If it is worth while to
erect monuments on Parliament Hill, it is
surely worth while to keep them in proper
order. Down in the city of Halifax, near the
Province House, we have a statue of Joseph
Howe, whieh became disfigured and discoloured two or three years ago. We did not
have any of these experts of the Public Works
Department down there, but the simpleminded people who live in Halifax were able
to find a means of restoring the monument to
a decent colour. For my part, I am not conIon. Mr. TANNER.

Hear, hear.

RELATIONS OF SENATOR WITH
DOMINION GOVERNMENT
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. R. H. POPE: Honourable senators, I
desire to add a few remarks to those that were
nade yesterdav in regard to the honourable
the senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
]3elcourt). Je the first place may I say that
one of the junior inenbers I do not heur
very well what the older senators, seated n
little distance away from me, say unto themselves, and it is not until I read Hansard the
day after they speak that I discover what
they have said. Sometimes I agree with their
remarks and sometimes I do not. I think that,
under the circumstances, when I disagree altogether I should have the privilege of rising
next day and expressing my opinions. I intend before sitting down to move an adjourn-

u

ment.

On reading to-day the speech of the
honourable gentleman frorm Toronto (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth), and while listening to him yesterday-for he is one whom
I do hear-I noticed that he was in error
with respect to the lawsuit between the
senior member from Ottawa and the publication Canada.
I understood our leader
on this side (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) to say,
although I am net sure he intended to convey this idea, that he agreed with the
honourable gentleman. The appeal case is
a legal matter that does not affect the principle involved in the question concerning the
senior member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt).
My information is this-and,
whether it is right or wrong, it is based
upon judicial opinion-that the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) has no right
to a voice in this House until the matter in

JUNE 17, 1931
question is abselutely settled. IV may be
months before the courts give a decisien on
the appeal, and I sulimit that if we are
going te wait for that decisien the lionourable gentleman lias ne riglit te, be in this
flouse in the meantime. Hie can enter, I
presume, but lie cannot vote or otherwise
take part ini the business of the House. That
is my understanding.
Now, in se far as the respensibility of a
senator is concerned, the question is simple.
I do flot know why wise advocates of law
split hairs se finely as tliey very eften do.
Tliey split and split and split until there is
nothing left te split. Now, here is what
tlie Act says:
-Ne person, who is a member of the Senate,
shaîl directly or indirectly, knowingly and
wilfully be a party te or be cencerned in any

iinclr wliich the publie money of
Canada is te be paid.
I presumne the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) desired us te read the document whicli he quoted yesterday; otherwise
lie would net have preduced it. Now, ît
will lie found on referring te that judgment
that the suit was breuglit in the name of a
Leduc & Genest, against
firm, ,Belcourt,
Canada Newspaper Company, Limited. That
name appears at the beginning of the judgment and is the only reference the judge
made te the firm. Hie says:
This is an action brou lt by Senator Belcourt
against the Canada Newspaper Company te
recever a fee fer services rendered in the
securing or endeavourin te secure an arrangement by whicli the Gevernment of Canada
should plac" the publication of the defendants
in a large number of reading reemscontract

And se forth. If you read that .iudgment ahl
tlie way tlireugh you will find that tlie judge
speaks of the senator. Hie dees net refer te
the firm; lie refers only te tlie senater, and
wlien the senater brings a suit te secure part
or parcel of $3,000 or 34,000 or 55,000, as the
case may be-it makes ne difference what the
ameunt is in which lie is te participate-it is
a reflection net only upen hlm as a member
of this flouse, but upon the flouse itself.
Further on there is a reference te a $200
fine, but I am informed by a leading autliority that the period within which a fine
can lie imposed expires at the end of Vwelve
months. Therefore we need noV discuss that;
we cannot fine him.
The reflection on the Senate of Canada
extends f ar beyond tlie Dominion of Canada, and we sheuld deal witli tlie question
as one ýaffecting the întegrity and boueur of
the Senate, and sheuld decide* it one way or
the other, and net put it off, or drag it along

the trail. Lt is a re-fleetion aIse upon a senator,
and lie cannet escape from that refiectien

271

unless we deal with the matter. It is our
bounden duty to deal with it in the name
and for the lhenour of the Senate of Canada.
and for the personal lionour of the senator
as well.
Those who are personal friends of the
honourable gentleman would go perhaps a
littie farther than others in their anxiety to
see the lionourable gentleman exonerated. We
ail have close friends, and we ail have enemies
who stand at a littie distance from us and
possibly would be desirous of seeing us hit
in the back, and would not growl if the blow
were a bard one. I have no feeling in the
matter, but here we have this judgment,
which refers in every instance to the senater.
The statute says that lie must not deal directly
or indirectly in, or ibe a party te, any contract
under which the public money of Canada is
te lie paid. *This judgnient says that lie did
se, and I ask if under the cirdumastanices; it
is right or fair for us te leave the honourablo
gentleman in a state of suspense. I do net
think it is.
We know that -the lienourable gentleman
bas occupied some very important positions in
the public life of Canada. I take up a newspaper from Regina and I read:
Senator Belcourt, by virtue of bis eminence
as a le-9der of the French Canadian people,
as a former Speaker of the flouse of Commons.
Minister Plenipotentiary for Canada at London,
member of the Privy Council of Canada, member of the bars of Quebec and Ontario and of
the Le~gion of Honour, etc., should in his publie
capacity keep himself above reproach.
Wlierever the honourable gentleman gees,
whether te England or the United Statos,
where lie bas been on diplomatie missions on
behaîf of the Dominion of Canada, this will
fellew him. I say that if the leaders of the
flouse agree, a committee should be appointed
te go inte the question and should either
condemn the lionourable gentleman or exonerate him and free him from the insinuations
that have been made as a result of the action
lie lias -taken. I do net see why we shouldI
permit tliis affair te cast its shadow on thp
lionourable gentleman and on the Senate of
Canada. If 1 liad been able te hear wliat
was said yesterday I sheuld net have taken
Up tlie time of the flouse to-day, but I ehject, as a memiber of this Heuse, to our letting
the question stand instead of taking definite
action for the exeneration of the flouse or o1'
tlie lionourable member himself.
I meve the adjournment of the House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, lionourable members, te adopt the
motion?
Some lion. SENATORS: No.
Seme Hon. SENATOR.l: Lest.

HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
REPORT

0F

SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
June 10, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Barnard for the adoption of the
report of the Standing Committee to whomn
was refcrred Bill E, an Act wi'tb respect to
Hospital Sweepstakes.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
Honourable members of the ïSenate, after
rnany 'attempts, we come face f0 face with
the discussion of a subject that bas !been on
tbe Order Paper for neardy a month. The
first tbing I want to do is to invite my fellowmembers of the Senate, if they bave not
already clone so, to make a serious sfudy of
tbe principle involved in this Bill. A stranger
sitting in tbe gallery, listening to ail tbat bs
been said, and having no further source of
information, would corne to a very inconclusive
judgmenf, 1 tbink, as to wbat was before this
body.
I bave had a fairly long experience in the
two Chambers, and during the course of rny
public life I do not rememiber f0 bave seen
a measure as important as tbis one s0 easually
and imperfectly explained. The promoter of
tbe Bill and tbe only otber member wbo bas
supported it, so far as discussion is concerned,
took tbe Bill tbroug-h ifs diifferent stages in a
little less tban twenty minutes by tbe dlock,
presurnably baving given aIl tbe reasons they
had for the introduction of sucb a measure.
Now, to my mind tbis Bill is a most important one. It marks a stage in tbe history
of our legislative development. It is a departure from tbe previous attitude of the
Parliamnent of Canada towards the principle
involved in the measure now under discussion.
In my opinion this is a Bill f0 legalize the
lottery systemn in Canada; nothing more and
,notbing less. It bas nothing to, do with
bctting, with stock exehange proceedings, witb
insurance company systemýs, witb the dealing
in margins, or with the subject which seems
f0 have infrigued tbe ýpromoter of the Billthe systemn of Éselling garters in a department store in tbe city of Ottawa. Tbis Bill
might or migbt not pass, yet ail tbose things
would simply go ýon as before~; they are of
affected in any way by this measure.

JUNE 17, 1931
To listen to the arguments that have been
adduced would lead us to suppose that the
measure before us is a twin sister of such a
system of finance and of collection of revenue
as the income tax, which allows a discount
for prompt payment, or of a system that
makes it possible for a man to bet upon an
event which is in progress or in prospect.
But this Bill, if there is any reason at all for
its introduction, must embody a different
principle.
I find that the promoter of the Bill, in his
very short address, declared in the first place
that there is nothing very new in the proposai; and the honourable member for Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), in following
up the discussion, said with regard to it:
It contains no principle that is not now
recognized by law and practised by nearly
everybody.
The question that comes to our mind is, Why
is this Bi1 necessary if the principle is already
recognized by law and if the practice of it is
carried on by almost everyone in Canada?
But let us examine it for a moment. I feel
inclined to resuscitate the argument of my
honourable friend the member from Hamilton,
and I ask the attention of members to it.
I think it will not need much further comment
on my part. The honourable gentleman says:Now, if I subscribe to a hospital, what is
wrong about the hospital authorities allowing
a discount on my promise to pay? What does
the Bill mean? If they sell a thousand tickets
at $5 apiece they will have $5,000; and if I
subscribe they will give a discount, but they
will pay it on the total amount to two or three
or more persons. That is all it means. They
could give the discount to each person who
subscribed, or they could divide it among those
holding certain tickets. Where is the gaming
in that? I cannot see any. If I pay my taxes
promptly I am given a discount of 5 per cent.
If I go in on a Monday I get the discount; but
if I do not go in until Tuesday I do not get it.
Is there not as great an element of gaming in
that as there is in what is proposed here?
1 submit, honourable members, that this is
c praiseworthy Bill.
-and with that the Bill passed its second
reading and was sent to a committee for
report.
Now, I call the attention of honourable
members to the reasoning of the honourable
gentleman in this respect. So far as I am
aware, a person who has to do with this
sweekstakes business as a subscriber does not
give .his note or promise to pay a certain
amount into the fund on a certain date. He
pays cash, and therefore the question of discount does not arise in any shape or form.
Then again, I cannot at all see a parallel in
the method of the Government in collecting
its income tax. It says to the taxpayer: "You

have been assessed for a certain amount of
money. That money is payable by a certain
date, and in instalments if you wish it; but
if you are willing to make payment in advance, by a certain date, you will be allowed
a certain discount upon the total amount
that is paid." The Government fixes the date
by which that decision is to be made. The
authorities are notified, and it is arranged that
payment is to be made not later than, let
us say, a certain Monday. If the person concerned makes his payment on or before that
day he receives a discount, but if he neglects
to take in his money before Tuesday morning
he loses the discount. Where in the wide
world is there an element of gaming or chance
in that? The whole transaction is entirely
between two parties, the one who has to pay
the tax and the tax-gatherer, that is, the
Government, and it depends on the will and
action of the taxpayer whether or not he gets
a discount. Yet we are given to understand
that the Bill before us contains nothing that
in principle or practice would be different frorn
that tax discount transaction. I submit we
must give a little further consideration to the
matter in order to ascertain whether this Bill
involves so simple a thing as we have been
told it does.
Honourable members will observe that
there has been a notable avoidance of any
discussion of the principle and the practical
implications of the Bill, of the new forces
which it would authorize and let loose, or of
the question whether such forces would prove
to be beneficent or malign. It is not sufficient,
I think, that we should have the measure
presented in the innocent garb of a little
sister, perhaps a twin sister, of the practice
of giving discount on government taxes, of
life and accident insurance, or of the policy
of allowing a rebate for the prompt payment
of any contractual obligation. I submit that
we should examine the principles and the
mechanism of this Bill. Upon neither of these
features has the mover (Hon. Mr. Barnard)
nor my honourable friend from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) thrown the least
light. I ventured to ask the mover to explain the merits and mechanism of the
measure, but lie did not accede to my request.
I labour under a disadvantage because I am
not so au fait as is my honourable friend,
who, as he himself says, holds tickets in these
affairs and knows how they work out. If
lie had explained to the House how the
provisions of the Bill would be put into
operation and result in providing, as be states
-but for the statement lie has offered no
proof-sufficient money to defray the cost of

the hospital service, I should have been
helped, as I am sure my fellow members
would have been, in coming to a decision
upon the matter. As I read the measure, it
involves a number of changes. In the first
place, there would be a reversal of the policy
and practice of Canada since Confederation
-to go back no farther. It would result in
the exploitation of human weakness such
as is evinced in an inordinate desire for
rnoney, or to get something for nothing, or
to "get rich quick" at the expense of someone else and without giving any equivalent
or adequate return. And, as a sort of sugarcoating, it is proposed that there should be
an alliance of this exploitation of human
frailty with one of the noblest and most
wide-flung of our charities. The mover of
the Bill and, I suppose, the supporters of it,
assume that by means of such a partnership
sufficient money for the hospital lervices
would be collected. But the Bill would be
more far-reaching than that, for under it
our hospital charities and services woul become partners and co-workers with gamblers
all over the world. I make that statement
in the belief that it is an important one,
worthy of consideration by the Senate. And
there would necessarily be developed a vast
system of propaganda which would be as
demoralizing as it would be pervasive.
If the Bill really goes as far as I contend
it does, we should give it oui very serious
thouglit and study. Chance. the essence of
ganbling, finds its complote enbodiment
in the lottery. The glory of a human being
is reason, judgment, will power, and control
over himself and his personal affairs. The
lottery is the negation of all that. It is, in
fact, the complete apotheosis of chance.
Through it the winners of prizes are dotermined by chance, and chance alone, and in
that respect it is the nost dangerous and
rnost demoralizing form of gambling. Furthermore, it becones the competitor of all honest
toil and operates in opposition to the principle which is at fle base of business, individual character and social stability, namely,
that sorne equivalent should b given for what
is received.
In making these points, I am challenging
the intelligence and the judgmnent of mny
fellow members. We shail hear if in the
opinion of some I have been too pronounced
in any of my statements, and we shall have
to hear something that controverts them, I
think, before we shall feel free to endorse the
introduction of this proposed system.
The argument we have so far heard-and
that is what we have to go upon-in support
Right

Hon.

Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

of the Bill bas been threefold. In the first
place we are urged to support the measure
uîpon the ground that it is necessary. Probably I had better read what was said by the
mover (Hon. Mr. Barnard) in that respect.
On the 8th of May, when moving the second
reading, he stated:
Conditions to-day, however, are suclu that it
is practically impossible to get any further aid
froin the municipalities or the Government.
He was speaking, I presumne, of British Columbia particularly.
Both are sorely pressed for money. It is
equually difficult to collect large sunms from the
public.

A similar assertion is made by the honourable
senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton), and I need not read if. In effeet,
the representative of British Columbia is
pleading that his province is bankrupt so far
as concerns its capacity to meet the financial
denands of its hospitals; that it is unable to
raise the necessary funds by means of individual, municipal, provincial and corporate
efforts, and therefore must of necessity resort
to an exploitation of the gambling instinct all
over the world. By inference, the alternative
to all this is the decline of hospital charities
in that province.
Now, I know sonething of British Colunbia, of its spirit, its resources, and the philanthropic spirit of a great many of its foremost
men, and although I must give way to a
reasonable extent before the assertions of my
honourable friend, I am net convinced that
they are in accordance with the opinion of
British Columbia as a whole. I think that
province has too much spirit, too much philanthropie impulse and too many resources at its
comnand to take the position that if must
go begging all over the world, through t he
lottery system, in order to fulfil its duty to
the aged and the sick. In every great country
whose history I have read, that spirit which
impels children to care for their aged parents.
and healthy and prosperous people to look
after the sick and indigent, bas been one of
the most ennobling of national characteristics,
and one which has grown stronger with everv
advance made by civilization. I do not think
that British Columbia wishes to declare to the
world that she has lost that spirit and
capacity.
Whait proof have we of the necessity for
this Bill, apart from the assertions of my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Barnard)? Of
course, I do not call into question his bona
fides in the matter. Not a single petition in
support of the Bill bas been presented to this
House, nor, as far as I can learn, to the

275

JUNE 17, 1931
other House. As far as I can find out, no
hospital authority, municipal corporation nor
other body has passed a single resolution,
nor lias the Government of British Columbia
taken any active steps to assure the success
of the measure. There is no evidence whatever of any agitation in that nor in any other
province for such a change in the law as is
here proposed. Generally speaking, the legislation in a democratic country is a erystallization of the opinion of the majority of citizens. Now, we have no expression of opinion
from any of the provinces in favour of the
establishment of a lottery system as a means
of financing their great charities. On the contrary, the only opinion that I have heard
expressed lias be-en in opposition to sucli a
system. .No intimation lias corne from ýthe
Province of Ontario, nor from the Province
of Quebec, nor from any other province,' that
the lottery is preferable to drives and subseription lists and other means of fina.ncing
hospital services, relief work and charity in
general. If sweepstakes provide a sure means
of raising funds and are morally sound, why
is it that the Red Cross and the V.O.N. and
other great charitable iorganizations in aur
country have not agitated for a Bill of this
kind?
It is argued that men will gamble and
therefore we should legalize the lottery. Now,
I always look wiCh. suspicion upon the argument that because the frailties of hiuman
nature cause any considerable number of men
to do certain acts-, we should give legal
sanction to those acts. Something more than
the assertion that "men will gamble" is
necessary to convince me that gambling should
be legalized in the interest of the body
politie.
If there is an idea that it is better not to
gamble than to gamble, and that consequently
the individual and the country would be
better off if there were no gambling than if
there were unrestricted gambling, the question arises: What is our legisiative function,
and how should it he employed? Should we
increase the facilities for gambling, or should
we increase the restraints placed upon it?
The whole force and trend of legisiation in
progressive countries ail through the ages lias
been to try to minimize undesirable action
by making the facilities for it as few as pos-,
sible and the restraints upon it as numerous
and effective as possible. That is the genlus
and spirit of progressive legisiation, and it is
along those lines that heretovfore other nations,
and our own country, have progressed.
22112--18à1

The third argument is akin ta the second,
and ta my mind equally uncanvincing. It is
that money is going out of the country ini
this way, and that therefore we should step
in and set up machinery to carry out the.
Iottery and gam:bhing business in Canada in
order that we may keep that money in the
country. I question whether in point of
principle that argument commends itself ta
this House, and I equally question whether
there is any force in it. If you pass this
Bill, establish a lottery system, set up your
machinerv and disseminate your propagand:i.
upon what do you rely ta keep within this
country money xvhich is now going ta the
sweepstakes and lottery business in other
countries? A most striking thing occurred
just a little while aga in the Dail of the Irish
Free State, where sweepstakes are now beine
carried an. Someone raised a question as
ta what proportion of the fund thaýt came in
went ta the Irish hospitals and what proportion wvent ta the gamblers. The answer of
the Government wvas tbat out of the fund, of
wbieh I shail treat a little later, 20 per cent
went ta the hospitals and 80 per cent ta the
pockets of a few gamblers.
Hon. Mr. CASGrRAIN: That is more than
the pari-mutuels get.
Riglt Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What is that?

get only 10 per cent. That is twice as much.

shall answer that question fully. When I
made the statement that 80 per cent went
tu the gamblers and but 20 per cent ta the
hospitals, I included the expense of operation in the 80"per cent chargeable ta the
gftmblers themselves, because unless certain
measures are taken they cannot gamýble and
cannot win prizes, and there would be no
fund.
Han. Mr. GRIESBACH:

What

daes it

Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But the percentage of expenses is vcry small
indeed in coinparison with the fund and the
amount distributed. I will take that up in

Z7

SENATE

Well, somebody in the Dail said that 20
per cent was not sufficient; that if al] this
effort had in view was charity, and the Irish
hospitals, surely it was poor economy-to go
no further-to try to get 20 per cent of the
fund at the expense of the 80 per cent which
went for the collection of that fund; and th:
statement was made that at least 33ý per
cent should go to the hospitals. That proposal was negatived by a vote of 79 to 25.
What was the argument put forward by those
who were opposed to giving a smaller amount
to the gamblers and a larger amount to the
charities? They said: "Big prizes are necessary to ensure a big fund; unless you offer
the inducement of big prizes you will noct
got a large fund; therefore it is wise to keep
the amount for prizes as large as possible
and the amount for charity as small as possible."
Now, I .apply that argument to the argument of my honourable friend that by instituting a lottery here we shall keep the money
in Canada instead of allowing it to go out.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Protection.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Can my honourabile friend declare to this
House that by means of the machinery which
is to operate the sweepstakes in C-anada he
can ever hope to give prizes of $150,000, or
that he would be sustained in doing that by
Canadian sentiment and by the demands of
If ho cannot,
the charities themselves?
through his machinery, give prizes of $150,000,
$75,000, and $50,000, when he goes to canvass
$2.50 subscriptions to the Canadian sweepstakes for the sake of fair charity and the
hospitals of British Columbia, he will be met
with the statemeni: "Oh, no. By an equal
expenditure, ten shillings, I get an opportunity
of drawing for a prize of $150,000."
My
bonourable friend cannot compete with that.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Does my honourable
friend want an answer to that now or later?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Probably the honourable gentleman had botter
lot me conclude my argument first, and bring
that up afterward.
My reasoning is t'his. The inequality in
the matter of the richness of the prize, between
the Irish sweepstakes. and the British Columbia sweepstakes, and the equality of the contributions to be made-ten shillings in one
case, and $2.50 in the other-would make the
competition so unequal that the money that
is now going out of the country would continue to do so, and you would be calling upon
resources and earnings of the people of Canada
tor contributions to another campaign in which
P;It

Hn,.

Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

there would be a great disparity between the
amount that would go to the charities -and
the amount that would go to the gamblers.
So it does not seem to me that the argument
that we should thereby save money to Canada
has very much weight.
But I am willing to learn, and if my honourable friend or anyone else can show that
that disparity would not be so great, then
I would meet him with the further argument
that in these days and under present world
conditions it really makes very little difference,
when the money is taken from a multitude
of pockets and is handed in the final result
to a very small number of winners, whether
the extraction takes place in Canada or in
any other country. So much money is taken
out of the carnings and the savings of the
people; and therefore so much is extracted
from the trade resources of the whole world.
We know what that means at this time, when
there is such a close community among the
nations of the world. We know that if the
extraction is wasteful and unwarrantable, it
matters very little where it takes place; that
it will affect equally our trade, our commerce,
our standing and our future. If Germany,
or Switzerland, or -any other country, is impoverished by this extraction, it may not
come quite so closely under our eyes, but it
is an influence in the wide world of finance
and economy which has a reaction upon us.
Now I come to another point-and I am
not making an admission, but simply taking
a hypothesis for an argument. If ever in
the opinion of this Parliament it became
necessary to resort to the lottery system, is
the time that has been chosen to introduce
this matter into the Dominion of Canada
a particularly opportune one? To-day we
are slowly and gradually sinking down to the
level of recovery
from
a
world-wide
gambling debauch which has brought in its
wake untold suffering and widespread ruin;
to-day all our Governments are co-operating
in the endeavour to find remedies for these
devastating results, and to devise means of
protection against the repetition of such a
catastrophe.
Is this the time to slip the
bridle of restraint and to give free rein to the
most senseless but most insidious form of the
gambling mania? My answer to that question is that even if it ever might become
necessary to depart from straight, honest dealing, and to resort to lotteries, this is a most
inopportune time, because the adoption by
this Parliament of such a system would not
mitigate, but would in every respect further
and increase all the troubles that already exist.
My next point is that this legislation is in
principle and in practice vicious and degrad-

JUNE 17, 1931
ing. I use the word "d.egraduing" in its
primary meaning; that is, grading down the
spirit and morale of the people and the bases
of their action, instead of uplifting them and
ameiiorating matters thereby. This is invoked
in the interest of a sacred trust. Let us see
how it works out. Once the campaign for
the Irish hospital sweepstakes started, the
attention of ail the world that participated
in it was directed away from. the sacred and
holy trust that is embodied in the hospitai
as an institution. The excitement or mania,
so to speak, was ail as to who was to be
the winner. T.hat was the feature that cauglit
the public mind-and the dollars and pounds
as well. It was a gambling mania that
spread like wildfire; nlot a spirit of goodwill
and service to a great and deserving institution maintained for the gnod of hximanity.
What have been the practice and the experience of other nations, sîtuated much like
ourselves, with reference to lottery 1,égislation? The literature of lotteries is not at my
command, but I have gleaned a littie knowledge as to the trend in oiher progressive
countries, and what we might learu from
their experience. In England in the eariier
centuries the lottery was prevalent, and became a source not only of private gain, so
to speak, but also of national revenue. That
continued for a series of ycars, and substantial amounts gained by way of Iottery were
put into the- Consolidated Revenue Fund of
Great Britain. But there came a time, nearly
one hundred years ago, when the effect upon
the country seemed to demand that a stop
be put to that method of raising revenue, and
without making a long story of it, I may
say that it resulted in the lottery system
being delegalized and lotteries being prohibited, as they are to this day.
I suppose that if any taxpaying community
feels a burden to-day it is Great Britain. The
British taxpayer is right in the midst of, and is
a member of, a community which I suppose is
more higlily taxed than any other country in
the world, ahl things being taken into accounit.
He feels the burden. The members of Parliament are brought face ito face with the
problem: t'hey know it; they understand it;
tbey feel it; they participate in it. Well, as
I read through the dispatýches I sec that on
May 19 this took place:
The House of Commons came down bard to-day
on advocates of legalization of lotteriee in support of hospitals, defeating by 181 to 58 an
application by a Conservative member for leave
to introduce a Bill authorizing the operation of
sucb lotteries.
Has that no lesson for 'us? Will British
Columbia taxpayers say that they are more
heavily burdened than the British tax-

277

payers? Can Canada stand up ini the face of
aIl its assertions, cd ail its resources, of ail its
progress, snd say that that does net read a
lesson for this country? There is thbe Old
Country in the ve.ry midst of its troubles,
its burdens, its difficulties, whicb press aimost
to the point of taking bl'ood from rbhc body,
and yet the people's representatives £rom
every part and quarter of the country, by a
mai ority of 181 to 58, refuse to accept the
iottery system and legalize what is now ilIegal.
They scorn to do it. They do not wish -the
British public to be brandcd as a nation that
depends upon the gambler's instinct and the
gambler's activities in caring for its poor,
its sick and its aged. The people of Great
Britain after the War said, "Our financiai
reputation is deear to us," sud to the United
States they said, "Make up your bill and we
wiil pay it;" and they are doing it. To-day
wi'th the saine hionourable purpose, they st-,
resolved that it shahl neyer be toid in the
bazaars of India, or in the boats along the
Yangtse-Kiang, or in the shops of any of
the nations of the world, that Great Britain
bas dclegated t-he care and sustenance of bier
aged, bier sick and bier poor to the gambler's
chance one bundred thousand times multiplied.
T'hen I see that since that -rejection by the
House of Commons the Britisb Prime Minister
bas found it necessary and 'wise to utter a
warning against this almost inconceivable
mania for putting one's money at stake, not
*by using any worth, or intelligence, or information, or reason, or judgment of one's own,
but merely upon cbance. I think I must now
refer to the matter of sweepstakes machînery
as I understand it, and the results of tlzose
great Irish sweepstakes that 'have just taken
place. But first let me read what I find in
rbhe newspapers:
Toronto, May 11.-,Close to 10,000 Torontonians w-ho bave tickets on the Irish Free
State hospital sweepstakes on the Engiish
Derby have not a chance of winning a prize
in tbe Englisb classic. Tbeir tickets have been
stopped in the mails.
Between 400 and 500 were stopped by postal
authorities to-day. A total of 10,000 bave
already been taken from the mail and forwarded to the dead letter office witbin tbe past

Since lotteries are illegal in Canada, tbe

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Will my bonoui,able friend paxdon -me for one moment? He

want to buy tickets on the Irish Sweepstakes.
It w'ould stiil be iliegal t'o do so.

278

SENATE

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But my argument as to competition must be
taken into account. I Jet it go for what it
is worth. I place it before honourable members and my honourable friend, and I hold
that in that competition i-t would be entirely impossible for him to be a successful
competitor.
Then, this is the reasoning, is it, after all
that we have seen, and the miseries and
suffering froin the speculative mania, the
gambling mania, which bas spread through
Canada during the last two years, bringing
those sad results? After all that, we think
it would be a good thing to reinove the restrietion which now certainly prevents many Canadians from becoming subscribers to that fund
through the mails, and to make it legal to use
the mails and all the other machinery, so that
there may go by mail, not 10,000, but 20,000
and 100,000 and more tickets!
A great national industry bas been discovered by my honourable friend. and he is
trying to introduce it into this country. It
is in Ireland to-day. There they have already
had three sweepstake drawings. That whets
the appetite for more, and they are now
putting up the machinery for another sweepstake on the Manchester November Handicap,
whatever that is-my honourable friend will
know-and they intend to raise a fund, not of
15 millions, but of 25 millions, and to drain
a large part of that money out from old
mother England. Out of the suffering, the
poverty, and the dole-stricken condition of
that country the greater part of the present
fund at the disposal of the sweepstakes
organization in Dublin has been garnered.
They propose to make another and greater
haul from the same source. These tickets cannot be sold nor funds collected by mail; so
agents are hired to go over with the money,
purchase the tickets, deposit the counterfoils,
and do all that sort of thing. Oh, it is a great
industry. a great Irish industry, soon to be
paralleled by a great Canadian industry.
Good, moral,
Profits?-scarcely imaginable!
-eligious, character-making influences, beyond
the description of pen or tongue! Ho, for the
aright day of the near future! Adieu, depression and hard times for ever afterwards!
Honourable gentlemen, I commend it to you.
That is the philosophy, and that is the
chimera, which is as unsubstantial as any that
has ever been foisted upon any people in the
history of the human race.
Now I come down to a practical point. I
have taken some trouble to study this matter,
and very fortunately I have just to-day received what J suppose is the only official reHon.

Mr. BARNARD.

port that we shall have with reference to that
sweepstake. I do net know whether in the
economy of sweepstake business the promoters
are obliged to present to the Government a
report covering exactly the whole operation.
Almost every honest trader has to do it;
every corporation or company is liable to be
called upon; and I should suppose that those
in charge of the great Irish industry would
copy those approved methods of procedure
and would duly present to their Government
an authentic account, audited by chartered
accountants, as te the whole operation, including the results of the distribution. But I have
to-day a reputable newspaper's report which
gives me the bones of the sweepstakes transaction in Dublin, and I will use that.
Honourable gentlemen, in round numbers,
which I have calculated in dollars from report.
given in pounds, the amount of the fund in
Dublin reached the grand total of 14 millions
of dollars. The price of each ticket was ten
shillings.
I find in the report a lively description of
six lorrv-loads of counterfoils, guarded by
Irish police, and taken to the abiding place
of the great round drum and its smaller companion. In the great round drum seven
million counterfoils were mixed, and mixed,
and mnixed by the wheel. In the small drum
33 names of horses were placed. In that mass
of seven million slips resided the fortunes of
the lucky winners, and the losses to all the
unlucky subscribers.
Now keep in mind that the fund itself
raised for Irish hospitals amounted to
$14,000,000. Bear in mind also that out of
bis the hospitals received only $3,400,000.
The gamblers and the gambling machinery
necessary to accumulate the fund absorbed
Those figures are stupendous.
$10,600,000.
The disparity between 20 per cent and 80 per
cent of that fund is the thing that strikes
one. Present to a national finance minister,
a railroad management, or a business corporation, a plan by which they could raise
a fund out of which they would retain 20
per cent distribution to themselves at a cost
of 80 per cent of the whole fund, and what
financial concern, what industry, what railroad manager, what business corporation or
company would endorse such an uneconomic
and wasteful transaction? That is the first
thing. It is based on no economic or financial grounds which can for a moment be
upheld.
But there is a wider and deeper significance
yet, and it is this: Of those seven millions
of counterfoils which went through the big
drum, and out of which the Irish nurses

JUNE 17, 1931
plucked a certain number of counterfoilsin ail, less than 627 in principal prizes--what
happened as a distribution of national
wealth? If we take the assumption, which
I think is about correct, that there werc
seven millions of counterfoil holders, and
that out of those seven millions only 627 drew
principal prizes, is not that gambling at tremendous odds? When I said that this was the
apotheosis of chance I think I was justified
by these figures.
Now let us carry those down a bit. In this
great prize-winning contest what advantage
is there to the civilized as against the uncivilized mati-to the scientifie as against the

has just the same chance as the president of
your university. Your ignorant Lascar on
a sbip in the Far East bas just as good a
chance as the President of the United States.
One is as well endowed as the other, and
no better, to compete in such a competition.
All judgment, all reason, all experience, all
that which has accompanied the march of
the human from the jungle to twentieth century civilization-alI that ceunts nothing for
the twentieth century man.
The largest prize is $150,000, and there are
19 such prizes. A negro out-of-work in the
city of Boston drew a first prize on a horse
and received $150,000. Where does that
$150,000 corne from to this negro out-ofwork? It cornes out of the pockets of 60,000
fellow human beings each of whom hbands
eut tan shillings, and makes possible its
transfer te the successful negro competitor
in the city of Boston. Is that a transaction
which is te be imitated? You may multiply
that until you reach 10 millions and odd
which went te the gamblers, yet &Il of the

this Senate and of the people of Canada?
But there are still further implications. What
weuld be the educative effact of this Bill if
it bacamc law? For, of course, the law dees
have a distinct educativa influence. My
honeurahle friend (Hon. Mr. Barnard) gave
us ne deta:iled information as te the way in
which such a law would eperate. Well, I
submit that the first thing that would follow the passage of the Bill would be the ramoi-al of alI barriers te the lettery system.
In the train of that removal there would follow a large number of evils, very few ef which
I have bean able te mention, but oe of the
most important would be the cultivation of
the gamýbling spirit, particularly among the
rising generatiens, until it bacame the controlling mania in this Dominion. Unless the
gambling spirit were cultivated te that point,
this new industry would not achieve the acme
of success. Now, should we give our endorsatien te a thing of that kind? If this Bill
sbould become law, there weuld be a lifting
of the restriction on the use of the mails for
distributitig propaganida concerning lotteries,
and every hamlet, town and city weuld be
floodcd with alluring storias and pictures:
"Great gains made by Se-and-So, a pour
werking man. He invested ten shillings and
tiow ha is the possesser of $150,000. Ge tbou
and de likawise. Dust up your ten shillings
and put it inte this new jndustry of Canada." And not only would the mails be
opan te this sort of th'ing, but the advertisin- columtis of our nawspapers would contain forceful appeals. I do flot need te say
anything about the infinite skill with which
advertising experts play upon the desires of
pcople nowadays. And in every newspapcr
that cornes into Canada from abread there
would be exciting and captivating descriptions
of wealtb made by helders of' sweepstakes
tickets. Strengly worded appeals would be
directed te our young people: "Yeu, Temmy
.Jones. get Papa te give you ten shillings,
and yen may become a millionaire." And
to young ladies in academies: "Fermn a pool
in your academy. Put in yeur tan shillings
and you will have a chance te become the
richest lady in the land." Can anyone say
where ýthis propaganda would stop? Cati anyone estimate its enervating, disorganizitig,
desecializing and denationalizing effect? Thero
would be a salasman in evary hamlat, who
for bis werk in selling tickets would gat aither
the chance of winning a prize or, what weuld
be perhaps mere satisfying, a definite comnmission for evary ticket of which he disposed.
What did the Goernment representative in
the Daýil say? "You must have large prizes
or else you will net gat large funds." There

SENATE
would b no lack of salesmen to speak in
gliowing terms of the prospect of winning
a large prize.
Now, it is conceded that the lottery is a
black looking monster, and so there is an
attempt to join it arm and arm with an
angel of light. When that is done there are
two grounds on which a man may be approached to buy a ticket. You may go to
the man who is inclined to gamble and say:
"Here is a chance to make a fortune. Put in
your moncy and try your luck." Or you may
go to. the staid person who does not take
very well to the gambling proposition, and
say, "For the sake of sweet charityr won't
you take a ticket?" The thing has no bounds.
It is so insidious that it might possibly eat
out the honest heart of the people of Canada. Give it rein, protect it, authorize it,
grant it legal sanction and the facilities it
requires, and who can say where the thing
will stop? I am sure I cannot.
The only ounce of comfort that I have for
my honourable friend the promoter of this
Bill (Hon. Mr. Barnard) is that the Soviet
Gtovernment has gone just about as far as
he proposes we should go. I do not know
the exact attitude of my honourable friend
towards the Soviet, but I hope he has not
been indoctrinated with their theories to the
extent of starting off on his false scent. I
read that the Soviet has authorized a loan
of $800,000,000, to be divided into two classes
of bonds. One class will ca.rry 10 per cent
interest; the other bears no definite rate
of interest at all, but here and there throughout the series of bonds there is one which
ca.rries a tremendous prize. The Russian who
happens to buy that one becomes a millionaire, in a country which prohibits millionaires; so maybe the Soviet gets the prize
after all. I have still another little crumb of
comfort for my honourable friend: down in
Saýo Paulo, in South America, they have
established or are about to establish a lottery.
I think my honourable friend (Hion. Mr.
Barnard) has not used his financial and
economic knowledge in a way that would
tend to the greatest good of humanity. The
American Red Cross, a great national
charity, -recently found itself pressed for

funds.

It wanted to raise $10,000,000,

and

the President of the United States set his foot
down against raising that by any means
which would take away from the sympathetic and large souled people of that
country the privilege to subscribe. What
a pity that my honourable friend did not
confer with President Hoover and the
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

American Red Cross and point out to them
the excellencies of the system which he now
proposes!
Is there a more sacred and, if one may say
so, holy charity than that which concerns
itself with the care of our aged and our sick?
If it is proper to apply the lottery for the
assistance of this great charity, why not apply
it in other great charities and organizations
for spiritual and humanitarian work? But
what a sensation would be caused throughout
the Dominion if some honourable member
were to father a Bill in this House reciting the
difficulty of raising funds at present, and
proposing that the United Church of Canada
should make up part of its great missionary
appropriation by allying itself with an exploitation of the gambling instinct-in other
wqrds, with a lottery system! If there is no
objection to the principle of a l'ottery on
religious or moral grounds, we are driven to
the conclusion that what is good for one
noble cause may be good for all.
Honourable members, I thank you for
listening to me so attentively and patiently.
I now move, in amendment, that there be
added to the motion for third reading the
words "this day six months."
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators.
after listening to the very eloquent speech of
the right honourable gentleman, I feel that
there is little left for anyone to say in critici-m of the Bill. I regret that I have to
oppose my honourable friend from Victoria
(Hon. Mr. Barnard), for whose judgment I
have every respect, but I feel that he has
strayed from the right path in bringing this
Bill before the House. Reference was made
yesterday to the hurried manner in which
the Bill was given second reading. I was not
present on that occasion, or I should have
objected to the hasty procedure. The measure
would have been passed if my honourable
friend from Picton (Hon. Mr. Tanner) had
had his way, for he suggested that it be given
third reading there and then.
That would have
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
saved us a lot of trouble.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It might have, but we
should have missed the eloquent speech that
we have listened to this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The Bill would have
been given third reading in about three
minutes but for the motion for reference to
a committee.
My right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) stated at

JUNE 17, 1931
a previous sitting that some fifteen or twenty
minutes were occupied at the second reading

stage, but he was a little generous. It would
have been a serious reflection on this House
to give the third reading in that way, because,
I think, a large majority of the people in the
Dominion do not approve of the principle of
the Bill. The hasty procedure on second
reading is an example of the way in which
legislation is sometimes rushed through here
without the consideration it merits. We have
well defined rules to govern the progress of
every bill through this House, and I think we
should endeavour to adhere strictly to them,
no matter how urgent a measure m-ay seem
to be. Occasionally we hear a complaint that
the Senate has not sufficient work to do. Well,
I think that the fault is partly our own, because we do not get down to business and
carefully scrutinize every matter that comes
before us.
The mover of this Bill (Hon. Mr. Barnard)
based his argument in support of it largely on
the ground that the people of Canada are
allowed to deal in stocks, bonds, wheat and
other commodities, and in that way incur
risks. Nobody disputes that. Any citizen has
a perfect right to spend his money as he
pleases, within the law. For example, I may
buy a thousand bushels of October wheat
and pay a margin of ten or twenty cents on
the purchase. I may be called upon later on
to make an additional payment, or I may dispose of the wheat before October. If I hold
it until that time I must pay the remainder
of the purchase price or lose what I have
already invested. That is a transaction that
concerns me and the person from whom I
buy, and no one else. Of course there is an
element of chance in almost everything in life.
A merchant buys a bill of goods with the
object of selling them -ata profit. He is taking
a chance there. A farmer sows seed in the
spring of the year and takes a chance on the
harvest. Similar instances could be multiplied indefinitely.
If in the past we had had the power, and
used it, to pass legislation to prevent people
from gambling in stocks, the country would
have benefited greatly. The crash that
occurred in 1929, which is responsible to a
certain degree for the depression now existing in almost every country in the world,
would probably have been avoided in Canada.
It is true, as the honourable gentleman
who introduced this Bill (Hon. Mr. Barnard)
stated, that our hospitals are finding some
difficulty in raising the necessary funds. The
hospitals are not alone in that respect. Other
institutions are having similar troubles. But

Z1

I question very much whether any of our
hospitals, even if this legislation were put
upon the Statute Book, would take advantage
of money obtained by means of what would
be nothing more nor less than a system of
public gambling. It is possible, too, that
those who to-day are so generously supporting those institutions would disapprove of
this class of legislation and withdraw their
support, and that municipalities that usually
give grants would discontinue them. Should
this legislation pass, there is a danger that
the resultant loss to the hospitals would be
greater 'than the resultant gain.
I imagine that the honourable gentleman
who brought in this Bill was actuated by the
success of the Irish Free State hospital
sweepstake. That matter has been so fully
and thoroughly dealt with by the right
honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster) that it is hardly
necessary for me to say anything more about
it. I may say, however, that conditions in
the Irish Free State are entirely different from
conditions in Canada. iere in Canada we
have a cosmopolitan population holding
diverse views, whereas the Irish Free State
has virtually one people, all united, or nearly
so, on this point.
As I have stated, our hospitals are in need
of support; but I do not think we need fear
for their future. The people of Canada take
a great pride in their hospitals and support
them liberally. I should like to cite an instance that came under my observation a
short time ago. In a little town in the province where I reside there is a small cottage
hospital. This hospital, because it is unable
to comply with certain provincial regulations,
does not receive any Government grant. A
short time ago this hospital, which had been
doing good work for a number of years,
found itself in difficulties and threatened with
the possibility of having to close its doors.
However, the citizens of that little town, the
town council, and the councils of one or
two of the near-by rural municipalities got
together and within a comparatively short
time arranged for the carrying on of the institution. That in itself is perhaps of not
much importance, but I think it is fair to
say that the spirit shown on that occasion
prevails throughout Canada from one end
to the other, and that it is therefore not
necessary to adopt a system of gambling to
maintain our hospitals.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Barnard)
made reference to horse-racing. He said that
we allow horse-races and betting on them.
In every province in Canada races are held.
In some provinces there is no limit to the

282

SENATE
SEN ATE

282

number of meets. I have just looked up the
law of the Province of Saskatchewan and I
find that in that province there are certain
restrictions. An Act for the Regulation of
Horse-Racing, Chapter 233 of the Revised
Statutes of Saskatchewan, provides, in part.
as follows:
(1) Except as hereinafter provided, no person
shall hold or conduct any race-meeting or horseraeing, nor shall any person aid in, enter in,
judge, start, race in, drive in, or ride in any
horse-race within Saskatchewan.
Then there are certain exceptions to this
section. The first is:
(a) Race-ieetings hel d inder the auspi ces of
an agricnltural society or exhibition association
on a race-course, operated as a part of or in
connection with aL agricultural fair or exhibition.
The second is:
Horse-racing by an association, turf club or
group of persons for a period not exceeding
three days in any one calendar month.
The third is:
Race meetings at which no opportunity is
efforded either directly or indirectly by the
mîanageient

or

otherwise

for the placing

of

biets or wagers through the agency of a pariiiutuiel system or otherwise.
From this we see that in the Province of
Saskatchewan there is a limitation placed
upon horse-racing. I do not find any fault
with horse-racing; I think it is really good
sport. It is a very ancient sport, and through
the ccenturies, from the time of the chariot
race of Ben Hur, we have always had horseracing.
Nobody enjoys horse-racing mora
than I do if I have no money on the races;
but if I am weak-minded enough to put up
money it is always my misfortune to lose.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: In the Province of
Saskatchewan is there any limit on the amount
a person may bet, or on the number of
tickets ho may buy?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: No. There is a fine
of $5,000 if one does not comply with the
law.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
as you like.

You can bet as much

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: You can bet as much
as you like. That is donc all over the world.
As was -pointed out by the right honourable
gentleman (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster),
there is no country in the world where the
people take a greater interest in horse-racing
than they do in England. In that country
horse-racing is regarded as one of their national sports, and certain races are looked
forward to year after year as great events.
But if my honourable friend will read the
Hon. Mr. GILLIS.

statement of what happened in the British
House of Commons on the 19th nf May ho
will observe that what was defeated was not
a Bill, but only a motion for leave to introduce a Bill, and that although horse-racing
is upheld in that country sweepstakes are
not approved of for any purpose.
The honourable gentleman from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique) gave notice of one
or two amendments to 'this Bill. They will
be found on page 184 of Hansard. One of the
amendments, as I understand it, provides
that the operation -of this Act shall apply
only within a province wherein the Attorney
General has signified his approval of the
sweepstake, and that tickets shall not be sold
outside of that province. Is that not truc?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It is proposed that the
sweepstake shall be carried on entirely within
the bounds of the particular province that
endorses this legislation?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Quite so.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I suppose the honourable gentleman will explain a little later.
Hon. Mr.
Canada.

BEIQUE:

Except

outside

of

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Yes. But can the
honourable gentleman devise a means of
effectually carrying out a law of that nature?
I live within a few miles of the boundary of
Manitoba.
What is to prevent me from
jumping into my car and driving a few miles
to a race meet in the Province of Manitoba?
If this law is good for one province, why is
it not good for the whole Dominion of
Canada? Wlhy discriminate? Surely if the
operation of the law is to be confined to one
or two particular provinces confusion is going
to result, and ýit will never be possible to
carry it out successfully.
Another amendment proposed by the
honourable gentleman from De Salaberry
provides that tickets for a sweepstake shaîl
not be sold in Canada except in the province
approving of such sweepstake, and that the
mails shall not be used for the purpose of
delivering tickets outside that province. I
presume the honourable gentleman will inform the House what machinery he has devised to make possible the carrying out of
this provision. If Manitoba should take
advantage
of this measure, are we in
Saska-tchewan to scrutinize every letter that
comes into our province from Manitoba? I
think this provision is impossible of enforcement.

JUNE 17, 193!1
In the face of ail these objections, and in
spi-te of the fact that this country lias lost
grievously in conneetion wit-h stock trading,
we bave before us a Bill whieli tlirows tlie
doors wide open to the rankest kind of
garâbling. The-re is no question about that.
The benefit of one, two, or a dozen individuals
in a province is not the benefit of the province
generally, and a Bill encouraging sucli a
systemn as this would, I think, lie a blot on the
legislation passed by this House. I therefore hope that lionourable members of this
Chamber will see the wisdoma of voting
against the Bill.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourahle members,
I wish to offer a few words of comfort
to my lionourable friend from Britishi Columbia
(Hon. Mr. Barnard). I think we must al
admit that the measure lie lias advocated lias
been rather roughly liandled by the riglit 'honourable gentleman from. Ottawa (Riglit Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) and also by the lionourable gentleman from Saskatchiewan (Hon. Mr.
The right honouraible gentleman
Gillis).
knows the secret of the use of the dramatie
and of ridicule, and employs tliem both with
equal skil-an aocomplisliment which I cannot lielp admirîng. I must admit that
lie made in opposition to this measure one of
tlie strongest pleas that I ever heard on the
floor of this House. But I think that his plea
would have heen much stronger if it had been
directed towards tlie abolition of every sort
of gambling. No matter wliat may be said
or donc, gamhling continues to exist. Honourable gentlemen do not know that as they leave
this Chamber tliey will not be met by a young
lady selling tickets for a draw tliat is being
conducted under the auspices of some
charitable organization, club or benevolent
Society. That is gambling on a sma.ll scale;
it is gambling nevertlieless; and I would
empliasize the fact that the principle is just
the same wlietlier one buys a flfty-cent ticket
for a draw or bets a substantial sum on a
liorse-race.
Gambling exists everywliere at the present
time, as was stated by the honourable gentleman from Saskatchf wan (Hon. Mr. Gillis),
wlio so strongly opposed this meesure. Life is
a gamble. We bet somnething on everything.
If we do not gamble on the fluctuations of
the stock exchange, we gamble on the weatlier.
An Hon. SENATOR: And on elections.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Yes, we gamble on
elections. I venture to add, at the suggestion
Of My lionourable friend, that the present
Prime Minister of Canada gambled a great
deal last July.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: He won.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: And lie won-to his
great disappointment at the present time.
An Hon. SENATOR: He is gainbling stili.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: My honourable friend
from Saskatchiewan (Hon. Mr. Gills) stated
a while ago that if a law liad been pa.ssed to
prevent our people from speculating in stocks
in sucli a wild Way a few years ago, much
money would have been saved. In that lie
is riglit. If at the same time there liad been
in effect sucli a measure as we are now studying, much of that money would have been
kept in the country and would have gone to
the benefit of our charitable institutions.
I know what a deep respect my riglit lionourable friend the junior member for Ottawa
(Riglit Hon. Sir George E. Foster) lias for
one of the mother countries of CanadaFrance-througli bis association with the
League of Nations. We ail know that a
lottery systen lias been made use of liy the
highest financial authorities of F.rance.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Government.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: In that connection I
need only refer to the Panama Canal and tlie
bonds of the City of Paris. I heard my riglit
lionourable friend state that countries tliat
have at heart tlieir honour and dignity would
not contemplate sucli a sclieme. Well, sucli a
selieme is a reality in the dear old land of
France and in many other places as well.
My right lionourahie friend has said that in
many of these undertakings--and lie mentioned
one in particular-only 20 per cent of the
money subscribcd reaches the institution for
which the money is being raised. Possibly that
is true. I take bis word for it. But let me
add that the same is true of any organized
charity. In this connection I sliould like to
refer to what took place in the city of Detroit
n week or so ago, wlien it was discovered, to
the distress of Mayor Frank Murphy, that
out of the fund esta'blished for relieving distress in that city $250,000 liad been appropriated by one of the officials of the commitee. That is a very substantial sumn of
money. Wliat happened there represents one
form of exploitation of cliarity. Whatever
may bie the selieme, there always will be a
hole for money to leak tlirough.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
He was not allowed by law to take it.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: No. But tliey do
not seemn to have any means of following up
the man, and wliether lie goes unpunislied or
not, the stolen money wil not lie recovered.
The reason wliy I arn favourably disposed
towards this Bull is that to my mind it involves not so mucli a principle as a rnetliod

284

SENATE

of granting to the provinces a right that
we at the present time possess. I do not
think the proposed measure is so drastic after
all, because it would simply transfer to the
provinces the right to handle this matter, subject to the provisions stipulated in the Bill.
It says:
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other Act. it shall be lawful from
tinie to time for the Attorney-General of any
province-and so on.
With reference to that, my honourable
friend from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis)
said that if such legislation is good for one
province it should be good for the whole of
the Dominion of Canada. Quite so. But we
all know that the management and supervision of charitable institutions are matters exclusively under the control of the provincial
authorities.
There is in Ontario, for instance, a Charitable Institutions Act, and it is
from the Government of Ontario that institutions in that province receive their annual
and other grants.
I conclude that such
legislation as this might meet with the sentiments and the needs of the people of one
province and not of another; therefore I say
that from a provincial standpoint the measure
is a logical and most rational one. I believe
that the transfer of the right to carry on
sweepstakes in this country under sensible regulations and proper supervision is a step in
the right direction. As a medical practitioner I
am fully aware of the bad conditions under
which our hospitals everywhere are striving at
the present time, and I think that the establishment of an organization to help them
along would be a most commendable step.
Hon. ROBERT FORKE: Honourable members of the Senate, as seconder of the. motion
of the right honourable the junior member
for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir Geo. E. Foster)
,I feel that I ought to say a few words in
regard to the Bill that is now before the
Chamber. I have full sympathy with the
motive that impels the honourable member
for Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) to bring forward a motion of this kind; that is, to do
something to help the hospitals; but I cannot
say that I am in sympathy with the method
that he bas adopted.
The American Medical Association. at its
meeting in Philadelphia some little while ago,
took notice of the growing use of hospitals.
Many more people are going to the hospitals
for help than in bygone days. The Association also passed a resolution asking members
to do all they possibly could to combat the
federation of medicine, which I suppose means
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

the turning over of the practice of medicine
and the care of hospitals, to some extent, to
the state governments. This is not in line
with some arguments that were put forward in
another place by medical men the other day,
which pointed rather towards the state taking
a more active part in caring for the health of
the people and helping hospitals and other
such institutions. However, I do not intend
to deal at any length with that part of the
subject.
I want to say a few words in regard to the
maintenance of hospitals as we have them at
present. The number of hospitals is increasing rapidly; much more so than the population. It has been estimated that about 20,000
beds have been added to hospitals and asylum
accommodation every year for the last twenty
years, though our population is not increasing
at anything like the sanie rate. Thjis shows
that many more people are taking advantage
of hospital service than previously.
Methods of financing our hospitals vary in
great degree. These institutions include the
public or civic hospitals, supported by the
taxes of the people and by fees charged
patients who are able to pay, and ail grades
down to the small cottage hospital that my
lionourable friend the member from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis) mentioned a little
time ago, which is alinost entirely supported
by private contributions. Many splendid contributions have been made by wealthy citizens,
and great help bas been given to hospitals in
this way.
I might speak briefly of the hosoitals in
Manitoba, as I am more acquaintetd with that
province than any other part of the Dominion.
I might say that in the early days of that
province I came into very close association
with hospital work through being an official
of the municipal association in my iown for
twenty years, and I was constantly dealing
with hospitals and with the Government in
regard to ah institutions of that sort.
Away back in the nineties, when a large
population was flowing into Manitoba, hospital
needs were very great. In regard to the
Winnipeg General Hospital, I will not say
anything about how the buildings were
financed, but will deal with maintenance. At
that time grants were made by the province,
by the city of Winnipeg, and by the rural
municipalities in the whole province. There
was no definite system. Each municipality
made whatever hospital grant they saw fit.
The plan worked satisfactorily, though one
municipality might not contribute as liberally
as a poorer and weaker one; but a climax was
reached when the Winnipeg General Hospital

JUNE 17, 1031
refused to admit some charity patients from
outside municipalities.
I very well remember that the executive of
the Municipal Union, after considering this
matter, concluded that some definite method
would have to be adopted whereby charity
or non-paying patients would be taken care
of. They met a committee from. the hospital
and diseussed the whole matter. The hospital
people were very much astonished to find how
willing and ready the municipal people were
to meet their wants and help them out of
their difficulty. At that time it was arranged
that the Provincial Government should contribute so much for each non-paying patient,
and each municipa}ity should pay a stated
amount for emch such patient coming from its
neighbourhood.
No douht that plan was satisfactory at
the time; but troubles arose. It was difficuit,
in a shifting population, always to know the
exact domicile of a patient in the hospital.
On the coming of a patient who was unable
to pay, it was the business of the hospital
to notify immediately the municipality concerned, and 1 suppose the hospitals suffered in
some degree from always having to establish
whei'e the non-paying patient came from.
Then the Charities Aid Act was passed by the
local legisiature, and that was very satisfactory
for a number of years. Funds coming from
this source met the requirements of the
hospital. I include the St. Boniface Hospital,
which was in much the samne position as the
Winnipeg institution.
But times have changed and the needs of
hospitals have very much altered since those
Medicine and surgery, as well as
days.
hospital services, though much more efficient,
are mu-ch more expensive. In these days,' as
is often said, there are only two classes of
people who can aff ord to go to a hospital:
the rich and the very poor. The rich can
atTord to pay for hospital services, while the
very poor get such services for nothing. The
great majority of the people, men. who are
earning small salaries or working for daily
wages, or men in a small agricultural way,
with only a limited income, find it almost inpossible at present to meet the niecessary
hospital expenses and the cost of medical
treatment. Consequently we find that people
oan independent spirit, with small means,
will sometimes suifer a good deal before they
will go to a hospital, snd if they go and
obtain necessary treatment they are perhaps
crippled financially for many years.
I hope I am stating these matters in a. very
moderate way. We hear a great deal abouL
the high fees of medical men. There may

295

be some truth in the statement that feeu are
high, but at this particular time 1 waiit to
say that perhaps there is no profession whose
members give more free services than do the
doctors in the Dominion of Canada, and perhaps everywhere else. Yet that does not remove the fact that a great many people find
themselves unable to meet the high tariff of
the hospital and the fees that an efficient and
expert medical man will have to charge.
There is a difficulty in financing hospitals
at present, but I wanted to point out an experience of the early years that 1 have mentioned. At that particular time the hospital
people imagined that the municipalities were
trying to evade their responsibility and were
not willing to pay for the services of the
hospitals. I remember the experience in regard to the Manitoba Sanatorium, one of the
finest and best institutions that exist anywhere for the treatment of tuberculosis. It
bas done untold good not only by the services it bas given in the Sanatorium, but also
by its great services in disseminating information as to how patients may take care of
themselves and give themselves treatment. At
first there used to be a tag-day for the Sanatorium, cand perhaps there neyer was a tagday into which the people entered with more
enthusiasm. But again the municipal authorities came to the rescue. and it was suggested
to the superintendent of that institution that
instead of having the tag-day hie should get
an amount from, the Govermcent, and the
municipalities said they were willing to give
their share. Some members of the Manitoba
Government were mot, this suggestion was
advocated, and an Act was passed by which
the local Government could levy a special
tax for the Manitoba Sanatorium. Since that
date the levy bas been doubled, I think, and
perhaps trehled. Still the fact remains that
the municipal councils throughout the province, when they were appealed to in the right
way, and the difficulties were properly represented to them, would always rise tn the
occasion and come to the aid of the hospitals.
I am ready to say that they will do so again
whenever they are called upon.
1 noticed in The Morning Citizen newspaper yesterday that there was talk of giving
the children in the city of Ottawa medical
and dental attention. The Citizen mentioned
that the service would cost about $20,000, and
pointed out that the ratepayers would have
to foot the bill for what it called an unnecessary piece of state health bureaucracy.

some way by which the grain buyer may
protect himself from loss. He does so by
what is called "hedging"; that is, buying or
selling futures. It is not gambling in the
proper sense of the word. No doubt there is
gambling done in wheat, but I cannot take
the time to go into that matter; it would
take the whole afternoon to discuss it. It
is -too intricate and difficult to understand
in just a few minutes. But on the grain
exchange there is not so much gambling as
a great many people suppose. Many of
our farmers used to think that the grain
exchange was just a gambling place.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: I do not know
what it is if it is not gambling.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
What about the
fellow who has no grain at all, and just goes
and buys on option?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: That is gambling. I
was going to refer to that in regard to both
grain and stocks. When a man does that
he uses judgment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He may have bad
judgment.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: He may have bad
judgment, but he uses his judgment as well
as he can. He tries to estimate, for instance,
the crop prospects, the amount of wheat
available, and so on. His judgment is based
upon a great number of things. But as the
right honourable the junior member for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
pointed out, there is no need for brains or
judgment in buying a lottery ticket. The
lottery is nothing but a pure gamble.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: A man has good judgment if fie wins.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Well, he may think he
has, if he wins. There is no doubt that
speculation in grain and stocks is often disastrous, and perhaps it would be better for
the ordinary person to keep away from the
exchanges.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Try to stop them.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Perhaps we cannot. I
really do not think that there is anything I
can add to what has been said against lotteries. I had some arguments ready, but
they have been so well stated already I do
not need to repeat them. Gambling is economically unsound, both for business and
individuals, in whatever way we care to look
at it. There is much unrest at the present
time; it is hard to get people to settle down
to business. The more we increase facilities
for gambling the more unsettled will condi-

287

tions become. The lottery is contrary to the
spirit and the genius of the Canadian people,
and I do not believe the time will ever corne
when Canadians will rely upon such a means
for the settlement of financial difficulties.
Where could we stop if we passed this Bill?
Another measure for the legalization of
sweepstakes is on the Order Paper for second
reading, and if it and the present one are
passed a great many charitable institutions
may ask for permission to raise money by
lotteries. I disagree with the opinion of my
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster) that a lottery would probably not bring in so much as the promoters
of the Bill estimate. I believe that the money
would be obtained, but it would come to a
large extent from the pockets of poor people
who cannot afford the loss. I can only add
that I am against this Bill because it would
be detrirmental to the dignity and the honour
of Canada to resort to the lottery as a means
of raising funds for our charitable or other
public institutions.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? I understood him to say that there were 20,000 new
beds every year in the last twenty years.
Did I hear him aright?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Yes. There have been
some 400,000 additional beds altogether.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If there are 400.000 additional beds, what would be the proportion to the population? One-quarter of
the people would be in bed all the time, according to my calculation.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: There are ten million
people.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I think my honourable
friend's calculations are not correct.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will vote against
the Bill if you can explain that to me.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I will make a confession. I got some figures from a certain
source, and the other day I observed different
figures were quoted in a debate in the other
House. I came to the conclusion that neither
set of figures was accurate, and I thought I
would strike an average between the two.

SENATE

Hon.
R.
DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I desire to congratulate my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) on the very excellent speech to
which we have just listened. I had prepared
some extended notes on the question before
us, but the right honourable gentleman has
covered the ground so well that I feel it is
not necessary for me to say much.
My honourable friend from Essex (Hon.
Mr. Lacasse) has said that gambling is going
on all over the country and that we cannot
stop it, whatever we do. I would draw his
attention to the fact that the policy of the
Parliament of Canada has been to restrict as
far as possible the occasions and facilities for
gambling. He will see that section 236 of the
Criminal Code makes five exceptions to the
general prohibition against lotteries. Subsection 6 of section 236 reads:
6. This section does not apply to
(a) the division by lot or chance of any
property by joint tenants or tenants in common,
or persons having joint interests
(droits
indivis) in any such property;
(b) raffles for prizes of small value at any
bazaar held for any charitable or religions
object. if p"rnission to hold the same has been
obtained from the city or other municipal
council, or from the mayor, reeve or other
chiai officer of the city, town, or other municipality, wherein such bazaar is held, and the
articles raffled for thereat have first been
offered for sale and noue of them are of a
value exceeding fifty dollars.
(c) the distribution by lot of premiums
given as rewards to promote thrift by punctuality in making periodical deposits of weekly
savings in any chartered savings bank;
(d) bonds, debentures, debenture stock or
other securities recallable by drawing of lots
and redeemable with interest and providing for
payment of preminums upon redemption or
otherwi se;
() the Art Union of London, Great Britain,
or the Art Union of Ireland.
There have been from time to time raffles
at church bazaars all over the country, but
as far as I know the other exemptions have
not been availed of to any considerable extent.
Formerly there was in the Criminal Code
another exception:
Any distribution by lot among the members
or ticket liolders of any incorporated society
establislhed for the encouragement of art, of
any paintings, drawings or other work of art
produced by the labour of the members of, or
published by or under the direction of, such
incorporated society.
Under that clause members of an art society
could draw for their own works among themselves. But there was considerable abuse of
the law. For instance, an art society would
be incorporated, buy a number of very
inferior pictures, mostly chromos, and set
them up in a store. I have seen two or three
Hon. Mr. FORKE.

such places in Montreal. According to the
law these pictures could be sold only among
members of the institution, but the establishments got over that by issuing tickets, the
purchasers

members.
Every Saturday there was a drawing. Each
picture bore a price ranging from $1 to $1,000,
and it was announced that the winner of any
picture might take the money instead. The
result was that many of those chromos remained on the walls for months and years.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Like the
rubber sandwiches in Quebec.

India

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This privilege
to art societies was abused ta such an extent
that I decided, after repeated requests by
police magistrates, to endeavour to have it
withdrawn. Nearly every week young boys
would be up in the courts charged with
pilfering small sums with which to buy
tickets. The lotteries were operating in the
centre of Montreal, on St. James street and
Notre Dame street, and they had a bad
influence on large numbers of boys and young
men who were attracted to them on Saturday afternoons. My Bill to eliminate from
the Code the excepting clause that I have
quoted was readily agreed to in this Chanber. It met with considerable resistance in
another place, where interested parties put
up a formidable lobby, yet the measure
carried.
My honourable friend from Essex
(Hon. Mr. Lacasse) does not realize what
an improvement there was in Montreal the
day after those places were closed, as compared with the day before. The very atmosphere seemed to be purer.
A lottery is a game of chance, based on
nothing but a possibility, and sensible people
of experience govern themselves by probabilities rather than by possibilities. I submit
ta my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Lacasse)
that if it is wrong to lure our young people
with the idea that they can obtain money
by chance without effort, then we should
not put the temptation of a lottery in their
way. We had in Montreal some years ago
400 licensed saloons. There was one at nearly
every street corner on Craig street. They
sold alcoholie liquors, beer and wine, and
drunkenness was rampant. In time the number of licences was greatly reduced, and now
liquor cannot be so easily obtained. The
result is that there is not the same temptation ta young people, and the city of
Montreal has been greatly benefited.
Of course, I know it is annoying to think
that hundreds of thousands of dollars go
from Canada for the purchase of tickets in
the Irish sweepstakes.
Two weeks ago I

JUNE 17, 1931
was in a small town of less than 3,000
people, where there are two branch banks.
One -of the bank managers told me hie had
transferred $200 on behaif of his own clients
for the last sweepstake, and that hie knew
a similar amount had been sent from the
other bank. That is $400 fromn that small
place; so it seems reasonable to assume that
a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars,
perhaps more than a million, left this country
for the purchase of -tickets in that sweepstake.
Many of the people whose money went to
make up that vast sum would nlot contribute directly towards the support of hospitals;
they bouglit a ticket only because there was
a chance to make something. One of the
most difficult arguments we have to face is
that a lottery systemn would provide funds
that are hadly needed by many of our
hospitals. But it seems to me that our chief
concern in this matter should be to do nothing that might encourage the gambling spirit
among our young people, and for that reason
I shaîl vote for the amendment.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Poirier, the debate
was adjourned.

THE JUDICIARY
NOTICE

OF MOTION

Hon. L. McMEANS gave notice of the
following motion:
That he will move that a Select Committee of
this House be appointed to examine into the
system of appointing judges as at present existing, with power to send for all papers and
examine witnesses under oath, and report upon
the necessity of taking some steps by which the
number of judges may be reduced, and the system of appointments equalized.
He said: Honourable senators, may I just
say a word in explanation? When I expressed
myself as opposed to a two weeks' adjournment of the Senate, I said that I had an important matter that I should like to have
examined. The notice of motion I have just
given pertains to that. I think anyone who
has a knowledge of the number of judges in
Canada to-day can come to only one conclusion, namely, that there are too many.
This is not my own opinion only. I have
taken the matter up with the Attorney
Ceneral of Manitoba and have also spoken
to the Chief Justices of the different courts
in that province. The Attorney General informed me that he was quite willing to have
the number of appeal judges in Manitoba
reduced from five to three, but that he
thought he ought to have some recommendation from or concurrence with the powers
that be at Ottawa. I am illustrating my
point be referring to the one province of
Manitoba, which has five judges sitting in the
Court of Appeal, although that province has
only about 600,000 people, mostly agriculturists, and no matters of great importance
are involved.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Soviets?

JUNE 18, 1931
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Well, there are
some there. Compare that province with
Ontario, which has a population of nearly
3,000,000. In Ontario, I think, there are two
Courts of Appeal, but in some parts of that
province the judges are doing a good deal of
work, though in other parts they have practically nothing to do.
I asked a judge of the Court of Appeal in
Manitoba what hie thought about the Attorney
General having the number of appeal judges
reduced from five to three, and hie said it
was a good idea. The other western provinces
-SakathewnAlberta and British Columbia-also have Courts of Appeal. We know
that the provinces creste these courts and
the Dominion has to pay the salaries of the
judges. In some parts of the country the
county judges are so numerous that many of
them have littie to do.
I have no desire to cast any reflection on
the Bench, but I do think that conditions
would be improved if the numbers were reduced when vacancies occurred, and judges
were selected on'ly where they might be
needed. The number of judges could be redueed where it was9 shown that they had
nothing to do. If we made some report to
the Dominion Government after -an investigation, so that they could take this matter
up with the provinces, we might aecomplish a
great deal of good. I have no doubt we oould
effeet an immense saving in expenses to the
country. Our population is flot incressing,
but if there should be an increase in population, or a necessity for more judges, it would
be a simple matter for the provincial governments to, increase the number of judges by
amendments.
I made enquiry some time ago as to the
numiber of superior court judges in this
Dominion and found there were 136, if I recolleet rightly, whereas in England-which, of
course, means En-gland alone, and does flot
include Ireland or Scotland-I found that for
a population of nearly 50,000,000 people there
were only 32 or 33 judges who have to deal
with the most serious questions, such as
admiralty, probate and similar cases. It is
from those English courts that we get all
our legal precedents, and therefore they are
moet important; yet they have only 32 or 33
judges for a population five times larger than
ours, while we have 136 judges for about
10,000,000 people. I believe that if we could
bring about such a change as I propose, the
judges themselves would be well satisfied, as
well as the people, and there would be a great
saving to this country.
Now that an adj ournment for the next two
weeks has been decided upon, I have no hope
22112--19J

of any progress being made in the matter
at this session, but I desired to bring it
before the House prior to the proposed adournment.

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE-BILL
REJECTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Barnard for the adoption of the report of the
Standing Committee to whom was referred
Bill E, an Act with respect to Hospital Sweepstakes.
Hon. P. POIRIER (Translation): Honourable members of the Senate, the matter under
consideration is a question of high morality,
since it concerns assistance to the hospitals.
If it involved only that, I would support the
Bill; but we have to consider also the means
proposed, and to these I cannot subscribe.
The question arises, Does the end justify
the means? Are the means lawful? Should
we encourage lotteries as proposed in the Bill?
I (o not think so.
There is first the question of charity. If
the act of charity is to be complete, he who
gives must have some merit in giving. Suppose that to-day I meet a needy person and
give him a meal. He benefits by that meal,
and, as it is a matter of charity, I have the
merit of having given it to him.
With regard to the sweepstakes proposed by
this Bill, I would ask you, honourable colleagues, whether the person who buys a ticket
is actuated by the idea of doing a charitable
deed. Seldom; perhaps never. The dominant
idea, is to possess a winning ticket. In the
case of the sweepstakes the hospitals would
undoubtedly benefit, but it would be necessary
to deduet the commissions, the cost of
advertising, the prizes, etc. For every million,
or perhaps million and a half, paid to tlie
hospitals. one or two millions are retained or
distributed among the prornoters and ticketsellers.
Should we encourage sweeptakes in CanI remember that before Mussolini

Froni

what I have read in the newspapers it appears
that in that country there were people who,
expecting to win fortunes by purchasing lottery tickets, contented themselves with the
thought and the hope that they held lucky
numbers, and thus they spent their time in
idleness. Italy, from the moral point of view,
suffered considerably from that state of mind.
You may tell me that what the Bill proposes is not as serious as what took place in
Italy; but everything has a beginning. You
have doubtless noticed, honourable gentlemen,
that the Canadian people have been deeply
stirred by the results of the recent drawing in
Ireland. Out of several millions of tickets
sent from Canada a few succeeded in winning
up to $30,000. Now everybody believes that
by purchasing a sweepstakes ticket he will
acquire the wherewithal to live in case and
comfort in his old age. The effect of that,
honourable members, is pernicious.
You
create among the purchasers of tickets the
hope of suddenly becoming rich, and that is
a rather unwholesome attitude. So far as I
am concerned, although I am not a severe
moralist, I am whole-heartedly opposed to this
Bill, because of its harmful tendency.
The law allows certain benevolent lotteries.
They have not the same effect. At bazaars
and tombolas, for instance, the prizes given
are not large and people are not made rich by
them. Most people buy tickets for the purpose of helping the bazaar. There is morally
no harmful result. But the effect of drawings
conducted on a large scale is harmful. For
this reason I shall vote against the Bill.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I rise to say but a few words on this
question, especially to draw the attention of
this honourable House to the effect of the
amendment of which I have given notice.
The purpose of my amendment is to leave
it to each province to decide for itself whether
or net sweepstakes shall b allowed to be operated witiin the province and outside of Canada. The proposed change would limit the
operation of sweepstakes in Canada to such
provinces as are in favour of it. I think my
anmendment is a steip in the right direction.
Now, without for the present expressing
my opinion on the merits of the Bill, I would
dra.w the attention of this honourable House
to this point, that in considering the Bill it is
desirable to keep in view the facts as they
exist at the present tine. Whether this
Bill passes or not, sweepstake tickets will
be sold. They are being bought in the varions
provinces of the Dominion and they will continue to be bought in very large numbers.

JUNE 18, 1931
Canadian. moniey wiii be wasted in great
measure, and the balances wiil go to the benefit
of .hospitals in Ireiand. Il the Bill were passed
by this honourable House it wouid ha lef t to
the Attorney General of eaoth province to
see fthat control is exercised over the amount
of wages to be paid to any and ail officiais
or promoters, and it would be his duty to
see that as large a portion as possible of
the amount of money paid ehouJd go to the
hospitais. T-herefore tihe Bull wouid prevent
the money of this country f.romt being wasted
in Ireiand, andc would ensure its reaohing a
proper destination, to ha used for the benefit
of hospitals in this country.
Another argument in favour of the Bill is
that it if, an effective way of assisting the
labouring classes. In this, country we have
not one-flfth of the hospitals for the labouring people that we should have, and to mny
mind this is about the only way to provide
for the establishment and maintenance of
such hospitals. As I said a moment ago, we
shouid take into consideration the fact that
sweepstake, tickets are being sold in this
country, and that unless the sale of these
tickets is prevanted, the money will go to
Ireland instead of being applied to, the benefit
of the hospitals of Canada.
Some Hon. SFjNATOIRS: Question!
Hon. G. H. BARNAiRD: Honourabla gentlemen, if no othcr members wish to, address
the House, I should like, in closing the debate,
to say a few *words in raply to the speech
made by the right honourable the junior memtber for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir 'Geo. E. Foster) yesterday afternoon. I feel that the introduction of this Bill should he a source of
satisfaction to us ail, because, aven if it has
done nothing aise, it enabled the memibers of
this House to hear the right honourable gentleman yesterday and to note the&unwaning
power of his intellect and the undiminished
vigour of his sarcasm, ridicule and invective.
I amn sure honourable suem-bars will join with
me in extending to him hearty congratulations on the eloquence of his effort and in expressing the wish that hie may long be spared
to enliven the proceadings of this Chamber
on any question that may comte before it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BARNAiRD: If I had as much
confidence in the sound judgmant of the right
honourabla gentleman as I have admiration
for his eloquence, I should feel constrained
to withdraw the Bill front the House; but on
previous occasions I have. had to diffor with:
him so frequently on kindred questions that

293

1 am irnpelled to lea've this Bill to the judgment of the House.
I do not purpose following stap by step the
arguments made by the right honouraible gentlemran in his speech, but shahl deal with offly
one or two points upon which I think hae
argued not quite fairly. I intend also to ignore
the personal references that hie made to mue.
I do not think the riýght honourable gentleman meant to, be severe, for hie is a kindly
person, and 1 think bis bark is probably
somewhat worse than his bite.
His first objection was that there had beau
an endeavour by somobody-myself, I suppose-to railroad this Bill through tha House
without proper discussion. He was followeh
by my honourable friand to, my ef t (Hon.
Mr. Gillis), who m-ada the samne statament.
The faots are these. The Bill was introduced
into this House on the 6th of May. It was
printed and distributed. It came up for
second reading on the 8th of May, and after
short speeches in favour of it had bean made
by mysaîf and the honourable member front
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), it:
raceîvad its second reading ncm. con. Apparently nobody elsa wanted to speak. I do
not know whether my right honourable friand
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Fostar) was under
the impression that it was; ey duty to provide him wi.th speakers in opposition to the
Bill, or whether hae thought it was my duty
to comte to him, as the custodian of the public
morals in this House, and tell him that hae
should ba ready to say somathîng in opposition to my measura. If not, it seams to;
me that it was his business and his duty,
whan the Bill had been on the Order Paper
for the customary length of tima, to have
read it, and, if hae had any objection to it,
to gat up and voice that objection. The
next step was a motion to sand the Bill to, a
spacial committee. I did flot ask for the
third raading at that time. Soma hontourabla
gentlemen suggested -that it should get the
third raading than, and naturally I said 1
had no objection; but my motion, the motion
th-at carried, was that the Bill should go to
a special committea. The Bill then want to
a speci-al comnmittea. The report of the coinmittea was presentad to the House on th3
l3th of May and has beau standing for con-'
sideration sinca, and the motion now bafore
the House is that the report ha adopte]..

The appointment of a select committee on

himself into an impossible position. Hie

He said: Honourable senators, I understand

amendments to this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
As I have already
stated, if the Hon. the Minister of Justice

amendments to the Bankruptcy Act before
Parliament at the next session, I should have
moved several amendments to the Bill that
is now before us.
In the circumstances I
thought it proper to wait until next session,
but I had intended to follow the suggestion
of a few honourable members and explain the
amendments I have in mind. Possibly I have
been dilatory; in any event, I have not the
amendments ready to-day.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I take it that
the honourable gentleman is not objecting to
the passage of this Bill, but that he has other
amendments to the Act in mind.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, that is it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That being the
case, I suggest the honourable gentleman
shouki agree to the third reading of the Bill

MOTION

POSTPONED

On the notice of motion:
That a special committee of
members
of the Senate be appointed to enquire into and
report upon the matters mentioned by the
Honourable N. A. Belcourt at the sitting of
the Senate on June 16, 1931, and appearing in
the Debates of the Senate of that date, in
regard to the purchase by a department of the
Government of copies of the publication
"Canada,'' and also to consider and report
upon the association of the said Honourable
N. A. Belcourt in the said matters and what
action, if any, should be taken by the Senate
in regard, thereto.
Hon. Mr. POPE Wednesday, July 8.

297

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable senators, I should like to point out that when
the honourable the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) made his preliminary
statement he said he would place before this
House the evidence given at the trial, as well
as the judgment. He has not produced the
evidence given at the trial, and I should like
to ask the honourable leader on the other
side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) if he will have
the evidence placed before us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not
remember that the honourable the senior
member for Ottawa made that statement.
Hon. Mr. -GORDON: He said, "I hope tu
be in a position on Tuesday next,"-Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:

What date?

Hon. Mr. GORDON: On the 12th of June,
page 259, the honourable the senior senator
for Ottawa said:
I hope to be in a position on Tuesday next,
when the House resumes, to place before
honourable members all the evidence given at
the trial, as well as the judgment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He said he hoped
to do so. We are full of hope for better
times, but we are not getting them.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: That is what he was
waiting for.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thought that
the honourable the senior senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) had complied
with his statement of the 12th of June.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But he did not produce the evidence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My attention
had not been drawn to his declaration that he
would produce the evidence. I do not know
what he meant by the evidence. It may not
have been extended.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: He said "all the
evidence."
The motion was discharged from the Order
Paper and placed on the Orders of the Day
for Wednesday, July 8.
THE JUDICIARY
MOTION-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. L. MeMEANS moved:
That a Select Committee of this House be
appointed to examine into the system of
appointing judges as at present existing, with
power to send for all papers and examine
witnesses under oath, and report upon the
necessity of taking some steps by which the
nunber of judges may be reduced, and the
system of appointments equalized.

SENATE
He said: Honourable members, I have already made a statement to the House on the
subject of this motion-though I was out of
order, I believe, in discussing it-and anything
that I might say to-night would be simply
a reitera-tion of what I have already said.
I would therefore simply move the motion
for the purpose of giving honourable mermbers of the House an opportunity of expressing themselves either in favour of it or against
it. I have no hope that, even if the cormmittee were granted, it would be able to
accomplish much at this late date in tha
session.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is that the motion
with regard to the number of judges?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
the honourable gentleman.

Yes.
I will vote with

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Had not my honourable friend better say something about it?
His opinion is highly valued by the House.
Honourable
MacARTHUR:
C.
Hon.
senators, when the honourable member from
Winnipeg referred to this motion at the
sitting on June 18 I rose in my place witb
the intention of asking a question. I caught
the eye of His Honour the Speaker, and had
the floor, but I got no further than "Honourable members" when the honourable gentleman from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) rose
in his place and raised a point of order. I
think he intended to raise the point of order
as against the honourable member from
Winnipeg. I certainly was not out of order.
I warited simply to ask the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg whether be was reflecting
the views of the Canadian Bar Association.
I did not get an opportunity to ask my
question. Perhaps my honourable friend will
answer it now.
I may say that for the past few years I have
been following some of the legislation and
proceedings relating to County Court judges
and Supreme Court judges, and perhaps have
had something to do with the appointment of
two or three of them. During that time much
has been learned from the Minister of Justice
and his officiaIs, and there has been an expression of opinion by the members of the
Canadian Bar Association, the effect of which
was that they favoured not only a reduction
in the number of judges, but also an increase
in the judges' salaries. The honourable memiber from Winnipeg has not mentioned an increase in salaries, but has spoken of a saving
to the country; so I take it that he has not
considered the matter of increased remuneraHon. Mr. MeMEANS.

tion. However, I should think that if in this
respect a change in legislation is contemplated,
the opinion of the Canadian Bar Association
would have considerable weight, and I should
like to hear from the honourable member
fromn Wiînnipeg as to whether or not he refleots the views of the Canadian Bar Association.
I can only say in
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
answer to the honourable gentleman that, so
far as I know, this matter never came before
the Canadian Bar Association. I do not know
what its opinion may be, or that I should
feel bound by it. I should want evidence
from the different provinces and districts. I
do not think the Canadian Bar Association
could go into that matter. At a meeting of
the Canadian Bar Association held some time
ago, Sir Robert Borden, if i am not mistaken,
made the statement that there were too many
judges. I have no knowledge as to the question of salaries, and cannot say anything
about it. That is for the Government to deal
with. I think I can assure my honourable
friend of one thing, however: that they will
not be reduced.
I do nlot like to say very much about the
Bar Association. Did my honourable friend
ever attend a meeting of that association
and hear it discuss any question relating to
the judges? It does not discuss such questions
except to say that the salaries might be increased. I do not think my honourable friend
should ask me if I reflect the opinion of
the Bar Association, because I cannot tell
him. I have never been informed what that
opinion is, and I do not sec how I can say
whether I reflect it or not.
With the perHon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
mission of the House, I should like to explain.
I am not a member of the Bar, and have no
right to attend the meetings; but I think my
honourable friend is a member and must know
that this has been a live subject with the
association.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

No.

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Formally it may
not have been, but informally it certainly has
been. I am not saying that I am in favour of
an increase in salaries, but I think we are all
agreed on the principle of reducing the number of judges. I was just wondering whether
my honourable friend was reflecting the views
o the Canadian Bar Association.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I am not going to discuss the
motion of the honourable gentleman from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans), but I would

JULY 2, 1931
remind the Hlouse that some years ago we
passed what was commonly called the Ross
Bill-a Bill introduced by my predecessor as
leader of the Senate, providing that judges
who served on commissions should nlot receive
any remuneration for so doing. They drew
their full Government allowances, oi course,
but were nlot to receive extra remuneration
for other work done by t.hem. I think that
if the honourable gentleman who moves the
motion would allow the inquiry to be extended to that legisiation, it would be very
useful to direct inquiry to it also, because
it has heen intimated to me that throughout
Canada the Act we passed has become obsolescent. I do not know what truth there may
be in that statement. When the Bill of Hon.
Mr. Ross was under discussion it was stated
clearly that a man occupying a position on
the Bench should receive an adequate salary,
but nothing more. I should like to have
an addition made to the motion so as to have
it cover that point.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: There is a recent
decision of the Court of Appeal to the effect
that the Government of Canada has no power
to pass that clause paohibiting a judge from
undertaking an outside commission. That
decision stands there to-day. I called the
attention of the honourable leader of the
Opposition to it some time ago, and he
promised to take the matter up with the
Minister of Justice and have the clause either
repealed or enforced. The appeal judgment
arose from a case in which. a judge acted on
an arbitration in which the City of Winnipeg
was the defendant. The award was very
heavy, and the City appealed to the Court
of Appeal, taking the objection that the judge
had no righit to sit as an arbitrator. In the
.iudgment, which. was given by four judges,
three of them held that the Dominion Art
was not binding at ail; that once iudges were
appointed they merely carried out the law
of the province, and the Dominion Parliament had no power at ail to pass that Act.
1 do not think that the Department of Justice paid any attention to that judgment,
although the leader of the Opposition promised the House that hie would have the matter
looked into, and a report made on it.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: 0f course it is not
for the leader on this side to implement a
promise made by the leader when on the
other aide. My honourable friend has just
referred to the constitutional aspect of the
problem. I intended rising to express my
diffidence as to our right to go very far in
such an investigation as that suggpsted by

299

my honourable friend. The administration of
justice lies with the provinces. The creation
of the tribunals rests with them, and our duty
is to make the appointments and pay the
salaries. Of course I have -known times when
the Federal
Cabinet lias suspended its
sanction for a while, but on being pressed
by the Government of the Province that had
enacted the legislation, it felt obliged to
abide by the law.
The investigation that my honourable friend
desires would not go much beyond an
academic venture, and I would theref are
suggest that he should not press lis motion
thîs evening, but should allow us to think
over the matter. I confess that I have not
given it the time I ought to have given.
What disturbs me is the request for authority
to send for witnesses and examine theui under
oath. If we are to consider this question
academically, are we not going a little too
far in starting an enquiry which would seem
to be a judicial one?
Hon. R. LEMIEUX: Honourable members,
1 do not see that the motion calîs for any
investigation about judges violating the law.
The hon-ourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. McMeans) lias just stated that some
judge was sitting in an arbitration. If we
have to investigate such cases, the motion
miglit be so amended as to enable us ta
ascertain whether in these instances there is
a contravention of the law passed ooncerning
this matter.
As to the nuniber of judges, I do not know
the circumistances in the Province of Manitoba, neyer having practised law there. I
gather from the honourable gentleman's remarks that the numiber of judges in that
province could ibe mnaterially reduced. I do
not know whether a similar evil exists elsewhere. Hlowever, I may say, with all due
regard to mem-bers of the bar in other provinces, that we do not expect that the number
of judges coul-d be reduced in the old Province
of Quebec. The reason is this. At the time
of Confederation Sir George Etienne Cartier,
who was one of the Fathers of Confederation
and knew perfectly well the circumatances od
the people of Quebec in the varions districts
from Gaspé to Pontiac, made it a point that
the judges ehould reside in their respective
districts. This principle was adhered to for a
great many years, because the judge in his
county town or city was like the seigneur of
old, the very emibodiment of leadership in
society. With the bishop, the parish priest
and the other leading authxoritiei., he exercised
a decided moral influence over the whole
district. My honourable friend bore from La

SENATE
Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau) and members from
our rural districts know what a beneficial
influence the judges in our province have
exercised for fifty years.
The system las been changed in recent
years. The objection that was made is, I
admit, a serious one. The members of the
bar in a particular district, appearing daily
during every term of the court, would get
from the judge residing in that district the
same jurisprudence, and that might give rise
to more appeals from the judgments of the
Superior Court-the common law court of the
Province of Quebec, of which I am speakingthan were necessary. It was thought by the
Chief Justice of the province and the Assistant
Chief Justice that judges should alternate and
pass from one district to another. At the suggestion of the bar, and possibly of litigants,
authority was therefore given that judîges
should, in turn, go 'from one district to another. There are objections to this system.
The whole social life of those districts bas
been changed, and as was said the other day
in another place by a gentleman who bas
occupied a very high position in the Government of Canada, it seems that the judges in
the rural districts to-day are guided only by
the railway time-table; the people have no
chance to see them, and speak to them, and
derive whatever benefit they can from their
presence.
When the judges remained in the districts
in which they resided they would after a while
develop law libraries which could be consulted by litigants and barristers. Per contra,
t bas been stated that it is better to have
the judges centralized in Montreal and Quebec, where they get better facilities to consult
law libraries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
among themselves.

And consult

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: And consult among
themselves, as I think they do. But, although
I have ceased practising at the bar, I think
this later systeni of centralizing justice in
Montreal and Quebec is not altogether to be
favoured. I think it is not aocording to the
intention of the Fathers of Confederation,
especially of Sir George Etienne Cartier, and
before him Sir Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine,
and later Sir A. A. Dorion, who laid the
foundations of our judicial system in the Province of Quebec. They meant that the judges
should reside in their respective districts in
order to exercise that moral authority which
their appointments conferred upon them. Of
course I am speaking for the Province of
Quebec, and am venturing to give only my
personal opinion on the matter.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

On the other hand my honourable friend
fron Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans), if J
may judge by his remarks and the tenor of
his motion, would like to have the number
of judges reduced. I do not question at all
iy honourable friend's intention. Do you not
think 'that justice should be as accessible as
possible to the masses of this country? The
delays of justice are very strongly criticized,
and also the costs. Without committing myself at present, I may say that I shall follow
with interest the investigation by the committee. Before reducing the number of judges
we should think twice.
Hon. Mr. POPE:
Formerly the judges
used to visit our country communities in the
Province of Quebec, but they no longer do so.
for the cases are tried at certain centres now
and the parties have to go to the expense of
taking witnesses there. It costs a man a great
deal more now to find out whether he is entitled to win.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. POPE: I say this notwithstanding that I am not a lawyer and I have never
sued anybody.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
It is quit"
true, as the honourable gentleman fron Bedford (Hon. Mr, Pope) says, that the judges
used to hold court in thoir country divisions.
I approve of that system entirely, but that
does not exactly come under the motion that
I understand that
îs before this Chamber.
the honourable member fron Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans) expresses the opinion-and his
motion is to the sane effect-that there are
too many judges. He says that the judges
of the Court of Appeal in Manitoba, at any
rate, think that there is not quite enough
work for the five of then to do, and that the
number might be reduced. I believe that the
honourable gentleman fron Winnipeg should
he highly commended by this Bouse. We ar
always hearing complaints in the Senate that
w«e have not enough work to do. If a conimittee is appointed it will not necessarilv
follow that its work will bear fruit at this
session, but it may result in an improvement
later. I have noticed over a great number of
years that many inquiries which have started
here have had good effects. My honourable
friend the leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) says that we might have an
academie discussion. Well, he bas sat at the
League of Nations, and that organization lias
had academic discussions for the ten years
or more that it lias been in existence, and it
vill continue te have them. I think the pro-

JULY 2, 1931
posed inquiry is a good thing and I shall
hcartily vote for the motion. If the special
comimittee does not get through with its
work this session, it will be reappointed next
session.
There is certainly. very much to lie said
on the whole question. Honourable members
are aware that the best lawyers, especially in
the large cities, wiIl not accept an appointment as a judge. I do flot think there is a
lawyer in this House who will deny that.
There are many lawyers-I could give the
n-ames of a number of them-who make four,
five or six times as mucli as the salary of a
judge. Then there are a number of judgeI shall fot mention their names, aithougli I
have them in mind-who say they have no
time te render a judgment until a year or
even two years after they have tried a case.
I dlaim that is a denial of justice. 1 arn
thankful to the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans) *for bringing forward this
motion, because it gives me an opportunity
to say these things. Sometimes a judge will
hold back his judgment in a simple case,
stating that he has no time te attend to the
matter, aithougli he has time to deliver
lectures on history and on varlous other sulijects. Everybody knows that it often takes
a long time to prepare an address. Honourable members will agree that sometimes bef ore they make a speech in this House tliey
have te spend a great deal of time ini preparation. If no judge would deliver a lecture
while he stili has a judgment unprepared,
there would nlot be this denial of justice.
I think that there should be some law empowering the Minister of Justice or the
Attorney General to tell a judge that he must
deliver his judgments within a reasonable
time.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is very imprudent, I suppose, for a land surveyor to speak
like this, but if one gets old without learning anything what is the good of living? It
often happens that a poor man, who has had
a lawsuit in which lie was on the riglit aide,
actually goes into bankruptcy months before
he gets his judg-ment. Is that riglit? I lielieve that it would be a good thing if, as
the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) suggested, judges
were not allowed te act on commissions, nor
te devote their time to any other work, wlien
by se doing they have te deny justice to
parties who are waiting for judgments. I
suggest that the lionourable gentleman from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) should include ini his motion a recommendation elong
this line.

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I rise to a point of
erder, which. I ask His Honour the Speaker
to decide. The motion is for the appointment of a committee to investigate the
system of appointing judges and to inquire
whether there are too many judges at the
present time. But the discussion lias drifted
into a criticism. of the judiciary of Canada.
I think that is out of order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I think the point
of order is well taken.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I bow to your decision, Mr. Speaker, with great pleasure; but
I have my own opinion. We were told when
the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) introduced lis motion, that England,
with a population of nearly 38,000,000, has
*only some 32 judges, whereas Canada has
over 400. Now, the lionourable gentleman
from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) lias
spoken about the system of appointing
resident judges, and my purpose in rising
was to refer te that. The centralization of
the judges was brought about by the Hon.
Thomas Chase Casgrain wlien lie was
Attorney General of Quebec. I think my
lionourable friend from Rougemont will agree
that lie was a pretty good lawyer. As my
honourable friend lias said,' the judges were
liobnobbing witli the parish priest, and with
,the seigneur, if tliere was one left, as well
as with otlier persons. Tliey were not paid
by this Government for doing that. In
the city of Mýontreal there is so mucli business that the judges cannot attend to it ail.
Some of the delays are not tlie fault of the
judges, wlio have more work than tliey can
do. Tliat is ne critîcism of tliem.
Wliat I have been saying applies only to,
the Province of Quebec. There are different
systems in other parts of the country. In
Ontario, for instance, there are County Court
jpdges. In counties which have two judges,
one of tbem is the head County Court judge
and lie gives lis assistant tlie privilege of
sitting on many cases, egpeciaily in the liot
weather.
The question as to tlie number cf judges
in Manitoba was responsible for the bringing
cf this matter before us.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No; in Saskatchewan
and Alberta-in the whole country.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I really believe the
proposed inquiry would be a good thing,
whether it became academical or net. It is
often claimed that tlie Senate lias nct very
much work te, do, but when some honourable
member suggests work there is always someone
opposed to it.

QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon.
C.
MacARTHUR:
Honourable
members, as a matter of privilege, before the
Orders of the Day are called I should like to
speak briefly of a newspaper report of an incident that occurred in this Chamber ou

JULY 2, 1031
June 18. True, the incident occurred behind
closed doors, and I shouid be out of order in
dîscussing it now if it were not for the fact
that it bas already been given puiblicity. Unfortunately, it has been reported erroneously
by the Canadian Press from the Atlantic ta
the Pacifie. There are sex'eral features that
might very weil be considered. In the first
place, is it advantageous ta have questions
of the kind discussed behind closed doors?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
question?

What is the

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUIR: I am coming ta
it. I know the honourabie gentleman is
anxious ta proceed with his Bill. The publie,
I think, feel that there is same sinister motive
f or discussions behind clased doors; and
matters are nat helped at ail when someane
in this Chamber, whether an officiai or a
member, discioses what has taken place.
Now I came ta the subject-matter of the
question of privilege, which is a Canadian
Press dispatch dated Ottawa, June 18. It
says:
For an haur this afternoonIt was nat an haur. There is nathing right
about the dispatch.
For an hour this afternoon, the Senate sat
behind closed doors. A proposai from Senator
Dandurand, Liberal Leader, that the Senate
when *it
adjourned ta-day shauld stand
adjourned until Juiy 2 was discussed. Conservative senators opposed the proposa;There is in that statement a plain implication
that the Liberai members voted for a long
adjournment in preference ta a shorter one
which had been suggested.
-but on a division the motion ta adjourn until
July 2 carried. The Senate then opened its
daors and proceeded with its regular business
for the day.
Every honaurable member knows that there
is -nathîng right about that repart. At the
request of the leaders ini this House an effort
was made ta ascertain the consensus of
opinion of honourable inembers, but no party
question was raised, and there was not a
division or a recorded vote, as one wouid be
led to believe there was, fromn a reading of
the report. I was na sooner home after the
adjournment than several persans asked me
why anc party voted in favour of an adj aurnment ta, July 2, and against the shorter
adjournment proposed framn the Conservative
side of the Hause. We ail remember what
took place. The question was whether it
would be better ta, remain here for a fortnight doing nathing, or ta adI ourn ta Juiy

favaur of the longer adjournment.

INQUIRY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Honourabie members. I have noticed that in another place, and
in the press generaliy, reference has been
made ta the trip to Western Canada taken
by the Minister of Labour. I gather from
what I can iearn that conditions in the West
are appalling. Is it the intention of the honoura;ble Minister to, make ta this House a
statement similar to the one that was made
in the other House?
Hon. Mr. RO)BER7!SON: I have no objection whatever to making a statement to the
Senate, if it is deemed desirable. I visited
Western Canada for the purpose of ascertaining the facts respecting unemployment. It
was reported that another crop failure, due
ta drought, had resulted in a rather seriouq
condition in the Province of Saskatchewan.
I visited each of the four Western Provinces
and had consultations with members of the
Governments of those provinces, and Vhrough
their courtesy in inviting representations fromn
the znayors of the various municipalities,
more especially those having large populations,
a great deal of useful information was gathered. A reasonably comprehensive, and detailed report has been subinitted to the
Government here on my return. The Government has, I believe, as the Prime Minister
announced yesterday in another place, already
given some consideration ta, this matter, and
it is probable that further announcements will
be made respecting the 'Government's proposais for the relief of the situation which
has resuited fromn the drought and the abnormal unemployment conditions. I respectfuiýly suggest that it might be w'ise to pastpone the discussion of this subject a few days
until the Government's proposais are brought
down. Id the Hanse is sufficiently interested

to desire some advance information in regard

JULY 3, 1931
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Oh, no. I rernerber-if I arn not clearly out of rny mindthat at the tirne I objected to this huge surn,
,extending over rnany years.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Take off a million.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Well, I will take
off a million.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Perhaps I can
enlighten the Huse. 1 was one of the
original members of the Commission for the
beautification of the city of Ottawa. I
occupied that position for, I think, fifteen
years. A great deal ýf work was done, and it
was done very cheaply. At one time a rnerber of this býouse, the Hon. William Gibson,
a well-known contractor, was taken over the
works, and after examining themn lie said
they could flot be done again for four limes
the rnoney. Sir Henry Bate, a prorninent
business man of Ottawa, followed the matter
very closely. Many improvernents were
made, including the beautiful rond leading
along the Ottawa river down towards Rideau
Hall. Then there was a change of government, and I thought that after fifteen years
of service I might resign and that the Borden
Government would appoint somebody else.
They did so, and at that time the appropriation was increased a little. The highest
point it reached was, I think, 825,000 a year
for ten years, which would be 32A50,00. So
when the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Dand-urand). speaks of 83,000,000 hie also is
mistaken.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The honoura-ble the
leader is spealdng of only one year. I remnemlier that when the Russell bouse was tomn
down the city was t0 be beautified at an
expenditure of 33,000,000 a year for ten years,
or 830,000,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend said $30,000,000 a year.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: I said a huge surn of
money am'ounting to 330,000,000 had 'been
voted; that is, 33,000,000 a year for ten
years. I remember that at the tirne I
brought in an amendinent to the honourable
gentleman's motion, te provide that these
grants should not be made for a >period of ten
years, but shouild be renewed frorn year to
year as the -circumstances required. I think
we need to restriet the expenditure, of the
country's rnoney at present. In rny opinioni
,the ainount spent upon the city of Ottawa is
entirely too large, and I should like some
further explanatiion of the need of granting
the sum ihentioned in the Bill. I would move

the adjournmnent of the debate, so that the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
may furnish us with further information.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: What further
information is wanted?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

We want to know.

Hon. R. DANDUIRAND: I confess that I
do not agree with my honourable friend fromn
Winnipeg. I belleve that the responsibility
has rested upon the Federal Governrnent to
do the righit thing by the Capital of the
Dominion, and 1 arn convinced that the right
thing has been done up to this time. I had
intended to ask rny honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby), either at this stage or when
the Bill came up for third reading, to give us
some idea of the program for the improvement of Ottawa ini the years to corne. I arn
quite proud of what has been done for Ottawa
so far, and I only hope that the central part
of the city will be fuirther beautified. For
eýxample, if the City Hail is t o be removed
to another site,. I should like to see the present
site added to the park, and the fire hall and
police station transferred elsewhere. And
surely that eyesore, that red brick building
nearby, will disappear. I arn ready to vote
in favour of a reasonable amount for the
beautification of the Capital of Canada.
Hon. Mr. FORXE: What about
Preshyterian Church in that locality?
Riight Hon. Mr. GR.AHAM:
expropriated.

the

It has been

I should like
Hon. Mr. BANDURAND:
to see Ottawa gradually brought up to the
standard of other capital cities of the. world.
I arn not suggesting that we should plunge
into large expenditures at this time, for I
know of the financial. difficulties with which
we have to -cope, but surely we are responsible
f or seeing that the work goes on. Since there
will be a continuation of the vote of $100,000,
or whatever, suin is mentioned. in the Bill, I
should like my honourable friend who leads
this House (Hon. Mr.'Willoughby) to tell
us something about what is projected for the
future.
Hon. A. C. HARDY:. I think the large
sum rnentioned by rny honourable friend from.
,Winnipeg (Hon. Mvr. McMeans) was given to
the Federal District Commission. It was not
ýat ail in the sarne category as the suin referred
to in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. MtéMEANS:
about the $30,OO,000.

22112-20
BEVISED EITION

I arn speaking

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HARDY: If I understand the
matter correctly, the $100,000 which is being
asked for here is to be given to the City
of Ottawa in lieu of taxes, water rates and
things of that kind. The other sum was for
the improvement of Ottawa, if I am not mistaken.
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
senators, may I confirm what has just been
stated by my honourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. Hardy)? The object of this Bill
is to extend for one year the agreement under
which the Government of Canada has paid
yearly a certain sum to the City of Ottawa
because no charge was made to the Government for fire protection, water supply and
various services of that kind. Up to 1925 the
annual payment was $75,000, and in that year
the amount was increased te $100,000, to be
paid annually for five years. That period
expired in 1930. This year the City urged
that there should be a substantial increase in
the grant, but finally it agreed to a continuation of the old rate for another year.
That is all there is to this Bill.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
should like to confirm what the Hon. the
Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has
said. I haýppened to be the Minister of Public
Works in 1925, when the Corporation of the
City of Ottawa asked for a larger grant from
the Government. An agreement was entered
into at that time providing for an increase
from $75,000 to $100,000 annually for the
period from 1925 to 1930. I take it that the
object of the Bill is to permit the Government
to pay for the year 1930-31, and that there is
nothing more to the Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not know
that I can say anything useful to supplement
what has been said by my honourable friend
to my right (Hon. Mr. Robertson), but since
the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans) has demanded that I
should give some further information on the
Bill, I may be permitted to read a part of the
statement by the Hon. the Minister of Public Works in another place. He said:
This Bill, however, has no relation whatever
to that subject.
That is, another matter between the City of
Ottawa and the Government.
It simply provides for the payment to the
City of Ottawa of the sum of $100,000, covering payment for certain services rendered-the
supply of water. The old agreement expired
on the lst of July last year, and unless this
Bill is passed there will be no authority to
pay the City for the year that expires on
July 1, 1931. This is the same amount that
has been paid for some years. The City think
mon. Mr. McMEANS.

that they should receive a larger amount than
this and have made some representations
accordingly, but no agreement has been arrived
at. The passing of this Bill will permit
negotiations to continue covering the subjectmatter of this Bill as well as other matters
such as my hon. friend mentions.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I should like my
honourable friend to tell us a little more
about it. It seerns to me that if the $100,000
is merely to pay for fire protection, water
rates and so on, the amount is too large.
Surely such services rendered to this building
and other Government buildings in the city
would not cost $100,000. If I am permitted
to say so, I think that the huge grants
mentioned by the honourable leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), amounting to $30,000,000, at the rate of $3,000,000 a
year for ten years, should not be made when
the people of the West are starving-when
there is a famine in the land. I think a halt
should be called on the expenditure of money
for beautifying the city of Ottawa when people
throughout the country are in want. That is
why I have protested against this Bill.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: I think we are overgenerous to the people of Ottawa, and I do
not think they are sufficiently appreciative
of our generosity. I hope the time will come
when there will be a federal district, when the
expenses in connection with fire protection and
water supply will be met by the Government
in the usual way, and I question very much
that we shall have to pay more than $100,000.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Not for water.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Not for water. Certain
elements of the population of this city do
not appear to have very warm feelings towards the members of this House. They
apparently do not appreciate the grants we
vote. I do not think we should show too
much generosity as far as the people of
Ottawa are concerned.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, I am in favour of paying a reasonable
price for water supply and fire protection. I
do not know any more than my honourable
friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans)
about this; and that means that I do not
know anything at all. I am also in favour
of expending a reasonable amount of money
in the beautification of Ottawa as the Capital
of the country. I think most of us are
proud of Ottawa, including even my honourable friend from Winnipeg. Generally speaking, Ottawa is more beautifully located, and
is a more beautifully kept city, than Washing-

ton.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Winnipeg?

307

JULY 3,1931
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Well, we will give
Winnipeg also a place on the map. 0f course,
we do flot expect to complete this beautification or amplification. of the city for some
years; but, as the honourable leader on the
other side has said, that work must be coinpleted or the money that has been expended
already wll1 have been thrown away.
I have just one criticismn that I think it is
opportune to make. We spent over a ilon
dollars in acquiring the property of the old
hotel and theatre, then we spent con8iderable
public money on laying out the square south
of Sparks street and planting it with trees
and flo'wers. I do not know whether hanourable mnembers of this House have observed the
condition of that square. I walk through iIt
frequently, and it is a fact that a certain
nuinber of the cîtizens of Ottawa have absolutely no respect whatever for its beautification. I do not know that 'another city on
the North American continent could be found
where a publicly laid out park would be
so destroyed as that plot of land south of
Sparks street. The Government laid it off
in walks, but if you go and look at it now
you will find short-cuts ahl through it. The
edges of the walks have been tramped over
until they are like a country highway, and
flot as good-looking. I do not blame the
citizens generally, but I say there are a certain number of people in Ottawa Who have noa
respect whatever for the Government's work,
and consequenïtly this square south of Sparks
street, instead of being a thing of beauty,
is a disgrace to the city. I say this publ.icly
for the benefit of the people who desecrate
it by cuttiiig paths through here and there.
This number includes officials of the country,
whom I watched going through there one day.
and who have cut a short road through the
beautiful part of the park in order that they
might get ta their work. I say that such a
condition is not encauraging to this Parliament; flot encouraging to us who vote large
sums of money for the beautification of tbis
city 1 think that when we do this the
citizens ought to appreciate the, expenditure
and respect the work that is carried on.

SE'NATE
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

lion. Mr. LEMIEUX, for Hon. Mr.
Chapais, moved the second reading of Bill 77,
an Act respecting the constructijon and maintenance of a bridge over the St. Lawrence
river between the Island of Orléans and the
coast of Beaupré, in the Province of Quebcc.
Some lion. SENATORS: Explain.
Iuion. Mr. LEMIEUX: This Bill is promoted by the Quebec Government. The
'bridge has been a suspension bridge-if I may
say so-for many years. It is part of the
work to be undertaken this year for the purpose of hclping to meet the unemployment
situation in t he Province of Quebec. The
Prime Minister of that province represents
the couinty of Montmorency, which is entitled
to have that bridge constructed in order that
the Island of Orléans, with its several parishes
and ifs large population, may be connected
witb the mainland. The bridge will span the
section of the river which is not navigable
at all, or is bardly so, and ail the plans for
its construction are ready. Wbat is better
stili, the two parties agree to the erection of
this bridge. The Bill was promoted in the
other Chamber by a friend of the Goveroment who represents the constituency of
Quebec-Montmorency.
I thinik there is
nothing more to say.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman if it is a toil bridge?
lion. Mr. LEMIEUX:
I do not kýnow
wbetber it will be a toli bridge for al time
to corne, but for a certain number of years,
tintil the cost of the bridge bas been repaid,
it will bave to be a toîl bridge.
lion. Mr. MeMEANS:
Is it being constructed by a private company with the idea
of collecting the toîl?
lion. Mr. LEMIEUX: It is tu bte constructed by the Provincial Goverament.
lion. Mr. MeMEANS: Is there any grant
from the Domninion?
lion. Mr. LEMIEUX:
No, there is no
grant from the Dominion; the grant is made
exclusively by the Province of Que'bec.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

lion. Mr. LEMIEUX moved that the Bill
be referred to the Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and liaribours.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Looking at the
two clauses of the Bill, I do not see any
necessity of sending -it to committee; but if
that procedure is însisted upon, there is
nothing else to be done.
Riglit lion. Mr. GRAHiAM: lionourable
members, I understand the circumstances
very well and arn prepared to vote for the
third reading of the Bill now, yet I think it
would perhaps be just as well to send it to
the Railway C'ommittee. Although this is a
Bill of the Goverament of the Province of
Quebec, it is a private Bill as far as this
House is concerned. Our Railway Committee
will meet at the beginning of the week and
will then have something to do.
Some lion. SENATORS: liear, hear.
The motion was agreed to.

VEHICULAR

TRAFFIC ON WELLINGTON STREET
DISCUSSION

Before the Orders of the Day:
lion. J. McCORMICX: lionourable senators, 1 sbould like to direct the attention of
bonourable members to the danger in crossing
from Metcalfe street to the nortbern side of
Wellington street. On two occasions in the
last couple of weeks I have seen a nearaccident there. 0f course, the great majority
of motorists psy attention to the signais, but
some bave a halbit of making a leîft turn
wbile other people are crossing the street on
the green light. The 'motorists wbo are careless of the rights of others are comparatively
few in nuruber. Why sbould they not be
o.bliged to wait until the light changes?
Surely the pecople who have business in these
buildings, and the public at large, have a
right f0 be able to cross the street safely.
Somne years ago I met with an aeident there.
At that time there were virtually no regulations; and a fool driver came along with no
lights burning and wi.thout sound-ing bis horn,
and ran me down. I think we should insist
upon an undertaking being given, through

JULY 6, 1931
the leader of the House, that th-is condition
will be remedied, so that the people who have
to corne to these buildings may be afforded
some protection i~n crossing the streets. As
far as I arn concerned, I cannot suppo1 't any
Bill for a grant of 8100,000 or any other
amount for the City of Ottawa unless the
authorities here take some steps towards providing su-eh protection.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: I shoiild like to
support the statement of my honourable
friend regarding the risk that pedestrians run,
not only on the streets of Ottawa, but in
cities general.ly.
Some years ago I was
favourably impressed with the regulations in
the city of Milan, where the law was that
citizens on foot hiad the firet right to the
use of the streets, the second riglit beionged
to the horse, which according to tradition
had followed rnan in using the highways, and
the rnotor car had the third right. At present
autornobiles travel on our streets at speeda
frorn 15 to 20 and 25 miles an hour, -in the
very heart of our cities. I cannot admit that
it is necessary to, travel at sucli rates. A
horse driven in the country et 12 miles an
hour would be considered to be going very
fast, and il anyone attemfpted to drive a
horse along Wellington street nt that rate
he would !be put into an asylurn. Yet motor
cars travel et 25 miles an hour an our streets
as a rnatter of course. 1 sornetirnes question
whether the tirne will flot corne when we
shall put a limit of 15 -miles an hour on traffic
within the city lirnits.
SHon. Mr. MoCORMICK: If the honouroble leader of the House (Hon. Mr* Willoughby) wiil support that, we shail have no
difficuJty in rernedy'ing the situation.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: So far as
Wellington street is concerned-~that is, the
only street contiguous to the Parliament
Buildings--I uniderstand that it is under the
control cd the Governirent and not of the
City of Ottawa. If this is so, we are the
people who should take steps to improve the
situation. I have no personal knowledge in
this matter, and I shall have to look it up.
We ail realize that it is a'bsolutely essential
that mernhers of Parliarnent and others who
have business in the Buildings shouid be protected against reckless rnotorists, for whom
I have no syinpathy. I~f we ascertai-n that
Parliament has control of the trafflo on Wellington street opposite these Buildings, then
the matter is in our own hands.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: The Court
of Appea4 in Montreal the other day rendered
a very important judgment, which stated

that the pedestrian had the right of way at
ahl times. An autornobile driver in a certain
case claimed that he had sounded lis horn
before the accident occurred, but the Court
held that that was no excuse for causing the
acident, be-cause the pedestrian crossing the
street had the first right.

RELATIONS 0F SENATOR WITH
DOMINION GOVERN MENT
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE-NOTICE 0F MOTIONr

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable mcmbers of the Senate, I rise to a question of
privihege. I intend to refer to the statement made to the Senate by the honourable
the senior member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) on the 16th of June Iast. When
he had made that staternent the honourable
member frorn North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Ayhesworth) suggested a suspension of proceedings because the matter wss before the
courts. Sorne of the memibers of this Chamber,
among them the honourabie senator from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), my honourable friend who leads the Governrnent (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby), and myseif, concurred in
that proposai. The next day the honourabIe
member for Bed'ford (Hon. Mr. Pope), on
a question of privilege, gave us his views
on the staternent and ended with a notice of
motion, which is down for disposai on
Wednesday next.
To rny surprise, last Friday, the newspapers brought me -the information that a
caucus had been held and a decision arrîved
at by'a large group of members, haîf of the
Senate, surrounding my honouraible friend
the leader of the Government. It struck me
that it wouhd have heen more naturel and

310

SENATE

.advisable to have a question affecting the
honour and dignity of the Senate discussed in
the Senate itself, behind closed doors, rather
than behind closed doors at a party caucus.
I believe that that meeting of a large number
of senators did not have before it all the
information to which the members were entitled; I mean, entitled to receive through a
discussion in this Chamber. I feel the
necessity of making a statement now, so that
members on both sides of the House may
have time to weigh the various aspects of this
question by Wednesday next. If I delayed
until Wednesday to make this statement, I
should run the risk of speaking then to
members of this Chamber who had already
been pledged to joint action. This is an
important matter affecting the honour and
dignity of the Senate, and it is still more
important to a colleague whose high standing in the community and unblemished reputation may be affected thereby. The statement I make to-day will appear in Hansard
.and members of the Senate will thus have
forty-eight hours in which to weigh it and
pass judgment upon it, and will have before
them more facts and aspects of the matter
than they have had hitherto.
This matter, honourable members, can be
.approached from two angles: first, in regard
to the interpretation and application of the
Independence of Parliament Act, and secondly,
in regard to the relations of members of Parliament with the Government and the departments.
. As to the interpretation of the Act, I need
not state, what is a truism, that Parliament
makes laws, but judicial tribunals interpret
them. The courts being seized of the facts
of the case, that is another most important
and essential reason why Parliament should
not intervene. As I said a few moments ago,
when this question was first raised the leaders
in the Senate seemed to agree wifth the
suggestion of the honourable senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), a
gentleman who was for a number of years
Minister of Justice and was in his day one
of the leading lights of Ontario.
Moreover, the good faith and sincerity of
-our colleague (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) cannot be
impugned. The Act reads:
No person, who is a member of the Senate,
shall directly or indirectly, knowingly and
wilfully be a party to or be concerned in any
contract under which the publie money of
Canada is to be paid.
The statement of the honourable the senior
member for Ottawa and his action in this
matter established his perfect good faith. He
gave us the opinion of Mr. Laurendeau, an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

ex-judge of the Superior Court of Montreal.
He has sent me an opinion that he received
later from Mr. Aimé Geoffrion, one of the
shining lights at the Bar of the Province of
Quebec-perhaps I might say of Canada. I
will place it on Hansard. It is dated June
16, 1931, and was written before Mr. Geoffrion
left for Europe:
MIy dear Senator,
It appears froin a judgment rendered by Mr.
Justice McEvoy that in 1927 you entered into
an agreement with a certain Newspaper Company,

under the teris of

which you or your

firms were to receive $5,000 for your services
if you were successful in obtaining from the
Government of Canada a certain contract for
the Company.
You did not obtain the contemplated contract, which was for 3,000 subscriptions during
three years, but 2,200 subscriptions were
obtained for a year. The judgment holds that
this was under a subsequent understanding
accepted as sufficient performance to entitle
you to the full $5,000.
Apart from the issue of fact which wNas
directly raised by the defendant, the question
of the possible nullity of that contract as
being against public policy was suggested to
the Court by the attorney for the defence,
although the point was not directly raised by
the defendant himself. The Judge therefore
considered it, and, of necessity, decided in
favour of the validity of the contract, since
the action was maintained, and, under a weil
settled rule of the law, if the fact of the contract being against public policy had been
apparent on the record, the action should have
been dismissed whether the point was raised or
not.
The statute relied on in support of the view
that this contract is illegal is section 21,
clauses 1 and 2, of the Independence of Parliament Act:
Section 21, Clause 1.-"No person, who is a
member of the Senate, shall directly or indirectly, knowingly and wilfully be a party to
or be concerned in any contract under which
the public money of Canada is to be paid."
Section 21, Clause 2.-"If any person, who is
a member of the Senate, knowingly and wilfully
becomes a party to or concerned in any such
contract, he shall forfeit the sum of $200 for
each and every day during which he continues
to be such party or so concerned."
There is no doubt that you were not a party
to the eontract in question. The whole question therefore is, Were you concerned in it?
To define your position accurately, it may be
said that you were concerned in obtaining the
contract for your client inasmuch as you were
to be paid if you obtained it, but being concerned in obtaining a contract for somebody
else is not, in my opinion, being concerned in
the contract within the sense of the Statute.
Otherwise. the proviso that the person shall
forfeit $200 per day during the period that ho
is so concerned in the contract would be meaningless. The instant the contract came into
force you ceased to have any interest in anything connected with it. Your work was donc
and you were an ordinary creditor of the contracting party for your fee.
It cannot be said, therefore, that you were
concerned in the contract for a single day.
Yours very truly,
A. Geoffrion.

JULY 6, 1931
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Honourable membere,
this, ta my mind, is straining a matter of
privilege ta the very extreme. Here we have
a case that ie ta be discuseed in a day or
two, and the *honourable gentleman deals
with it in a long speech in which there is
nothing particularly new. I thinik thie is
stretching the rule ta the very limit.
Hon. Mr. DAN.DURAND: My h-onourable friend will remember that on the question of privilege the honourable senator from
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) made a statement
and then gave a notice of motion. I arn
doing likewise, and for this reason: thie question bas a legal aspect, and instead of waiting until Wednesday next to make a statement whieh ta honourable senators who are
flot members of the Bar may seem somewhat
involved, I desire to give thera time ta
examine the argument. What I mîght say
on Wednesday next I say now in arder that
honourable senators may be f ully informed.
I do nat call a caucue of my friends who sit
around me; I addrese them now, as I addrcess
my hanourable friende opposite. If honourable members were ta take joint action on
Wedncsday, I shauld feel that they might
flot have had an open mind and that even
if they considered there were strang arguments against the decision reached at the
oaucus it might have been somcwhat difficuit.
for themn ta go back on that decision. With
thie in mind I wouid point out that the question invaolves the honour and dignity of the
Senate, and aiea the honour and dignity of
a member of this Chamber. Everybody will

preciaus possessions in life.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If I may interrupt
the honourable gentleman, I would say that
I cannot understand the basis of hie argument. If the motion of the honourable member for Bedford (Hom. Mr. Pope) carrnes, the
honourable the senior meiiber from Otta.wa

comxnittee as in the hands of thie House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, I desire
i thie statement ta lay the facts before the
Senate. Same information has been aeked for
by the bonourable gentleman from Nipieeing:
(Hon. Mr. Gardon) and I intend ta give it
ta him. It seeme to me advantageous ta
the Senate that this state ment should go on
'Hansard ta-day, s0 that it may be examined at
leisure between now and Wedneeday.
The judgment that wee rendered fully
supporte the view of Mr. Laurendeau, who je
a retired judge, and of Mr. Geoffrion. Some
bonourable members of this House doubted
that 'the Independence of Parliament Act

âii

had been pleaded. The point was raised by
Mr. Biggar, who sougbt ta perforin what hie
believed ta be a duty ta His Lardship. Mr.
Biggar argued on behaif of the London Company, the defendant in the case, that the
plaintiffs were nat entitled ta judgment for
the amount oifered by the company,.because
the plaintiffs had failed ta obtain the particular agreement wbich the company had
applied for; that je ta say, because the agreement which the Department was willing ta
make, and w.biich tbe company eventually
accepted, was for 2,200 instead of 3,000 copies
of the magazine Canada, and for one year
instead of three years. Then Mr. Biggar
called the attention af the court ta the
Independence of Parliament Act and cited
section 21, which I have already read. I
cite a portion of the argument:
Hie Lordship: In order, Mr. Biggar, that you
may diseuse the matter as a legal proposition,
I think that what happened was, the gentlemen
in the Old Country, this paper company,
desired ta get a contract from the Government
ta spend in the way of advertising a block of
maoney with the newspaper campany. In keeping with this proposition it must be canceded
that they made the Senator an offer of $5,000
if lie would get them that contract, and that
lie agreed and made a contract with them.
When hie did agree the contract was made
that for $5,000 hie was ta get them 3,000 suliscriptions, and for the moment I think that
was a firm contract, and that was ail tkre
was about it at the time being. Now if ýo.a
have any further authority ta give me that
the Senator's contract with the newspaper
people ta try ta get that contract is an illegal
contract, and one upon which lie cannot
recover, I will hear you.
Mr. Biggar: Your Lordship understands, my
clients in this action take the view that the
contract they made with Senator Belcourt was
not at ail a contract that was in any way
cantrary ta public palicy. They regard their
own motives in making the contract with
Senator Belcourt as of the highest poseible
char-acter, and they have no criticism whatever
of Senator Belcaurt in accepting that contract.
Hie Lordship: That ta me, Mr. Biggar, just
means, "We made a contract with the Senatar.
We say that we do not want ta take advantage
of the fact that that is an illegal contract, but
in the same breath we paint out ta the caurt
that it ie an illegal contract, and the court
cannot enforce it.";
Mr. Biggar: I am sorry if I have nat made
myself clear. I said before I introduced this
subject at ahl that I had made all the euh.
missions I had ta make on behaîf of my client,
but after considering the matter and having
regard to the knowledge I had of the existence
of these cases and this Statute, I thouglit it
would lie a failure on my part ta perform my
duty ta your Lordship if I failed ta, mention
their existence. I did flot argu-I am making
no submission on either thte cases or the
Statute.
Ris Lordshi p That is yeur way of stating
it, and in effect Ido not think it is any
different ta the way I stated it ta yau. Sa
we will leave it there.

Those were letters addressed fromn London
ta Mr. Belcourt, but they were addressed to
him, I suppose, as head of the firm. However, lie sued flot only in the name of the
firnm, but in hie own namne as well.
RIstated the other day that if the judge
had fouud a violation of the Act hie would
have non-suited the plaintiff. This view is
endorsed by Mr. Geoffrion. Five or six years
ago the Supreme Court of Canada took the
saine ground in the case of a member of
Parliament who had sued for fees and for a
commission. He was non-suited before the
courts of his province. He entered an appeal
in that province, and the news came to us by
wire of such an action heing taken. The newspapers were giving us details, and I feit, ns
leader of the Government, that it was my
duty to inquire into the matter. I did so,
and on conferring wîth Sir James Lougheed
over the situation, I concluded that as the
plaintiff, having loat his case, had filed an
appeal, we had better await the outcome.
The trial judge had decided against the
plaintiff on both counts. The court of appeal
allowed that member of Parliament lis fees
as solicitor, but rejected bis dlaim for what
hie had himself called a commission in a certain matter, which I do not exa.ctly recall.
In rejecting lis dlaimi for commission the
court of appeal said that he had acted against
public policy, having infringed the Independence of Parliament Act. Then there was an
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which
confirmed the decision of the court of appeal
in Nova Scotia. 1 mention these facts in
order to explain why I took no action in that
matter. We were waiting until there should
bie a final judgment. I did not believe, for
did Sir James Lougheed, that it was the
proper thing to interfere in.the matter until
the, courts liad, disposed of it. My honourable
friends may think me remiss in my duty, but
when the question was finally settled by the
Supreme Court, as the member of Parliament
had been ailing, and was indeed quite an
invalid, I decided, under the circumstances,
not to raise the point ini the Senate. I
thought that we should flot -interfere pending
the decision of the appeal'beoause I did niot
believe that we should sit in judgment on a
case that was before the courts. I believe that
no reproacli can be levelled at me on that
ground. When it came to the decision by
w hich the plaintiff Iost bis case, I miglit have
raised the point in the Senate, but my hionourable friends, who ail know to whom I
refer, will undexstand why I did not.
I have discussed the question of the interpretation of the Independenice of Parliament Act, and now I oome to the seconid

313

point, as to the ethics gover.ning our relations
with the Governanent and the departments.
I miust say that outside of the Independence
of Parliament Act we have no guiding rule.
We have Rule 53, which coiicerns tlie action
of a senator in the Senate or ini comrnittee,
as follows:
No senator is entitled to vote upon any
question in which lie lias any pecuniary interest
whatsoever, flot held in common wîth the rest
of the Canadian subjeets of the Crown; and
the vote of any senator se interested will be
disallowed.
Outside of the Independenoe of Parliamen-t
Act and of this mile, which applies wlicn we
are acting as meinhers of the Senate, there
is no guiding mule as to our action. Then,
if there is no guiding rule, hy what principle
shall we, as members of Parliament, be guided
in our dealing with the Govemaîment and the
depamtments as barristers, solicitors or engineers?
I would point out to my honourable friends
that this question is not a simple one. At
present tliere are 80 or 90 menibers of Parliament wlio are amembers o.f the Bar. Quite
a num.ber of thena had a large legal practice
befome their election as members of Parliament or tlieir ap'pointanent to this Chamber.
They had a large nuasbem of clients, many of
whom. had deailings with the Govermaent and
the departmnents. In the general administration of the affaira df the country thc various
departmnents have important questions of law
and of fact to disouss with v-arious persons,
and these questions caîl for expert advice.
There are applications for grants of land, or
for mining and other leases; petitions for
patents of invention, tmademarks or copyright;
contracts with different departmnents, and dufferences over their interpretation; dlaims
against departmnents such as thnt of Public
Works; references by most departments ta
the Department of Justice for adIvice, where
couni'sel for both sides appear. Now, must
those mnembers of Parliament, fmom aIl over
Canada, froni the Atlantic to the Pacific,
acting at the head of large legal fimms, discontinue serving their clients who have h-ad
'or -may have relations with the various departanents of the Goveiment? Must their
pamtners also discontinue that practice?
I would caIl the attention of the Senate to
the fact that barristers in Ottawa are in a
clag by themselves. Not only do tliey appear
before the courts of Ontario, and the Excliequer Court and the Suprenie Court, but
they style themseives, and are, departimental
agents. The whole Bar of Canada is their
client, because barristers fmom f ar and near
appoint barriàters in Ottawa to attend ta
matters that call for direct contact with the

314

SENATE

departments; and I may say that these contacts with the departments in Ottawa constitute their regular vocation. Matters come
to them from afar. The present case came
from London. It was an important matter
for the Canada newspaper (which I have read
for the last twenty-five years). Not only was
there involved the amount of money to be
received from the Government, but the publicity was valuable to that newspaper, which
was to be distributed among all the public
offices, hotels and libraries. I presume that
such a contract would certainly represent to

that paper a value of $100,000.

The amount

they offered was such as would be considered
in London an ordinary fee; and it was not
a commission, as is shown by the extracts
which I have read from the letters.
The matters which the public, through their
attorneys, take up with the several departments of the Government are of the most
varied character. Now, since we have no rule,
is it advisable that we should try to devise
one? If so, where shall the line be drawn in
relation to the various activities of those barristers who are members of Parliament and
whose firms have had and continue to have
dealings in a number of cases with the departments?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Is there a single
case where money was paid directly by any department of the Government to any of those
solicitors who acted for their clients?
Well, I know
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that members of Parliament are precluded
from acting for the Government in the various
activities of the departments. Now, if we
lay down a rule, shall we declare that they
shall likewise be precluded from giving advice or rendering service to clients who have
business with those departments, and therefore precluded from receiving fees from their
clients? If a principle is laid down by us,
of course it must affect all barristers equally.
I am agreeable to a committee being formed
for the purpose of exploring the whole field,
and I give notice of the following resolution,
which will be perhaps an amendment to the
motion of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Pope), and which will explain itself:
That a special committee of
members
of the Senate be appointed to enquire into and
report upon the advisability of a rule being
adopted by the Senate defining the nature and
extent of the relations which a member of this
House, whether a member of the Bar or not,
may have with the Dominion Government or
any of its departments, and if deemed advisable to prepare such a rie.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I must thank my honourable friends the
members of this Chamber for allowing me to
place on Hansard what I believe to be a
staitement that will be somewhat enlightening
to some of the members -of this Chamber, so
that on Wednesday we may be in a better
position to grapple with this question.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I may be allowed to say
this, that in moving for a committee I had the
idea that the inquiry or investigation-whatever you may call it-would be behind closed
doors, rather than that it should publicly reflect on the honourable gentleman who is concerned in this matter. Now you have advertised the whole thing, the show is wide
open, and everybody in Ottawa and throughout the length and breadth of Canada will
know what you have said, and why you have
said it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

But-

Hon. Mr. POPE: Now, excuse me a minute.
I kept perfectly still while you were talking.
When the judges are ready to render their
verdict, let then render it; but they are not
the only judges of the virtue and honour of
the Senate of Canada. There is also the
Senate itself. We do not care whether a
judgment comes from the court of appeal, or
from the superior court, or where it comes
from. The question is one for us to decide
here. It can be decided privately if you will,
and it must be decided for the future, as we
cannot influence the past. The proceedings
would be taken in respect te the honour of
this House. That is the reason I moved my
motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will answer my
honourable friend's remark. He bas moved
for a committee to which shall be referred
the statement of the honourable the senior
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt).
Hon. Mr. POPE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My objection to
that form of inquiry is that we should
thereby sit in appeal on a judgment which
was rendered by a Supreme Court judge, and
which is in appeal before the Supreme Court
of Ontario. That is the reason why I say, as
to the interpretation of the present Act of
Parliament, that it is the duty of the judicial
authorities to give that interpretation. The
purpose of my motion is to have an investigation of the whole situation respecting members of Parliament who at the same time are
barristers, or engineers, or have some other
vocation in which they have relations with
the Government and the departments. Such

JULY 6, 1931
an investigation would flot preclude aur having the opinion of senators who are members
of the Bar, as to their activities in thase
matters. I may say, on behaif of the senior
member for Ottawa (Hon. M*r. Belcourt),
that hie has laid before the courts ail the
facts of the case in perfect gaod faith, and
whenever his advice is asked as ta the advisability of such a rule as I have proposed,
lie wvil1 lie, like any one of us, at, the disposai
of the Senate. But by the motion of xny
honourable friend-and of course lie and I
may flot agree on this pointHon. Mr. POPE: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it is flot the
first time that we have not agreed.
Hon. Mr. POPE: No; you may bat your
if e.
Hon. Mr. DANJJURAND: I remember
that once I defended his leaders on the floor
of the House, hand in hand with Sir Jemes
Lougheed, and my honourabhle friend had flot
the success he expected. Sa I have met him
bef ara. However, on the present occasion, I
beliave the majority in the Senate will flot say
that when there is bef are the courts of Canada
a questian involving the interpretatian of an
Act of Parliament, this Chamber shauld intervene and sit in appeal fram that judgmant.
Hon. Mr. POPE: That is exactly where
we disagree. I say there is na court in
Canada that can tell us what we shahl deal
with, and what shahl be the limit af aur power.
I do not care what the court of ap.peal is.
The present case involves a matter af business--a common lawsuit in which one man is
suing another ta get money. That is one
question; but that is not the question af the
honour af the Senata af Canada, and there
is no court in Canada that cen decree what
the code af honour af the Sanata shahl be.
Wliether my honourabla friend agreas with
me, wliether this honourahle Hause agrees
with me, or whether in the past-ta which my
honourable friend refers-it lias agreed witb
me, has nothing ta do with my viewpoint as
ta the honour af this honourable body.
Hon. PASCAL POIRIER:

House having heard the statement of the

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I should lika ta ask

As I understand, the case is under appeal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Bef are what appeal
zaurt?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, I cannot
state exactly what court of appeal it is. I
could readily answer the question if the case
were in Quebec. There are two divisions af
the Appellate Court in Ontario, and the case
is in anc af the divisions.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Has my honourable
friand any idea how long the case is likely ta

Hon. Mr. HARDY: Six or eight months
anyway.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Pardon?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Until the autumn, at
any rate.
Han. Mr. TANNER: Then I would point
out ta my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that it will be a great injustice ta
the honourable the senior senator fromn Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Behcourt) ta delay this matter.

to give a copy, they concluded that they had

PRIVATE BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READINGBILL REJECTED

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH moved the
second reading of Bill El, an Act to amend
an Act to incorporate the Army and Navy
Veterans in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, on a
previous occasion I asked honourable members to permit this Bill te be sent to the
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills,
before whom various parties could appear and
give evidence. The stand was taken, however, that in accordance with the rules, the
principle of the Bill should be discussed. I
find it somewhat difficult to diceuss the principle of this Bill. I am confronted with a
situation not entirely unknown in countries
governed by parliaments. Acts of Parliament
wear out, so to speak; cease to be applicable
to existing conditions. One hundred and
fifty years ago the laws against witchcraft
were vigorously enforced in the New England States. A few days ago the police of
Lachine, which is net very far from Ottawa,
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

undertook to enforce a by-law with respect to
the wearing of bathing suits, and as many
bathers as could be rounded up were taken
to the local police court. The by-law provided that bathing suifs should reach four
inches below the knee, should cover the arm
below the elbow and should be modestly cut
about the neck. There was some difficulty
in connection with the prosecution and as a
result the Mayor visited the local establishments where bathing suits were sold. He
found that none of the suits on sale complied
with the by-law. In other words, the law
was made for a different day and generation.
The law of thirty years ago with respect to
bathing suits is not suitable to-day.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
the same now.

They are not made

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

The laws or the

The bathing suits.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Whether the
bathing suits do not fit the law or the law
does not fit the bathing suits, I am not prepared to argue. The point is that the law is
no longer suitable.
History shows that legislation must be
changed to keep pace with changing conditions. This point is important, because one
of the objections that have been urged against
this Bill here is that the Army and Navy
Veterans have been conducting sweeps since
1923. It is said that the organization has been
operating illegally in this respect. Technically
that is so, but the fact that it has been permitted to operate since 1923 without any
interference indicates that the public opinion
of ·this country is net particularly hostile to
sweeps wben properly conducted. It would
appear that the Army and Navy Veterans
would have had no difficulty at all in continuing their operations but for the fact that
other organizations undertook to run similar
sweeps dishonestly and irregularly, and thus
incurred the ire of the authorities. But, as
I say, it would appear that the public opinion
of Canada is not opposed te transactions of
the kind referred to in this Bill, so long as
they are carried on honestly by reliable men.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I ask the honourable senator a question?
Who are the
men who have been managing these sweepstakes; aside from their positions as officers of
the Army and Navy Veterans?
Are anv
salaries, profits or management expenses paid,
and if so what do they amont to?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The management
comprises a certain number of honorary
officers.

SENATE
I shall giýve a brief review of the history
of the Army and Navy Veterans in Canada.
The organization has existed since about
1860, having 'been founded at Halifax by a
body of veterans of the Crimean War. It has
branches ail over the country, and its membership, which is noted for its high calibre,
is made up of ex-soldiers and sailors who
have served in the Canadian and Imperial

through ail the years without outside assistance. One of its policies is to, ask for nothing; so it pays its own way and holds up its
head. Each branch is engaged in charity,
and assists ex-service men out of its resources
and without outside help except free-will contributions that are made by its own people.
The unit at Quebec some years ago, finding
jtself confronte-d with a charitable need with
which it was unable to cope, undertook to
raise money by a system of sweepstakes. The
first sweep was in 1923 and involved $80.
The grants to charity have increased from
year to year, and I shalh read some of the
amounts so as to give honourable members
an idea of the donations that have been made
as a resuit. of these operations. The items
iînmediately under review, which are, I think,
up to the 16th of June, are as follows:

The honourabýle gentleman m.entioned tÀhe Disabled Veterans of America.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOR'KE: Apparently funds are
distribýuted ail over the continent.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That h-appens to
be one item. Certain representations were
made to the management committee that the
Disabled Veterans of America were in urgent
need, and a grant was made to them.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Tickets are sold only
in Canada?
,Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Oh, the tickets
may be sold anywhere. To date o>ver $1,000,000 has gone ont for charitable pur-poses,
including the sums I have mentioned, totalling
$278,000, and the amounts raised by way of
commissions on the sale of tickets by the
local organizations.
I could read to the buse a sheaf of testimonials and telegrams from. ail over Canada
stating the benefits that various organizations
have received and expressing gratitude for
what is being donc for them. Here is a telegram from an organization of f orty branches
of the Canadian Legion in Toronto:
Officers of Toronto and District Command of
the Canadian Legion on hehalf of its forty
component branches ail situate in Toronto and
vicinity request your sympathetic consideration
and assistance in reporting favourably Bill to

From ail over Canada come communications expressing the hope that this Bill
wvilh receive support, and that this metbod of
finding money for charitable distribution
will be continued.
I do not know that I can add anything
further. The point that I desire to make is
that it is quite possible that the tîme has
arrived for a reconsideration of the law that
affects this particular transaction. I suggest
to honourable members that conditions have
changed since the law was originally passed.
Lt is no longer strictly applicable; it bas

JTJLY 6, 1931
and that fact alone, I believe, is sufficient
to justify this House in accepting a motion
to send this Bill to the Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills, where it may receive
more carefu1 consideration; and where the
many persons who desire to give evidence
and offer arguments in support of it can be
heard as they cannot be heard hefore this
House.
Hon. Mr. WILLOTJGHBY: That is not

Hon. Mr. GRIFEMACH:

No.

Hon. A. B. GRILLTS: Honourable members,
in bis opening remarks the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbacli)
made the statement that this organization had
been carrying on sweepstakes for a great many
years, that it was neyer disturbed, and that it
was accumulating money. If it was carrying
on so successfully and was not disturbed, why
should the Parliament of Canada 'be asked for
this legisiation? Why is it necessary to place
on the Statute Book an Act that is nothing
more nor less than one to legalize an open
system of gamhling?
Hon. Mr. GRIESB.ACH: 1[ stated that the
Army and Navy Veterans had been carrying
on sweepstakes sînce 1923; 1 described the
growth of the business; I drew attention to
the fact that so long as this organization was
in the field by itself, having established a
reputation for honesty and efficiency, it enj oyed the confidence of the public and was
not disturbed. I went on to say that certain
other organizations and individuals, envying
the suocess of this organization and hoping
to reap some of the returns that the Army
and Navy Veterans were gettîng, opened up
various kinds of sweepstakes and gambling
proposais, and that then the Attorney General
of the Province of Quebec, in taking legal
action against ail these mushroom. organizations, had been obliged to say to the ArmY
and Navy Veterans: "We have to close you
up as well as the others." In that way the
Army and Navy Veterans had for the first
time corne into contact with the law.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: If this Bill were passed,
would it stop the activities of those mushroosa organizations?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It woul bave
precisely that effect. That is the purpose of
the Bihl-to confer on this organization the
right, and Vo deny iV to ahl those other
organizations.

319

Hon. ROBERT FORKE: In bis last remark the honourable gentleman has, to my
mind, furnished the best argument imaginable
against the Bill. .Apparently a great many
other organizations are eager to geV into
this game to make money, and we are asked
to create a special privilege for one particular
body of people in the Province of Quebec and
to debar ahl others from it, even though they
can prove their bona fides.
Hon. Mr. GRIFSBAOH: My honourable
friend now offers the best possible reason f or
sending this Bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: That is ahl right. But
I would point out that a great many other
organisations are eager to get into this business of conducting lotteries, or gambling. I
do noV give rnuch weight to the argument
that we have gambling in stocks and gamhling
on horse-races. Two wrongs do not make a
right. If it is wrong to gamble on horseracing and on stocks, you will make conditions
worse hy permitting gambling on sweepstakes.
I have on my desk a elegram-I have no
doubt the honourable gentleman has received
a similar one--in which it is stated that the
passage of this Bill would enable the authorities to handie the unemployment situation
through a lottery. Well, why should not we
meet the unemployment situation through a
lottery?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Wou&ld tihe honourable gentleman read the telegram? I should
like to know precisely what it says.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I presume it is public
property, or I would not read it. IV says:

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is noV quite
fair Vo say that it is going Vo, seve unemployment.
Hon. Mr. FGRKE: The Government is
confronted with a big problem in raising
money for unemiployment and other purposes.
Tif this is such a splendid method of raising
money, why shouid the Government not go
into the business?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAîCH: The committee
might considet, that.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Why not? But I would
point out that in all the good work done by
this aasociation-.and I am n ot finding fault
with it-it has createti no wealth of any kind.
As a result of sweepstakes not. one dollar's

SENATE
.worth has been produced. All the money
that has been accumulated and distributed
was already in existence.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I put my
honourable friend right there?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not need to bc
put right. I shall manage. very wel'1.
Hon. ,Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentileman does not want to be put right?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I am going to make
only a few remarks. I do not intend to make
a speech, because I think this subject was
pretty well discussed in this flouse on a
previous occasion. I do want to point out,
however, that the gathering or distribution of
this money has not in any way equalized
wealth. It is not the people with money who
are buying lottery tickets as a rule, but the
poorer classes. I do not say that some people
who are well off, or in comfortable circumstances, do not buy them; but I think I am
right in saying that the great majority of the
tickets are bought by people in poor circumstances who hope that they may draw one of
the lucky tickets and thereby become wealthy.
In the gathering of a dollar a head from the
poorer people nothing has been accomplished
towards meeting any of the problems that
need consideration. I do not deny that for a
time money will be gathered and that the
lottery will be successful; but the day will
come when it will go the way of all things
that are not right in principle.
The honourable gentleman says that times
have changed. I am afraid that they have
not changed for the better and that at the
present time we are travelling in the wrong
direction. The honourable gentleman referred
humorously to the situation in regard to
bathing suits at Lachine. It seems to me
that the way to remedy that matter would
be to change the law.
This association has been carrying on an
illegal business, and has been gathering a large
amount of money and distributing it-in a
proper manner, perhaps; but does my honourable friend or any other honourable member
honestly think that that kind of thing will
continue, or that it wili bring prosperity to
this great Dominion? I for one do not believe
it. I am quite willing to admit the sincerity
of those who say that they see in this Bill a
way out of some of our present difficulties,
but I believe that its ultimate effect would
be to weaken the morale of the people of the
Dominion. Surely we are not bankrupt. If
this organization were creating wealth it could
claim some credit. Through a method that
to me does not on the face of it seem fairHon. Mr. FORKE.

through a lottery-money is simply to be
gathered together and distributed for charitable purposes. I believe the whole influence
of such a measure would be bad and that
many institutions of various kinds would want
to raise money in the same way. If this
privilege were granted in one case, how could
it be refused in another? If I could see any
end to it I should not be so afraid of it; but
I cannot; and before long the Government
might be going in for lotteries, and the whole
country would be travelling in the wrong
direction. In my opinion the passage of this
Bill would be a retrograde step.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have a suggestion to make. The honourable gentleman
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) has
moved that the Bill be sent to the Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM: It bas not
yet received the second reading.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am not going
to discuss the question. I am perfectly willing that the Bill should be allowed to go to
the committee, with the clear understanding
that in so referring it we are not committing
ourselves to its principle.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I am agreeable to
that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot accede
to the suggestion that we should give the
Bill the second reading and send it to committee. Last week or the week before we
voted on what is virtually the principle of
this Bill. Those who voted against the
Hospital Sweepstakes Bill did so with a certain pang of regret because of the great need
of hospitals for money; nevertheless, they
felt that it was their duty to vote against
that Bill. Now we are asked to help the
Army and Navy Veterans to gather money
to be distributed, not only among their own
people, but also to other institutions that
seem to be deserving. Listening to the list
of gifts that have been made by this association, it seemed to me as though a Province
or a Government were voting the money for
the various institutions.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Imperiurn in
:mperio.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am wondering whether we should not be belittling our
various Governments -if we were to approve
of such a systern for the collection of money
by a private organization for distribution to
various institutions that are deserving. Either
those institutions are in need of money or

JULY 6,1931
they are flot. If they are in need of money
it is for -the public, for Parliament or the
legisiatures, to meet the need. If we agree
that it is riglit in principle to levy money in
this way, if we are dccided to turn our backs
on the judgment of the world in regard to
such operations, let us organize to raise
money by such a systemn for the federal exchequer, as suggested by my honourable friend
fromn Manitoba (Hon. Mr. Forke), and let us
recommend to the provinces that they do likewise in order to raise money for their needs.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable
gentleman support it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, because I
have not yet been reconciled to the principle;
and as I arn of the ame opinion as I was
two weeks ago, I shall vote ngainst the second
reading.
The motion for the second reading was
negatived on the following division:

STATUTE 0F WESTMINSTER
JOINT ADDRESS

The Senate proceeded to consider a message
from the House of Commons for an Address
to His Most Excellent Majesty the King
praying that lie may graciously be pleased to
cause a measure to be laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom, pursuant to
certain declarations and resolutions made by
the delegates of His Majesty's Governments
in the United Kingdom, the Dominion of
Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the
Dominion of New Zealand, the Union of
South Africa, the Irish Free State and New-

foundland, at Imperial. Conferences held at
Westminster in the years of Our Lord 1926
and 1930, and pursuant to certain other resolotions made by the delegates of His
Ma.iesty's Government in Canada and of the
Covernments of ail the provinces of Catnada
at a Dominion-Provincial Conference held at
Ottawa on the seventh and eighth days of
April in the year of Our Lord 1931.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, this Statute is a very important
one in relation to the constitution and
development of Canada. Doubtless many of
the members of -this Chamber have watched
oui, powers constantly evolving and enlarging
until now we stand absolutely on an equality
with the Mother Country, as announced by
the conference declaration of 1926, which. I
tbînk was framed by Mr. Balfour. The
declaration was that Great Britadn and the
,Dominions are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, and in
no way subordinate to one another in -any
aspect of their external affairs, although
united to the Crown and freely associated as
members of the British Commonwealth of
Nations. That was the great fundamental
declaration. It stated what in practice was
then an existîng fact. I think it indicated
not only a real feet, but also a hope. StilI,
for the purposes of legislation in this and the
other Dominions of the British Empire, something more than a declaration of historical
fact was neeessary in order to crystallize in
a Statute that status which was acclaimed
and accorded to us in 1926. Therefore a resolotion for an Address to His Majesty requesting the enactmnent of the Statute of Westminster is submitted to this House to-niglit
for approval.
As honourable gentlemen aIl remember, the
confernee of 1926 was followed by a conference in 1929. Then there was held the
conference of last year, 1930, to which we al]
helped to send the distinguished Premier of
this country, and at which. the final touch
ivas put on the suggestions of 1929.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Which were the
v4ork of a commi*ttee of experts.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: A committea
of experts; and they required to be experts
nîso in showing to what extent some of the
laws in force in Great Britain wcre inherently
applicable not only to this Dominion, but ta
the -other Dominions, notwithstanding the
declaration made on status in the conference
of 1926.
Among other laws that clearly over-rode
our own was the Merchant Shipping Aot.

Then there was the Colonial Laws Validity
Act, a comparatively recent enactment of
Great Britain, whereby any law of any
Dominion, whether self-governing or not, that
was not in harmony with British laws, was
,invalid. It became necessary to dispose of
that Act, as well as the Merchant Shipping Act.
Then there was a great problem of draftsmanship, as to how the Statute of Westminster should be framed. Suppose it was
not agreeable to repeal by a general clause all
Acts of Great Britain which were not in
harmony with ours, or all of ours which were
not in harnony with Great Britain's laws.
Perhaps I am not putting this as clearly as
I should. Certain Acts of the Old Country
-I have alluded to two of them-over-rode
Dominion legislation in msatters pari passu, but
our experts, doubtless with the concurrence of
those of all the other Dominions, did not wish
-to make the general declaration that all Acts
out of harmony with the Statute of Westminster should be invalid. They preferred to
adopt another system of drafting which
should attain the same result by another
form.
There are one or two other Acts in which

the question of extra-territoriality, which of
course had to be dealt with. I know that
different views have arisen in this Parliament
since I have been a member of it. as to what
our extra-territorial rights are. It comes to
my mind that at one tirne Lord Durham
caused some people to be expelled from
Quebec to Bermuda for participating in the
rebellion, and this action was disallowed as
being beyond our jurisdiction. It would have
been beyond our jurisdiction to deal with our
own merchant marine outside of our territorial waters.

Britain with the most generous terms since
the conference of 1926. Consequently there
has been a battle; net a conflict, but a battle
of wits engaged in the task of determining
how this Statute should be framed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There was another Act that did affect us a little, I believe,
and I think nothing bas been done with it.

we enjoy this all over the world. We and the
other self-governing Dominions now have even
the right to be consulted in the devolution
ef the Crown of Great Britain. If any change
should be made hereafter in the mode of
descent of that Crown, the self-governing
Dominions have the right to be accorded a
hearing and participate in the decision.
I have not given this matter the detailed
attention i intended te give te it, and I would
have spoken te it earlier and at greater length
if the weather had net been so oppressive.
However, I think I have touched on the important phases of the proposed Statute.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Ours is a resolution.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is a resolution as follows:
That the Senate do unite with the House of
Conunons in the said Address, and tiat tIe
words "Senate and" he inserted in the blank
space therein, and that the Honourable the
Speaker do sign the said Joint Address on
belalf of the Senate.
Honourable
R. DANDURAND:
Hon.
senators, it is unnecessary for me te saiy that
I conmend the aiction of the Government in
bringing this resolution before Parliament.
l represents a long step towards the equality
of the status of Canada and the other Dominions with that of Great Britain. I remember
a dinner which the Government gave to Sir
Austen Chamîberlain at Ottawa, when all the
Privy Councillors were present. Sir Austen
affirmned at that time that the true basis of
union of the British Commonwealth was
freedom, and that the greater the freedom of
action by the Dominions the stronger would
be the sentimental tie between them and the
Mother Comntry. I have been watching the
evolution of our status ever since i left col-

lege, fifty years ago, and I can hardly believe

my eyes when I look at this Address and
think of the position in which we stood at
that time. There was then-and I am speaking more particularly of the mixed population
of Montreal, for I was born and raised there
any national sentiment; there was
-scarcely
virtually no pride in being known as a Canadian. I lived in the west end of the city,
among English-speaking friends. Some of us
used to walk up and down a hill to and from

JtILY 6, 1931
our offices, and we discussed public aif airs
hundreds of times. Occasionally, when there
was a difference in the point of view, those
friends, of my own age and older, would say
to me, "Oh, well, you Canadians-"; for to
most of thcm the terrni Canadians meant the
French-speaking Canadians. I do flot know
how rny English-speaking cornpatrio.ts styled
themnselves, but when any of them were about
to leave for a trip f0 Great Britain they
spoke of going home.
That state of mind bas completely disappeared and now we are proud of the word
Canadian. 1 have seen stili lingering on the
w'alls of some schoolhouses old rnaps on
wlîich the naine Canada did flot appear, for
the whole country from the Atlantic westward was descnibed sirnply as "British Possessions." But now Canada plays a part in
world affairs, looking after its interests abroad
as well as at home. I arn always surprised to
find that some of my friends are a littie afraid
of tha;t movement, which they say is towands
urnanýcipation. They fear that the ti.e which
binds us to the Mother Country may be
weakened or broken. But those who travel
to otber parts of the world and represent
their own country abroad corne back happy
and pnoud that they are full-fledged Canadians, and jealou-s of our national prerogatives.
There are probably only two important
questions in regard to our relations with the
Mother Country, with which we shall have to
deal in the future. One bas to do with appeals
to, the Privy Council. In another place there
occurred recently an interesting discussion on
this subjcct. when it was pointed out that
Canada would sooner or later realize that its
tribunals are able to render justice, and that
there is no necessity for Canadians to go across
the Atlantic to a sister nation for a court of
last resort. The other question bears upon
the right of Canada to arncnd its own constitution. Australia bas had the power to do so
ever since if was made a comrnonwealfh, and
it was given thaf power without any hosfility
or cniticisrn on the part of the British authorifies. We could have obtained a sîrnilar power
in 1926 and in 1929, and we could obtain it
to-day. The statesmen of Great Brifain
recognîze the truth of Sir Austen Chamberlain's statement to which 1 have referred. But
the difficulty lies with us. I was inforrned that
at the conferenoe of 1929 some members of the
British Governmenf were surprised that
Canada was not requesting that power f0
arnend ifs own constitution, which other
Dominions have reccived sirnply for the asking.

the Premier of Quebec, -feels that if this power
were transferred ýfrorn the ImpeTial Parliament f0 the Canadian Parliament the provinces would run the ri.sk of losing sorne of
the privileges which fhey have enjoyed by
virtue of clause 92 and othefr clauses of the
British North America Act. Well, 1 have no
sucli fear, because the British North America
Act does not state in blaok and white that
the provinces mnust be eonsulted before any
change is made in the constitution. There
is no declaration fliat the four original provinces, Nova Scofia, New Brunswick, Qucbec
and Ontario, enfcred into a contract. The
Acf was drafted alfter the Charlottetown and
Quehiec Conferences, but was considerably
altered in London. I say that at this session
we could petition the Imperial Panliarnent
to give us the authority f0 amend our own
constitution were it not for the desire of some
of our public men in Parliainent to, respect
the spirit of the original agreement with the
old provinces, and to uphold the righf of
those provinces to be consulfed before any
constitutional ch-ange is made. A fe'w years
ago we passed unanimously in this Chamber,
aften a lengthy dedaate, a resolution moved by
the honourable gentleman from Gloucester
(Hon. Mn. Turgeon), in wbich, we declaned
thaf our constitution should flot be a.mendecl
without the consent of the provinces. But
if we went to the Iinperial Parliamnent andi
asked that the right to amend our constitution should be given to us, on the express
condition that certain clauses in the British
North America Act should not be changed
by the Canadian Parliarnent unt il a resolution fýavouring the change had been passed
by the Provincial Governmenfs, the safegiierds which are negarded as so important
by the provincial authorities would be much

SENATE
stronger than they are now, because they
would then be written into the constitution
instead of being respected simply because of
a desire for good-will and fair play.
Therefore I welcome the conference that
the Right Hon. Mr. Bennett has announced
will take place within a certain time, for the
purpose of ironing out difficulties that appear
to be in the minds of some members of
Provincial Governments, and of finding some
method which will guarantee for ever the
rights of the provinces and at the same time
give us that virile power to amend our
own constitution. That indicates a movement
towards a greater measure of autonomy, and I
shall follow with deep interest the preparations
for the success of the conference.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I understand that this
Statute of Westminster will have no effect
on the British North America Act at all. Is
that so?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That is the fact?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried!
Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, I am strongly in sympathy with
almost everything-I might say everythingthat my honoured leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has said. But we have made very
rapid advancement in the last few years, and
my suggestion would be-whether it is Torylike or not-that we should go steadily and
not too rapidly with this idea of getting the
right to change our constitution.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It will come,
but if we press it on, or attempt to press it
on, to some of the provinces, we shall drive
the realization farther away than ever.
Althougli the provinces may not have the constitutional right to be consulted, it is only by
according them that right, where they are
concerned, that we can be successful in getting
extended powers.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Honourable senators,
I agree with most of what has been said by
the honourable leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) and by my right honourable friend from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham). We must move slowly in matters
of this kind. Facts precede Acts of Parliament, as was stated in another place. There
is no fear of a revolution in connection with
this subject in Canada so long as a resolution
of the kind which was introduced by the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) here to-night is supported,
and indeed promoted, by the present Prime
Minister. We all know that he is a descendant of United Empire Loyalists and has
always been a staunch supporter of British
ideals and traditions. I am rather proud that
in the present instance lie follows in the
path of his great predecessors in office, Sir
John A. Macdonald, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir
Robert Borden, Mr. Meighen and Mr. King.
This resolution is another milestone in the
political history of Canada and of the Empire.
It is the culmination of a series of events,
and illustrates what Lord Tennyson said, that
freedom under the British constitution has
broadened slowly down from precedent to
It is the result of a natural
precedent.
evolution, starting with responsible government. Lord Durhan's report was met with
extremrnely strong opposition in England,
where his friends disowned him and he was
bitterly attacked in both Houses of Parliament. As we all know, at least two different
Governors General of this country did not
act in accordance with the principles laid down
in his report. Finally his son-in-law, Lord
Elgin, who was one of the greatest Governors
General that Canada has ever had, gave effect
to the principles of responsible government,
and they took root here from that time. Lord
Elgin hlad the support of two noble men who
understood him perfectly, Robert Baldwin
and Sir Louis Hippolyte La Fontaine, a
tribute to whom we sec, whcnever we stroll
around these buildings, in the monument by
Allward.
But even when responsible government was
granted we bad no fiscal independence. Our
tariffs were drafted by the Mother Country;
our commercial treaties were discussed and
made through the instrumentality of Imperial
statesmen, and the Colonials, as Canadians
were called, were scarcely consulted. It took
a good Tory like Sir Alexander T. Galt to
put an end to that. He secured our fiscal
independence and the riglit to make our own
tariffs. At that time there were sorne people
who almest rebelled against Galt, and who
thought that the Empire was at an end.
But common sense prevailed, and who today would think of leaving our tariff in the
hands off Ramsay MacDonald and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Snowden? Common sense prevailed, and it has brought all
those reforms into our Canadian system of
government. In 1867, when Sir John A. Macdonald was promoting Confederation, he said
that Canada would become a nation and other
nations would seek alliance with lier. If he

JULY 6, 1931
were living to-day, Sir John A. Macdonald
would approve of the mneasures which from
timne to tiîne have corne to fruition. In 1867,
at the time of the Fisheries Treaty, he found
out for himself, at Washington, that Canada
had no voice whatsoever in matters concerning lier most vital interests; in fact he found
that our interests were being sacrificed, and
so stated in the Bouse of Commons. I forget his exact words, but lie stated that our
riglits were being sacrificed by the commissioners wlio liad been appointed by the
Iniperial Government. Bad it not been for
the virile action of Sir John A. Macdonald,
everything might liave been given to the
LUnited States. He conceived tlie idea, that
Canada should have a liiglier status, and in
later yoars lie gave Sir Charles Tupper direct
instructions to ncgotiate treaties witli France
and with Spain. It is true that the signature
of the British Ambassador in Madrid, or the
Britisli Ambassador in Paris, was affied to
each of those treaties, but tlie riglit, to, conduct
tliose negotiations liad been obtained from the
Imperial Government. So in that sense Sir
Chartes Tupper was also a reformer.
With Sir Wilfrid Laurier the same logical
e,ýolu tion continued. Wlien a new trea'ty
was contemplated witli France, Mr. Fielding
-wlio, I can assure my lionourable friends in
tlie Senate, was a very stout Imperialist-accompanied by Mr. Brodeur, negotiated with
tlie Frenchi Government. The only thing tliat
was not done by tliem was the signing of the
treaty. This was done by the Britishi Ambassador in Paris.
The present Prime Minister may well follow
in the footsteps of lis great predecessors, Sir
John A. Macdonald, Sir Cliarles Tupper, Sir
Alexander T. Galt, and last, but nlot least, Sir
Robert Borden. During the war, Sir Robert
Borden was bold enougli to exact from the
British Government, for Canada, tlie riglit
to be directly represented at the conferentes
which culminated in the Treaty of Versailles.
We liad our own representatives at those conferences-Sir Robert Borden and the Riglit
Hon. Mr. Doherty, Minister of Justice-and
under that treaty we secured separate representation at the League of Nations. I say, al
honour to Sir Robert Borden for what lie did
on tliat -occasion.
Then came Mr. King, under wliom, in accordance witli tlie advice and recommendation
of Sir Robert Borden, our Minister to
Washington was appoînted. At the time some
people objected. Tlie present Prime Minister
of' Canada was one of them. I remember
the speech lie delivered in the Bouse of
Cominons. Considering our relations with

325

the United States and the business that is
carried on'bctween the two countries, one
miglit well be surprised tliat we did not long
ago have a direct representative at Washington. Under Mr. King Mr. Massey was appointed. Recent]y Mr. Herridge lias been appointed. The proper place for our representative to the United States is tlie Canadian
Legation at Washington, where in the name of
Canada lie can deal directly witli tlie American
Government. Tlirough Mr. Ring and my good
friend the leader of tlie lef t in this Bouse
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) a Minister was
appointed to Paris. We also have a Minister
appointed to Tokia.
1 said a moment ago tbat while Sir Charles
Tupper. Mr. Fielding and Mr. Brodeur negotiated treaties affecting- the trade of Canada
witli other nations, they were signed by the
Britishi Ambassadors. A considerable change
bas corne since Mr. Lapointe, the very aible
exMinister of Justice, ivent to Washington
and on bebaîf of Canada, and as the representative of Bis Mai esty the Ring, signed the
Halibut Trcaty and later another treaty concerning a boundary question between the
United States and Canada. We have asserted
our riglits in a virile way, and as a consequonce. we are att the more respected, not only
by the United States, but, I dare say, by the
Mother Country as wett.
The years 1926 and 1929 ma.rked the last
steps in our evolution to date. The de-claratien attributed to Lord Balfour by my lionourable frîend the. leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Willoughýby), and rightly so was
indeed a great charter and will. go down
in history to the eredit not only of the statesmen of Canada, but also of the statesmen of
Britain. There we have a solemn declaration
that Canada, Australia and the other great
Dominions are the allies, the equals, not the
subordinates, of the Mother Country. In
common we support the same principles of
government. We have reached a status of
To-day nobody finds

fault, as some Canadians did in 1840 or in
1849, when Lord Elgin was in Canada. In
view of that declaration an'd the findings of
the last conference as applied to it, we may
well be proud of our present status. We have
become a nation. This was the aim and objnct of Sir John A. Macdonald when lie promoted the cause of Confederation, and we
take pride in the fact that we are a nation
and are respected as suceh.
Let me conclude by stating tbat I shaîl vote
with pleasure for this resolution. It embodies

But we

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I spoke on the
spur of the moment, but I still do oct think
1 overstated the ameunt. I cannot fînd out
now. I have a memorandum shewing that
$250,000 wvas granted tc the Federal District
Commission over a peried cf sixteen years;
$3,000,000 te the Federal District Commission
in fifteen years; 3300,000 was paid eut for
certain properties; $600,000 was paid eut for
another piece of preperty, and $99,440 for the
Birkett prcperty. But that is oniy a drop
in the bucket, and if these expenditures continue 1 du eut kncw where they arc going te
lead us.
I think 1 have said nearly enougb. In my
opinion Ottawa has been extremely well
trcated. 1 know that in cities ]ike Toronto
or Winnipcg the properties cf the Provincial
Goverements, the telephene preperties that
thcy ewn and the railways, are aIl exempt
frein taxation,
In Winnipeg the Provincial
Government takes the amusement tax, the
automob)ile tax, the gasoline tax and the
liquor tax, and imposes ce the City a tax cf
somcthing like $800,000 a ycar fer municipal
purposes.
The Government here does net
take anything from the City cf Ottawa, but
it is spending a tremeedeus amounit of meeey.
This, I think, cught te stop at the present
time. If the trcasury cf the Docminion were
mn a condition te stand these expenditures
there might be some reason for ccetinuing
the bcautiflcation cf Ottawa; but when cenditions arc as bid as they are in this country,
wvhen famine is predicted in part cf the land,
and municýipal schools arc closed and the
childrcn bave net sufficicot food or clothing,
I think it is time te utter a protcst against
any fîîrthcr expeediture alon-g these lics.
I have net received the information that
I asked the leader cf the Goveroment te
procure wlien lie intreduced the Bill; se I do
net suppose there is aoy use in my preceedîng any fîîrtber. I do want te say, however,
that it is well known in this flouse and in
the city of Ottawa that when any member
of this liuse opposes or even criticises expenditures in this city his action will be
followcd ext day by a personal attack in the
Ottawa Journal. That has happened before.
1 should like te say te the Journal that I
amn net geieg te be terrerized, and that if 1
'thinli that in the intereet cf Canada I should
examine into or criticise the details cf an

JULY 6, 193132
expenditure on the part of this country I shahl
avait myseif ai rny privilege and miy right ta
do so. It is disgraceful that a member of this
Hanse should not be able ta oppose any expenditure in the city af Ottawa without being
the subject of a bitter attack by the Journal
next morning. The leader opposite knows that
what I say is true. I can give him. instance
after instance of members af this House who
criticised such expenditures being treated in
the same way. The inaccurate sort of statement that appeared this morning does not
amount to anything; but I think that any
member af this House who critioises a proposai ai this kind should not be subjected ta

An additional expenditure was made in 1930
of $99,440.86 to acquire the property of the

Those are the additional expenditures in

and in connection with the Federal District

that we were unready, unwilling or unable ta

solution of the problem in Western Canada
vill be achieved through these means. The
situation in the West at the present time'
shows how difficult it is to give advice to the
farmers. Perhaps honourable members will
excuse me if I refer to my own experience by
way of illustration. Some years ago I raised
as much as fifteen or sixteen cars of wheat,
amounting to 15,000 or 16,000 bushels, but now
I have considerably reduced my acreage in
grain. I think that at present I have only
200 acres in wheat, about the same in oats and
100 acres in barley. I have 100 head of cattle,
200 sheep and 22 horses. These figures are
fresh in my mind because I used them in
filling up the census papers not long ago.
Now, I should like the honourable leader on
this side of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)

to listen to this. Lately I have not worried
su much about the loss of my crop, for I
have felt certain that it would not bring in
anything, although I have been put to the
expense of raising it. My chief worry today is on account of the live stock. The
man in the West who has no live stock at
present is a great deal better off than the
man who has some, for it will be difficult to
find sufficient feed for next winter. After the
last adjournment of the Senate I was away
from Ottawa, on a trip to the West, one
week, of which two days were spent at home
with a view to seeing what could be done
to get sufficient feed to carry the cattle
through.the winter. I sent down to the hay
lands and bought three stacks of hay, paying
for it out of my pocket. I was desirous of
looking at the pasture grounds because
stories were coming from the West that the
pastures were drying up and animals were
starving. I think my own pasture, which is
a very large area, is one of the best in
Western Canada. It is partly high and partly
low land. Had it all been high land, the stock
would have starved, but the low marshy
places that at this time of the year are often
too wet to be of use happened to be suitable
for grazing, and consequently we shall be able,
I think, to get enough feed for the cattle.
But there are a large number of farmers-I
am speaking only of Manitoba-who are in
dire distress and will not know how to carry
their cattle over the winter. Before I left
Ottawa hay could be bought in the stack,
down in the marshes, for $2 a ton, but before
I came back the price had risen to $10. I
have no doubt that many farmers will ask
themselves this winter whether they should
hold on to their cattle or destroy them. Yet
pebple who profess to be able to advise the
farmer tell him to go in for mixed farming

and not to put all his eggs into one basket.
Well, we have them in two baskets now, but
we are not out of trouble.
But I repeat that it will be necessary for
Western Canada to have smaller farming
units in the future. Of course, there will
continue to be large acreages worked by
tractors and combines. I have a tractor myself. I know of one honourable member who
is a farmer with a very large acreage under
cultivation, and I should like to hear from
him.
I would impress upon honourable members
the fact that the farmers of the three Prairie
Provinces are, generally speaking, men of
intelligence. Most of them are well informed,
for not only do they subscribe to a daily newspaper, but they read extensively on a wide
range of matters, many of them not connected with their own work. They are not
in need of much advice. As soon as money
becomes more plentiful and it is- possible to
improve the situation they will go about
things in the right way. In the early days
wheat was virtually the only crop in the
West, and people raised it because they were
eager to make money, but the time is coming,
and I think it is near, when the Westerner
will not be se desirous of making a great deal
of money out of wheat as of getting a decent
living on the farm. There are too many
people who seem to think that the farmer
should sink to the peasant class. I never
would have been at Ottawa-I say it in all
sincerity-if it had not been one of my
objects to do what I could towards the
development of what might be called a
yeoman class of well conducted, well educated
people carrying on the farming business and
enjoying many of the comforts and conveniences of modern civilization. I am afraid,
honourable senators, that present conditions
are tending towards the establishment on
farms of a more ignorant class of people, who
are content with a bare living, and who will
not insist upon having the conveniences of
modern civilization. I shall do everything I
can to save our farms from falling into the

hands of people of that kind, because if there
is any lowering of the standards of life on the
farm the whole Dominion will suffer.
Perhaps I have referred to my own experiences too largely, but I thought that I
could speak more plainly by telling what I
know. I have high hopes for the future.
If I am permitted to refer to my own experience again, I would say that Western Canada
has been a wonderful country to me. I
landed as a boy at Halifax with no money,

and it would be base ingratitude on my part

SENATE

not to testify to what our great West has
done for me and for many others who have
gone to make homes there.
My honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend has not answered my question,
but perhaps I did not make myself clear.
He cultivates a large area, but I was thinking of the farmers who operate 160 acres.
I am not trying to give advice to farmers. J
was simply asking whether the farmers of the
West, from their own farms, were supplying
themselves with food for their daily use, aside
That is, I was wondering
from groceries.
whether they raised poultry, cows, hogs, sheep
and so forth. When there is a failure in the
crops that are raised for the markets, to what
extent can the farmers of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta supply their ordinary
food requirements from their own farms?
Hon. W. H. SHARPE: In reply to the
honourable leader on the other side (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) I should like to say that
conditions in Manitoba are very largely as
the honourable member from Brandon (Hon.
Mr. Forke) bas described. I cannot speak foi
Alberta and Saskatchewan, because I do net
know of the conditions as existing there, but
I think I am safe in saying that 90 per cent
of the farmers of Manitoba could live off the
produce of their own farms.
With regard to the statement that the
honourable gentleman from Brandon (Hon.
Mr. Forke) is the only dirt farmer in the
House, I should like to point out that my
honourable friend from St. Boniface (Hon.
Mr. Bénard) cultivates 7,000 acres.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I forgot the honourable senator from St. Boniface.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I have myself cultivated a farm of more than 3,000 acres. And
there are other farmers in the House, too.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I should like to ask,
a question of the honourable gentleman from
Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke). Some forty-two
or forty-thrce years ago I was in the Northwest, and there was no worrying then about
being able to carry stock over the winter. I
was surveying in the Red Deer country, and
worked eleven horses all winter. They found
thcir own feed, and I was wondering if there
has been a change in the climate which would
prevent the cattle from doing that now.
Hon. D. E. RILEY: Honourable srnators,
it is with considerable hesitation that I rise
to speak at this time, but as I am in the
category of a dirt farmer, perhaps I may be
excused if I make a few remarks. In reply
to the question asked by the honourable
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) as
lon. Mr. FORKE.

to how many farmers on 160 acres of land
in the West were raising their own food, aside
from groceries, I may say that in the part
of the country that I represent, Western
Alberta, almost every man who operates a
quarter-section of land ;produces his own
vegetables, meat, butter, eggs, and so on.
Many of the men on the larger holdings are
net doing that, because they are concerned
almost entirely with the business of growing
wheat. I think that when the country is
divided into farms of smaller units there will
be more prosperity. We have an example
of what can be donc by small farms in Prince
Edward Island, where I was born and brought
up. In that province there is no unemployment, no poverty and no great wealth. The
people as a whole are very happy and contented. It is strictly a mixed farming country,
and the grain that is grown there is used to
feed the cattle, hogs and poultry.
I have prepared a statement for presentatien to the House on conditions in the West,
because these have been the subject of con-iderable discussion in the press and elsewhere.
The Bill that is now before us has seme
bearing u:pon these conditions. I understand
that the object of the measure is to allew
certain financial companies te in-vest their
money in the Dominion Agricultural Ctredit
Company for the purpose of assisting in the
financing of the live stoek and general farming buines.

As a result of certain reports that have
been made, there has been created an a]tog ether wrong impression, at least in Eastern
Canada, with respect not only to economie
conditions in the West. but also te the spirit
of the people there. It is true that certain
scetions of that country are undergoing serions
hardships, and conditions in some of those
districts are as bad as represented, but those
conditions do not apply to the Western
country as a whole. The calamity that has
overtaken large sections in southern Saskatchewan and parts of eastern Alberta, in the
way of drought, is, after all, only a passing
phase in the evolution of the Canadian West.
In speaking as I do, I want it to be distinctly understood that my purpose is net
.n any way to minimize the terrible conditions
that prevail in the affected areas, but rather
to emuphasize the absolute necessity for immeediate relief, if those people affected are to
remain an asset te the country.
Thte people of the Western Provinces have
passed through conditions just as trying as
those that prevail to-day, thougla possibly
not affecting so many people or extending
over so large an area. They have had to
contend with climatic conditions over which

JULY 7,1931
they have no control--hail, drought, frost-and with low prices. I can point to several
large areas that were once under cultivation,
but, owing to some or all of the causes mentioned, were abandoned years ago. Anyone
who has lived in the West for the last thirty
or forty years has not had to wait until this
late date to know what hard times mean.
The entire history of the Canadian West
has been a "weeding out process," a "survival
of the fittest," and that process still goes on.
But at heart the country is sound. In spite
of all those discouragements and drawbacks,
the country has gradually and steadily developed, until to-day Western Canada, which
fifty years ago was a buffalo pasture, is rightly
called the "Granary of the Empire."
The sturdy pioneer spirit that developed
that country under all the adverse conditions
that had to be contended with is still in evidence, and already the people are adjusting
themselves to the conditions which prevail
to-day. This spring they have put in their
crop at less expense than ever before. They
have planted only ground that was properly
prepared last year. They have been more
oareful of the class of seed sown. By these
means they intend to cut down the costs of
production and to obtain better quality and
increased yield.
The low price of wheat is the cause of the
depression, not only in Western Canada, but
through the entire country.
This carries
within itself its own certain and speedy cure,
namely, largely curtailed world acreage. In
the part of the country I represent, this curtailment amounts to almost 20 per cent. This
reduction has to some extent been replaced
by the planting of oats and barley; this with
the view of keeping more live stock and
selling tihose grains in the form of pork and
beef and mutton. This is only another proof
that the farmer is adjusting himself to
present-day conditions and will carry on until
th-ose conditions improve.
The world famous economist, Sir Josiah
Stamp, during his recent trip through Canada as the head of the Royal Commission
investigating grain futures, said that to him
the most impressive point was "the staunch
confidence of Western Canada in its own
destiny." He said:
I consider most remarkable the tremendous
development which has taken place in the
Prairies in the iast thirty years. The settlements on the vast lands expressed no touch of
temerity in their transition from shack towns
to budding cities.
While admitting that the West is passing
through trying times, it seems to me that
over-publicity has been given to it. We need

331

in the West money to develop the great
natural resources, and the adverse publicity
that we have received of late is unfortunate.
An article appearing in the Literary Digest
a short time ago, regarding conditions in
Arkansas, is applicable to our own situation:
The sorry plight of the Arkansas farmers
last year was the subject of the world-wide
interest. The unprecedented drought, coming
as it did, contemporaneously with the Wall
Street slump, aroused the pity and practical
sympathy of the United States Congress.
Funds were raised. The Red Cross fed 500,000
people in the parched States. Now, after good
rains and the hopeful advent of spring,
Arkansas is belittling the hardships of last
year.
The Digest goe on to say:
Many Arkansans now feel that the State has
been forced to suffer unnecessary hardship
through adverse publicity, much of it overdrawn. As a result, investors shy away from
Arkansas State bonds, and are reluctant to loan
money. We have been hit, but we have howled
a little louder than we have been hurt.
The world grain situation is such that
straight wheat farming will, for some time at
least, be more or less unprofitable, but wheaît,
as well as the coarser grains, can be more
profitably turned into cash by the meat route.
It is estimated that half of the people of
Canada live on the farms, that 80 per cent
are commercially dependent on the farm
directly or indirectly. The controlling factor
in Canadian business welfare has been the
world's price of wheat and the yield of this
grain on the plains of Western Canada.
Wheat growing has been Canada's main business of late years. So much has this been
the case that the most important branch of
agriculture has been almost overlooked. I
refer to the live stock industry. In the country which I represent this was the initial
industry. The cattle men were the pioneers
of Western Canada, and while their operations have been sadly curtailed by the turning
of their old ranges into wheat fields, still
to-day it is a most important branch of agriculture. The keeping of flocks and herds is
as old as the history of the world and it still
occupies an important place in the economic
life of Western Canada. Now that the growing of wheat, at least for the time being, has
ceased to be attractive, more people are turning their attention to live stock.
It is true there are large areas unsuitable
for the production of live stock, but wherever
possible it is economically sound to engage
in mixed farming.
There has been dire howling about an overproduction of live stock, but now that an
outlet has been again found for our surplus

JULY 7, 1931
1 have passed througb several periods of
hard times in the West, but I have neyer
seen a time when live stock was flot a liquid
asset. I mention these thinýgs to show that
the live stock industry still bolds an important
place in the economic life of Alberta, and the
people have not bast faith.
In aur home market, which, as 1 have said,
is our principal market, the spread between
the price paid the producer and the price the
consumer pays is ample proof -that our seiling and distribution system mnust be reorganized. If 50 Per cent olf the people o(
Canada live on the farm; if 80 per cent of the
people are, directly or indirectly, dependent
economically on the product of the farnm; if
live stock is the basis of permanent and s;uccessful agriculture in every farming cauntry
in the world; then surely it is the duty of
Parliament, as 'well as the Government. in
these times of stress ta, evalve a national live
stock policy having for its aian not oniy th-production of more and better live stock,
but aksa a marketing and distribution systeme
that would insure to the producer a fair
return for bis investment and labour, and ta
the consumer a fair price for what hie bas ta
buy. Such a policy would mean more cmployment druring the winter months. It would
provide a profitable market -for the low-grade
wheat and coarser grains. It would provide
increased trafflc for aur radways. It would
bring prosperity ta this country mare quicly
than anything else would,-and tend ta make
Canada anc of the greatest agricultural countries in the world.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable members,
the query propounided by the honourable
leader on the other aide of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) affords a good opportunity
for the discussion of the agricultural situation
in Western Canada. As is known ta ail of
us, no matter from what part of the country
we may came, the unique situation of agriculture in Western Canada ta-day is something upon which we cauld well afford ta
spend some time, in order, if possible, ta
evolve some reasonable solution for the future.
Our honourable friend froma Alberta (Hon.
Mr. Riley), in his address, deait with the
question largely in its relation ta live stock.
From the strategie position that hie knows so
well, he discussed the live, stock question in
a most intelligent and interesting manner. I
think, hawever, we might delve a little deeper,
and instead of confining ourselves ta any
particular phase of the agricultural industry,
we might extend aur inquiry into a general
review of the isituation as it stands ta-day.

333

In addressing myseif to this subjeet, may
I say that 1 speak from a knowledge gained
by an experience extending over some thirty
years of residence in Western Canada, during
which time I have seen il grow from the
acorn of sparsely settled communities and inidifferent agriculture to the gigantic oak of
beautiful towns -and cities, a network of
transportation systemns and a production lfrom
the soul of farm products which feed the
peoples in ail parts of the world. Whiie there
have been sacrifices by reason of living ini
pioneer surroundings, there has been a campensating satisfaction in watching a great
country grow and in being part of it, so that
one's very soul becomnes inseparable fromn its
national life. It is true we have had our
troubles, but they have been iargely due ta
growth. No child grows ta maturity without
cxperiencing the round of childhood diseases,
-and it is even so with ail new countries; and
if you have heard of Western grievances and
complaints, do not take them too literally or
too seriously, for they are really evýidences of
growth and progress and the impatience of a
people whýo, through their very optimism, perhaps desire to travel and arrive too quickly.
In considering the evolution of Western
Canada we might properly start with an ides
of conditions as they were, say, in 1900, when
the country really commenced ta open Up,
and then take a look at the situation as it
is to-day, and see how- the people have adapted
themselves to the changing conditions during
this thirty-year period. In 11900 a single line
of railway traversed the. country from east
to west, with a small population on the land
and in the straggling villages along the line
of steel. Agriculture was confined to a few
well defined areas, and horme and cattle ranching was somnewbat extensively carried an in
the larger areas farther west. Rail rates were
high, prices of farm products low, and the
people had to live within their own resources
and make ends'meet.
Then came the influx. The whole world
suddenly seemed to realize that Western
Canada was the last Great West, and offered
opportunities that no other land could promIn fourteen years enormous districts
ise.
were turned from grazing lands and virgin
soil into successful agricultural areas. Population developed tranoportation systemas and a
network of railways. Agriculture required
millions of dollars' worth of implements to
turn the sod and make production possible.
Towns and cities grew overnight, which required large expenditures for municipal improvements, schools, churches and public in-

334

SENATE

stitutions. Following this influx of people
came the inrush of capital and the employment of thousands of artisans. Capital,labour
and development went hand in hand. There
were four classes of people comprising this
growing population: the first class, original
settlers, largely in the Indian Head district;
the Eastern Canadian farmer who sold out
and took his money and experience west to
start anew; certain classes of American settlers
with ample money and live stock and experienced in western agriculture; and immigrants from all parts of the world, sone of
whom took their grub-stake with them.
Development led to the rise in land values.
The settler paid $10 homestead fee and receired one hundred and sixty acres of land.
The C.P.R. sold the finest land for $480 per
quarter-section. These values rose $20 to
$60 per acre. With construction and development, money flowed freely. Credit was easily
obtainable.
Under these circumstances, a
settler was not ambitious to make a permanent home for himself, but wished rather
to make some easy money and move on. The
result was inevitable. Financial institutions
had been eager to put out money at high rates
of interest, and inexperienced people did not
sec the danger of over-extending thernselves
and borrowing money which later they found
t difficult or impossible to repay. It was a
combination of inexperience and too much
optimisrm in a new country.
Then came the war, with high prices for
farm products, which made farming very
profitable and carried the farmer to further
heights of prosperity and a standard of living
which agriculture under normal conditions
could never be expected to maintain.
The experience of the last two years has
proved a rude awakening for the Western
farmer. Loaded with high-priced land which
is mortgaged at high rates of interest; with a
standard of living which included automobiles,
radios and other expensive trappings, all born
of a prosperity now non-existent, he finds
himself faced with high fixed outlays for
interest and carrying charges; lands reduced
in value by fifty per cent; prices for farm
products which do not nearly pay the cost of
production; and high taxes on a scale hitherto
unheard of.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: To what taxes does
the honourable gentleman refer?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Municipal and provincial
taxes.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

And federal?

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: No; the federal income
tax unfortunately does not bother the Western
farmer very- much.
Then, to add to the discomfiture of the
Western farmer, the land that he has been
continuously cultivating has in many cases
lest its fibre and productive capacity, and the
recent disastrous dust storms have demonstrated that the day of the black summer
fallow is about over. In future he will have
to cease being a soil miner and become a soil
restorer. This will require changed methods
of farming, the adoption of rotation of crops
and the extensive cultivation of grasses and
clovers in order te put back into the soil the
libre of which it has been robbed and thus
prevent the blowing of top soils, which will
prove the ruination of the country if not
curbed in time.
Here let us digress for a moment and consider whether the farmer has been well serviced
by Government and private institutions as
regards facilities for carrying on his business
under favourable conditions. I think I am
safe in saying that in no country in the world
has encouragement been accorded in a more
marked degrece. He has been able to borrow
a reasonable anmount of capital with which to
carry on. Truc, the interest rates have been
higher than in the older and more stabilized
parts of the country, but mortgage and bank
advances have been available, as a rule, at
8 per cent. Efflicent marketing facilities have
been afforded by the grain trade and his
own Co-operative Pools, these assuring him
the last cent his product is worth. Transportatien facilities by the two great national
systens have been efficient and liberal. The
Federal Government has practically completed
the Hudson's Bay Railway at a cost of $30,-

000,000, and a niaterial saving in freight on

export grain and live stock, in years to
come, is confidently expected.
Provincial
Governrments have spent enormous sums to
provide public highways te reduce the primary
marketing costs. The Government Experimental Farms and Research Departments have
shown the way to more advanced and better
methods of farming. A pamphlet issued by
the Canadian Wheat Pools on March 31, 1931,
proves the advantageous position of the Westerri farmer as against his competitors. The
railway freight from a typical Saskatchewan
point to Fort William is 13.50 per bushel,
based on 700 miles haulage. The average
freight rate in Australia is 8 cents for 77 miles,
and in the Argentine 11.74 for 114 miles. The
freight rate paid by the Australian is, therefore, five times as much, and by the
Argentine farmer four times as much, as the
Canadian grower pays-

Hon. Mr. FORKE: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Just a moment, until
I finish the sentence-aithougli it must be
remembered that in Canada the haul Vo the
head of the lakes is mucli longer than the
initial haul Vo tide-water in the other countries
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I was going Vo ask the
honaurable member whetber he tbinks that
is a fair way of putting it-that the Australian
farmer pays a higlier rate Vo ge-t the wheat
to the seaboard than does the Western farmer.
Actually it costs aur farmers twice as mucli
as it does the Australians Vo get the wheat ta
the seaboard.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I have already explained
th-at, and I thouglit my bonourable friend
wauld undcrstand it.
Han. Mr. FORKE: 1 read my honourable
frien-d's article in Saturday Niglit.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: 1 am gaing ta deal
further with the paint, if my banaurable
friendwill have a littie Scotch patience.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I will try ta have
patience.
Han. Mr. LAIRD: The same authority gives
the net return-tbis allaws for the freigltta the wheat grower in Western Canada, an
the basis af prices as af March 31, 1931, as
37.75 per bushel; the net return ta the grawer
in Australia from grain in bags as 38.27, the
cast af the bags being extra; andl the net
return to the Argentine grower as 12.65 per
bushel. These comipilations are based an fair
average prices and allow for differences ini the
quality of the wheat in the cauntries mentianed. They are taken from the officiai
records and documents of the Canadian Wheat
Poals themselves. Sa, as regards this phase af
the question, it can be succeasfully argued that
from the standpoint of transportation charges
ta the seaboard, and the net returns ta growers,
the Canadian farmer is in a fox mare advantageaus position than lis world campetitars.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Heux, heur.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I have endeavoured sa
far Vo give you a picture of the present-day
position of the Western farmer, and the
economic causes which led up ta it. I have
also painted out tîat his present precariaus
financial position cannot be said ta be due
ta the .1ack of enoouragement on the part of
Government, credit and transportation agencies. Now let us go anc step farther and
inquire in what direction lies the wvay out,
and Iaw the Western farmer can retrieve bis
fortune and regain his lost purchasing power.

First, he must live on b-is farm and within
bis incarne.
Second, he muet revert ta conditions tbat
obtain in otîer agricultural cauntries, and
depend an the fairm itself for his living.
Third, lie must make money instesad af
borrowing maney. The heavy overburden of
ill-aýdviseýd boîrrowing in VIe pat is wbat is
now oppressing hire.
Fourth, lis ambition must be ta mýake a
permanent homne on tIc farm for himself and
lais family. He must cease ta be a bird af
passage, and must become attached ta the soil,
and thus develop a permanent agricultural
population instead of a more or less speculative
anc.
Fifth, he must develop e'long the lines of
smaller and more intensively cultivated farms
-not more than a haîf-sectian eacî-and by
tIe use af grasses and clovers put back into the
soil the fibre cultivated out of it by continuous
cropping. This will facilitate the adoption af
miixed farming.
Sixth, the more general use of feirtilizers
will IeJp him make twa blades grow where
ane grew bef are, thus. increasing production
and reducing bis overhead.
The adoption of these suggestions will flot
make the fermer prosperous unleas tbey are
accompanied by thrift and the intelligent
direction of bis labour. Even tIen tîere are
other economnie considerations that enter inta
his case. Single-handed, there is grave daubt
that le will be able ta, extricate himse1f from
the financia! morass fro>m wbich le struggles
for freedom. The banks and mortgage corporations have pressed bim for payaient ot
interest andi repayment of principal, and when
this bas proved abortive, in many cases they
have taken security on ail bis essets. Hamstrung financially, ho is ýunable ta move; he is
diseourageti, and, sees no way out. He sees
notbing for the future except working for bis
creditors. Witb VIe accumulation of interest
and taxes, and witî low prices for what le
has ta sell, le. secs little prospect of overcoreing the forces arrayed against bim and w-inning out, notwithstanding the urgent pleas of
the lending companies for him ta rernain on
the land, and tbeir Promises ta see him
tîroulgl. And VIe lending companies, as a rule,
have been very eonsideTate ta the farmer,
because they knowv that sucla a policy is tbe
anly solution of the proiblesa of pratecting
their security. If the farmer cannat work
the land profitably, it is a certainty the companies cannat do sa. IV is my best jutigment
that so-oneT or later tIare will have ta comas
a show-down between the lenders andi the
borrowers andi at least a portion af Vhe past
indebtedness mu.st be writtoen off. There is no
other possible solution of the farmer's present

335

SENATE

position. And if it is bound to come, the
sooner the bctter for the' creditor, the debtor
and the country generally. What does it avail
a lending company to carry on its books
enormous sums of past due interest and very
questionable equities when it is a certainty
tbey never can nor will be paid? And why
should the Canadian Government continue its
paternal policy of supplying seed and feed
and relief to the farmer when it is obvious
that such assi-tance, though well inbtentioned,
cannot relieur the undcrlving and basic
causecs of his distress? Such a policy is only
postponing indefinitely the evil hour-the
certain failure in the end. Far botter te relieve
the farmner fron the incubus now, have it over
with, and thus enable him to start a-fresh with
at lcast some of bis shackles removed and
withb his strong arms froe to work out his
detiny on the land-and incidentally ensure
that the loýs te his creditors shall be only a
partial and not a complote one. The Federal
Government adopted this policy with its soldier settlers: took the loss and forgot about it.
Th same policy wvas pursued in the Dakotas
and Minncsota in the .early days, and soens
to be the invariable happening in all new
countries until permanent stability is secured.
In conclusion may I say I am not one of
those who sec no future for our great Western
country. I am an optimi-t of 30 years' experience and bave more faith in the country
to-day that I have ever had. It offers the
areatest opportunitios in the world for the
farmer wlho starts in now wi-th the experience
of the past to guide hi.
Certain conditions
oxist toa-day which require heroic treatment,
that the country inay b put on its fcet, and
once this is donc the economic evolution of
Wetern Canada will be complete se far as
the happiness and prosperity of its people and
the general welfare of Canada are concerned.
Right Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: Honourable senators, I shouild like to geit some advice. For seume time I have been wondering
what a .comparatively small trust company or
insurarce company ought to do by way of
performing its duty in taking advantage of
the privileges proposed in this Bill. I am
desirous of assi-ting as much as possible
towards the sucer ss cf this agricultural credit
scheme, but I do net know just how far the
smaller companies. more particularly those
engaged in life insurance, ought to go. A life
insuîrance company does not own the money
it handles; it simply holds in trust money
that has bren investe-d principally for the
benofit of widows and orphans. The Insurance Act very strictly limits the securities in
which companies may invest, and some of the
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

companies bave been se caroful that they
lave put their moncy only into municipal or
goverament securities. Now those companies
are asked to take a share in a different type
of security. Feeling my responsibility as a
trustee for widows and orphans, I am not
sure just how muceh I should consider myself
a-t libcrty to invest their money in the scherne
in question. If some honourable member can
enlighten me as to how I should act, in view
of that responsibi.lity, it would rescue me
from a dilemma and perhaps relieve my
consccience. The company in which I am intereste d bas always been very careful in its
investments, and that is very fortunate for
it at the present trime. I know there are others
besides myself who would like to know hov
far [ho smaller companies might reasonably go
in investing funds in the company referred to
in this Bill, and how safe such investment
would be for these funds, which belong to
widows and orphans.
Hon. J. S. MeLENNAN: Honourable senit seeis to me that the larger insurance
companies could invest the whole amount of
the capital that would be roquired under this
scheme, and, even if they lost it all, the
security for their policyholders would net be
seriously endangered. After all, the amount
of money required will be comparatively
small, and while the smaller companies might
like to express their good-will to the undertaking, it could perhaps be left to the bigger
companies to put up the required sums.

ators,

Hon. Mi-. DANDURAND: I do net profess
to be able to answer the question of my right
honourable friend on my loft (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham). but I would suggest that if we
-ire this Bill the second reading now, the
honourable leader of the Goverrnment (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) might, when it comes before
us for third reading, prescnt the view of the
Superintendent of Insurance concerning bis
discretionary power to direct insurance, loan
and trust companies under bis supervision as
te what part they may take in this scheme.
Of course we can legislate only for companies
thiat have federal charters. I know that the
Departmnent of Insurance carefully scrutinizes
the securities in which insurance companies
invest.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable sonalors, I should like te commend the honourable member for High River (Hon. Mr.
Riley) for bis optimistic remarks. They show
that ho bas a deep faith in this country. I
am convinced that his faith is well founded.
i am not sure that I understood correctly the
ideas of the honourable senator from Brandon

JULY 7, 1931
(Hon. Mr. Forke), but 1 gatbered tbat he
i hought that the farmers of the West should
net continue raising cattle or live stock.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Oh, no.
Hem. Mr. DONNELLY: I should like to
refer to some matters that have corne under
my ewn observation. I corne from. the County
of Bruce, wbich produces and selis more beef
cattie than any other county in the Province
of Ontario. 1 bave been closely watching the
cattle business in that country for a number
of years, and I know that in tbe year 1895
cattle were cbeaper there than tbey are to-day
in the section of the country that my bonourable, friend (Hon. Mr. Forke) represents.
We had much more difficulty in getting feed
than the people of the West have now, but,
the cattle raisers who had the faith to, carry
on have since becorne successful. They dia
net go eut of business because of the tern.
In farming as in every
porary difficulties.
other line of activity there are lean as well
as fat years. An old farmer wbo lived near
me, and whomn I knew very well, said that
one could neyer judge the success of a farmer
by one or two years' operations; that one
could say a farmer was a failure only if he
had net succeeded on the average over a
period of at least four or five years. My
observation is that, judged by that standard,
the people of Western Canada who have mnade
an honest effort have been successful.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not want the
notion te go abroad that I arn oppoeed te
the raising of cattle in the West. As I have
already stated, I spoke in the Senate some
time ago in faveur of mixed farming, and I
arn of the sarne opinion now as I was then.
We have listened te very interesting speeches
on this matter to-day. Perhaps I may be
permitted te rernark that rny honourable
friend from High River (Hon. Mr. Riley)
lives about as far frorn me as I live frosu
Ottawa; s0 if there are any difierences between
bis statements and mine, they should be considered as due te different geographical conditions.
In answer te the question asked by the
honourable senator frorn De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) I may say that at the time
te whicb he referred there were ne fences and
the stock could roarn at will on the prairie.
Crops were raised only here and there. Conditions are entirely different to-day. I may
add that the last real drought in Manitoba
was in 18W.

m

Hon. L. MeMEANS: Does rny henourable
friend not think that the present high rate
of taxation on farms is responsible to a great
extent for the difficulties that the farmers
have to meet?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: It bas a good deal te
do with it. There was a sentence in an article
written by the honourable senator from
Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) which, I think, hit
the nail on the h.ead. H1e did flot mention
the point to-day. It was that the prices of
ail farma products have fallen below the cost
of production.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I mean that the
expensive administrations of the different
provinces, the building of roads and of railroads, the losses of the Pool, pensions and al
sorts of heavy expenditures wbich have been
made frorn year to year, have increased the
taxation of the people, especially those on
the farms. I, uni ortunately, happen to have
a farma on which the taxes are over $1 an
acre. It is situated about fifteen miles frorn
Winnipeg, andi consists of 1,200 acres, and the
taxes on it are more than 6,0.I think that
taxation has a great deal to do with the
difficulties under whîch the farmers labour.
Hon. Mr. FORKE - In reply I rnay say that
I have net muéfh doubt that the agriculturists
of t.he West-and the city people also-have
gone too far. A debt incurred when wheat
is seliing at $1.60 is going to be very difficuit
to pay off when wheat is selling at 46 cents.
There is the great trouble to-day. As I say,
I think the honourable gentleman from
Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) hit the nail on the
head. I suggeste-d in the Bouse on a previous
occasion that the loan companies, trust companies and other creditors of the farmers
should try to get together with those to whom.
thcy have made boans, because there is ne
other way out of the situation. A boan of
$5,000 did not seem very large to a man who
was getting $1.60 for his wheat; but at the
present tirne, xvhen he is getting only about
one-quarter of that price, he considers it as
large as he would for-merly have considered
a boan of $15,000.
Hon. RUTFUS POPE: I do not think that
any part of Canada offers a better illustration of the comparative advantages of large
farms and small farrns than does the Province
of Quebec. In parts of that province, in the
valîcys, the farrns have been divided up
among the families of the people who originally settled there. They have been a very
thrifty people and have lived off their farmr

and carried on successfully. In the part of
the country where I live, which was originally
settled by English people, there are large
farms. The land in the valleys where the
small farms are situated is worth four times
as much as the land where I live. I think
the sae
comparison applies everywhere.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
TRUST COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY movcd the second reading of Bill 89, an Act to amend the
Trust Companies Act.
He said: Honourable members, the purpose
of this Bill is simply to widen the powers of
the trust companies and enable them to make
investments that they otherwise could not

Is it to the

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
That is all
there is to it. I an not prepared to say anything one way or the other as to the wisdom
of it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
LOAN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second reading of Bill 100, an Act to authorize
the raising by way of loan of certain sums
of money for the Public Service.
He said: Honourable members, the Government desires to raise money by loan, as
iay be required. Following the Loan Bill of
1928, tbe recent Conversion Loan has greatly
reduccd the Government's freedom of action.
The present Bill gives additional authority
to borrow money, on occasion, under the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, through the
issue and sale or pledging of securities of
Canada, in such sums, at such rates of interest
and upon such terms and conditions as may
ba approved bv the Governor in Council.
In order that the Bill nay be clearly und.erstood, I would add these details. By
Chapter 34 of the Statutes of 1928 the
Minister of Finance was given authoritv to
borrow $500,000,000.
Since then national
obligations have been falling due, which by
1937 would have amounted to $1.475,000000.
The Finance Minister and the Government
recentlv determined to take advantage of the
lower monev rates to negotiate what is now
Hon. Mr. POPE.

known as the Conversion Loan.
By this
action, and through the subscriptions of the
Canadian people, who converted their Victory
bonds into the new securities at a lower rate
of interest, roughly $6,000,000 has been saved
ta the Canadian Government.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Annually?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The annual saving
arising ont of this Conversion Loan, after
November, 1934, will be $6,205,000. It therefore seems desirable to provide for the obligations of the Federal Government falling due
up to 1937 and not covered by the raising of
the $639,000,000 through the Conversion Loan.
These obligations amount to about $817,000,000. This Loan Bill is presented in order
that under the provisions of the Consolidated
Revenue and Audit Act the Goverement may
raise money as needed to meet these obligations.
It may be of interest to the House to know
that there is a provision under which a sinking
fund may be set up; but it bas not been the
general practice to set up such a fund in
years gone by.
Section 4 of the Appropriation Act of 1930
provides:
And wbereas there renained on the thirtyfirst day of Marchb, one thoiisand nine hundred
and thirty, uniborrowed andi negotiable of the
loans atitiorizedi by Parlianent for the construction of public works and for general purposes. the following stin:
For public oworks and general purposes,
$182,717,595.20.
And whliereas it is necessary to make provision
for retiring nattiring loans raised for war or
dminobilization purposes and other maturing
oans and obligations of Canada:
Therefore it is declared and enacted, tiat
the Covernor in Coiunil iav authorize the

raising of the stii

above ientioned as required.
The purpose of the Bill now before the
House is to authorize the raising of money in
order that Canada may be in a position to
eet ber financial obligations as and when
they fall due, and that from time to time
adv antage may be taken of opportunities
which present themselves for the raising of
money

at

a

low

cost

to

the

conntry.

A

demonstration of the effect of this is to be
found in the negotiation of the Conversion
Loan, whereby Canada's interest costs will ba
naterially reduced, as time passes. As other
obligations fall due, it may be possible to
make further very substantial savings on
interest account in consequence of the passing
of this Bill at the present time.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Can my
honourable friend tell the House the amount
of outstanding tax-free securities at present?

JULY 7, 1931
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The securities
falling, due from this date to 1937 amount to
$1,475,000,000. 0f that amount 6639,816,000
has been covered by the Conversion Loan, and
this Bill will assist in providing for the sum of
$817,347,000. The record before me does not
indicate exactly what is and what is flot taxfree, but I take it that the 5j per cent bonds
were only in part tax-frea. If my lionourable
friend will indicate to me the years of the
issues that he hes in mind, I cen perliaps help
hima to some extent.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I thouglit that
before the third reading, just as a matter of
information, it would be very useful to have
the amount of tax-free bonds stili in the
hands of private individuals, and also their
dates of maturity. 1 imagine that the principal tax-free bonds are the 5 per cent due
in 1937.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The '33's.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And there are
some '3l's. It strikes me, however, that the
larger part is made up of 5 per cents due in
4
1937, and also M per cents due in 1937. One
issue belongs, I think, to the Victory Loan,
and the other to a War Loan.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: To which does
my right honourable friend refer?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: To both. It
would be interesting to the country to know
exactly the amount of the outstanding liability on whieh no income tex is paid.
Then there is provision here for the purchiase of "unm.atured sedurities." The 1937
non-taxable bonds are, I think, quoted at 107.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The 1937 5ý per
cents are at 111.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There should
be no sucli thing as the Government taking
this power to cali unmatured securities.
It surely does not expeet Parliament to
pass an Act saying that the holders of
those securities shall be compelled to
sell at the price that happens to prcvail at the time of a Conversion Loan.
Tbe Bill speaks of "purchasing." In the case
of a purchase, both parties would have to be
agrceable. I arn in favour of the Bull, but I
think it would be a good thing for the flouse
to have the information that I have asked
f or.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It may be usefui to point out that the 5 per cent War Loan
maturing on March 1, 1937, amounts to $90,166,000. The record does not indicate whether
The Victory Loan
it is tax-free or not.
22112-22à

maturing on December 1, 1937, amounts to
8236,299,000. That is the k~ per cent boan.
I shall endeavour to ascertain, for the information of my right lionourable friend, and
of the House, which of those issues is taxfree. I should not like to say et t-his moment.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I think they are both
tax-free.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think they
are.
This is an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
empowering Bill which will allow the Government to finance progressively, and to meet its
obligations by issuing securities at the same
rate of interest that is paid on the converted
securities. Ail we can do is to give the necessary power to the Government. We can give
no direction as to the proper time to buy or
to borrow.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUJGHBY: That would be
a fine thing to know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would be a
very fine thing to know. Everyone is asking himself when is a good time to buy and
when is a good time to sell. Some months ago
people who had 5à par cent bonds which had
two yeaws to run were off ered an opportunity
to exehiange them for bonds at 4j per cent.
The question asked by every holder of those
securities at 5j per cent was: "Shall I he able
to do better in two years than I cen do now?
What is the outlook? Will money go up or
wiil it go down?" I know of a wise investor
who held some of those bonds and was uncertain as to what lie sliould do. He said, "I
will convert haîf of them and wait for two
years to aec low things turn out."
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hie is liedgîng.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I had lied
those bonds I should have considered it good
business to ta-ke the 4à per cent, because of my
feeling that money would get cheaper. It is
cheaper now thýan et the time of the issue of
the bonds, whicli already are at a prrmium on
the market. The rate in the United States
et present is less then 4 per cent. I am,
convincedl that as time goes on the Government wilh be able to redeem its obligations on
better termas than it ohta-ined two or tliree
months ago.
Hon. Mr. COPP: How will the saving of
86,000,000 corne about, then?
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable

policy that was este'blislied. by tlie predecessors

SENATE

of the present Minister of Finance, namely,
Mr. Fielding, Sir George E. Foster, Sir Thomas
White and Mr. Robbi.
In my opinion the
public debt of Canada is a.ppallhngiy large. It
i3 truc that the country lias trernendous
resources and great potectialities, but stili
there is a limit to the amount which we can
sa-fely borrow. During the late Mr. Robb's
tenure of office large teductions were made in
the public debt, te tbe gro.at advantage of
Caneda's eredit in the rnonoy mrets. I hope
that the Gcvernment w'ill be chie to arrange
conversions in the future as eesiiy as on the
rocent occasion.
0f courS, in view of the
ternis on which the ladt býan ives effered,' it is

without provision for a sinking fund: Provided
that the amnount to be jnvested in any ouch

Hon. Mr. LEMIEÙX: There is no such
explanation on my copy.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: It is an expression of pohicy?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: An expression of
policy. A sinking fund now exists in connection with certain of the London loans.
The principal of the debt thus conicerned is
$254,000,000. The contribution is one.half of
one per cent, or $1,272,263 goes into the sinking fund every year, towards the final
liquidation. The total held in sinking funds
on Mardi 31 amounted to $59,700,000, of which
$3,670,000 was added this year. So the
obligations are gradually being paid off. The
same principle that was advoca.ted by the
present Prime Minister in the speech referred
to by my honourable friend from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) was applied in connection with these loans, and it may be adopted
to retire borrowings authorized by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: That is -satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: The provision referred
to by the honourable Minister of Labour
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) is not in the Bill. The
Bill merely states that boans in addition Vo
the sumos now remaining unborrowed may be
raised for redeeming boans that are outstanding. and for purchasing and withdrawing from
circulation unmatured securities, and for
public works and general purposes.
Hon. Mr. ROlBERTSON: And provision
may be made for the establishment of a sinking fund.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: That is flot in the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. RO'BERTSON: I did not say
that it was.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Why are not the explanations printed on the right-hand side of
the Bill, as Vhey usually are on other Bills?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSiON: Explanatory notes
appear only on Bills that are amendments to
Acts. This is a new Bill and consequently
there are no changes to be explained.
Hon. J. P. B. CASbGRAIN: Honourable
senators, I h4eard a discussion a.mong some
financial men who suggested that the Government could borrow a lot of money cheaply
witbout any incidental expenses. Their ides
was that it sbould be possible for citizens who
bave comparatively small sums of nioney for
investment, perhaps from $100 Vo &W0, to
apply to a postmaster and get a bond. As the
postna.stcrs are already in t.he Government
employ, and post offices are ail over the
country, no extra salaries or office expenses
would be incurred. Applications for bonds
couid be sent on to Ottawa, and, when the
bonds were delivered, the money remitted by
the post office to the Government. The
scheme might become very successful, once
the people got to know about it, and if so a
permanent source of money would be provided. 1 do flot know if there is anything
worth while in the suggestion, and I arn
simply passing it on for what it is worth.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There migbt be
a littie diffiiculty in keepîng track of the issues
of bonds in sucb oirdumistances.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There migbt be
some difficulty.

HALIFAX HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the second
reading of Biii 103, an Act ta provide for a
further boan ta the Hlalifax Harbour Cernmissioners.
He said: Hononrabie gentlemen, when a
B3ill cancerning a harbour commission cames
before us there is anc thing of which we cao
be certain, namely, that more money is

JULY 7, 1931
wanted. That is the case with this Bill.
Perhaps the explanatory note will give as
concise a statement of the Bill as it is
possible to give. It says:
The Halifax Harbour Commissioners were
incorporated by Act of Parliament, chapter
58 of the Statutes of 1927. A loan of $500,000
was authorized by the Statutes of 1928, chapter
28. to construct terminal facilities, and that
amount was to ineet the total requirements of
the corporation for one year from 11th June,
1928, the date of the passing of the Act. A
further loan of $5,000,000 was authorized by the
Statutes of 1929, chapter 44, to carry on the
construction of terminal facilities and to construet such additional f acilities as were
approved as necessary to properly equip the
port. The present Bill is to authorize a further
loan of $3,500,000 to the Harbour Commissioners for the same purpose.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Do they meet
their interest?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I cannot say
whether Halifax is meeting its interest or not.
Very few of the harbour commissions are.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
defaulted.

Montreal never

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is one of
the exceptions.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Nor Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am not sure.
According to the last information I had in
regard to Vancouver, it was doing fairly well.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Vancouver is the
only one at present paying its interest.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Montreal quit.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We all know
that it was felt desirable to develop Halifax
Harbour as an ocean port, and, in the matter
of facilities for loading and unloading, to
enable it to compete with ports of the United
States. As to whether it is or is not paying
its way, however, without having certain
knowledge, I would say that it is not.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think you
would be safe in that.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: If honourable
gentlemen want the Bill to stand overHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that we give it the second reading now, and
that it be taken up in committee, perhaps tomorrow, with the idea of having the engineer
of the department supply us with plans so that
we may know what is being done in the port
of Halifax. As bas been stated, $500,000 was
advanced in 1928, $5,000,000 in 1929, and now
we are being asked for $3,500,000. Undoubt-

343

edly all this expenditure must be for the purpose of develaping a general plan. I should
like to know whether this $3,500,000 will complete the work, or whether we are in for a
long pull from year to year.
Hon. Mr. COPP: It is never completed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think the
Senate would be interested in knowing something about that. I remember that when I
was on the other side of the House and moved
for a loan of $5,000,000 to the Quebec Harbour
Commissioners, we had plans here showing the
proposed development and the modus operandi
involving the expenditure. In that case
$5,000,000 was expended; then, I think, we
voted another $5,000,000, in addition to which
there was some $2,000,000 for elevators. So
a large expenditure was necessary before the
port of Quebec was able to accommodate the
Empress of Britain at the new wharves near
Wolfe's Cove. In that case, however, plans
of the project were shown to the Senate by the
officials of the department, and we saw that
the first undertaking was but a partial development.
I do not know whether the development 'of
the port of Halifax will cost $10,000,000 or
$25,000,000. I know that in the case of
Montreal we started out with an annual expenditure of a few millions; but the whole
plan represented a future expenditure of
$100,000,000. I do not know to what extent
we are involved at present in the port of
Montrea.l, or whàt proportion of the total has
already been spent. I think the information
that I have asked for would be useful in
ascertaining whether we are simply voting
money piecemeal from year to year or
whether it is for a general plan.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am quite
in sympathy with that method of procedure.
I think it is most desirable that we should
have the information in crystallized form,
and I suggest that the committee stage stand
over until Thursday.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before the motion
is put, I think it would be well to inform the
leader of the Government in this House that
some of us are very desirous of knowing
how much money bas been spent on the harbour of Halifax during the past twenty years.
I understand that the Commission will pay
interest only on the amounts that have been
lent to the Commission; but in the past
various Governments have spent a great deal
of money on that harbour. Is that expenditure going to be ignored altogether?
I had occasion to go to Halifax, and saw
the works there and the alterations that were

344

SENATE

being carried on in order to run the Intercolonial railway back of the town. I have
seen also what has been done in the way of
expropriating the water-front, and so on. It
seems to me that the huge sums of money
spent there are not justifled by the business
done during the winter months. I think it
is only fair, therefore, that we should know
whether these expenditures are to be forgotten,
and how much we have buried in that particular harbour during the past twenty years.
I think ià will be found that we have treated
the dear old city of Halifax pretty well. Fortyeight hours should be quite long enough for
us to secure the information desired. Further.
I should like to know whether there lias been
any return on that money. I do not think
there has been. I do not know. There may
have been sufficient to pay the interest on the
amount advanced.
'e know that it is the
policy of the present Governrment to do away
with all these harbour commissions and to
adminiSter all the ports fron the department
under which they come. That may be a very
good policy. I do not know. Of course, it
would be rather sad for those who are lucky
enough to he harbour commissioners. We
sympathize with them. Some of them we
could take into the Senate, others could go
into the other House, and the remainder could
find something else to do.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: If I can get
the proper offleer of the depart.ment here, I
think he will be able to give alI the information required.
lion. Mr. TANNER: I hope the leader of
the Government will bring down the exact
figures, hecause if he does, mv honourable

money buried down there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Halifax harbour is
a real asset to Canada; a much greater asset
than some other ports of this country. Halifax
is an all-year port on the Atlantie ocean; it
is not like the ports that are tied up half the

year by Jack Frost. It is one of Canada's
great national ports of the future, and this
country and this Parliament would be well

Hon. Mr. TANNER: -and the immigration shedsHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And the hotels.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -and the wharvesHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And the hotels.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I know that he is impressed, and is not serious in talking about

buried money. The work at Halifax was conmenced soon after 1911, and by 1914 the port
had been developed sufficiently to afford something that Canada needed. I do not know

what Canada would have done without the
Halifax terminals when it came to sending
men and materials to the Great War.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What about Saint
John, New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The amount being
asked for here is $3,50,000. Now, in some
mysterioluis way there has come about a change
in the personnel of the Halifax Harbour Commis:sioners since the 28th of July last. I do
not know how it happencd. I am informed,
and believe, froin observations on the ground,
that about 90 per cent of this money is required to pay liabilities incurred un.der contracts cntered into by the Commission that
went out of office in the fail of 1930. When
the present Commission assuimed control they
we re confronted with a bank debt of from one
to two million dollars, and conscquently they
had to curtail very materiaIly their activities.
I rpeat that this vote is required largely,
although not altogether, to liquidate the liabilities that existed before the present Commission came into office.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourabie
senators, I an glad that my honourable friend
has spoken of Halifax. I a.m in favour of
doing anything within reason for that port.
My honourable friend is entirely wrong when
he says that the improvements down there
began after 1911. The impairment began
after that ycar.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am speaking of the
south terminal.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: As a matter of
fact the Minister of Railways expended many
millions of dollars on Halifax-

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I quite agree with
my right honourable friand that there was a
lot of rnoney .spent on the north end.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is at the
south end that my honourable friend is
arguing, but I arn dealing with both ends.
Halifax harbour has been an object of great
interest and concern to the whole Dominion
for rnany yeurs. Nearly ail the improvemnents
there in matters conacerning transportation, the
building of sheds, construction of docks, and
so on, were. made at the time that the Intercolonial Railway was directly under Government control.

always took in our province. In 1911, although
the member for Colchester in the other
Chamber was in opposition at the tirne, the
Railway Departrnent estimates contained an
item for the railway station at Truro. As a
result of that vote Truro to-day hais the finest
station east of Montreal.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I saw it this
summer.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: I sirnply want to
give credit where credit is due. If every
Minister of Railways took as keen interest in
Nova Scotia as niy right honourable friend

more facilities in that province than we now

JULY 7, 1931
(Hon. Mr. Chapais) in heartily fel-icitating
the bonourable gentleman from Acadie on the
occasion of his fiftieth anniversary in the
Senate. My eminent friend from Grandville
is quite correct in saying that aid age is not
a decline. On the contrary, as it lias been
deflned by a famaus writer, oid age is but a
dawning, for it whitens everything.
The honourable senatar from Acadia lias
gloriously reached the summit of parliamentary life, and if to-day he casts lis glance
back over the plain and recalîs the lunes of
LamartineAdieu l'ombre des beaux jours!
Adieu notre enfance!
La vie est un morne silence
Où le coeur appelle toujoursý.
(Farewell ta the shadow of beautiful days!
Farewell ta, aur childhood!
Lif e is a dreary silence iuta which the heart
keeps cailing.)
-aur calleague may feel gratified that, natwithstanding the vacant places ail about him,
in Acadia, even in this Chamber, he still bas
a hast, af friends and admirers, including
many who, belonging ta a later generatian,
have perhaps neyer seen him and knaw hlm
oniy by bis writings.
It was a great hanaur for him, a madest
officiai af the Hause of Cammons, ta have
been chosen for appaintment ta the Senate
by Sir John A. Macdonald himself, one of the
Fathers of Confederation. Fifty years ago
this young officiai bad already acquired an
enviable reputatian. He had written the stary
of Acadia; lie bad composed what was later
to become the national anthem of the
Acadians; ha had also preached ta bis campatriots in the Maritime Provinces tbat
poiicy of racial survival whicb tbe lionourable
senatar from Grandville bas so weli described.
To-day it must lie a source of pride for him
ta remember that tbrougbout Acadia tbe littie
scbool chidren learn by heart the pages of
history tbat be bas written. And wben lie
attends the celebratians af tbe Feast of the
Assumption, wliat must be bis emotian on
bearing the national anthem that be bimseif
bas given ta bis peaplet That anthem clearly
reflects their racial and religiaus sentiments.
The bistory of Acadia lias, indeed, a religians
and Frenchi basis.
Before resuming my seat may I tell this
Cliamber thg)t at the Institut de France I
myseif witnessed the favaurable reception
given ta the name af tbe histarian of Acadia
and tbe writer who lias made knawn the
remote beginnings of the Frenchi language in
Canada. Indeed, -about tbree years aga, Mr.
René Doumic presented ta him tbe goid
medal of tbe Frenchi Academy for bis literary
works.

May I say ta -tbe honaurabie senatar that
we are proud of him. In the Senate and
tbroughout the country lie bas aiways
preacbed national unity, and on tbis score lie
deserves well af his country.
Hon. GIDEON ROBERTSON:
It is a
pleasant priviiege ta do banour ta tbe caurteous gentleman af wbam we bave been speaking this afternoon. It bas been my pleasure
ta know Senator Poirier quite intîmately since
my entry inta this House about fifteen years
ago, and I may say that he bas always been
characterized by an amiable spirit, an unfailing caurtesy, and an a'biiity that bas often
bcen demonstrated here. It is a particular
pleasure and an bonour te play a part at the
golden jubilce of bis entry into the life of
the Senate of Canada, remembering as we
do tbat be is the only member of t-his House
wba was appainted prior ta the time wben
Sir Wilfrid Laurier became Premier. We ail,
I am sure, rejoice in tbe fact tbat lie bas
been spared for aver haîf a century ta fulfil
bis duties as a inember ci tbe Senate in suci
an able and acceptable manner, and I arn sure
we ail hope tbat we sball be able ta celebrate
with him the sixtieth annîversary af bis becoming a member of this Huse.
Han. A. B. COPP: As a represent-ative
f rom the same county as tbe hanaurable
gentleman (Han. Mr. Poirier) I shauid like
ta join with those wba bave spoken, and extend my bearty congratulations to Senator
Poirier upon reacbing the fiftietb milestone
in bis career as a member af this buse. I
quite weil remember some tbirty years ago,.
w-len I first was interested in poiitics in aur
country, looking up ta, him as one of tbe
leading men of the county. Many times lie gave
me the benefit of bis sage advice. Sometimes
I foliowed it; somretimes I did not. As the
iast speaker said, we bope that aur lianaurable friend will be with us ta commemorate
the sixtieth anniversary af bis coming ta this
Huse.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: May I pay my
sincere tribute ta the qualities of the senator
of whom we bave been speaking--quaiities
wliich are well known ta ail in this Houseand ta the extraordinary erudition dispiayed
by bim in bis remarkabie book an the
Acadian language, "La Langue Acadienne."
Ta me tbe baok is monumental, in the sense
.that ana reading it can scarcely imagine that
anyone living in-I had almost said tbe wilds
of New Brunswick-that anyone living so
many miles from. tbe great libraries of the
world, particularly those of France, should
have been able ta acquire sufficient knowiedge,
and shouid have bad sufficient industry, ta

348

SENATE

write a book which, by all who are interested
in the use of words, has been acclaimed as a
most remarkable performance. All this, without subsidies, without private fortune, lie
was able te accomplish.
I have been told that the senator has the
material all prepared for a second volume,
but that gross commercial considerations do
net permit him te have it printed. I venture
te suggest that it would be very fitting for
those of us who appreciate his work, and who
enjoy the pleasure of his companionship in
this House, te make possible, by a joint effort,
the publication of that book in readiness for
his sixtieth anniversary, an event that I hope
we all shall witness.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, I wish te join with those who have
spoken se feelingly of our colleague, Mr.
Poirier. I should like te tell him how much
I have appreciated his friendship. Senator
Poirier, it seems te me, carries with him what
in French is se well called "sa petite patrie""his little country." I know of no man who
is more decply attached te, or who can better
describe, the beauties of l'Acadie. I know of
no man who has written of "his little country"
more appealingly than Senator Poirier has
donc. He is a conscientious writer. He has
taken infinite pains and has armassed a store
of learning such as few persons possess.
One thing above all others distinguishes him
frcm his fellows: notwithstanding his years,
he has such freshness of seul, such youthful
intilligence, such enthusiasm as can hardly be
matched by any man of any age. Te express
my thougbt I would say with Victor Hugo
that if in the eyes of youth there is a flame,
in the eyes of age there is a light. His career
has been a light, a beautiful light, shining
not only in "his little country" and in our
land, but across the sea. Few of our compatriots have been decorated for their historical or literary work. Our colleague has
se attracted the admiration of the French
Republic that he has been awarded the title
of Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.
From my heart I tender te my friend my
congratulations and very best wishes. I trust
that he will remain what he is, without changc,
for a great many years te come.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: May I add just
one word, having only tivo seniors in this
House, the honourable gentleman of whom
we are speaking (Hon. Mr. Poirier) and my
leader on this side of the House (Bon. Mr.
Dandurand)? I hope I shall be excused from
saying much.
I suppose every honourable
member knows the relationship betiween the
honourable gentleman and myself. It is very
Hon.

Mr. MeLENNAN.

difficuit for one te speak of one of his own
family. Let me say, however, that I echo aIl
the beantiful things that have been said, particularly the remarks of the honourable gentliman from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais),
whose speech was a gem. All the speeches,
both French and English, were beautiful. I
think it ought te give the honourable gentleman great pleasure te know in what esteem
he is held.
The book alluded te by the honourable senator from Sydney (Hon. Mr. McLennan) is
a wonderful book. I have read it. I am net
ashamcd te say that I am net through reading
it yet. It is se beautiful, and se difficult, that
one would imagine that it must have required
the labours of a Benedictine monk and the
whvole of a lifetime te have written it. It
refers net only te the origin of the Acadian
language, but te the languages of the north
and of the south of France. It is a stu-pendons work and, as was stated by the honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux), the literary authorities of France
thought proper te make the author the recipient of a gold medal. All my wishes are that
he may remain for a long timse in the family.
Hon. PASCAL POIRIER: Honourable colleagues I sppose that an old man, like a
child, should be, scen rather than heard. But
I iust say a few words te express my gratitude, and mv appreciation of the honour that
you are conferring upon me. I will net say
that I am overwhelmed, but certainly I am
very deeply touohed.
In this friendly manifestation the main
feature is age. I happen to have been for
fifty years in the Senate. Yeu gentlemen may
ail bave the saine privilege. All you have te
do is pile years upon years, and then you too
behonoured as I am honoured now.
will
lion. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Carry on.
lon. Mr. POIRIER: There is no great
virtue in thbat. It is simply a matter of living
a well regulated life. A Scotchman who had
attained a great age once told me that the
main thing to which he attributed his longevity
was his choice of whiskey. Of course, I could
not contradiet him; but I say that what is
conducive te old age is an honourable life.
This makes me believe that all of you will
attain te a great age, for the Senate of Canada
is a testimony to the care and wisdom exercised in selecting men.
I will be brief. As I have been a senator
for half a century-not sixty years-you may
ask me wxhat has struck me most during my
carcer in the Sena-te. I have seen and met aIl
the great figures-Sir John A. Macdonald of

JULY 7, 1931
Ontario, Sir George Cartier of Quebec, Howe
of Nova Scotia, Tilley of New Brunswick.
It wilI be remembered that there were threats
to abolish the Spniate. The Liberal Party, so
well represented by my friends to the left of
His Honour the Speaker, periodically advocated the abolition of this Chamber, and for
a time I myseif did flot know whether they
might not be successful. But the Senate will
flot be abolished. We have with us the eternal
feminine, whose coming hfre I look upon as
the happiest event that bas occurred during
my sec atonial career, and as a guarantee of
the continuity of the Canadian Senate.
My alleged menits have been praised f ar
more highly than they deserve. Now, before
sitting down, I desire to thank you from the
hottom of my heart for this very kind tribute.
I shalI close with a few words in French.
(Translation) I thank you very much for the
very kind-the ail too kind-words that you
have spoken with regard to myseif.

Mr. FORE.

H1e said: Honourable mem'bers of the
Sonate, it seems proper that I should give
te this honourable House some statement inl
connection with tbe session~ of the League
of Nations, whose deliberations I Lad the
privilege te, attend, in September 1930, as
eue of the delegates of Canada.
The chief of our delegation was Sir Robert
Borden. I need net insist before this House
on the importance of having a statesman of
stncb rqpute as the representative of our
country at Gcneva. He was knoýwn as the
war-time Prime Minister of Canada. Ho was
the only man in the Assembly of the League
whbo bad been a signer of the Treaty of
Versailles.
Moreover, bis wide experience,
bis mastery of facts, bis great knowledge of
political, baistorical and constitutional questions added te bis prestige. The Canadian
delegatien wcre justly proiîd of their leader.
1 should net omit te mention bere our lady
colleague. the Hon. i-one Parlby, a memiber
of the Provincial Lcgi.liiture aind of the
Governmcnt
of Aiberta.
Well informed,
cpi'lyon the social problcms, endoxved
with a remarkable qîîicknes, cf perception,
she is a ready speakzer. And all these gifts
made bier a credit te hier province and te, our
Dominion.
Tbe C:înadian delegation compriscd aIse
tirc e associate delegates: Ris Excellency Mr.
Philippe Roy,, our- Minister at Paris, Dr.
W. A. Riddell, Canadian Advisory Offleer at
the League, anci Coloel Vaniier, Canadian
r 'preiidtativ-e on th(, Permanent Advisory
Commii.ssion for Military, Naval and Air
Questions.
Mr. Roy, a former mcmibcr of
tbis- Ronce, is w cIl postod on aIl European
l)roblemý: Le is a man of uprigbt vicvs and
of clear judgmcnt. and cnjovs a miost enviable situation in diplomatie circîrs.
Dr.
Ridd Il is weIl cqui)pc ci for bis important
functions at Gpetva. He bas knowled,g-e, tact
and firncrs of pîîrpose and makes bis infhîjence felt, in tlic w orl
of committees.
Colonel Vanier, new -secrctaiy te tbe Canadian Higli Commissioner in London, aftcr
b:îving, distingýuisbed bimself on the battlefichd, bas attained equal distinction in civil
liPe. He bas forcsigbt and fertility of mmid,
and is a most sympatbetic pcrsonilitvý.
The sc crctary of the delegation. Mr. Normnac Robertson, an officer cf the Departmient
cf lxrnlAffairs, bcre in Ottawa, choyer,
asiuu.painstaking. conversant witb
i
parts et the Asembly's programme, was very
cfficient in the disebarge of bis important
du tics.
The session cf the Assemblv cf thie League
cf Nations, %vhicha was opcned on the lOtb of
Septcmî)Or, was the elcventba since its founda-

JULY 8,1931
tion in 1920. It brouglit together the representatives of fifty-two nations. That Assembly
at Geneva is the greatest and most imposing
parliament od the world. In fact it is the
parliament of the world. At that session of
1930 its membership comprised six Prime
Ministers, six former Prime Ministers or beads
of states, eighteen Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
ten former Ministers of Foreign Affairs and
twenty-three delegates with a rank corresponding to that of Cabinet Minister. They
came from every part of the world: from the
Far East and from. the Far West; from
Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Australasia; from Japan, China, Siam, Persia, India,
as well as from Chile, Peru, Bolbivia, Guatemala, San Salvador, Uruguay, and Paraguay;
from Belýgium and the Netherlands, Engl-and
and France, Germany and Austria, Rouinania
and Hungary, Penmark and Norway, Sweden
and Poland, Finland and Esthonia, Spain and
Italy, Greece and Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia, Portugal and Switzerland,
and a score of other countries. You could
meet there in nîutual intercourse representatives of ail races, eacb easily discernible by
his varied features and complexion, yellow,
black or white.
Many members of that Assembly were men
of world fame. One could see negligently
bent over his desk, in a familiar attitude, the
Pan-European Union promoter, Mr. Aristide
B3riand, at the head of the French delegation.
acecompanied by Mr. Pierre Lavai, who was
to become a few months afterwards the Prime
Minister of France. On the third row of
benches sat Mr. Henderson, the British
Foreign Secretary, with his square shoulders
and his strong head, bis prestige daily
increasing, and Lord Cecil of Chelwood, the
flower of diplomacy, one of the brilliant sons
of the illustrious Marquess of Salisbury.
Nearby, the eye was attracted by the
white hair and elegant gait of Mr. Pauîl
ilymans. the clever Mînister of Foreign
Affairs for Belgium, and by the striking
presence of Mr. Carton de Wiart, the
former Prime Minister of that country. Pursuing that cursory review of the great Assembly. you could gaze successively at Doctor
Curtius, the poised German Minister of
Foreign Affairs; at Venizelos, whose name
attained sucli celebrity during the war; at the
alert Mr. Politis, Minister of Greece at Paris,
one of the best speakers in French in the
Assembly; at the venerable veteran of Hungarian politics. Count Apponyi, master of
seven languages. who at the agé of 84 proved
to be a most forcible and eloquent orator;
at General Hertzog, the renowned Prime Minister of South Africa; at His Highness the

Maharaja of Bikanir, a prince of India, of
commanding stature and mind; at Mr.
Seialoja, the great Italian jurist and professor;
at Mr. Titulesco, the chief Rumanian delegate, who was to be elected President of the
Assembly; and at a host of others.
After this glance over the Assemnbly, would
you mind glancing over the city which lias
been for ten years the seat of the League?
Geneva is indeed a beautiful town. She
spreads her streets, lier buildings, lier monuments on hoth sides of that splendid inland
sea, the Leman, which reflects lier towers and
spires in the shining mirror of its pure and
green waters. At the outlet, this mighty river,
Ihe Phone, scemingly impatient of the quietness imposed on its turbulent spirit through
the peaceful crossing of the lake, leaps over
the barriers which would attempt to fetiter
its freedom and precipitates its tumultuous
course towards the valleys of southern France,
where, united with the Sâone, it runs at full
speed te merge its waves witb the blue waves
of the great Mediterranean z-ea. Raising your
head, you are struck with admiration at the
siglit of the gigantic row of mountains which
encircles the lake. Here is the Salèze, towering over flhc beautiful scenery, and farther
the wonderful Mont Blanc, erecting in the
skies its snowy peaks, which, at sunset, seem
glittering with all the hues of the rainbow.
During the session of the Assembly, Geneva.
which lias become for a whule the capital cf
the world. is a scene of strenuous if e and
festival animation. The great palaces bordering the "Quais du Mont Blanc et du Président
Wilson," where the delegates are quartered,
are decorated with tlie multiccloured flags of
the different states. Crowds cf visitors enliven
the streets and the shops. September is for
the Swiss mnetropolis a month cf brilliant
buoyancy.
But it is aIso and mainly a mnonth cf arduous
work. The session of the League in 1930
lasted four full and busy weeks. Before giving a synopsis of the program which was to be
followed, perhaps it would lie convenient to
give a short sketch cf the organization cf the
League. 'I know that sucli information may
be deenied superfluous for a great many members of thîs flouse. But recapitulation is
cf ten useful. Let us remember, therefore, that
the League cf Nations under the Covenant
entered into, by forty-twc self-governing states
in 1920, is composed of tbree bodies: the
Council, the Assembly, and the Seeretariat.
The Council primarily consisted cf representatives cf Great Britain, France, Italy and
Japan, to whom were added the representatives of six other states elected yearly by the

SENATE
SENATE

352
352

Assembly. The four great powers mentioned
in the first place were to have permanent
seats and the others non-permanent seats.
Later on, in 1926, Germany was admitted to
the League and was given a permanent seat,
and the number of non-permanent seats was
fixed at nine, three of those being allotted
by the Assembly, every year, to so many
states, for a period of three years. Thus the
Council now consists of fourteen members.
Five-namely, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan-have permanent seats
and nine non-permanent scats. For three
years, Canada held one of the non-permanent
scats, its term, as well as that of Cuba and
Finland, having lapsed in September, 1930.
The three states which were then elected in
their stead were Guatemala, the Irish Free
State and Norway. The Council is now coinposed of representatives of Great Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland,
Rumania, Spain, Venezuela, Persia, Chile, the
Irish Free State, Guatemala and Cuba.
The Council has four regular meetings
every year at these different dates: Mardh
10, June 10, August 30, and December 10.
When needed, it can be convened for a
special meeting. The Council, in some ways,
acts the part of the Cabinet in our constitutional governments, whilst the Assembly acts
the part of the Parliament. Both can deal
"with any matter within the sphere of action
of the Leagute or affecting the peace of the
world." But the Council has in fact more to
do than the Assembly with settling international disputes, because. of course, it is casier
to secure agreement in a small body which
acts as a committee than in a great one which
acte as a parlianent. The Council also guides
and controls the work of the Secretariat,
and of the various advisory commissions and
committees of enquiry; it places matters on
the agenda of the Assembly, etc.
The Assembly is composed of the representatives of all the states who are members
of the League. Each state has the right to
be represented by three delegates, but is
entitled to only one vote, without discrimination in faveur of population, power or wcalth.
The Assembly meets every year on the
second Monday of September. Ilt elects its
president, its six vice-presidents; it selects its
committees. It debates the questions which
are brought to its attention; it adopts, or
amends, or rejects the reports made by the
various committees. Quoting the words of a
learned professor, I would say that "the
Assembly is the truc driving force of the
whole nachinery of the League; in short, it
doces that which in a national state is donc
by parliament."
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

The third body in the League of Nations
is the Secretariat. It might be compared to
:the Civil Service in our governmental organizations. At the head of that important body
is the Secretary-General, Sir Erie Drummond,
a most able and efficient executive officer.
|He may be considered as one of the mainstays of the League. He directs the activities of the whole administration. The Secretariat is divided into many sections or departments, the main ones being: the Health
Section, the Legal Section, the Treaty Registry, the Disarmament Section, the Mandates
Section, the Political Section, the Social
Section, the Economic and Financial Section.
The Secretariat includes also the various
technical services, upon which the sections all
depend: the translators, the interpreters, the
typists, the reporters, the indexers, the proofreaders. In the huge Secretariat building may
be seen at work hundreds--one document says
five hundred men and women-belonging to
perhaps forty nations, drawn from every
clime and from every race, working together
for a comimon purpose.
This rapid survey would not be complete
if J did not at least mention two institutions
connected with the League: the Permanent
Court of International Justice, and the International Labour Organization. I shall have
by and by to add a few words about the
f ormier.
Two days before the opening of the
eleventh session of the League's Assembly,
the Council held its sixtieth session. It lasted
fron the 8th till the 12th September. "In
addition to the usual routine in connection
with the work of the Assembly, the Council
vas occupied with adjustment of a number of
political differences, with the election of members of the Economic Commission and Economie Consultative Committee and of judges
to the Permanent Court of International Justice, with the problems of health, opium and
refugees, of penal reform, traffic in women,
and intellectual co-operation." Later on the
Council held its sixty-first session from
Se'ptember 17 till October 3.
As we have already seen, the Assembly
opened its cleventh session on September 10.
Mr. Nicholas Titulesco, first delegate of
Rumania, was elected President. Six vicepresidents werc also nanted. Then the work
of the session was allotted, as in former years,
to six commit t ees as follows: the first, to deal
with constitutional and legal questions; the
second, to deal with the work of the technical organizations; the third, with the reduction Of armaments; the fourth, with the
organization of the Secretariat and League's

JULY 8, 1931
finances; the fifth, wîth the social and humanitarian questions; and the sixth with political
questions. These prelimînaries occupied the
first meeting of the Assembly. The six coinmittees proceeded to their organization and
elected their chairmen, who became, ipso
facto, vice-presidents of the Assembly. Canada had the honour to see its first delegato,
Sir Robert Borden, elected as chaîrman of
the sixth committee. The general committee of the Assembly was thus composed of
the President, of the six vice-presidents
elected by the Assem'bly, of the six vicepresidents, chairmen of the committees, and
of Sir Eric Drummond, the Secretary General.
At the third plenary meeting of the Assembly began what 1 sbould be inclined to cal
the debate on the Address. At the beginning
of each session at Geneva a report is submitted on the work of the League since
the preceding session. That report might be
likened te our Speech from the Throne.
And it is always debated at length, a similarity with the long discussion on the Address
in our popular Chambers.
On the llth of September, 1930, the debate
on the report was begun. And wo were
delighted to sec that SiT Robert Borden had
been asked te be the first speaker. Allow
me to quote bis own humorous mention of the
incident. In a lecture deliverod at Ottawa
on the 17th of Novomber last hie said:
There were not many in the Assembly wbo
had been present at the Peace Conferenco in
Paris, in 1919; and on the afternoon before
the opening of the Assembly it was suggested
te me by Sir Eric Drummnond that it would
bo apprepriate to have me begin the debate.
I hesitated, and thon with the rashness and
inoxperienco of youth, I accepted, as 1 knem,
that at soine tirne I mnust break the ice.
Accordinghy. 1 said te Sir Eric Drummond
that I would speak for nlot more than ton or
twvelve minutes. .. Behold me, newly arrived
and venturosome, f acing fifty-two nations
gathered in the Assembly.
1 need not tell you t'hat Sir Robert could
confidently face even such an awe-inspiring
audience. But I can assert that it is ne small
trial te break the ice bof ore this great parliament of the world, cemprising a commsnding
array of renowned statesmen, of mighty
leaders in diplomacy and international poliSir Robert Borden in his speech rotics.
called the memories of eleven years ago, when
bie returned from Europe te bis own country
with a feeling of prefound depression. The
atmosçphere of lhe world was oppressive,
almost stifling. Mon criod, "Peace! Peace!"
when there was ne peace. After ton years,
it was an inspiration te see that Assombly
of the Nations in full and intimate confeoronce, conqecrated te the cause of peaceful

5

arbitrament and the enthronement of public
right among the nations. At Geneva they
were in the kindergarten of peace, and already
they had learned many a useful lesson. But
there were others stili harder that were yet
to be learned. Sir Robert spoke of the
Briaund-Kellogg pact, which had. been a
memorable step towards moral disarmament
in leading the nations te reneunco war as au
instrument of national policy. Yet, notwithstanding this splendid moral renunciation,
armaments continued to oppress the nations.
To-day, the world was expect-ant. Sir Robert
Borden's speech was highly commended and
received with loud applause.
The Canadian first delegate was followed at
the tribune by no less a man than Mr. Briand.
The Frrench statesman is the foremost orator
of the Assembly. He has been styled the
*'premier ténor de la Ligue." Ho always*ýoinmands a full bouse and full galleries. Undoubtedly, hoe is a master of oratory. When
you seo him, witb his bent shoulders, his
careloss dress, bis sluggish bearing, ascending
clumsily the steps of the tribune, you would
neyer imagine that in a few minutes that
man is going to catch the passionate attention and stop the breath of the most splendid
audience in the world. But wait a moment,
and ho shahl a-chieve the feat. Mr. Briand
bas a deep voico, comparod sometimes to the
sound of a violoncello; bis ocratorical action is
full of if e; he speaks with bis eyes, bais arms,
0
bis shoulders; bie feels the pulse of bis audience and moulds his speech accordingly; ho
is plausible, familiar, oarnest, now easy-going,
then impassioned and vebement. In the
speech whicb hoe made that day hie mainly
treated. the paramount question of the
Euiropean federation. A preliminary meeting
of twenty-seven states had taken place at
Geneva a few days bof ore. Mr. Briand bad
been elocted chairman, and hoe endeavoured
to show that bis scee was in no way intended to minirnize the influence and jurisdiction of tbe League, as it had been insinuated; that, on the contrary, it should work
witbin the League and under its oegis. He
stated that the twenty-sevon states whose
represontatives had met to discuss the matter,
whilst differing on some points, had agreed
"that close co-operation in ail international
activities is of capital importance for the
maintenance of peace." And hie wanted the
League to tell them: "Go forward. You are
on the right road; you are marcbing towards
peace."

The debate was continued by Mr. Henderson, the British Foreign Secretary. H1e made
a. Wtiong speech and was greatly admired for

SENATE

his elear presentation of facts and his forcible
comments on disarmament. From this moment
he was looked upon as one of the leading
minds of the Assembly. A great many speakers
took part in the debate, which was prolonged
over eleven sittings. I shall not attempt to
give you even a summary of the numerous
speeches delivered by the thirty-nine delegates who made themselves heard. As usual,
some were very good, and some not so good.
I should like only to mention specially the
speech of Count Apponyi, the first delegate
of Hungary, who at the age of 84 spoke in
perfect French for an hour, with great eloquence.
I should perhaps mention here that the two
official languages of the League are the English
and the French. But other languages may
be used. All speeches are translated immediately into French or English, as the case may
be. The League has a wonderful body of
translators, mon and women.
Speaking of the language of debate, Sir
Robert Borden made the following remarks
in the lecture already quoted:
'lie translation iay on occasion be condentied into one-quarter of the time actually
occupied by the speech.
And he goos on to state:
About four-fifths of the delegates speak in
French, one-fifth in English. A brief experience at Geneva convinces me of the immense
value of a knowledge of French.
It was
inipressive to liear the delegates of all the
countries of continental Europe and of South
and Central Anerica as wvell as those of Persia,
Liberia. Albania and Abyssinia express them.
selves fluently in that language. Many of the
European and Amnerican delegates also spoke
English, some of them half a dozen languages.
The general debate was closed on the 16th
of September. Thon the committees began to
sit and work. There were two sittings every
day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. As a rule each delegate was a member
of two d'ifferent committees. A review of the
agendas of the six committees will give you
an idea of the activities of the League.
The first comnittee (for legal and constitutional questions), whose chairman was Professor Scialoja, had to deal with the Statute
of the Permanent Court of International
Justice; with the ratification of conventions
concluded under the auspices of the League of
Nations; with the amendment of the Covenant, or the pact whereby the League of
Nations had been created; and with the codification of international law.
The Permanent Court of International
Justice was constituted in 1921, in compliance
with Article 14 of the Covenant of 1919. That
Court sits in the city of the Hague, and all
lion.

Mr. CHAPAIS.

controverted questions and cases arising between different nations may ho heard and decided upon by that body. The benevolent
and pacifying influence of such an institution
has been asserted more than once, specifically
in litigations between France and England;
between England, France and Italy on one
side and Germany on the other; between
England and Greece; between Poland and
Czechoslovakia;
between
Germany
and
Poland; and so on. After ton years, in 1929,
it was felt that certain changes in the organization and composition of the Court were
desirable. These changes had been recommended by the Assembly at its session of
1929. But, some difficulties having arisen, the
îi'st committee, at the session of 1930, received instruction to study the question and
<ndeavour to find a solution. The result was
a report proposing the adoption of soen
amendments of the original statute. Under
these ameondments the number of judges ot
the Permanent Court of International Justice
sitting at the Hague, was increased from
leven to fifteen; the four deputy judges
were maintained; the salaries were raised tu
60,000 Dutch florins for the Chief Justice or
President of the Court and to 45,000 Dutch
florins for the others; and a system of pensions for the judges was enacted. The report
was adopted by the Assembly, which, later
on, had to proceed to the clection of the
judgcs; for such is the mode of appointing
the members of the high tribunal. They are
telected by the Council and Assembly, acting
separately. Any candidate who secures an
absolute majority in each body is elected.
The terni of office is nine years. In 1930
this term lapsed, and the election took place
on the 25th of Soptember. On the first
ballot fourteen judges out of the fifteen were
electcd. But it took twelve ballots to elect
the fifteenth.
The Permanent Court of
International Justice is now composed of
representatives of those different states:
France, Germany, England, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, China,
Poland, Rumania, San Salvador, Colombia,
Japan, Spain and Cuba. I have spoken at
some length of this great international
tribunal on account of its importance in the
wheelwork of the League.
The first committee consid'ered also the
question of ratification of the League conventions by the different states. A resolution
was unanimously approved, setting forth the
stops that might be taken to increase the
number of ratifications of treaties signed
under the auspices of the League. An amendment of the Covenant in order to bring it into

JUIN 8, 1931
harmony with the Briand-Kellogg pact was
di.scussed by the same committee. But no
doefinite solution could be adopted. As for
the codification of international law, it was
recommended that the Council invite the
governments to conmmunicate their observations in regard to future work.
The second commit tee went de-eply into
the study of ecoreomie policies. The questions of free trade, of protection, of preference, of ant-i-dumping measures, were freely
discussed. On somte points the opinions expresscd were widely divergent. The Canadian del.cgate, Dr. Ri.ddell, took a firm stand
and was instrumental in the framing of the
report.
The third co*mmittee had to deal specially
with the burning question* of the reduetion
of armaments. The rather non-committal
report which was presented to the Asse-mbly
was the occasion of a debate on which I shall
say more by and by.
The fourth comimittee had to discus the
budget of the Le-ague for the ye-ar 1931. That
budget might be suibddvided as follows:
Secreta-riat and spe-cial organization, 17,091,586
gold francs; International Labour Organizatiion, 8,661,652; Permanent Court of International Justice, 2,712,668; buildings at
Geneva, 2,170,822; pensions, 1,000,773; total,
31,637,501 gold francs. The share of Canada
in the contribution to, that budget of expenseis
is approxima.tely $205,000.
The Canadijan
delegates could proudly state that there were
no -arrears chargeable to our Dominion. Some
states members of the League could not say
as mucli.
The fifth ecommittee, presided. over by
Countess Apponyi, the wi-fe of the veteran
Hungarian statesman, made a thorough study
of the questions submitted to its considleratien. On the subjeet of penal administration
it recommended that a set of standard rules
prepared by the International Prison Commission, and indicating the minimum conditions that should be observed in tihe treatment of prisoners, should be su.bmitted to
aIl governments for their observation. On
child welfare enlightened views were expressed and the committee noted tihe progress
made in such questions as the protection and
educationof the blind child, and the aaixiliary
sevcsof juvenile courts. On the question
of traffie in women and ehildlren the committee was happy to note that, during the last
year, several countries had sibolished, or taken
new îsteps towards the a'bolitîion of, the system
of licensed houses. As for the traffic in opium,
the comxnittee devoted mueh of its time to
a consideration of two methods for dealing
with the problem, "A wider and stricter appli22112-23J

cation of the Hague and Geneva Convention,
and the limitation of manufacture by international agreeiment." One of the Canadian
delegates, the Hon. Irene Parlby, made an
interesting contribution to the discussion,
giving an account of some of tihe methods
employed in Canada to deal with the problein
of narcoties.
The sixth committee discussed at great
length the question of minorities. Marked
differences of opinion were notable. It was
stated that minority questions should neyer
be allowed to weaken the unity and integrity
of states; but, on the other hand, that they
may involve peace and should therefore most
vigilantly be taken care of by the League.
Sir Robert Borden stated "that the best
course is to afford to minorities every constitutional and reasonable right and at the same
time to impress upon them their duty to cooperate." The question of slavery was also,
debated. The creation of an international
slavery office, proposed by Lord Ceci, wari
not agreed to, and the committee adopted a
resolution to postpone until next year the
consideration of any change in the procedure
now in force.
As we have already stated, ail the reports
made by the vaýrious committees had to, be
submitted to the Assembly for final consideration . Some were the occasion of considerable
debate. The most interesting of these discussions was the one which was called forth
by the report of the third committee on the
question of disarmament., That report hiad
been carefully and cautiously drafted. But
it was well known that the question had been
hotly discussed in committee, and a lively
time might be expe'cted on that subjeet ini the
Assembly. A great many members, including
thoôse of the British delegation, were of the
opinion that France was not moving fast
enough towaTds disarmament, and by such

reluctance was impeding tihe work of general
pacification. On the other hand it could be
presumed that F-rance would have something
to say on that very critical subjeet. Thereport of the third commission was submitterl
on the 30th of September. As on a previous,
occasion, Sir Robert Borden was asked to open
that ominous debate. It was a great and
perilous honour. The first Canadian delegate,
I am proud to say, was equal to the occasion.
He spoke his mmnd with the most courageous
frankness. He said:
I would remind you once more of what has
been so often recalled to you, that it ie teai
years and more since the League of Nations
undertook what I conceive to he one of its
greatest tasks. It is my duty, also, to enquire
to what extent its efforts for disarmament have
been crowned with suceess. I recognize fully the
difficulties of governments. I was leader of a

and elsewhere, and I recognize the earnestness

of the efforts which have been made to carry

ont this purpose of the Covenant of the Leagne
of Nations. Nevertheless, I ask you, and I
think the worid is asking you to-day, w'hether
the result up to the present time bas been
comimensurate with the effort. The report
speaks of mutual confidence.
We have
renounced war, have ve not, by solemn engagement? To what end does the maintenance of
enormous armaments still continue?
Our
engagement was soleno and sincere, was it
not? Shall it not find expression in something
more enduring than words, something more
effective than what bas been proposed up to
the present?
And then, in deep and moving tones, Sir
Robert uttered these solemn words:
Gentlemen, J must say with ail respect that
in this regard the League of Nations stands
to-day at the bar of publie opinion.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hoar, hear.

Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: I cannot describe the
impression made on the Assembly by such
an utterance. A moment of profound silence
was followed by a storm of applause.
But, of course, there would be an answer,
and that answer would come from the French
degation. And now you could see Mr. Aristide
Briand walking slowly towards the tribune.
Whatever may b thought or said about that
political man, whatever estimate may be
made of his character and of some of his past
deeds, it must bc acknowledged that at Geneva
his fine oratorical gifts niake him a most
effective representative of his great country.
He began by saying that, of course, the presont
problem was one of the gravest that could
claim the League's attention. He expressed
the wish that he might be free to envisage it
from a purely moral standpoint, immune from
all feeling of responsibility. He added that
the Assenbly could not fail to realize that
there are some countries, less fortunatcly
situated in the world, whieh are compelled to
take notice of certain rumors that reach their
ears. If governments paid no heed, they would
be unworthy of their charge, unworthy to
have assumed such solemn responsibility. He
sala:
It is a representative of France who stands
before you, and you will allow him to express
himself in such a manner as to eave no

mnisunderstanding as to bis

attitude on this question. We French have
always said that Article 8 of the Covenant
ceonstitutes for all signatory countries a solemn
undertaking that must be kept. Under wbat

down in Article 8. nanely. that there must be

been:

This was the leitmotiv of all Mr. Briand's
wonderfui speech.
"Arbitration, Security,
Disarmament," such was the progression which
would have to be followed urgently in order
to reach the glorious goal so ardently longed
for. France had done her best to make arbitratien founded on mutual good-will the law of
all nations. Mr. Briand reminded his hearers
of what had been said and settled at Locarno.
He recalled the Briand-Kellogg pact for the
renunciation of war. France had strenuously
led the way in that direction and she had donc
more. She had disarmed as much as she
could.
J am here to say so, said he, for unfortunately
if the parties directly concerned do not plead
their own cause, they can hardly count on
others to do it for them. Before the war, in
1914, France liad a big and powerful arîny.
Here, the orator made a pause; then in a low
and thrilling voice he added:
Circumstances, alas! have compelled us to
mnake use of it.
And at thoe simple words uttered in tremulous tones, the audience felt something like
a shudder, as if the bloody picture of the
calamitous war had appeared on the wall,
recalling the dreadful havoc, the million and
a haif of young Frenchmen mowed down in
the flower of their youth, the wealthy and
industrious departments devastated, th.e beautiful towns and splendid monuments destroyed, the once fertile fields sown with the
mnurderos seed of deadly shells. It was the

went on. In 1914, the home and overseas
forces of France amounted to 810,000 men,
and the tern of military service was three
years. Sin.ce the war that term had been reduced succes-ively to two years, then to
twenty months, then to eighteen months, and
finally to one year. And the number of men
n the French armies had been reduced ta
556.000 men (including the air force). As a
matter of fact, France had disarmed in the
proportion of 41 per cent. But could she not
go further? Here Mr. Briand made a striking
point. A genoral election for the Reichstag
bad just taken place in Germany; the Nationalist Party, headed by Mr. Hitler, had been
frightfully succes-fnl.
During the campaign
Hitler and his lieutenants had made the most
ficry and menacing speeches, inflamed with
the spirit of revenge. And at the news of
the Nationalist Party's success, consternation
had reigned at 'Geneva among the members
of the League. Mr. Briand did not fail to
comment on these disquieting incidents.
Not long ago, said he, just when J was
uttering none but words of concord, words for

which J am sometimes bitterly blamed, words
of conciliation and co-operation--at that very

JULY 8, 1931
moment clamours from the polling-booths penetrated to ny ears, and cries of hatred and of
death were the response that reached me.
Mlust we ignore themi? Must we disregard such
occurrences?
And, turning his eyes toward the Canadian
delegation, he went on:
In such a case, I say, are not those who may
be threatened at some future date entitled to
reflect, and in a gathering such as this, have
they not a right to turn to the nations with
nothing to fear, who live in a state of blissful
well-being remote from danger, and to say to
then: "We are brothers, all of us here in this
Assenbly.
Leave your heights of security,
come down into the valley, come nearer, listen
to what is going on, and say if we are not
justified in showing caution"? I feel certain
that in their innost hearts, after a careful
study of the events to which I have just
referred, they will be the first to say: "Yes,
the doctrine of the League, based on arbitration, security and disarmament, is the true
doctrine, the most sure and sound. the only
one that a country worthy of the name should
ever consider." But it might be said: "Can
nothing more be done?" Yes, the nations must
concert their efforts, after achieving such conditions of security that there shall be neither
dupes nor victims.
That great speech of Mr. Briand seemed
to have cleared the atmosphere. The report
of the third commission was adopted nemine

contradicente.

And it was decided later on

that a great conference of the powers, on
disarmament, should be held in 1932. May I
say that the Canadian delegation were much
elated at the fact that their chief had taken
such an important lead in that momentous
debate.

I beg the forgiveness of my colleagues for
having detained then so long. I have tried
to give this House an idea of the work that

is being done at Geneva and of the ways of
doing it. Now. one may ask, as it bas been
asked often, and as it will be repeatedly asked
again, what shall be the result of all that, of
all those meetings, of all this committee work,
of al those debates, of all that machinery, of
all that expense? I will not pretend to give
an adequate answer. On that subject I am
neither optimist nor pessimist. I should not
feel inclined to affirm that the League of
Nations can boast, aýt the present moment.
of decisive achievements. But I would demur
to admit that she has no achievement to be

credited with. She has not yet made future
wars impossible. She has not yet freed the
nations of the crushing burden of armaments.
She has not suppressed national prejudices nor
national ambitions. She has not established
universal security and universal harmony. But
she has prevented dangerous conflicts; namely,
between Italy and Greece, between Poland
and Lithuania, between Finland and Sweden,
between Germany and Poland, between Great

Britain and Turkey, etc. etc.

She has set up

that great judicial tribunal, the Permanent
Cou-rt of International Justice.

She has given

birth to that other important body, the In,temational Labour Organization. She has
instituted useful international organisms to
fight slavery, the dope disease, the white
slave trade; to promote health and hygiene;
to facilitate transit and transportation, etc.
etc. And over a'1l she has created an international spirit which can do much to solve
the great problems of the day. Would it be
possible that such mutual and friendly intercourse between political leaders, between influential statesmen coming from all points of
the world, debating questions. exchanging
ideas around the committee table, learning
and studying one another's viewpoint, meeting
daily during a succession of weeks in social
amenities-would it be possible that all that
should not enlighten those leaders, should
not broaden their minds, should not foster
better understanding. should not be conducive
to more active good-will, should not, in a
word, pave the way towards that blessed
hour when war would be an obsolete word,
meaning solely tie hateful remembrance of
tragie ages?
Would that be only a happy dream'? That
may be. But, at all events. the international
effort of which Geneva has been the scene
for the past ten years is not a cont'mpîtible
attempt, and it deserves the sympathv of all
the true friends of peace and of humankind.
Hon. RAOULT DANDURAND: Honourable members of the Senate, I should like to
be permitted to congratulate my honourable
friend on the splendid picture that he has
given us of the last Assembly of the League of
Nations. I must say that I was elated when,
in August of last year, I learned that Sir
Robert Borden and our talented colleague
were to bo the chief delegates of Canada to
the League. I wrote to then wishing them
success, and I remember saying to Sir
Robert that it was fitting that he, having
obtained for the Dominions the right to sit
in Council, by his gallant struggle in Paris in
1919, when the Covenant was being put into
shape, should live his own dream, even if it
were only in the last days of the three years
during which we had a seat in the Council of
the League.
Sir Robert Borden had succeeded in winning
recognition for the principle that the Dominions had the right to a seat in Council, and
I was most happy to find that he would be
there, even as our terni was about to end,
to see the Council in action and to participate
in its deliberations. He had full experience

SENATE
and knowledge of the difficulties that surrounded European problems; and by his
side sat a noted Canadian historian, the
honourable senator from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Cha!pais), a gentleman with considerable
insight in international affairs. For years
our friend wrote a monthly review of the
situation in Europe, which I made it my duty
to read and to ponder over. Our honourable
friend knew very well, from afar, and had
been able to give a proper perspective to, the
problems that he would have to study in
Geneva. Honourable gentlemen can judge for
themselves as to the brilliancy of our delegation and the success that it met in Geneva
at the last Assembly.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Surely someone will continue this great debate. It would
be a pity to let it fall flat. There must be
shades to all good pictures. Let us have the
shades to this one.
Now for the bouquets for the honourable
senator for Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais).
He is a past master in the art of oratory.
I was watching him to see whether he would
tell us what the chief of the Canadian delegation, Sir Robert Borden, said, namely,
that when he went back to Geneva after an
interval of ten years he inquired, "What have
you done for disarmament?"
Sir Robert
said, "The League of Nations is to-day at the
bar of publie opinion," and I admire him for
saying that. It is absolutely true. I have
no hostility towards the League of Nations;
on the contrary, I have the kindest wishes.
But the whole thing is a dream, a beautiful
dream. So long as human beings exist there
will br fighting. When there were only two
men on earth one had to kill the other.
Wh'v not face the fact, and come down from
the clouds? I often have referred in this
Chamber to the wonderful vork by l'Abbé
Saint-Pierre, consisting of twenty volumes.
He advocated a Union of Christian Princes
and the abolition of war. His plan provided
that if a war occurred in one kingdom the
armies of the other kingdoms would soon
put an end to the fighting. And that proposed Union was superior te the League,
because the League has no army and no
police. If it is a good plan for the countries
of the world to abolish their armies and
navies, wby should not the cities of the world
do away with police forces, and let public
opinion be in control?
I do not want to be critical at all. Many
people get a pleasant trip te Geneva, and
they are always willing te go back there
again if they are asked.
My honourable
friend gave such a fine description of the
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

friend also referred to the very able transla-tors, of whom I think there are some five
hundred at Geneva. Well, they have been
there more than ton years, but they have net
yet translated these thrce words, "frais de
représentation." If any honourable members
present can translate them I should be glad te
hear their version. As I have stated several
times in this House, the words represent
money for night suppers, champagne and a
good Lime. Sir Erie Drummond receives a
colossal salary, and in addition he gets almost an equal amount for frais de représentation, so that he can give many people a
good time.
I suppose all honourable members are aware
that in the last ten years Canada has made
an annual contribution of approximately
S200,000 to the League of Nations. Out of
that sum about $80.000 is given to Mr. Albert
Thomas and his Labour Organization, and no
accounting is required. Why is he given that

time the Bolsheviks started their revolution
was running bareheaded through the streets of
St. Petersburg. France apparently thought
that it would be a good thing te send a
Communist to the Communists. He went
and told Mr. Maurice Paléologue, the French
Ambassador at St. Petersburg, a most distinguished man, that the French Government
was going to replace him.

RELATIONS OF SENATOR WITH
DOMINION GOVERNMENT
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE
On the notice of motion:
By the Honourable Senator Pope:
members
That a special committee of
of the Senate be appointed to enquire into and
report ipon the matters mentioned by the Hon.
N. A. Belcourt at the sitting of the Senate on
June 16, 1931, and appearing in the Debates
of the Senate of that date, in regard to the
purchase by a department of the Government
of copies of the publication "Canada," and also

JULY 8, 1931
to consider and report upon the association of
the said Hon. N. A. Belcourt in the said
matters and what action, if any, should be
taken by the Senate in regard thereto.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON:
Honourable
senators, I was absent from the House on
Monday evening when the honourable leader
on the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
produced some papers for which I asked.
Among them was a letter that had been
written by the publishers of the newspaper
Canada to the senior senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt), but no reference was
made to the re;ply, if any, that was sent to
that letter. Now, I think that in fairnees to
the senior senator from Ottawa the reply
should be produced, and I shou'ld like to ask
the honourable leader on the other side if he
will have it placed on Hansard. I think it is
obvious why this should be done. The letter
that has been placed on record contains, in
my opinion, an improper proposal, and in all
probability the reply made by the senior
senator from Ottawa would show that this
was not the proposal he had accepted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand
that my honourable friend is now asking for
further information before the motion is
moved?
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
on Monday evening, the 6th, inquiries were
made by the honourable gentleman from Pietou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) and the honourable
(Hon. Mr.
gentleman from Saskatehewan
Gillis). These inquiries appear on page 312
of Hansard, and I have answers to them,
which I shall read. These answers may give
the information desired by my honourable
friend from Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon).
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Has my honourable
friend the reply that was made to the letter
of the Sth of April, 1927?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall give my
honourable friend the answers that I have
here, and they may satisfy him. The questions asked by the honourable gentleman from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) were as follows:
Will the honourable leader tell us who signed
the contract?
Did Senator Belcourt sign the contract for
his principals?
I am interested only because of the suggestion of my honourable friend here (Hon.
I am wondering whether
Smeaton White).
Senator Belcourt appears to be the principal

my honourable friend has read.
Are we to understand that he concluded the
contract with the Government-that he signed
some document?
I think we ought to have the contract, or the
correspondence.

359

The answer to the question, "Did Senator
Belcourt sign the contract for his principals?"
is no. The agreement with the department
consisted of a letter from the head of the department agreeing to take 2,200 copies of the
paper monthly for one year. The agreement
was the resuit of an application made and
addressed by the company to the Publicity
Branch long before the senior member for
Ottawa was offered a fee to carry on negotiations; that is, before he had anything whatever to do with the application. Before the
senator had anything to do with the matter
the company had been promised by several
of the departments orders, for which the company had presriously applied, for a substantial
number of copies.
The letter of acceptance by the department
is dated the 9th of December, 1927, and reads
as follows:
My dear Senator Belcourt;
Knowing that you have been acting for Mr.
Lefroy. I wish to pass on the decision of the
Advertising Committee arrived at yesterday
afternoon with regard to the publication
"Canada." After going very carefully over all
the merits of the magazine when placed in the
reading rooms, and taking into consideration
the amount of money that the various departments had to spend, it was felt that approximately $20,000 was the most that we could
justify for this one periodical.
It was therefore decided that:
Copies
Immigration should subscribe for.. 1,000
600
Trade and Commerce for.. .. ..
300
Agriculture for.. ...........
300
Interior for.. ............
making a total of 2,200 copies at $9 per copy,
amounting to $19,800.
Mr. Lefroy's original proposition was that
if the Government of Canada would subscribe
for 3,000 copies, he would place 6,000 in the
reading rooms of England, taking care of the
other 3,000 himself. In other words my impression was that he would sell them to subscribers,
or otherwise provide for their payment.
During conversation with Mr. Lefroy recently
he informed me tiat he proposed to ask the
assistance of the Provincial Governments in the
sale of his subscriptions, which in my opinion
is quite out of line with his original proposition.
However, after reviewing all these facts, we
decided that for this year we would subscribe
the amount mentioned from the various departments mentioned, in consideration of which we
expect Mr. Lefroy will place in the reading
rooms of Britain the number of copies which
we actually subscribed for. and an additional
number of copies equal to the amount which we
subscribed- for. This decision was agreed upon
unanimously by the members of the Advertising
Committee, and Mr. Chisholm took a note of
the same.
There was at no time any formal or other
agreement or contract with the department.
The senior member for Ottawa did not at any
time sign any contract or agreement for, on

Hon. Mr. LAI-RD: Whose answer is it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It cornes fromn
the honourable the senior member for
Ottawa. The senior member for Ottawa was
paid no money, direcýthy or indirectiy, by any
departiment of the Government for himself
or his client. Ail the moncys payable u" der

or bis firmn neyer received a cent of that
mnoney. Tbey have nover claimed a cent
of it; tbey have ail aiong recognized that
these nioneys whoily and exciusivoiy bolonged
to the conipany. The only thing they claimed,
and for which tbey have rocovered judgment,
is the payment of the fee offered by the company, to be paid by the company, out of the
company's own fonds; and ever and above
anil quite outsidc of any money which the
company had or conid or would receive fromn
the dcpartrnent.
The fee in question in no case, in no event
and in no part couid ho clainied frorn or paid
bY any) department of the Government--not
one cent of it.
The departmnent was not in any degree
concerned or interested in the amount or the
paymcinnt of the fee. It had not and neyer
bad or could have any intere.st whatever in
s'ucb fee.
The oniy mone ' paid on accotint of this
fee was paid by the newspaper company in
the ainount of S1,000 received by' the companv's choque on the l2th of February,
1,928. and at once credited to the 11cm of
Bleiourt. Ledue & Genest and deposited to
their credit with their own bank in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The honourable gentleman bas flot gis on us wbat I shouid like
to bave. It is asaid that a contract exjstcd
between Senatai' Beicourt and the publishing
eonipany, and that it is expressed in cor'he
respondence. Now. we have 1 letter stating
the proposai of the company, and I think,
ibat if Senator I3elcoîîrt sent a proper repiy
to that letter ho shouid ho cieared from the
implication under wbich ho now rests. My
idea is that in repiy' to that lette,' the senator
should have written stating that it wouid
1)0 illegai and imipreper for himi to accept a
commissionlion. Mr'. DANDUHAND: Why does my
lionouriable fiiend use the word "commission"
when the letter speaks of a fec?
Hon. Mir. GORDON: Just a minute. But
he could have added words to this effeet:
"I bes-ee il is ethi('ai and lega] for me to
'rccept a fee for legai advice to you and for
the drafting of the contract?"
Mr. Lefroy
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND:
apparently had been bore and in touch with
the s ariens departments, or bad engaged in
correspondenre seeking- a continuation of an
oid contract. Ho was not able to bave the
contraet rcnewed as quickly as ho had hoped.

JULY 8, 1931
If he dîd corne here, he seemingly was unabre
to remain until the matter was brought to a
finish; so he retained an attorney or agent.
He wrote to the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Beloourt), as a member of a firm,
exp1aining what he wanted and asking if he
would follow the matter up. Hie pointed out
that he would pay a fee of $5,000, or £1,0O0.
The senator accepted the offer to act for the
newspaper company. I arn not going Vo
split hairs on the question whether ho replied
for himself alone or on behaîf of his firm.
Correspondence with the clients and correspondence with the department continued
for months. He sued for the fee, and ho
recovered judgment.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then do I understand
from my honourable friend that the contract
does flot consist of this letter and the reply
to it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Undoubteffly
there must have been an answer acknowledging
the offer and accepting the mandate, inasmuch
as the mandate was carried out to the end,
and upon that correspondence the court has
since had to reach a decision.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The court expressed
the view that the contract was contained in
the correspondence, and 1 think it is unfair
Vo the honoura-ble the senior meember for
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Beîcourt) not Vo prodiice
that letter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In effeet the
reply was an acceptance of the offer, since the
mandate was carried out. An action was taken
for work performed, and judgment was given.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Are we Vo assume that
the reply Vo this was: 'I shall endeavour Vo
get this contract"? I think that would.place
the honourable member in a bad light.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That was a
question for the judge Vo consider, and after
considering it he rendered judgment in favour
of the plaintiff.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: In my opinion it is
also a question for the Senate Vo, consider.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
fricnd would sit in appeal on the judgsnent of
that court.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Will the honourabie member make his motion?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Honourable members, I
amn disappointed at the so-called amendiment
that I presume is Vo be proposed, if I miy
judge from the speech delivered the other day
by the leader of the Opposition.

361

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As my honourable friend probably desires me Vo follow him,
I would ask him either Vo speak loud enough
for me Vo hear him or else Vo come nearer. We
are of about the same age, and when I speak
my honourabie friend caa hear me. 1 should.
like to be able Vo hear him.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I wish I had a horn Vo,
blow through. I don't mean a brass horun; I
mean another kind of horn.
1 said Vhat 1 was surprised and disappointed
that Vhe simple motion appearing on the
Order Paper, which I amn about Vo move, was
not acceptable Vo the honourable the leader
of the other side of the flouse. 1 have asked,
I ask now, and shall ask again, that a committee of members of botýh sides of this flouse
-seven, if you like-he selected by the two
leaders; that it should, behind closed duors,
consider Vhe position taken on the floor of
this House by Vhe senior member for Ottawa,
instead of having the matter aired throughout
the 'length and breadth of Canada; and that
this committee should pass judgment, according Vo its ability, in order that we may avoid
some of Vhese difficulties in the future, and
may maintain the honour and integrity of this
honourable Hlouse. Instead of that being done,
I was notified-not by being shown the amendment; I have noV seen it yct-I was notified
by the honourable member for De Salaberry
(Hlon. Mr. Béique) that he had an amendment, and I assumed that the long oration or
recitation delivered the other day hy the
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was
prepared for this occasion. I assumed that
because he said he had an ameudment. What
is our purpose? Some people say that it ie Vo
whitewash the senior member for Ottawa instead of giving senious, careful and kindly
consideration Vo the position that he occupies.
So far as I amn coacerned, I will join in no
proposal to whitewash. I do noV know what
lhe ameudment is, but if it is of that character I Nvish Vo dissociate myself.from it. The
honourable gentleman opposite, and those surrounding him, will have Vo assume the whole
responsibility, so, far as the Sonate of Canada
is concerned, for any proposal Vo apply the
whitewash brush.
IV is noV necessary for me Vo go further.
I do noV want Vo charge anybody with being
guilty of any offence, and I refuse Vo, do so.
That is noV my duty. IV is a question for a
committee. For that reason I should like Vo
sec my motion passed. I should be very
pleased if the honourable gentleman would
accept this motion of mine that a cornmittee meet behind closed doors Vo consider
this question, adjudicate upon it and report

SENATE
back to us. This, to my mind, would be much
better than airing the matter throughout the
length and breadth of the country.
I beg to move the motion that stands in
my namie, which is as follows:
That a special committee of

members

of the Senate be appointed to enquire into and
report upon the matters mentioned by the Hon.
N. A. Belcourt at the sitting of the Senate on
June 16, 1931, and appearing in the Debates
of the Senate of that date, in regard to the
purchase by a department of the Government
of copies of the publication "Canada," and also
to consider and report upon the association of
the said Hon. N. A. Belcourt in the said
niatters and what action, if any, should be
taken by the Senate in regard thereto.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Do the words "closed
doors" appear in the motion?
Hon. Mr. POPE: No. They are not necessary. The matter has already been opened by
honourable gentlemen on the other side of
the House.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Then why mention
that, and try to got behind it?
Hon. Mr. POPE: I am not trying to get
behind anything. I am in earnest. I do not
have to be angry when I am in earnest. I am
in carnest when I talk of the integrity of this
House. The integrity of this House is sometling that has come down to us from the men
wxho went before, and that will pass on to
those who come after us.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable members, a week or two ago, when this question
was raised in the Senate, both the leader of
the Government in this House and the leader
on this side agreed that, as the matter was
before the courts, any discussion of it in the
Sonate should be deferred. I then personally
joined in that opinion, and I still think it
would have been the proper course to follow.
J fail to understand the reason and per,isten(y of the repeated attacks which are
being made against the honourable the senior
meinber for Ottawa when the matter is thus
before th,- courts. It seems to show a desire
to affect the standing of one of our colleagues,
and. in a measure, Ihat of the whole House.
My mind is entirely open as to the advisability of enacting a rule under which any
member of the Senate would in the future be
debarred from the right of receiving any
remuneration from a client for services rendered to him in dealing with the Government or any of its departments. A rule of
that kind would tend to elevate the standing
of the Senate and of its members; but such
a ruile would constitute an entirely new departure.
Hon.

Mr. POPE.

* The question is whether the honourable the
senior member for Ottawa bas done anything
in violation of section 21, subsection 1, of the
Independence of Parliament Act, which reads
as follows:
No person, who is a member of the Senate,
shall directly or indirectly, knowingly and
wilfully be a party to or be concerned in any
contract under which the public money of
Canada is to be paid.
The contract which has given rise to this
debate was a 'contract between the Canada
Company, a company carrying on its business of publicity in England, and several departments of the Canadian Government. The
contract has been in operation for a number
of years. Early in the year 1927 negotiations between the Canada Company and departments of the Dominion Government were
in progress, as appears by the letters printed
on page 312 of the Debates of the Senate.
On the Sth of April, 1927, the Canada Company wrote to the honourable the senior
member for Ottawa:
The fee we could offer for the completion of
the negotiations will be five thousand ($5,000),
which we will pay within one nonth of our
receipt of the official authorization.
And again on the 4th of July following:
As previously mentioned to you in my letter
of April 8th, the fee agreed on-$5,000-will
be paid to you as promised by that letter
within one mîonth from the receipt by me of
the official contracts from Government departments for three years.
Of course I look to you to get the official
contracts froin the several departmîents naking
up the mininun of 3,000 copies per annum,
whici nîumber includes

already

By this letter the honourable the senior
mienber for Ottawa was requested to act as
agent of the Canada Company and follow up
its pending negotiations with the departments
cf the Dominion Government.
To act as agent or solicitor of any person
dealing with the Government, or any of its
departments, or secure for a client or principal a contract from the Government or any
of its departments, is clearly not being a
party to, or being directly or indirectly conccrned personally in, such contract.
The question is so simple that it is hardly
arguable. Let us suppose a contract negotiatocd by an agent on behalf of his principal
with any other party on condition that if
successful he will be paid by bis principal an
amîount agreed upon. The negotiations are
carried on, the contract is signed by both
parties, and the amount agreed upon between
the agent and his principal is paid by the
latter out of his own money and before recciving a cent out of the contract. Would

JULY 8,1931
it be pretended that the agent was con'cerned
or interested in the contract, in the sense of
section 21, subsection 1, of the Independence
of Parliament Act? Evidently 'not. For my
part, I can see no difference between a case of
th&t kind and the case concernîng the honourable the senior member for Ottawa.
.
I would cali the attention of honourable
members to the fact Vhat the purpose and
effect of the motion of the honourable member for Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) is to
place the honourable the senior member for
Ottawa on trial before the Senate. For my
part, 1 do not think there are any reasons
for doing so, and I propose to move in
ameadment to the motion:
That ail the words following the words
"report upon" in the second line of the said
motion be struck out and be replaced by the
following:
-the advisability of a rule being adopted by
the Senate defining the nature and extent of
the relations which a member of this House,
whether a member of the Bar or not, may have
with the Dominion Goveroment or any of its
departments, and, if deemed advisable, to, prepare such rule.
This is seconded by the right honourable
member for Eganville (Riglit Hon. Mvr.
Graham).
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Before we proceed
further I should like to ask a question. The
honourable gentleman who has moved t-his
amendrnent based the first portion of his
argument upon the statement that an appeal
had been entered in this case. I have been
informed, on what I believe to be the very
best authority, that no appeal has been
entered. I should like to ask the honourable gentleman if he has any evidence to
bear out hîs statement that, as a matter of
fiact, an appeal has been entered.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I did not refer to
any appeal having been entered. I do not
know.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The honourable gentleman raised the point that, as the case was
before the courts, it should not be discussed.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable the
senior memnber from Ottawa stated in the
Senate that an appeal had been taken. I
know that a judgment was entered in his
favour. We had his statement that there was
an appeal from that judgment. I said that
in my opinion the proper course would have
been to await the decision of the court; but,
as the matter has been pressed by an honourable member of this House, I have to express
my opinion on it.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It is just as well for us
to understand the situation. An important
argument lias been based on the ground that

this matter should not receive consideration
at the hands of this Chamber be-cause it is
sub judice, by reason of an appeal hiaving
been entered. As I understand the honourable gentleman, all that he has to show that
an appeal lias been entered is the statement
of the honourable the senior member for
Ottawa. I have heard that statement absolutely contradioted, and I do not think this
Hou se should further consîder the question
whether the matter is suli judice or not, until
somne credible evidence is given to show that
an appeal bas been entered. Till then that
part of the argument should be withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is always logical enough, and he
should understand that if there is no appeal
the .iudgment stands. Therefore the argument is just as strong that the Senate cannot sit in appeal on a judgment of the
Supreme Court of Ontý'ario.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: T-hen, why the argument that the matter is under appeal?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because there is
the fuvther argument that it is stili before
the eourts. 1 have thle officiai statement of
the plaintiff-who must know something about
it-that the case lias been apipealed.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: T-hat ie ahsolutely contradicted.
Han. Mr. BEIQUE: The hon ourable the
leadcr of the Governmient in this Hause
8tated, and tlie sta-temenit was corroborated,
by the leader on this oide, that there had been
a judgment, tliat there was an appeal, and
that the matter was bedore tbe court, and
they boffi extpressed the opinion that under
the cirdumustances the matter should rest until
judgment was given.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: We have becei toid that
an appea] bas been entered in this case and
that therefore we sliould net do anything
further until a decision lias been rendered.
Now, I am informed -that no appeal lias be.en
entered. Thýat fact lias -no bearing on the
n.-erits of the case, but it does affect the
argument that we sliauld nlot proceed to consider the question because it is suli judice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Has my honourable friend been informed by attorneys in
the case that no appeal lias been entered?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: My statement is 'founded
1upon as good authority as that upon which
my honourable friend relies.
Honl. Mr. DANDURAND: My authonity
is oe cd the pla.intifis iu the case, tlie senior
senator for Ottawa, and as a meniber of this
Chamber lie stands behind his statement. I

As I have 'already said, if

but since thore is an apypeal the plaintiff must
run whatever risk-s are invoixred. Shouid the

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Does it say so?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes.
His Lrndship: I am desirous of saying, Mr.
Biggar. Iaving that duty, and feeling yourself
compelled to exonerate yourself in that regard,
that you have done it very nicely, and very
kindly, and with very nice regard to everybody
concerned.
Mr. Biggar: It was only for that reason I
did it.
His Lordship: When it comes to me I have
got to face t. I cannot deal with it in a sort
of gentle way at all. If it is the law I have
to enforce.
I think that is plain English: "If it is the law
I have to enforce."
Mr. Biggar: I thought it would be improper
for me to allow your Lordship to dispose of the
case without knowing of the existence of that.
His Lordship: I think you are quite right
and I think you have brought it to my attention
in as professional and generous a way to all
concerned as you could possibly have done.
Then Mr. Fripp, who acted for the firn of
Belcourt, Leduc & Genest, said:
Mr. Fripp: If I find authorities may I submit
them to your Lordship within a day or two?
Bis Lordship: No, you need not.
Mr. Fripp:
It has taken me a little by
surprise.
His Lordship:
It bas not taken me by
surprise. I had it in mind.
Later his Lordship rendered judgment, in
which he said:
None of the statutory defences raised work
a defence for the defendants.
And he granted judgment for the plaintif.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

I understand that.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would further
draw my honourable friend's attention to the
opinion of Mr. Aimé GeoffrionHon. Mr. MeMEANS:
before.

We have heard that

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, but surely
my honourable friend will have the modesty
to accept that opinion, in view of Mr. Geoffrion's standing as a barrister.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I think my honourable friend should not make such a statement
as that. Mr. Geoffrion has a high reputation
throughout this country, but there are many
other eminent counsel, as able as my honourable friend, who will differ with the opinion
that has beet cited here. I maintain that the
Independence of Parliament Act is not affected
by the judgment of the trial court, and that
it will not be affected by any decision the
Appellate Division may render. I know that
my honourable friend is a very specious
pleader. He has been a senator for a great
number of years, and as a special pleader in
this House he perhaps has no equal.

365

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is very
kind.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He knows how to
twist and turn so that he can confuse most
of us. I say that the Independence of Parliament Act is not affected by the judgment in
this case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I set against
the opinion of my honourable friend the
opinions of Mr. Justice McEvoy, Mr. Geoffrion
and other leading members of the Bar.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If the discussion is
going to continue along this line, J think we
should get the opinion of other eminent
lawyers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think the
Senate will be content with the judgment of
one of the courts of the land. That ranks
above the opinions of counsel, but of course
members of the Bar have the right to say
what they think. Here is the statement of
Mr. Aimé Geoffrion:
Apart from the issue of fact which was
directly raised by the defendant, the question
of the possible nullity of that contract as
being against publie policy was suggested to
the Court by the attorney for the defence,That is clear. I have cited the discussion
between the judge and Mr. Biggar.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: That is what I
said, that it w'as a question whether the contract was against public policy. The Independence of Parliament Act does not affect
it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He goes on:
-although the point was not directly raised by
the defendant himself. The Judge therefore
considered it, and, cf necessity, decided in
favour of the validity of the contract, since
the action was maintained, and, under a well
settled rule of the law, if the fact of the contract being against public policy had been
apparent on the record, the action should have
been dismissed whether the point was raised or
not.
It is not necessary to plead a statute.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Let me correct the
honourable gentleman. There is no statute
required in regard to publie policy; that
comes under the common law of the land. I
do not want to go into a further discussion,
but I maintain that if the contract is void
it is void on the ground of being against
public policy and not because of any provisions of the Independence of Parliament
Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the honourable
gentleman will admit that the judge has
given judgment contrary to that opinion.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GORDON: In view of the letter
which was written by the plaintiffs in the
case, I ar n ot at ail surprised at the pussyfooting which was done on their behaif before
the court, with regard te the question of the
Independence of Parliament Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like
my hionourable friend te say who in bis
opinion bias donc any pussyfooting, because
the bonotîr of members of the Sonate may ho
affected.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: May I kindly
eall the attention of honourable senators te
the desirability-unless it is the wish of the
Sonate that ail the rules ho set aside-of
proceeding according te the rules of debate?
Sornu iln.

SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. WILLiOUGHBY: Honourable
senators, I should like te restate the reason
why this inquiry bas been brought hefore this
honourable body. The question is whetber it
is compatible with the dignity of thýis House
and the independence of honourable members
for a senator te procure personal advantage
through a contract with the Government. I
arn spoaking reluctantly, for I have and
always have had the kindest feelings towards
the senior senator for Ottawa. 1 have ne
desire te bring him or any other member of
the Sonate into disrepute. On the contrary,
I would rather ho the champion of the
actions of an honourable member, as my
honourahie
friend
opposite
(Hon.
Mr.
Dandurand) is in tbis case.
I think we should ho do.ing a disservice te
the senior senator from Ottaýwa and ail
bonourable members who support bis views
in the matter, if we pasied this amendment.
Are we net willing te trust the honour of a
sonator te a cemmittee of the bouse? 1
should ho ashamed te sit bore if I tbought we
could net, refer a matter of this kind with
implicit confidence te a committee of our
colleagues because of fear that they might indulge in head-bunting. I arn anxious te have
the bonour of Senator Belpourt vindicated.
The question is net necessarily confined within the limits of the Independence of Parliament Act. It is whetber the senior member
for Ottn.a, who bas for a long time heen
one of the most outstanding members of the
Sonate, did or did net take advantage of bis
position te obtain personal advantage througb
a contract made with the Government. 1 do
net accuse him of baving done se; I arn
siniply indicating the kind of inquiry the
comimittee woul1d have teo make.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
court inquired into that?

Has net the

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I say it is net
within the jurisdiction of any court of law te
inquire into a question of the dignity of this
Huse.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think bonourable momibors opposite are doing a disservice
to the senior member for Ottawva in urginethat the inquiry ho net procecded witb bore.
If the arndment is carried I intend te witbdraw from the mattor, and shahl ask that the
wbole thing ho dropped. I bave implicit confidence that impartial justice xvill ho done
and that there xviii ho ne bead-bunting if the
inquiry i, referred te a, cornmittee.
Wbat
botter conclusion of the whole matter could
the senior member for Ott4wa, wish than a
tinding by a committee of this bouse that ho
h.id net aoted improperly?
Surely we know
that such a finding would ho made if
warr-anted.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have great respect
for the opinion of tbe bonouraible leader of
this House and I should like te ask him a
question. Is net the ohject of the motion
of the bonourahle member for Bedford (Hon.
Mr. Pope) te place the senior senater froin
Ottawa on trial? The motion asks that a
cornmitte ho appointed te, inquire
Senator J3eleourt's conduet. The honourahle
leader knows that a porson is net placed on
trial unlcss there is a prima facie case against
i, and the implication will ho that there is
a prima facie case in this instance, if we
adopt the motion.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Following the introduction of this Bill in the other Chamber.
there was a wave of protest from various
parts of the country on the ground that it
would no longer be possible to obtain certain
English, French and American magazines in
this country. I need not mention the names
of any publications, for all honourable members know the type to which I refer. I understand that the Prime Minister promised that
some magazines would be exempted from the
law. The prices of magazines that are not
exempted will, it is feared, become so high
that Canadians will not be able to purchase
them. Can the honourable gentleman tell us
anything about the exemptions?
I think my
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
honourable friend misunderstands the object
of this Bill. It concerns simply the Post

the company cannot hend to one of its shareholders, and it has been objected that persons who have bought shares of the company
by whioh they are employed have thereby
become sharehoiders and consequentiy cannot borrow from the company. The Bilh provides that a eompanymay make loans to its employees, to enable
or assist themn to purchase or erect dwehhing
houses for their own use, even ahthough such
ernphoyees are shareholders of the company;
and the company may take from such employees

NATURALIZATION BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNEY
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the
second reading of Bill 3, an Act to amend
the Naturalization Act.
He said: Honourable senators, naturalization bis have been before Parhiament for a
generation. The main difficulty has been to
define the nationality of a wife in certain circumstances. The Bill is intended not oniy
to clarify the present law, but also to gîve
to married women in certain instances some
privileges that are not now obtainabie. The
amendment to subsection 3 of section 13 of
the Act provides that where a man ceases to
be a British subject lis wife shahl remain a
British subject i.miess she aiso acquires the
new nationality of hier husband. There was

a case where a woman was without any legal
nationality at ail for some time.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: May I ask my honourable friend how a man can cease to be
a British subi eci if hie does not become the
subject of anot-her nation?
He has to
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
become the subjeet of another nation.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Then why would his
wife not become the subject of that other
nation?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Under ordinary circumstanýces the wife would acquire the
same nationality as her husband.
As an interesting ceremony is scheduled to
take place in this Chamber within a few
minutes, I move the adjournment of the
debate.
The motion was ag-,reed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

SENATE

PORTRAIT OF SENATOR DANDURAND
PRESENTATION TO THE DOMINION GOVERNMENT
FOR
TRANSMISSION
TO
THE
LEAGUE OF NATIONS.

Following is a report of the speeches
delivered in the Senate Chamber after the
adjournment of the Senate on Wednesday,
July 8, 1931, on the occasion of the presentation of a portrait of Hon. Senator Dandurand
to the Dominion Government for transmission
to the League of Nations.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members of both Houses of Parliament, we
are honoured to-day by the presence of the
Prime Minister of Canada (Right Hon. Mr.
Bennett) and the late Prime Minister of
Canada (Right Hon. Mr. King), who have
be-en good enough to come here, together with
many other members of the other House, to
participate in the presentation of a portrait
of Senator Dandurand to the Government, by
his friends, and on behalf of this Chamber.
This portrait has been painted by a very
eminent French artist, and is to bo hung at
the headquarters of the League of Nations in
Geneva.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Mr.
Prime Minister, Right Hon. Mr. King, and
gentlemen, I amn glad to sec yon in the Senate
at last; but I ain not nearly so glad to sec
you hre as man- of you would bo to come
here to remain a little longer.
Right Hon. Mr. BENNETT:

Not yet.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I consider it
a great honour to be permitted to say a few
words at this time. Senator Dandurand has
represented Canada in a most remarkable way.
Had it not been for the fact that he was able
to speak both English and French, he never
would have occupied the position that he did.
He went to the League of Nations on the run
--he goes everywhere on the run-for he is
a mnan who never sits still, and who seldom
slackens his pace to a walk. He went to the
League of Nations at top speed, and right
up to the presidency of the Assembly, the
ighest position in the League. Then he becaine a nember of the Council. In aill this
he brought credit not only to himsielf, but to
the Dominion of Canada, and perhaps I may
say that no man bas donc more in that
direction than he has. But I cannot bo too
outspokon towards my deskmate; it is difficult
enough for us to get along together as it is.
One of my difficulties at the moment is this:
I sec before me a wonderful portrait of a
wonderful man, and I ans puzzled: I wonder
Honi.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

how they ever got him ta sit still for a
sufficient length of time to paint it.
Some
undue influence must have been used.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honourable
mnembers of the Senate, and our visitors, I
take great pleasure in seconding what the
Hon. Mr. Willoughby has said. It is an
honour to us all to bo able to hand to the
Governmient of Canada this portrait of the
man who so weli represented us among the
nations of the world, and who brought credit
to us ail.
I do not think I can say more. I believe in
the League of Nations, and I believe that
Senator Dandurand has faithfuilly and well
represented
the Canadian ideal at that
League.
Some Hon. MEMBERS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Mr. Prime Minister,
as you are aware, our comnmon friend, S-nator
Dandurand, has played a very important role
nt the League of Nations. He represented
Canada at the Assembly of 1924 and was
clected its President at the meeting of 1925.
His nunerous activities at the League were
of a veryv high order, of great credit to himseif, and of a nature to draw the special and
favourable attention of all other nations,
memnîbers of the League, to Canada, and to
place it in a very strong lig]ht.
At the request of some of his friends. a
portrait of the senator was made at that time
by a distinguished French artist, with a view
to its being prosented to the Dominion Government, to be passed on by it to the Ieague
of Nations.
I have been charged by the parties at whose
request the portrait was made, and by the
nuierous friends of Senator Dandurand in
the Senate, with the pleasant duty of offering that portrait to the Governimsent of Canada, so that it may be presented by the Governmient to the League of Nations, I have
now the great pleasure of discharging that
duty.
I an sure that the senator has in the House
of Commnons. as in the Sonate, a large nimber
of friends who, irrespective of political convictions, will be glad1 to associate themselves
with the presentation.
Some Hon. MEMBERS:

Hear, her

Right Hon. R. B. BENNETT
(Prime
Minister):
Honourable
members
of the
Senate, gentlemen of the House of Commons:
lu political life, with its acute differences and
antagonisms, its fierce strife, its passions and

JULY 8, 1931
prejudices, of which we are ail so fully aware,
it je fittÂng that now and then the amenities
of civil life should be observed. It is therefore a very great pleasure to me to be present
this evening to accept, on behalf of the Government of Canada, a portrait which has been
presented to the Government for transmission
to the League of Nations. I accept it on
behaif of the Government in order that it
may find a place in the gallery at Geneva,
there to remind future generations that early
in the life of the League of Nations Canada
gave to it a president.
Senator Dandurand is peculiarly qualified to
oecupy the position of President of the League
of Nations. Had hoe lived a couple of hundred ycars ago hie might have been a
Machiavýlli, or, possibly, in later yeare, hie
might have heen a Richelieu or one of the
other great statesmen of the past. He has
all -the qualities of heart and mind that would
have enabled him to become a great statesman of those days. Qualifled by education,
experience and training, hie gave to the office
of President of the League of Nations an
importance that was. I think, second to none
given to ýit by any other occupanit of that
great office. I might say thie--and I can
speak very dispassionately-tbat our place mn
the League of Nations was secured for us by
a Government of which the honourable gentleman was not a member, and the great traditions were maintained and carried on by the
Government of which he was a member. We
will strive to maintain worthily those traditions.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. BENNETT: May I add
that the position that this Dominion has occupied at the League of Nations is probably
little understood by the average Canadian.
Canada occupies, as my friend to my left
(Rigbt Hon. Mr. King) bas often remarked,
a truly great position in international affairs;
not by reason of ôur population, not because
of our size, not becatise of our rich material
resources, but because of the character of our
people and their origin. Here, living side by
side, are the descendants of great races, the
original pioneere of this country, represented
by those who settled upon the banke of the St.
Lawrence and their succeesors, and those who
settled upon the shores of Massachusette.
These two peoples have. been able to work
out, sometimes with some difficulty, sometimes witb slight misunderstandings, a barmonious civilization. Now and thon discordant notes are struck; but in the main it may
be said that by reason of the examplo that
22112-244

371

we have givon .to the world we have become
ail international factor of the first magnitude.
Thoroforo it is of the utmost importance that
we should mainstain wortbily our great traditions, such traditions as those which have been
to some extent created by the distinguished
gentleman whoso portrait bas been presonted
to-day, to find its permanent home at the
League of Nations.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, hear.
Right Bon. Mr. BENNETT: I congratulato Scnator Dandurand on the place that ho
has hoon able to make for himself, on the
position that hie has occupied, and on the
influence that bie has exercised. I trust that
hie bas beforo him many years of useful service
-not always in opposition to the causes that
I reprosent-and that in the fuiness of time
ho, will realizo that the strongtb of the influence hie bas exercised is found not wîthin
polit-ical parties, but rather outside of them.
I hope that in tbis great body to which he
bas rendered such distinguishod service he bas
found, in large measure, a fulfilment of the
dreame of bis youth-of which at turnes, in
happier days, he bas told me. H1e bas hecome
a real factor in world affaire, and by reason
of his qualifications bas reflected crodit and
distinction upon this Dominion, and upon thie
Senate, of wbich hie is so great an ornament.
On behalf of the Government I accopt this
portrait for transmission to the League of
Nations, knowing that future generations will
look upon bis kindly face and cee thero its
astuteness and that benevolence and courtesy
which are part and parcel of hie useful life.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, bear.
Right Hon, W. L. MACKENZIE KING:
Senator Willoughby, honourable membors of
the Senate, and membere of the House of
Commons, as the Prime Ministor bas just
saîd, it is indeed a ploasing interlude when
-thoso of us who belong to different political
parties and difforont Housos of Parliament
have tbe privilego of meeting togother even
for a few moments, and especially so when
the occasion is to do bonour to, one of their
numbor, and to emphasize theroby somne of
the things which are held in common, rathor
than the differences that divide us.
The Prime Minister bas accepted this portrait on behaîf of the Government of the
day. To those of us who were in office at
the time the portrait was first thought of,
it is a source of gratification that members
of both Goveramonts should have had soine
share in expressing in this way, flot only to
Senator Dandurand, but to the League of
Nations, the unanimity of feeling and admira-

SENATE
tion which, irrespective of political party, is
cherished towards our distinguished colleague
for the part he has played in world affairs.
Some Hon. MEMBERS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. KING: The Prime Minister has referred to certain personages in
history who have played important roles, any
one of which, he has been kind enough to
say, Senator Dandurand might have filled
had ho lived in their time. I am not going
te allude to anyone in particular, but I blieve it te be true that history. discloses that
the men who have donc most for civilization,
the real bencfactors of mankind, have been
the great conciliators-the men who have
been the means of bringing together in conmon accord peoples of different races, different classes and different nations, thereby
helping te avoid the great catastrophes that,
unfortunately, through failure in effort of the
kind, come too often in the history of the
world. I believe that in the roll of great
conciliators our friend Senator Dandurand's
name will at all times hold an honoured
place.
The large part which Senator Dandurand
has played in world affairs has been referred
to this afternoon; it is so well known that it
requires no further reference. May I say,
however, that, long before there was a League
of Nations, Senator Dandurand was devoting
his time and thought to the work of conciliatien, te the bringing together of the represyntatives of the popular assemiblies of different parts of the world, to the work of international arbitration, and to all that perlains to international amity and good-will.
If in the course of time, and with the change
of events, he caie te b the President of
the League of Nations-as high an honour,
I believe, as can come te any man in our
tume-it is due to the fact that he was
realizing in mature years the accomplishment
of those dreams and aspirations which were so
real te him in youth, and which, as all who
know him are aware, are of the very essence
of his life and of his purpose in public life.
In conclusion inay I say, Mr. Willoughby,
that while this presentation, no doubt, does
great honour to one who is a dear frienil
of all of us, a man who throughout our
country is admired by all, it is also a very
great honour to Canada that one of her distinguished citizens, as a former President of
the League of Nations, should be the first te
have his portrait hung in the halls of the
League. To all of us that makes of this
moment net only a pleasing but an historie
occasion.
We have the privilege of being
associated at this time in the recognition of
Right lon. Mr. MACKENZIE KING.

the services of one whose labours have been
recognized by the world at large, and whose
name will be cherished net only by his
fellow-citizens in Canada, but by all who
seek to further peace and good-will throughout the world.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, hear.
My
dear
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
colleagues, when I was asked te sit for this
portrait I respectfully demurred, because of
my instinctive reluctance te accept from my
friends any tangible expression of their goodwill and esteem, but I was told that I was
connected only incidentally with an event
which concerned the Dominion of Canada, and
which they wanted te perpetuate by the gift
of this painting to the League of Nations.
That event seemed te me of considerable
importance, because it emphasized before the
world the prescnce and the action of Canada
in the comity of nations. An interesting
incident, which may be worth noting, occurred
at the time of my election as President of the
Assenmbly of the League. It devolved upon
the then Prime Minister of France, Mr.
Painlevé, who was President of the Council
of the League, to preside at the opening of
the Assembly and to welcome the Presidentslect. In an official statement the year before,
he had declared his faith in the League of
Nations, but had added that ho wais not yet
reconciled to the possession by Great Britain
of six votes in the Assembly while France
lad but one. Still ho had to welcome the
representative of a Dominion that had one
of those six votes. Without alluding to his
state of mind I took occasion in my reply
to give him, twelve months in advance, the
formula containcd in the Balfour declaration
of 1926 establishing our equality of status as
a nation with the other Dominions and Great
Britain.
In the minds of many in GCneva, the clection of a Canadian to the presidency of the
Assemubly paved Canada's way to a seat in
the Council of the League. Sir Robert Borden,
in the face of considerable opposition, had
a-serted the right of Canada to a seat in the
Coencil and had obtained an official recognition of his claim by the Prime Ministers of
Great Britain and France, Messrs. Lloyd
George and Clémenceau, and by the President
of the United States, Mr. Woodrow Wilson. I
was quite elated when I received from the
Prime Minister, Mr. King, on the eve of the
opening of the Assembly, a despatch giving
the Canadian delegation authority te announce
Canada's candidature for the Council. There
were thrce seats vacant, but two of them were
earmarked for countries in South America and

373

JULY 8, 1931

Northern Europe, so that a number of nations
were competitors for the remaining one. Our
most formidable rival was that old and
classical country, Greece, represented by Mr.
Politis, an eminent jurist who was popular in
the Assembly. The vote was a close one, and
resulted in a victory for this young nation.
On the night of the election Mr. Politis inade
a comment which is perhaps worth repeating,
and I feel the more justified in quoting it
because it has been referred to by the right
"What
bonourable the Prime Minister.
chance," he said, "bas any country to succeed
against Canada, which appears at the League
under two particularly appealing aspects, one
British and the other French, and thus wins
the sympathy of those two vast worlds, the
Anglô-Saxon and the Latin? How can such
a combination be beaten?"
Although but accidentally in the picture,
I desire to thank the leaders of both Chambers for the kind words which they have
spoken, and all my colleagues who have
joined in this demonstration. And may I
be allowed to express my deep appreciation
to the Prime Minister, who bas consented,
in his capacity of Minister of Foreign Affairs
-I did not say "External Affairs"-to transmit this portrait officially to the League of
Nations.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Mr. Prime Minister, and honourable members of the Senate
and House of Commons, the committee in
charge of arrangements for this ceremony
wish to thank those who have kindly accepted
their invitation to attend. They especially
desire to express their appreciation to the
Prime Minister, who, notwithstanding the
burden he is carrying in these hectic days,
bas found time to be with us. They are
particularly grateful for his gracious acceptance, in the name of bis Government, of
Senator Dandurand's portrait, and for his
kind offer to present it to the League as a
tribute from Canada. And the committee
are not unmindful of the fact that nearly
two years ago, when the thought of presenting this portrait was conceived, their suggestions met with the approval and hearty
support of the then Prime Minister, the
Right Honourable Mr. Mackenzie King, to
whom they are greatly indebted.
Sincere thanks are also tendered to all
those, from within as well as from without
Parliament, whose generous collaboration has
enabled the committee to achieve the important objective of marking in a fitting and
lasting way a momentous event in Canada's
international career. I see present many who
gave a helping hand, and I am bound to
say that the committee's work was made
light. Senator Dandurand is held in such high

esteem by all, because of the great services
he has rendered to his country, that our project was enthusiastically supported. Canadians of all classes are very proud that one
of their countrymen was singled out as the
first among so many distinguished statesmen,
the representatives of fifty-five nations.
Being mindful that their undertaking was
of such international and lasting importance,.
the committee entrusted the execution of the
portrait to one of the leading masters of
Europe, Mr. Marcel Baschet, whose fame has
been immortalized by the admission at the
Luxembourg Museum, in Paris, of bis portraits
of two Presidents of the French Republic,
Messrs. Millerand and Doumergue. The committee trust that their own high appreciation
of this painting wilil be fully justified.
The suggestion to create a portrait gal'lery
of the Presidents of the League has been
received with gratifying favour in Geneva.
Indeed, the plans of the palace now being
erected for the League have been modified
to provide for the display of this rare collection in a fitting manner, and Sir Eric Drummond bas stated that at a not distant time
this gallery of portraits of the leading statesmen will be superior to anything of its kind
that the world bas hitherto known.
To the Canadians who visit the League's
palace in Geneva Senator Dandurand's portrait
will appear as a fitting reminder of Canada's
participation in the endeavour to establish
world peace, the greatest and loftiest aim of
humanity. It cannot but remind them that the
Dominion has produced statesmen of ull international stature.
In closing may I again express the thanks
of the committee to all those who have
helped to make possible the realization of this
project.

RELATIONS OF SENATOR WITH
DOMINION GOVERNMENT
MEMBERSHIP OF SPECIAL COMMITTEEDEBATE ADJOURNED

On the notice of motion:
Honourable Senator Béique will move that

the following senators be named to serve on
the Special Committee appointed to inquire
into the advisability of a rule being adopted
by the Senate defining the nature and extent
of the relations of a member of the Senate
with the Dominion Government.

374

SENATE

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable members, I intend to move the motion which is
printed on the Order Paper, but before doing so I should like to invite honourable members opposite to act on the committee, and
I hope that they will be willing to do so. I
repeat my request to the honourable the
leader on the other side (Hon. Mr. Willoughby). If honourable gentlemen opposite are
willing to act on the committee, I would
move the name of the honourable leader and
other members; if he is net willing to act on
the committee, I should like to know whether
there are members opposite who will act.
The purpose of the committee, as stated on
the Order Paper, is merely to inquire into the
advisability of the adopting by the Senate
of a rule defining the nature and extent of
the relations of a member of the Senate with
the Dominion Government. It seems to me
that we all should be agreed on trying to
prevent the recurrence of any such question
as has been raised in the Senate recently. My
sole object in asking for the appointment of
a committee is that we may decide whether
there should not be a rule of that kind, so
that in future members of the Senate will
have something for their guidance. Therefore I ask whether the honourable leader of
the Government in this House, and other
members opposite, are willing to act on that
committee.
lion. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: In answer
to the bonourable senator I may state, on
behalf of the honourable gentlemen behind
me, so far as I have any right to speak for
them, that it is not our intention to take any
further part in the discussion of this question at the present session. Therefore I cannot accede to my honourable friend's request.
In saying this it is not my desire to be discourteous to the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Béique), whom I esteem as one of the
leaders of this House. I may say that I am
advised-it is of no great moment now, and
perhaps is not apropos-that an appeal has
been launched and is pcnding. This being
the case, I think all interests would be better
served if we were to defer action in this
matter to another session. The honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
attaches to the finding of the trial judge an
importance to which I can hardly agree.
Without discrediting that finding at all, I
believe that remedies are available to us that
are not available to the courts. I hope the
honourable gentlernan from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) will agree, under the circumstances, to allow this matter to stand over
till next session.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am always desirous
of agreeing with the honourable the leader of
the Government, but I fail to understand what
objection there can be to adopting as soon as
possible a rule to prevent the possibility of
any mistakes in future. I think we should
carry out the decision that was reached yesterday, to the effect that a rule should be
adopted. There remains merely the appointment of the committee to consider such a rule.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I can only say
again, in answer to the honourable gntleman,
that I have indicated my position to the
House.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Then, if no honourable
members on the other side are willing to act
on the committee, I propose that a committee
be appointed consisting of Hon. Messieurs
Copp, Dandurand, Graham, Hardy, Ring,
Lewis and myself.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, I rise simply to suggest to the honourable member for De Salaberry that under the
cii cumstances it would be wise to postpone
until next session the decision of what is
simply a principle. I think the gesture made
by the leader of this side of the House should
commend itself te the judgment of honourable memibers, including my honourable friend
from De Salaberry. I think it would be most
unfortunate that a rule governing so important
a matter as the relationship between senators
and the Government, or any of its departments, should be devised by a committee
composed exclusively of members of one side
of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What objection
is there on the part of the honourable gentleman and some of his colleagues to joining in
that work now?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Let us not discuss
that question, because we certainly shall not
be in accord. The important thing is to find
some means whereby we al may agree on
the selection of a committee which would be
thoroughlv representative of the views of all
honourable members, and it will be impossible
to do that if we accept the suggestion of the
honourable mnember from De Salaberry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But I would
point out to my honourable friend that that
suggestion is accompanied by another.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
tion?

What other sugges-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That the honourable members opposite join with us.

JIJLY 9, 1931
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That brings up
the reason why we do net want te join, and
te go into that would mean the reopening
of the whole question, which, in my opinion,
bias already occupied the attentien of this
House tee long, and net te the advantage of
honourable members. If the whole question
had been referred te a committee at the
outset, it would have been settled finally, and
without haîf the uinfertunate publicity that
bas been given te it throughout the country.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Will the honourable
member allow me te asic a question? When
hie says that the matter should have been
referred to a cemmittee, dees hie mean that
the motion of the honourable member for
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) should have been
adopted?
Hon. Mr. BEAUTBIEN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I repeat what I said
yesterday, that, as the honourable gentleman
knows, the effeet of that motion, if we had
passed it, would have been te place one of
our colleagues on trial, and ne one can be
placed on trial unless there is a prima facie
case against him. Would it have been fair
for us te pass that motion and thus admit
that the member concerned was on trial and
that there was a prima facie case against him?
The reasen why I rnoved rny motion was that
I did net want te place one of our colleagues
in such a position.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: With the best of
intentions I suggest that at next session a
cornmit.tee might be appointed that would
commend itself te both sides of the bouse
and weuld submit a rule that we ail could
unhesitatingly accept. I cannot answer my
honourable friend's question without reviving
the whole unfortunate discussion. It is net
difficult te reply, but 1 trust that my honourable friend will net tempt me te give the
answer, for I desire very much that the
discussion should net be reopened1. As I say,
in my opinion, the matter has had tee much
publicîty thr -oughout the country. I think it
was net necessary te say se much about it.
However, there is ne use in crying over spilt
milk; we cannot undo what has been done.
Surely, when we are ahl in good faith seeking
te have formulated a rule, which we do not
posseas, and which is evidently very necessary
for our guidance in the future, we ought te
take every possible precaution to select a
commi.ttee that would commend itself highly
and abselutely te both aides of this bouse.
bon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But we cannot do
that by passing this motion. I know that my
honourable friend from De Salaberry is

375

desirous of doing something that will be useful
to us and will resuit in a permanent ru-le 6f
conduct that can be acce.pted without question.
Therefore I insi.st as strongly as I can on the
suggestion that the matter be postponed until
next session. This session is now in its dying
days. When we corne back next year we shall
most probably have forgotten the heat that
some of this discussion has engendered, and
we shali be in a more judicial frame of mind
to consider the question. Then the honourable
leader of the ITouse (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
would be ready te join in, and we should be
in a position te act dispassionately and arrive
at a conclusion based purely and simply on
equity and the highest principles, in accordance
with the opinions of members of both sides of
the House. This is too important a matter to
ho deait with by members on one side only.
.bon. Mr. BEIQUE: Wi'll the honourable
gentleman give a reason why honouraible meinbers on his side should net be as ready te jein
in the selection of sueh a cemmittee and in its
work, now as next session? 1 would draw the
honourable member's attention te the faet that
1 have reached an age at which I cannet feel
sure of being here next year, and therefere
1 have good ground for insisting that the
motion be proceeded with now, since no reasen
has been shown te me for a postpenement of
the question.
bon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the spirit
which animnates my honourable friend on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Beaubiien), I should like
to appeal te my honourable friend the leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
and ask him if we could net arrange te explore
te some extent, between now and the close of
the session, the means by which we might
corne to an understanding as te the. proper
relations between mem-bers of Parliament and
the varieus departments of gevernment. As
the honourable gentleman from De Salaberry
has said, if it is acknowledged that a finding
by a committee upon this matter is necessary,
what reail objection is there te making a start
on a study of the question now? We may not
proceed very far with it at this session. We
may find it advisable te consuit with the
leaders in the other Chamber as te whether
the matter should be studied by a joint committee of both buses. Since I spoke on this
matter the other day and referred te the
contact of barristers who are members of
Parliament with the varieus departmnents, I
have received information which shows that
such contact has been extensive from year te
year. Therefore it seems te me that the
question with which we are concerned here
is equally interesting te the Heuse of Cernmens, and altheugh we may find it impossible

376

SENATE

to finish our inquiry this session, we may in
the next week or two be able to consult with
the leaders in the other Chamber and ask
them to give some thought between now and
next session to the suggestion that the question
involved in the motion before us might in
the best interest of Parliament be studied by
a joint committee. I am not particularly interested in this matter from the point of view
of a lawyer, because I have not practised at
the Bar since I had the honour of being
Speaker of this Chamber, but I realize that the
professional contact between a barrister who is
a member of Parliament and the governmental departments invoives a highly complex
problem.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Does
able friend not think that a
occupiAs a seat in this House is
position from a barrister who
of the other House?

my honourbarrister who
in a different
is a member

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; but for
every lawyer here there are nine in the
other place. It rnay be that if we draw up
a rule to govern the relations between a
senator and the departments, the members
of the other House will think it advisable to
consider whether it would not be in their
interest to have a similar rule. I am throwing out this suggestion simply with a view
te helping in the solution of the present
difficulty. I do not wish to broaden the disussion, but of course it is well known that
members of Parliament who belong to the
legal profession are not the only members
who have contact with the departments.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
senators, I think that the honourable gentlenan's reference to members of Parliament
who are not lawyers is unfortunate, because
the impression may now go abroad that
other members of this House have had
unethical relations with the departments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND. I was speaking
very generally, and not of this Chamber in
particular, nor of the present time.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: In my opinion it is
not necessary to have such a rule as is suggested in the motion, provided we are all
agreel that the ordinary, ethical business
practices should be followed by members of
this House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the proposed
committee is formed, I should like my honourable friend to be a member of it, and he
would then realize what contacts are possible
between members of Parliament and the departments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I regret very much
that this motion will have the result of increasing the publicity that has been given to
this affair.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not like to
interriupt, but I may say that all this discussion is irregular. There is nothing before
the Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: If my honourable
friend would compose himseif for a moment
and not interrupt members who do not take
up so much of the time of the House as he
does, we should get along better. It seems
to me that it would be wise for the honourable member for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique) to drop this matter. I agree with
the honourable gentleman to my left (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) that any regulations recommended by a committee representing only one
side of the House would not be satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Honourable senators,
lest there may be a misapprehension, I wish
to dissociate myself from certain remarks
which have been made by honourable members on this side. They have not spoken on
my behalf in requesting that this motion
should be withdrawn. Yesterday afternoon
a njority of honourable members voted in
favour of an amendment, which was properly
before the House, and the honourable member from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique)
gave notice of his motion. He and those
who agree with him are responsible for the
motion, and, speaking for myself, I have no
desire that he should not move it, or that
the matter should bo allowed to stand until
another time. I take the position that it is
the dutv of honourable members on the
other sidc to move the motion and carry itas thev no doubt can do--aod proceed with
the formation of their committee. The committee should bring in its report, and if that
report is not satisfactory to all honourable
memb.'rs an amendment may be moved. In
the meantime I want it urderstood that I
have no favours to ask, nor any requests to
make, of my honourable friend from De
Salaberry. I am not asking him to withdraw his resolution, but am suggesting, on
the contrary, that he move it and proceed
with the appointment of hi, committee.
Hon. H. J. LOGAN: Honourable senators,
in the first place I desire to state that we all

against his presence here, so long as hie maintains bis present virility and ability. After

T
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: W e are in thc mid.st of
a lieat wave, as the honourable member for
La Salle lias suggestcd, and we are nat able
ta consider the matter dispassionately. Since
the Opposition lias declined ta take partHon. Mr. BUREAU: I would not say "the
Opposition."
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I beg pardon..
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The otlier side.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I think that since lionourable members on the other side liave stated
that thcy will not take part in this matter, it
would be useless ta go on witli it at this tirne.
Hou. Mr. BEIQUE: I su.ggest that soine
bonourable memiber move that tlie deibate be

tliat we. may have a littie more time ta consider thi.s matter.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Make it six mantlis.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Now or neyer.
Hon. PASCAL POIRIER: Honourable seinators, I votcd for my bonourable friend's
'arendmen.t yesterday, not because I was particularly enamoured with it, but because I
thouglit the matter had gone far enough. It
was necessary, I think, that tlie point should
have been raised, but enougli publicity lias
been given ta the discussion to avenge-if I
may use tlie word-the honour of the Senate,
because the country must by now be aware
that we are wide awake ta any question affecting the honour of this honourable body. Now,
none of us desires vengeance. I do not know
whether or not my honourable friend the
senior member for Ottawa (Han. Mr. Bel-

court) is guilty. He may not be guilty. At
ail events lie is entitled to equity. Now, the
course that lias been proposed may be logical,
and I find no fault with it, but its resuit
would be ta prolong tliis matter and expose
it more vividly before the country. My
opinion is that we have gone far enough and
that it would now be in good taste to drop
the whle matter.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: I will add my prayer
to that of some of my lionourable colleagues
in asking my lionourable friend on tlie opposite side to drop his motion. We do flot need
a.ny rule of this flouse in order to be lianourable. Wc ail know wliat our duty is.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Some of us may slip
-errare humanum est--but that a man has
sl':pped, or apparently slipped, is no reason
why we should pursue him ta, the utmast;
no reason wliy we should be Sliylocks, asking
for the pound of flesh. Enougli has been said
to punisli any senator who might have been
guilty. May 1 repeat tliat I do not pronounce the senior senator for Ottawa guilty,
because the question is sub judice. I have at
heart the lionour of this honourable House as

would be tliat -this wholc matter be dropped.

NEWV WESTMINSTER HARBOUR LOAN
BILL
THIRD READING

B3ill 104, an Act to provide for a loan to
the Ncw Westminster Harbour Commissioners.
-Hlon. Mr. Willoughby.
HALIFAX HARBOUR LOAN BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 103, an
Act to provide for a further loan to the Halifax
Harbours Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-short titie:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Honourable
gentlemen on the other side were desirous of
obtaining some information which I did not
have when the Bilis relating to, New Westminster and Halifax harbours were under discussion previously.
Mr. A. R. Tibbits, an
officer of the Marine Department, is now
present and I would a.sk that he be permitted
to corne to the floor of the House. If any
honourable gentleman desires to ask any
further questions, Mr. Tibbits may bc able te
furnish the information.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I simply asked how
much. money had heen expended by the Governmcnt on Halifax harbour in the last
twenty years.
Rt. Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
It would be
necessary te include the expenditure by the
Railway Department, becau.-e the
Intercolonial spent nmost of the meney.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
I asked what
ameunt had been spent by the Government.
I dàd not name any particular department.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I think I
have the data that ;vill bc suitable to the
honourable gentleman's purpose.
TIhe expenditure by the Department of Railways
and Canais for the Government raiIways was
$12,830,122.16.
Under the
Harbour Commission the amount spent was $5,961,829.54.
Thus the total up te date is about $18,000,000;
but I do not think that comprises the railway
tracks on the docks.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: My honourable
friend is quite right, but the amount I mentioned makes ne allowance for the expenditures on railway connections; it covers only
the marine end of the harbour.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Could we have aise
the revenue and the expendituro of the barbour for the past year?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
We will try
te get that.
It is net availa:ble at the
moment.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
This officer

net that information ready just now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Can the honourable leader indicate te us the total amount
needed te complete the werks that are being
developed in the port? We were asked fur
a certain number of millions some years age,
and later for another appropriation, and 110W
we are -asked for a loan of $3,50t1,000.
I
should Jîke te know whether this is the
finality, and whether it is sufficient te cernî'lete the work.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
The best t'he
officer can say in a hurried answer te that
question is that it will take $10,000,000 yet.
The money is appropriated only from year
te year, as the wvork is done. As already intiniated, over $5,000,000 has been spent by the
Commission.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I notice hy the cxplanatory note that $5,000,000 was authorized for the harbour of Halifax by the
Statutes of 1929. Hlas ail týhat money been
expended?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
The ameunt
expended by
the
Harbour Commission,
$5,961,829, includes the expenditure of that
$5,000,000 and in excess of that ameuint the

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: If honourable
gentlemen want any further information, the

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I heard that the
total expense of the hiarbour, including docks,
sidings, sheds, etc., in the last twenty years,
was about $50,000,000.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We might
obtain some information as te the general
plan of the development in New Westminster,
and the extent te which the amount that is
now asked will advance that plan.

Rt. Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

JULY 9, 1931
Hon. Mr. CROWE: Last spring, I think,
the Government made the statement that it
intended to appoint a commission to look
into the harbour boards of Canada, wliether
at Halifax, Saint John, Quebec, Montreal,
Vancouver or New Westminster. Ras that
commission been appointed?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The work at
New Westminster is for the completion of the
elevator, and .$300,000 more is asked. Already
$700,000 lias been spenit; so the expenditure
on. the grain elevator there woid total
$1,O0O,O00.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: I was asking the leader
if the Government liad appointed the proposed commission to look into these harbours. It was announced that the commission
would examine into the expenditures on ail
the harbours before the Government granted
any money for improvements.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I arn informed
that Sir Alexander Gibb, wliom, we know as
an eminent English marine architect and
engineer, is working on the other liarbours;
but apparently it is not intended that lie
ahould devote himself to small harbours suci
as the one in question.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: Is lie working on the
other harbours now?
.Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:: He lias been,
and lie is working at the present tirne.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The question
of expenditure by the liarbour commissions
lias always lef t mie in a quandary as to the
proper control by the departmnents of the
Government over that expenditure.
The
Governrnent be'ing in Ottawa, and appointing
commissions to superintend work in various
parts of Canada, 1 have always wondered
whetlier the link connecting the departinent in
Ottawa was sufficientiy strong and soiid to
insure control of expenditure on those harbours. I suggestcd to Mr. Fielding as far
back as 1922 that the Audit Board, or the
commission whichlihe brouglit'into existence,
sliould be given full power to supervise sudh
expenditures. I have not had an opportunity
of learning ail about the activities of these
liarbour boards, but I know that in the city
,of Montreal very large surns have been spent
by a Board of Coimmiasioners composed of
men wlio were not experts, and wlio met
wcekly or montlily. These expenditures are
made on work done by contract or by day
labour, and it sccms to me that the officiais
of the boards are realliy the masters of the
expenditures, and that the Government,
through its engineers or auditors, does not

379

exercise a proper supervision over tim. I
was flot surprised at the suggestion m-ade in
another place, that it woul probabiYy be in
the interest of Canada to have these commissions brought into dloser contact with the
Federai Administration. I have an absolutely
open mind on the subi ect. My right lioncurable friend to my left (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) thinks that it is better to leave the
administration of these ports in the hands of
a commission, and perhaps lie is riglit, but
il seems to me that wlien such vast expeniditures are being made there is flot enough
superintendence or control.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 to 7, inclusive, were agreed to.
On the titie:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
Before the Coinmittee riscs 1 would suggest that as the
expenditures of these hiarbour commissioners
al] over the country are very large, it miglit
be desirable to appoint a commission of higli,class men from various parts of Canada, who
would act witliout salary and would be paid
only their expenses, to supervise the expenditure of nloney. 1 think -the appointment of
such a body would in large messure reassure
the public and curtail the expenditures.
Further, sucli a body could inform the Govcrnment of what it had observed, and its
advice would be very valuable.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The harbour
commissioners are far fromn having a sinecure.
In a busy harbour they have a great deal to
do, and, unless I arn mistaken, tliey sit every
day. The honourable member from Stadaeona (Hon. Mr. Webster) is a large slipowner and lias considerable space on the
wharves. I think lie could give us some information in regard to this subjert, because
lie is very familiar with it.
It is not cntirely the money of the Government that is cxpended on a well administercd
harbour. If Montreal is in default this year,
it is for the first time in its history. In the
past the charges were fixed at a figure that
would enable the harbour -commissioners to
balance the budget. The honourable member fromn Stadacona nods approval; so I take
it that I arn righit.
I think that one general commission of the
kind that has been suggest.ed would make a
mess of things. In a large liàrbour thec oimmnissioners require to be on the job all the
time. They are more than ordinary officiais.
Tliey meet witli other men and engage in
other activities, and do a great deal of
good work, no maLter wlio -may have put

380

SENATE

them there. As a rule, Montreal has been
blessed with very able men, good harbour
commissioners, and they have administered
the harbour very well. This year will be the
first in which there bas been a deficit, and
I think it is due to the construction of a large
bridge. Perhaps the honourable gentleman
from Stadacona could enlighten the Committee somewhat.

from different parts of the country, and whose
recommendations would have considerable
weight, would prevent that.

I think he

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the third
reading of the Bill.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
could. He bas been harbour
at Quebec City.

Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: All our harbour
commissions this year have been confronted
with a very difficult situation. In addition to
the millions of dollars already spent on the
harbours of Canada, it will naturally be necessary to spend further large amounts of
money on them in order to keep them up
to a high state of efficiency. At the same
time, in view of the depression through which
we are passing, it is necessary that there should
be a careful survey and check of the expenditures on our various harbours. Their
revenues to-day are not meeting their expenditures. It is net fair that some of them,
which are national ports, and the shipping
interests that use them, should be unduly
taxed on account of the other harbours. I
think it would be advisable for the Government to consider the appointment of some
commission or board, or an auditor, te scrutinize carefully the very large amounts involved.
We know that through our expenditures for
the Canadian National Railways and for
harbours we are becoming very seriously
affected, and caution should be exercised. I
appreciate the fact that good service is rendered by the commissions at the various ports;
nevertheless, pressure is very often brought
to bear upon them to induce themi to spend
money for additional property. I think that
large expenditures on these harbours might well
be held over for another year, or until there
is an increase in the traffic going through our
ports. I just throw out the suggestion that
the Government should keep a very careful
check on all the expenditures on harbours at
the present time.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I offer my suggestion
because, as we all know perfectly well, and as
is quite natural, pressure is brought to bear
by the people in the locality to get the
harbour commissioners to spend as much
money as possible in the neighbourhood. I
think that a commission of the kind I have
suggested, composed of men of high standing

Province of Alberta for the transfer of its
natural resources, the Aet was to become
operative as of the first day of August, 1930.
It becane necessary, apparently, to extend the
time for the purpose of making certain adjustments, and it was extended by agreement to
the first day of October, 1930. This Bill is

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GIRAHAM:
Honourable members, I think this is the Bill
that provoked a little discussion as to thé
action of what miglit be ealled the ermaller
insurance companies. If I Temember correctly, it was suggested by my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that the Superintendent of Insurance might be asked hy the
Goverament to express an opinion as to the
desirability of insurance companies, particularly the smaller ones, investîng moneys that
are really trust funds and belong to widows
and orphans, in this company. Has the Superintendent of Insuran-ce expresscd any opinion?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not know
whether. the Superintendent of Insurance was
consulted or not when the Bill was going
through the other House, but I should think
it very likely that he was. What my honourable friend fcars is the possibility of the small
companies using some of their trust moncys
to invest in what inight turn out to be a not
very good security.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not paying a
dividend for sosue tinie.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Not so sure to
pay dividends anyway. It would seemn that
the siualler insurance companies, excepting
those situated in the Prairie Provinces, to
which. this Bdll is particularly intended to
apply, might be rather reluctant 'to invest
their money in this seheme under ýpresent conditions. No company would be under any
obligation to do so. There are not many
insurance companies wit-h hieadquarters in
the West, and anost of themn are mutuals. I
think under the circumstances the Bill shouhd
be allowed to pess, because I presumne the
point that bas been raised h.aý been considered to some extent by those who havé
sponsoreil the measure. 1 feci that no good
puiipose would be served now by our getting
the opinion of the Superintendent of Insurance, for he could only theorize on the result
of investments in the Agricultural Credit
Company. Mr. Beatty and others are behind
the eompany, and I take it that the Dominion
Government wilh 'be behind it too, as wel.I
as perhaps some of the Provincial (iovernments. So apparently the matter will be
handled by responsible people.

381

Insurance oomHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
panies large and small wilI, of course, exercise their discretion in deciding whether thiey
should invest in these shares, and, if so,
to what pxtent. But a diffiv&ilty rnay arise
whten the reserves and securities of any company which makes such an investment are
being inspected by the SupeiTintendent of Insurance, whose duty it is to examine minutely
into their vailue with. a view to seeing that
the interests of policyholders are protected.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHIBY: And he is veiry
ready ýto act, tao.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think he has
a elear understanding of bis duty on that
score.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:,Should we be castin. a reflection on companies which -are perfectly solvent, though smaîl, if we suggested
that they should not subseribe for -any of
these shares, or il we put a limit to the
number wh-ich they mi.ght purchase?
Pdght Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 have no
doubt that the Senate will pass this Bill, but
I sbould like to refer again to the situation
that confronts the smaller insurance comnpanies. The return to policyholders--I will
leave shareholders out of consideration in this
discussion-is determined by the rate of interest earned on their companies' investments.
Now, it is well known that interest rates 'have
been declining rapidly; sa anuch so that at
the end of last year many insurance cornpanies were wondering what the next developments would be. Many cd the securities
held by them have dropped in value, and the
Superintendent of Insurance ocannot avoid
taking note of this when making bis annual
inspections. Generally Lspeaking, the- companies that have their investments in government and municipal securities have not been
troub'led at ahl about the situation, althougb
the bonds of somne foreign governments, particularly in the Argentine and other Sduth
American countries, have depreciated to 2uch
an extent as to cause concern to owners of
large blocks. The Insurance Department has
of necessity to be very strict, particularly in
times like this, for one of its duties is to give
protection to policyholders. As I have stated
before, I am somewhat in a quandary, because
ahl the insurance companies have been asked
t.o invest in this Agricultural Gredit Company.
Small comlHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
panies too?

382

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Oh, yes. But
it will b left to their discretion whether they
do so. Now, it may be that some companies
will feel that their paramount obligations to
policyholders preclude the investment of any
of their funds in the securities of a company
which, in my opinion, will not pay a dividend.
Speaking frankly, I rather think that such an
investment might almost be considered as a
donation. Will a company which takes that
view bo pointed to by other companies and
the people of the country as a concern that
has not the interests of Canada at heart? lt
wvill not be easy for the directors of smaller
(ompanies to make up their minds whether to
invest in this scheme or not. Of course, I
an in favour of the Bill and trust that ail
the good results expected of it will materialize.
But I feel that the smaller insurance companies, whieh derive their revenue from ordinary sources, ought to bear in mind their great
responsibilities and think twice before they
invest in a securitv that might we'aken the
confidence of policyholders by cansing them
to fear that they are not amply 1 otected.
Hon. J. McCORMICK: Honourable senalors, the smaller insurance companies, to
which my right honourable friend from Eganville bas been referring, are generallv verv
careful about the security for their loans. It
is not likely that they will be called upon to
invest in this scheme, for the chartered banks
and big trust, loan, mortgage and insurance
companies will be able without any difficulty
to furnýish the $5,000,000 required. One of our
large mortgage corporations is operated in
affiliation with a wealthy trust company. I
understand from some of the men who are
interested that the plan of operation is similar
to that which bas been put into effeet in
Minnesota and the Dakotas. I notice from a
report made after two years' operations of the
Minnesota fund, which is of about the same
amount as will be required here. that at no
lime has more than 60 per cent of it been
out on loan. because the borrowers have constantly been making repayments. I think il
would not embarrass some of our larger companies. like the Sun Life, for example. to
subscribe one-quarter or one-half a million
dollars to this scheme. but I feel that conparatively small companies sbould not be
asked to make any investments that would
wveaken the security of their policyholders.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think we may rest
assured that the public interest will be safeguarded by the Superintendent of Insurance,
who is a first-class man and keeps a close
watch on all the corporations under his

jurisdiction.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Hon. F. B. BLACIÇ: Honourable senators,
I agree with the right honourable gentleman
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
tbat a man who is on the directorate of one
of the smaller insurance companies ought
not to lose sight of his responsibilities. But,
after all, there is nothing in this Bill that
will make it compulsory for any company to
invest in the shares in question, nor has
anvthing beEn said in another place to indicate that compulsion will be used. The
directors of insurance companies, small and
large, are on the whole intelligent people
who iook after the interests not only of those
whom they have insured, but also of their
stockholders. I do not think that any company selling fire, life or any other class of
insurance will subscribe to a scheme of this
kind unless it feels that its revenues and
re.servecs are large enough tu take care of a
possible loss. It is true that we have a most
efficient Superintendent of Insurance. He is
supposed to inspect the books of companies
every year, and I know from experience that
he makes his inspections almost quarterly.
But we could not place upon the Superintendent of Insurance the responsibility of refusing tG allow a company to invest in a
security which is recommended by the Governmet that employs him. I think the companiez and their directors will safeguard their
interests, and I do not feel there is very
much danger in this Bill along the lines suggested by my right honourable friend.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: I have a great deal
of sympathy with the position of my right
honour-ble friend from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham), because I happen to be
similarly situated, as a director of one of
the smaller life insurance companies, and I
fully realize the responsibility that will be
assmiIid by any of these concerns in dealing
with the proposal to become interested in the
Agricultural Credit Company. It should be
remomclnred, howvever, that this Bill refers
onlv te companies incorporated by an Act
of the Dominion Parliament, and has nothing
te do with companies that have provincial
charters. Therefore the restrictions placed
upon these provincially incorporated companies, as regards the securities in which
theY may invest, will not be changed by this
Bill. Nevertheless there is a disposition on
the part of companies of a public nature to
support a public movement like the scheme
now proposed. I recall that at the time the
Governmnent of Ontario proceeded to raise an
endowment of one or two million dollars for
research work, the insurance companies were
appealed to for support, and the appeal was

383

JULY 9, 19,31

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: No. They know what
the law is, and they wouid have to dispose
of any securities that he deciared did not conform Vo the legai requirements.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The objecta of the
Dominion Agricultural Credit Company are
so praiseworthy that I cannot doubt for a
moment that the capitalization required will
be forthcoming. I think, however, that the
advances should be made by corporations or
individuais who can afford to f orego dividends on their investments. My own candid
opinion is that any insurance or other com.pany which cannot afford to f orego revenue
from the money invested should flot participate. In regard to the remark of the honourable gentleman fromn De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) as to the efficiency of the Supermntendent of Insurance, I wouid point out
BEIQUE: Yes, five years.
Hon. Mr.
that while his department is very efficient,

SENATE

We are living in an age of change, and
àystems must change. It is not difficult for
me to support a Bill that tends to a closer
scrutiny of expenditures in all departments.
In saying this I am not reflecting on the
Civil Service. I believe that the Civil Service
of Canada is as good as any other in the
world, and there are some very able men in
it; but, in view of changing conditions, I am
in favour of the Bill. I would suggest again,
however, that this country ought to have
within a very few weeks a Finance Minister,
a Deputy Minister of Finance, and this
Comptroller. In the end, the responsibility
for the administration of this proposed law
and for the control of the finances wili fall
upon the Finance Minister, and this means
that there should be a deputy for consultation
and recommendation. There is no use in
passing the Bill and appointing a Comptroller
unless there are other officials ready to
shoulder the burdens that must come to them
under this new law, because it is going to be
more burdensome in its detail, perhaps, than
it looks.

officials; but I do not think there will be
friction, and I believe that the benefits flowing
from this legislation will be far greater than
any difficulties that may result.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Will the Senate
permit me to make another brief statement,
although perhaps it is out of order? The
necessity of a closer scrutiny of public accounts is apparent, I think, to every honourIn consequence of a brief
able member.
experience in the administration of a rather
large sum of money during the past few
months, there was adopted a system conmonly called the pre-audit. Every account
is scrutinized by the Auditor General after
it has been examined by our department, and
when it is found correct, the Finance Departnient issues the cheque.
An effort was
made to systematize payment by having the
accounts rendered at stated periods, usually
about once a week. All the accounts that
had accumulated during the week were checked
and a statement of them made, which with
the proper vouchers and the approval of the
various provinces, municipalities and councils
engaged in unemployment relief, was submitted to the Auditor General, and finally
to the Finance Department. I am unaware
of any complaint in this regard having reached
the Auditor General, the Finance Department, or the department administering the
fund. I therefore feel that it is quite possible
to carry out the provisions of this Bill
smoothly. No doubt questions will arise from
time to time which will necessitate regulations
to govern certain actions, or the laying down
of certain principles for the guidance of
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

I have looked
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
through the Bill, and I do not see any point
upon which I can offer any criticism or suggestion for improvement. Of course, it very
often happens that the difficulties appear only
in the operation and application of a measure.

Unless some member of the
Senate desires that the Bill should go to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, I am
not disposed to ask that it be referred to

Bill.

JULY 9, 1931
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the second
reading of Bill 109, an Act to amend the Income War Tax Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is a money
Bill, to which we must submit, and I have no
objection to its being given the third reading
now.
Right 'Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is not this
legislation retroactive?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does it mean
that corporaitions which have paid their taxes
for 1930 and have receipts showing payment
will get another bill ifor taxation for the same
period and will have to pay a further amount?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think that is
so, and that it is also being provided that the
retroactive portion of the tax bill will not
necessarily have to be paid before the end of
the present year, and will be without interest.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is hard
enough to have' to pay it without interest.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is very
kind.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is extremely
kind to a corporation that has had a big
deficit for some years to allow it to pay this
without interest; but the retroactive principle in legislation, particularly when it has
to do with taxation, is nàt right.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not only is it
unpleasant, but I think it is not right.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The times are
out of joint.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: In my humble
opinion we shall not get them into joint in
this way. A corporation having a small income may have made its calculations as to
revenue and expenditure for the year 1930; it
may have gone the length of paying some
dividends that would not have been paid if
it had been known that this extra expenditure
was going to be saddled upon it. It is impossible for a business concern to know what to
count on if the Government can come in
22112-25à

eleven or twelve months later and impose a
tax in addition to the one already paid, for
which the Dominion Government has given
a receipt. The people will be able to say
that a receipt from the Government for the
taxes payable for 1930 is of no value except
to show the amount paid: it is not a receipt
in full.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: A receipt that
I saw for payment on the 8 per cent basis
simply acknowledged the amount of money
received; it did not purport to be a receipt
in full.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It may not
have stated that it was in full, but of course
a receipt is in full if it is for the whole amount
payable. I want to urge that it is unfair not
to let the business interests know at least
one year in advance what their taxation is
to be. At the present time they have enough
financial difficulties, and unless they know
what taxes they have to meet they cannot
make their calculations with anything like
accuracy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As is implied'
in the statement of my right honourable
friend, a company's entire budget may be
upset. A company that paid a dividend before it knew of this additional tax may find
that its profits were not large enough to
justify that dividend. Perhaps it would be a
violation of the law, though, I suppose, no
court would deal harshly with any alleged
offender in this respect.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: While there may
be force in the opinions expressed by my
honourable friends, I would point out that
it might happen that the Budget would be
brought down before the end of the fiscal
year, and in the Budget Speech the rate of
taxes might be substantially changed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But suppose
a man has paid his tax before that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: A man would
not have paid his tax before that time, because it is not due until the 30th of April.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Most people,
or at least a great many, pay before the 30th
of April.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: A great many
do not. Furthermore, as my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) pointed out,
things are somewhat unusual this year. Additional revenue was rendered necessary by the

heavy expenditures that had to be made for
emergency purposes, and we have not seen

SENATE

the end yet. Therefore the Government in
its wisdom, if wisdom it be, saw fit to add 2
per cent to the rate of incorne tax on corporations of a certain class. I do not think that
the public will severely criticize the Government's action, because these taxes are not
imposed upon concerns that cannot reasonably afford to pay them. It certainly is
preferable to tax corporations who can bear
the burden rather than individuals who could
not. I feel that the retroactive provisions of
the Bill will not have the effects feared by
my right honourable friend. The Budget is
usually brought down before the end of the
fiscal year, or before income tax payments are
made. I trust that there will be no objections
to the Bill-

Hon. Mr. BLACK: They may sit if they
have the consent of the House, may they not?

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The objections stand, but the Bill will go through.

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved that when
the Senate adjourns to-day it stand adjourned until Monday next at 8 o'clock p.m.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I should like to ask the leader of the House
if the meetings of the committees which are
scheduled for to-morrow will be held? I know
that at least two committees have been asked
to meet to-morrow: one is the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, of which I am Chairman, and the other is, I think, the Committee
on Public Buildings and Grounds. So far as
the Banking and Commerce Committee is concerned, the Chairman is ready to sit if the
other members are.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Can committees sit when the House is adjourned?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am informed
that it is not the practice for committees to sit
when the Senate is adjourned.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I think they can sit,
with the consent of the House. That is the
reason I have brought up the matter.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think it is
in order for them to sit if they want to.

Bill 97, an Act to amend the Canada Shipping Act.-Hon. Mr. Tanner.
NATURALIZATION BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
July 8, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Willoughby for the second reading of Bill 3, an Act to amend the Naturalization Act.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I have little or nothing to add to
what I said to you when this Bill was called
before. The objeot of the Bill is to bring
our legislation into conformity with the Hague
Convention, which, I believe, is going to be
applied to all the British Dominions. This
measure, like most Naturalization Acts, has
to do with the status of the wife and how she

JULY 13, 1931
may acquire or how she may lose her riglits,
which becarne very insecure in this country
by reason of the Cable Act passed in the
United Staites a few years ago. The provisions
of the Bill are very simple, and deal with the
nationality of the wife in case of marriage to
a foreigner.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members, I amn really sorry that the honourable member for Rockcliffe (Hon. Senator
Wilson) is not in lier place to extend lier
congratulations to the Canadian Parliament
and the Hague Conference upon having given
women a more dignifled status. beretofore,
in the matter of nationality, the wife lias had
to follow the whim of lier lord and master,
being obliged to accept lis nationality. He
miglit leave one country, go to another and
ask for letters of naturalization there; tlien,
after sorne years, lie miglit corne back and
resume lis original nationality. The nationality of tlie wife clianged with tliat of lier lusband.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Slie is now a
person.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Now slie is a
person and lias full contrai of lier own nationality. I am speaking nlot only on bhlalf of
women, but on my own behlf as well. I
have always felt that they should have the
right te, decide under wliat flag tliey woud
live and to what country tliey would bear
allegiance.
Hon. ROBERT FORKE: Tliere came under
my observation a rather peculiar case in
which a Canadian-born girl ul'timately found
herseif in the position of being without a
country.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Sucli a thing is
possible.
The motion was agreed to, and the Billwa
read the second time.

ROOT VEGETABLES BILL
CONSIDERFID

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Willouglhy, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 87, an
Act to amend the Root Vegetabies Act.
Hon. Mr. McLe*nnan in tIe Chair.

bon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Tliis Billlias
been brouglit into Committee of tlie Wliole
in consequence of the lionourable eenatoir
froma Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) having
intimated to me that lie would like to add
sometliing to it. bis amendment lias mostly
to do with the publication of notice as to
tho regulations. Otîerwise, I believe, tlie Bill
is acceptable.

the

Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: As tlie lionourable
leader lias stated, I intimated to him tliat I
liad an amendment wliicli was possibly of
minor importance, yet of sufficient consequence
to, bring iýt to the notice of tlie buse. Tliis
Act is an important one, as it provides full
control of tlie grading and selecting of table
stock or commercial potatoes in Canada. We
in tlie Maritime Provinces are interested in
the working out of this legislation. As lionourable members may know, tlie system dealt
witli in this Act lias been in operatiýon for
about ten years. Tlie first measure was introduced, I think, in 1922, and was in force from
tliat time until -it was amended in 1929. Tlie
standard of the grade was deflned in tlie first
Act and is stated in section 3 of the Revised
Statutes of 1927, cliapter 181. Under this Act
the Department made regulations for the inspection of potatoes and the carrying out of
the many details connected tlierewith. In 1929
an amendmaent was passed wliicli placed tlie
standard of the grade entirely un-der ministerial
regulation. The regulations are now puhlished
in pamplilet forma and distributed to persons
wlio ask for copies, and to persons wîo are on
the mailing list of tlie Department. The
standard of tlie grade is a very important
feature of tlie Act, whule tlie other regulations
are not so important. However, tlie Department felt that in order to make it flexible, so,
tliat it maiglit be clianged as conditions
demanded, it was better to set tlie standard
by regulations. It lias been a little difficult
for many who are interested in the eniforcement of the Act to foilow even the feýw clianges
that have been made in the standards of tlie
grades and in the regulations. Tlie amendment that I arn proposing to-niglit is a very
simple one. It merely provides that tlie regulations, whicî are made by tlie Minister and the
Departrnent, shll be printed in front of the
Dominion Statutes of eacl year in which tliere
are any clianges.
Tliere is an example of tliis to bie found in
the Migratory Birds Convention Act, Revised
Statuýtes of Canada, 1927, chapter 130, section 4,
subsection 3, whicli requires th-at the regula-

SENATE

390

tions made under the Aot shall be printed in
the Prefix to the Statutes for the following
year.
The adoption of this amendment would make
it easier for all who are interested in the working out of this Act to keep posted on the
regulations, which are subject to change from
time to time. It would be much easier to find
the regulations in the Prefix to the Statutes
than to search for them in the Canada
Gazette, as is necessary under the present
statute.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Where are the
regulations published at present? Are they
published in the official Gazette?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Yes, they are published in the Canada Gazette, as provided
for in section 3 of the amending Act of 1929.
I now move that Bill 87 be amended as fol-

lows:
A. By adding thereto as clause 1 the following:
1. Subsection two of section three of the
Root Vegetables Act, chapter one hundred and
eighty-one of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1927, as amended by chapter seven of the
statutes of 1929, is hereby repealed and the
following substituted therefor:"(2) Such regulations shall come into effect
from the date of publication in the Canada
Gazette, except as provided in paragraph (e)
of subsection one of this section, and shall be
printed in the Prefix in the next succeeding
issue of the Dominion Statutes."
B. By renumbering the present clauses 1 and
2 as 2 and 3 respectively.
My reason in proposing the amendment is
to make it easier for producers, dealers and
memnbers of the legal profession to follow the
changes made from time to time in the regulations. If this amendment is accepted, those
who have access to the annual Statutes can
easily turn up the regulations and see what
they are for the year. It is true that sometimes we go too far in allowing the departments to legislate by ministerial regulation
or Order in Council. It may be contended,
as an objection to my amendment, that this
Act only calls for the regulations to be ministerial, while in the other Act which I have
citeld the regulations are made by Order in
Council. This objection, however, should be
ov erlooked, because in the Root Vegetables
Act the regulations are the main part of the
legislation, it being leift to the Department
to change them as conditions may warrant in
the view of the Minister. I think that my
amendment would be of benefit to the people
and would b well received by all those interested in the Act.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: Would the honourable
member explain why it is necessary to have
changes made every year in the grades, say,
of potatoes?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I have had a good
deal to do with the Root Vegetables Act. It
has not been necessary to make many changes
in the regulations. In fact there have been
only one or two minor changes since the
standard was first established. But there are,
both in Canada and in the neighbouring country, different crop conditions that do require
some little changes. This Act applies to American produce as well as to Canadian produce.
It is international in its scope. This Bill will
bring American potatoes under the same
standard in our market as our own potatoes,
and I think it is a good move to do that. Our
potatoes go from the Maritimes chiefly to the
United States, and they go out under the
grades we set by this Act. I think it is only
fair and right that my amendment should be
passed, as I believe it would help the Act.
May I ask the
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
honourable gentleman if the Government
appoints inspectors to look after the enforcement of the provisions of the Act?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Yes. They are appointed by the Civil Service. Commission.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: So it costs considerable to carry out the provisions of the
Act.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: No. There is a fee
of $3 per carload for the inspection, and that
fee carries the expenses of the Act.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Is the object of the
amendment to regulate the grading of potatocs?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I understand
my honourable friend's amendment, it is
simply for the purpose of having these regulatilons printed in the next issue of the Statutes.
That is easily donc, and it would help a considerable number of people who are interested
in the Act. If instead of delegating to the
Department the right to make regulaitions it
were necessary for Parliament to amend the
Act, the amendment would appear in the

Statutes.
that the periodical changes in the regulations
be printed likewise. There may not be many.
Such changes may have been more numerous
in the experimental stage. I think that gradually there would be evolved a satisfactory
basis, and few changes in the regulations would
be needed. I quite understand, however, that

politics were not in accord with those of the
governing powers. He was thrown to one
side and one of their own type was put into
his place.
In the Territorie's, whinh are no* Alherta andl
Saskatchewan, we had in 1905 six court judges,
and I think I may say that in t-hose days we
had more litigation, and perhaps more crime,
than at present, and no inconvenience was
experienced by the public. For example, I
might point out that prior to 1905, in the town
in which I live the Supreme Court sittiniga
were held twice a year and often occupied
several days, and ail litigation was dealt with.
Now we have a District Court judge sitting
there twice a year and the sitting scarcély
ever lasts more than part of a day. The last
sitting, I believe, occupied about haif an hour.
0f course, criminal and civil cases invoiving
more than the District Court is allowed to
deal with are attended to at the judicial
headquarters; and I may add that during the
past five years only two cases of this nature,

persons interested in the Act would like to

amendmnent simply asks that the new regulations be printed in the next issue of the annual
Statutes after those regulations corne into
force.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We have had
some conversation about this matter. The
objection was the inaccessibility, at times, of
the regulations. The Bill applies only to the
importation of new potatoes in June, July
and August. The Department can publish
the regulations now in the Gazette, but
whether it does or not, I do flot personally
see any objection to the amendment.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Sinclair was
agreed to.
Sections 2 and 3, as renumbcred, were
agreed Vo.
The preamble and the titie were agreed to.
The Bill, as amended, was reported.

SENATE
I might point out that each District Court
judge is paid $5,000 by the Federal Government and $1,500 by the local Government.
In addition to these, we have twenty-three
sheriffs and their deputies and other court
officials. I am not certain as to the remuneratien paid to the sheriffs, but I am safe in
saying that it will amount to at least $3,000
each, which would make a total of about
$75,000; and I may add at least another
$40,000 for other court officials, such as deputy
sheriffs etc. etc.
When speaking te one of the District Court
judges not long ago, I enquired whether he
was kept busy. He replied that there was
very little to do. I then remarked that I
thought it was a mistake to have se many
judges and se many judicial districts. He fully
agreed with me, and said that he had told
the then Attorney General that it was a great
mistake te forrn se many judicial districts.
That gentleman agreed with him and said:
"What can I do? They are all clamouring
for these districts all over the province."
Another gentleman told a friend of mine not
long ago that he was going te seed for want
of something te do.
We naturally ask ourselves the question,
What is the reason for this unnecessary increase in organization?
There is only one
conclusion at which we can arrive, and that
is that it was te a considerable extent the
result of political expediency. The party which
held power in Saskatchewan for twenty-five
years must assume the entire blame for this
situation. It must be remembered that, while
the Federal Government pays the salaries of
all judges, every judicial district that is formed
involves a heavy tax on the province in which
it is situated, as court-houses have te be built
and a staff of officials employed.
The only course I can see for the betterment of the present conditions is that when
the present judges retire no new appointments
should be made until the numbers are reduced
to the actual requirements of the province. I
think I am safe in saying that the requirements of Saskatchewan could be fully met
by, say, three judges in the Court of Appeal,
five King's Bench Court judges, and ten
District Court judges. A number of the existing districts could be easily amalgamated and
placed under one court and one staff of court
officials without any inconvenience te the
public. This would be a great saving te the
country.
If the reduction which I have suggésted
could be brought about, the saving te both
the local and the Federal Governments would
amount te over $160,000 annually. This is the
situation as it exists in the province. As I
Hon. Mr. GILLIS.

stated at the beginning, I do net wish te
reflect upon the judiciary, but •I think it is
deplorable that the cost of it is almost unbearable. I should like te quote a statement
that was made by a great jurist, probably one
of the greatest in Canada, Hon. R. M.
Meredith, ex-Chief Justice of the Province of
Ontario. The following is a newspaper despatch dated London, Ontario, June 25:
A staunch supporter of the campaign of
Senator L. MeMeans, K.C., of Winnipeg, to
reduce the number of Supreme Court judges in
Canada to some basis comparable to England's
is found in Hon. R. M. Meredith, former Chief
Justice of Ontario.
In an interview the ex-Chief Justice suggests to Senator MeMeans some tests designed
to show that taxpayers of Canada are overloaded with a top-heavy judiciary, and that
thousands of dollars can he saved with fewer
woolsacks in the land.
Senator McMeans' claim is that England,
with 50,000,000 population, has 32 judges, while
Canada, with 10,000,000, has 136 judges in the
higher courts. From which it would seem that
England, at Canada's rate, should have 680
judges, or Canada, at England's rate, could get
along with six. The Winnipeg barrister will
move in the Senate for an investigation into
a means by which Canada's quota can be cut.
"If Mr. MeMeans' proposed inquiry is made
thoroughly," said the ex-Chief Justice, "it
should end in the saving of many hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
As Wallace
Nesbitt, president of the Lawyers' Association
of Canada and head of the Law Society of
Canada, said: 'The bench in Canada is glaringly
overstaffed.'"
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:
"Net long ago there were two local judges
in most of the counties of Ontario, though
in most of them one capable man was more
than enough. But eventually the number was
reduced to one in most of the counties. The
result was a great saving of money and greater
efficiency.
And yet local judges might be
further reduced in number by quite one-half,
with still greater efficiency, if the counties were
grouped and the law simplified, as it should
have been long ago. And the same applies to
the higlier court judges, if really competent
men are appointed in each case.
Let Mr.
McMeans ascertain accurately the number of
cases actually decided in each of the Ontario
courts of appeal separately, last year or any
other year, and compare them with each other
and with the number decided in the same time
in the English court of appeal. If he desires
more evidence of the glaring overmanning of
the Ontario courts, so too he might ascertain
accurately the number of days in each year
each court sat and for how long each day.
Compare the results with that which the
English courts did in these respects.
I was not able to get the information with
regard te the number of davs the English
courts sit. I believe that would be interesting from the standpoint of Saskatchewan, because I am confident it would show even more
glaringly the overmanning of the judiciary of
that province. He goes on:

JULY 13, 1931
"The provinces have the right to fix the
number of judges in the courts, but if extravagant in this respect the Dominion has an overruling control, in the power to reduce their
pay, so that the total cost may be no more
than it should be."
I do not know what could be accomplished
by the committee. In fact, I imagine that
not very much could be done just now, but
I think it would be worth while to inquire
very carefully into the situation and ascertain
whether we cean in any way lessen the present
burden. May I repeat that I think the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
MoMeans) is to be congratulated on having
the backbone to bring this matter up for
consideration.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman says there are fifty million people
in England. Where did he get that information?
Hon. Mr. GILTT: I an quoting the
honourable gentleman from Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But my honourable friend ought to know better than that.
There are not fifty millions.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Forty-five.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No. I have the
book here and it says thirty-eight millions in
England.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: What about Scotland
and Ireland?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There would be
about four millions there.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I am only quoting
figures.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I think we should
not let a thing like that go.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Sootland will
not give the information.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The difference is only
a matter of a few hundred thousand. I ani
informed that the population of England,
Ireland and Scotland is 49,700,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You cannot count
Ireland. It is independent, and the British
judges do not go there.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The North of Ireland.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There are not many
people there. That is the Black North.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It will be found that
the figure 50,000,000 is virtually correct.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: And Wales is included.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Well, there
are sufficient anyway.
The motion of Hon. Mr. MeMeans was
agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: How many will
there be on the committee?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Put on all the lawyers.
TARIFF BOARD BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING POSTPONED
On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 47, an Act to provide
for the appointment of a Tariff Board--Hon.
Mr. Willoughby.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
senators, it was suggested at the opening of
the present sitting that this Order could as
well be taken up to-morrow afternoon as
to-night. There is no objection on this side
of the House to that procedure, so far as I
know, and I therefore move that this Order
be discharged and placed on the Order Paper
for to-morro* afternoon. Before the motion
is put, may I say that a short time ago the
honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lemieux) suggested that some statement
should be made to the House concerning existing unemployment conditions as observed on
my recent trip through Western Canada. As
the evening is not far advanced, I am prepared
to give a brief résumé of the situation as it
appeared up to the time of my return, a little
more than a week ago, if the House cares to
listen to it to-night.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the Order
was discharged and placed on the Order Paper
for to-morrow.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN CANADA
DISCUSSION
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
senators, I do not intend to make a speech or
indulge in any argument on the question of
unemployment. Rather, I purpose to state to
the House what I believe it desires to hear,
namely, my convictions, formed after a brief
tour through Western Canada, in regard to the
existing situation, as to how serious the
problem is, and so on. I should like to preface
my remarks with a few observations that I
think have a distinct and direct bearing on the
problem.
Unemployment is not a condition peculiar
to Canada, as all honourable members know.
Within the past week a report has come to us
from Geneva, which is a sort of central source
of information on world affairs, to the effect

394

SENATE

that at the present moment there are more
than 25,000,000 unemployed people in the
countries that are members of the League of
Nations and perhaps a couple of additional
countries. This naturally causes one to look
about for some reasons for this world-wide
depression.
In visiting Western Canada recently one
was impressed by what one saw and heard,
and was prone to look about for the causes
of the conditions that prevailed. Across the
continent, particularly in the three Prairie
Provinces, it was apparent that the 1931 grain
crop was going to be substantially below normal. Perhaps 'there has not been in the last
decade a year when crops have been as bad as
they appear to be this year, especially in the
Province of Saskatchewan.
On the Pacifie coast another phase of the
problem presents itself. The greatest industry
of British Columbia, lumbering, is in about
the same predicament as the wheat-growing
industry of the Prairies. This is not because
of any lack of a crop to be harvested, nor
because men are not available to garner it.
One therefore looks about to find the leason.
Upon inquiry the.inevitable reply is heard on
every hand: "There is no market for the
products of the British Columbia forests."
And when one asks, "Why is there no inarket?" the answer is, "Because immense quantities of forest products are being produced by
the Soviet Republic"Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -"to the detriment of Canadian business." Upon inquiring
a little further, one learns that Great Britain's
requirements alone run into billions of feet of
lumber and other forest products, but that
Britain has found it particularly profitable to
trade with Russia. One then naturally looks
to sec what is being paid by Britain for the
privilege of trading with Russia. Reference
to the records that come from the seat of the
League of Nations show that up to October
1 last the credit issued to Russia by the
world, to enable that country to compete
with our Empire and other countries in the
world markets, exceeded 85,000,000 pounds
sterling, and that by October 1 next it will
amount to something more than 110,000,000
pounds sterling, of which 30 per cent or more,
according to the records, will have been supplied by Great Britain herself. But what have
we found on reading the newspapers that were
placed on our breakfast tables this morning?
That Britain is coming to her senses and is
now considering the restriction of her trade
with a country that is obviously making a
deliberate attempt to destroy her trade, as well
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

as the trade of other parts of the British
Empire. So I reach the conclusion that the
forest industry of British Columbia, which until recent times has been perhaps the most
important industry of that province, has been
seriously affected by the conditions that I
have mentioned.
The Prairie Provinces this year will produce something less than 200,000,000 bushels
of wheat, as compared with a total of approximately 500,000,000 bushels produced three
years go. Furthermore, the price procurable
for wheat in the world market is to-day
slightly over 60 cents, whereas three years
ago it was twice that figure or more.
So,
with the wheat crop reduced by more than
50 per cent, and the price eut to half, it is
inevitable that the purchasing power of the
people of the Prairie Provinces will be greatly
curtailed; indeed, well nigh destroyed.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I hope to be
conservative in my statement.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman is a long way short of the truth.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: At any rate, with
Ihat groundwork of information, one naturally
inquires: What is the unemployment situation in Western Canada? I confess without
hesitation that it is more serious than I had
believed before I went west. The fact that
the prices of farm products and many other
commodities have declined in Eastern Canada, and that the purchasing power of the
people throughout the whole country is materially lessened, in consequence of conditions
that probably no Government could have prevented, has brought about a serious situation;
but when one comes to consider the existing
unemployment conditions. the extent of their
influence, and the prospects for the future, it
becomes necessary to make a deeper and more
detailed examination if one is to reach a
reasonably correct conclusion.
In British Columbia the lumbering industry
is in the state that I have already described.
The fishing industry, which is a large and
important one, is not flourishing, very largely
because of market conditions. Metalliferous
mining is at a low ebb, and the transportation
industry, se far as its ability to employ men
is concerned, has rapidly declined.
On the
15th of June last, because lumbering activities
were so greatly curtailed, or virtually nonexistent, approximately 7,000 men who ordinarily earn their livelihood in the lumber
woods and in the mills were to be found in
the coast cities, principally in Vancouver. Up

JULY 13, 1931
to the lst of July, 2,200 had been added to
that number. Many of the men engaged in
the mining industry, apart from coal mining,
have drifted from the interior of the province
to the coast.
Quite apart from all this, and for reasons
at which one can only guess, a very substantial
number of men have gravitated to Vancouver
by what is known as the side-door-Pullman
route. In other words, they have sought free
transportation via freight trains.
While
estimates as to -the number of these men
vary, it is not uncommon to find from 50 to
100 of them on one freight train, and official
estimates that I have received show an average of 200 a day.
Strange, to say, these men travel both east
and west. I stood on the station platform at
North Bend, talking with a railway employee
while the train on which I was travelling was
taking on water, and so on. He told me that an
aast bound freight was just pulling out, and
a moment later one ai the yard staff stepped
up and said: "There, are fifty-two on that one."
The employee to whom I was talking said
that another freight ws waiting to pull out
after the departure of the train on which I
was travelling, and as we left the station I
counted forty-three men standing in the doors
of the box-cars of that west bound freight.
That transient traffic has become-not a
menace, but a condition that is somewhat
alarming to the people in the small railway
towns along the line. Day after day, they receive almost constant calls for aid, princi.pally
in the form of food, whenever a new contingent ai men appears. I do not believe that
these men really appreciate the burden that
is thrown upon those people.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it not a fact that
the men move backward and forward because
people will not feed the same men day after
day?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As I observed a
few moments ago, one can only guess at the
reason for this condition. My honourable
friend may have guessed well. At any rate,
the problem on the Pacifie coast is aggravated
by reason of the fact that the railroads end
there and these travellers have to turn back.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is their
terminal.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, that is their
terminal, and many of them, having travelled
so far, are in no hurry to make the return
journey. The result is that the situation in
Vancouver is most depressing.
Alberta presents a somewhat similar problem. When we dig a drain to run water
into a pond, the water runs until the pond
is filled. When the pond is filled the water

395

backs up. Vancouver represents that pond,
and the railways the channel through which
the water passes. The flood of persons is
beginning to back up, and this affects Edmonton and Calgary. As we proceeded westward we read in the press-and later it was
confirmed on the ground-that in some
municipalities the throngs of unemployed were
being served food very sparingly, while in
others, which found the burden too great,
they received none at all. That, of course,
threatens a difficulty of another nature. Apart
from the cities of Edmonton and Calgary
the situation in Alberta was not quite so
acute, although an area in the central portion
of Eastern Alberta has been affected by a
drought that threatens almost a crop failure.
In other parts of Alberta the crops are more
promising, though not normal.
In Saskatchewan the outlook is gloomy
indeed. In that province there are 303
organized municipalities, each about 180
square miles in extent. Seventy-four of those
municipalities, comprising an area of 15,000
square miles, present a scene that might be
described as utter desolation: there is no grain,
no grass, no possibility of a wheat crop this
year. Furthermore, over a considerable portion
of that area there have been three successive
crop failures. It is true that a larger area is
affected this year than last year, and a considerably larger area than two years ago.
It is a most depressing view.
People who have travelled through that
western country in years gone by know that
in the areas surrounding the cities of Regina
and Moose Jaw the crop prospects in the
month of June were almost always splendid,
and usually they were fully realized. This
year fields have been covered and roads obliterated. In some places, were it not for wire
fences, you would not know that you were on
a road. The ditches along the roads have
been filled, not with sand, but with gumbo,
which is finer than sand, and nowhere is there
a sign of grain, grass, or even weeds.
The day following my arrival in Regina I
motored over considerable territory-we drove,
I think, 123 miles in one afternoon-and
throughout that area, in which there are
several once-prosperous towns, not one bushel
of wheat will be garnered this year. That
experience was perhaps calculated to impress
one with the seriousness of the situation. I
would not charge honourable members of the
Saskatchewan Government with such an intention, but one could scarcely escape the feeling that they had possibly placed in the
show-window the selected view they wanted
us te see. However, there was no gainsaying
the fact that there is an area there of about
15,000 square miles, occupied, on a conserva-

tive estimate, by 150,000 people who must be
fed if they are to survive-and they must
survive.
In a rough sketch of the Province of
Saskatchewan, which, I think, appeared in the
Ottawa papers this morning, there is shown a
triangle representing seriously dried-out areas,
and other parts of the diagram give a reasonably accurate picture of other portions of the
province, where the crop failure is not so

districts in the farthest north can there be
said to be a normal crop.
There were evidences in the Province of
Saskatchewan, not of any turmoil or agitation, only of distress; but there were parts
of the province in which, even among the
farming communities, many strange doctrines
were being preached, and this was due, I
think, to dire extremity rather than to any
belief in such doctrines.
In the western portion of the Province of
Manitoba the situation largeiy repeats itself.
From Macgregor westward there were no good
crops. The southern portion of Manitoba has
suffered severely; not so much- up to the
middle of June as immediately after that date,
when there were some very hot days, the
temperature rising to 107 degrees, and hot,
withering winds mowed down those crops in a
way that was very pitiful to behold. But
since our return very substantial rainfalls have
corne to the Province of Manitoba, and also
to Saskatchewan, and hope has considerably
revived, so that to-day our farmer friends on
those Western Prairies are quite confident
that they will be able to produce enough
feed to meet their requirements, and thereby
save the animals that at one time they feared
would have to be sacrificed.
East of Macgregor, or a point not far from
Brandon, the crops in Manitoba looked quite
promising. But there exists in that province
another problem that merits more than passing
consideration. More. than half the population
of Manitoba is in Greater Winni-peg, a city
of approximately 275,000 people, and immediately surrounding it are seven suburban municipalities with coneiderable population. That
locality is faced with a most serious problem
of unemployment. Year after year people of
almost all nationalities diverge from the city
of Winnipeg out to employment opportunities
throughout Manitoba. in the woods, in the
puip milIs and the lumber mills, or in the cutting of cordwood, large quantities of which
are used in Winnipeg for fuel. But this year
such opportunities have not occurred. The
puIp and paper industry is dormant, with the
exception perhaps of one mill. Because of
the crop conditions and the price levels the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

farmers did not this year a'pply for the agricultural labour which they were accustomed
to engage in previous years. So, instead of
an exodus of unskilled labour from the city
of Winnipeg to the agricultural and forest
areas of Manitoba, the workers this year have
remained in the city of Winnipeg. They are
a source of anxiety there, because they have
no immediate prospect of employment, and
they certainly look to the provincial and
federal authorities to do something to relieve
their need.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
naturalized Canadians?

Are those people

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I assume, because
it is contended in Winnipeg, that many of
them are not. Half of the unemployed in the
city of Winnipeg are said to be foreign-born.
It is contended that very many have come
within the past two or three years, and that
fact is advanced as an argument to show why
the authorities that brought them here should
either take care of them or return them to
their native land. One official statement that
was given there was to the effeot that more
than 1,000 would gladly return to their native
countries if given the opportunity, but they
could not pay their fare. I am not so sure
that that is correct. I am quite sure that the
opportunity to go was given to some, but they
did not desire to take advantage of it.
Coming to Port Arthur, at the head of the
lakes, which was the last point visited before
our return to Ottawa, we .found approximately
8,000 unemployed men in what are known as
the Twin Cities, Fort William and Port
Arthur, and it was officially and authoritatively stated-and on request the statement
was repeated-that 90 per cent of all those
men were of non-British stock. I do not
know to what extent they may have become
naturalized, but it is certainly true that in
Alberta, Manitoba, and the western and
northern portions of Ontario, where men have
been engaged in the forest and mining industries, a large proportion of the population are
not Canadians by birth, and a good many
are not Canadians by naturalization.
Perhaps a few words might be said about the
need of having regard for our own Canadian
citizens, born in Canada. Thousands of them
saw service overseas about fifteen years ago,
then came home to Canada and attempted to
re-establish themselves in civil life in gainful
employment, and they have not been able to
do so in any permanent way. Of course it
was well known to us all, and it was probably inevitable, that during the war period,
when wage rates as well as living costs rose
substantially, non-Canadian citizens did not

JULY 13, 1931
respond te the call of this country to nearly
the same extent as did our Canadian-born
men. Instead, they went into industrial
activities of all sorts. Since our boys came
home they have found it increasingly difficult
to re-establish themselves in the industries in
which they were previously engaged. Under
the operation of the law of supply and
demand, the Canadian or Britisher very often
found himself in competition with a man from
some country in continental Europe, as to
who would work for the lower wage. That,
honourable gentlemen, is one of the serious
phases of the problem that we face to-day.
I think it will perhaps be possible to find
employment for a large number of men in
Canada. Surely in a young .country such as
this, with its vast and as yet undeveloped
resources, there should be work for all. But
all men cannot be employed as common
labourers. There are in Canada skilled tradesmen, many of them returned soldiers, who find
themselves to-day unemployed, and unable to
ge' employment even with pick and shovel.
Therefore I think that the energies of the
Government and the Parliament of Canada
ought to be particularly directed towards
alleviating the burden on our own Canadian
people.
In Eastern Canada we have our unemployment problems, but, thank God, we have
no crop failures this year; and the spirit that
I think pervades the minds of the people in
Eastern Canada is a spontaneous desire to
be helpful in relieving the distress existing in
the newer provinces. The need will be
especially urgent where 160,000 people must
be fed and clothed, because this is the third
year of their affliction, and clothes do not wear
for ever, nor boots for very long, and such
articles will need to be supplied. I am greatly
cheered by the knowledge of the fact that
even the ladies' organizations in Eastern
Canada are enquiring what they can do to
be helpful. They want to begin at once the
preparation of supplies of clothing necessary
.o withstand the rigours of a Prairie winter.
In my opinion that speaks volumes for the
helpful spirit that exists as between one part
of the Dominion and another.
But, though there are no serious crop failores in Eastern Canada, there is a substantial
amount of unemployment. In the northern
areas of both Ontario and Quebec there are
thousands of men who heretofore earned a
livelihood by working in the forests and the
mills, whether lumber mills, paper mills or
pulp mille, and in the production of raw
material for those industries. To my knowledge many of those men have gone into the
newer districts of our northland and eked out

a living for themselves and their dependents
by cutting down trees, hauling pulpwood to
the paper mills, and clearing their land at
appropriate seasons, and have thus gradually
worked themselves into the ownership of a
farm. But this year the opportunity upon
which they chiefly depended for some ready
cash to support their families while they were
clearing their land is not available. Therefore great distress exists throughout the northern portions of both these provinces, and it is
perhaps more acute there than in the older
and more settled parts. That is a matter which
I. am sure is receiving the attention of provincial authorities in both provinces at present,
and in view of the conditions surrounding
those important industries I think the Provincial Governments feel that a responsibility
rests upon them to do their utmost to solve,
or at least to relieve, that difficult problem.
In other parts of Canada I find-not from
personal visit, because time has not permitted
me to visit the other provinces-that the
municipalities and provincial authorities are
full of confidence that bËtter days will dawn
than those through which we are just now
passing, both as to the bounties of nature and
as to the price standards that prevail for agricultural and forest products.
However, we need not feel unduly pessimistie. It must be remembered that in that
vast wheat area in Western Canada there has
never been a time, so far as I could learn,
when there were more than three crop failures
in any one district in successive years. Within
ten days of the date when hope had been
absolutely given up for this year throughout
a large area in the Western Provinces, raine
fell that soaked the ground for fifteen inches
in depth. As a result, the people there to-day
are holding up their heads with hope, and
telling what crops they are going to have next
year. I saw them sowing oats on the 25th
day of June, because it had rained that morning, and they got a heavier rain than they
had had for three years. "The heaviest rain
in three years," was the comment made on the
shower that fell when I was in Regina. To
one who has a fair acquaintance with those
Prairie Provinces it is marvellous to see how
quickly crops grow in the sunlight in the
warm days from June onward, and how quickly
they mature. Another year may hold a much
brighter prospect, and many regard the present
stringency in the crop situation as being a
not unmixed blessing, because of the low
price. They say some other country will
have its turn at famine next year and we
shall probably find ourselves coming back as
rapidly as our fortunes have dwindled.

In regard to the unemployment that we
have in Canada, would it not be better to
commence by feeding our own people and trying to return to their own countries ail the
foreigners who have no right to be here?
Many of these people keep shifting about by

great num-ber of such visiters from Toronto
just now, who have corne to take advantage
of our charitable institutions, like that of the
Grey Nuns, which give food to whoever applies to them. One would think that Montreal had enough to do to look after its own

When William Cullen Bryant first beheld

v'ast area cf waving acres, filled with life, and
who looked forward te the time when a

can well understand why the country was
referred to as a desert on old maps. I remember-and I ar n ot very old yet-having

known territory. I think the memory of a
few of Bryant's' observations can still inspire us to believe that there is a great
future for Western Canada. I recall memorizing when a schoolboy part of his poem on
the Prairies, and being struck by the beauty
of these opening lines:
These are the gardens of the Desert, these

duty but the privilege of Canada as a whole
to succour the people who are in need.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I may say
in reply te my honourable friend, when he
suggests that something be done te remove
some of the settlers from southern Alberta
and southern Saskatchewan into more fertile
districts, that in the eight years during which
I sat on the other side of the House I had
occasion te bring te this Chamber one or two
legislative amendments intended te meet the
difficulty. It was realized by ail Westerners
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

in this Chamber, and by ail other members
who knew something of those regions, that
the opening of serne sections to settlement
had been improvident. Regulations, based
upon legislation, were passed to allow the
settlers te transfer te other quarter sections,
and, if I am net mistaken, arrangements were
made with the provinces of Saskatchewan and
Alberta te assist in making the transfer. I do
net know to what extent that was accomplished, but facilities were provided for the
carrying out of such a policy.
Speaking generally of the problema of unemployment, I suggested at the session of last
September that inasmuch as we had te face
the results of unemployment, and as people
in need would present themselves te ask for
relief, a census of the unemployed should
bc taken. The taking of such a census should
net be difficult, for when they applied for
relief they could be asked where they came
from, how long they had been in the place
where they applied for relief, and se on, and
then an effort could be made te send back
those who within, say, twelve months, had
invaded the cities from the rural sections. If
that bas been done, or if it is donc during the
coming autumn, the number of needy men in
the cities will be diminished. People who live
in the rural municipalities surrounding the
large cities and towns should be able te house
and take care of returning sons. Then we
might be confronted with the problem of
taking care of the people in the rural parts
whose crops had failed. I have no advice te
offer as te that part of the problem, but se far
as the cities and towns are concerned, I have
a suggestion to make. It seems te me that
when iarge sums of money are handed te a
municipality, te be expended for the relief of
the unemployed, the municipality should be
able te set those people at some useful work
and thus obtain some return for the
I cannot but believe that, if
expenditure.
they are notified in time, hundreds of towns
and cities where money will have te be
distributed this autunn will prepare a programme of work in order te give men employment. It seems only right that those towns
and cities should receive some return for the
money they spend.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do net quite
follow my honourable friend's trend of
thought. No specific amount of money has
been furnished te any municipality. In aIl
the relief work that has been done during the
past year the municipality has been allowed
te judge of its own needs. We have said:
"If you are prepared te carry on some local
improvement te provide employment in your

JULY 13, 1931
community, and will pay hall tihe cost, the
province and the Government at Ottawa will
each bear a part of the cost of that work."
But flot one dollar has been handed out to
any municipality to be expended as the municipality might see fit, without its being a
partner in a co-operative effort.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course I
know what has been going on, and I should
expect a similar policy to be followed during
the .coming autumn and winter. But I was
under the impression that in addition to
moneys expended on works to relieve unempioyment there were lump sums given by
the municipalities Vo help men who had not
been able to get work.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: A municipality
may fr.om time to time have given a man a
dollar or five dollars instead of giving hlm a
loaf of bread and a roast of meat; but the
Federal Government lias neyer handed out one
dollar for any suai purpose during the past
year. The effort lias been co-operative. A
bond was executed amnong the municipal,
Vhe provincial and thý- federal authorities,
whereby the inunicipality was authorized te
give sucli relief as it thougit necessary. The
bill was sent to tic province, and if the province approved, it would f orward thne bill to,
tie Dominion Government, and the Government would pay its proportion. There lias
never been a transaction between Vie Federal
Government and an individual or a municipality.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: I arn not so sure that
the Provincial Governments have flot dealt
with the municipalities as suggested by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), by
giving direct relief to the poor. 0f course
the responsibility for that could be laid at
the door of Vhe provincial administration. The
Federal Government would know nothing
about it. But I tbink 1 could refer to cases
wbere direct relief was sanctioned by a Provincial Government, proïbably without the
autiority of the federal administration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 thouglit that
a, certain proportion of the $20,000,000 could
be distributed for direct relief Vo certain
parte of Vie population.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I fancy that this
is all out of order, because we are noV in committee; but, if the Hous will permit me, I
shail be glad Vo give my honourable friend as
clear an idea of tie matter as I can. Out of
Vhe 320,000,000 voted by Parliament for the
relief of unemployment $4.000,000 was appropriated for direct relief. The remainder was

Vo be used only for the creation of employment opportunities by means of a plan of
co-operation among the municipality, the province, and the Dominion. The cost of direct
relief was Vo be divided. One-third waa to be
paid by the municipality, one-third by Vhs
province, and one-third by the Federal Govcrrnent. By this means there was set up a
credit of $12,000,000, which miglit be drawn
upon by any municipality, according Vo its
needs, and 1the municipality was to be the
judge of its requirements. The only brake
put upon the municipality was that it must
be the judge of the need, that it must pay
one-third of Vhe cost, and that the province
must approve of the expenditure. If a municipality saw fit Vo spsnd $5 on direct relief,
and submitted Vhe account Vo the province,
and the province approved of ths expenditure,
lhen the Federal Government was satisfied
that it must have been reasonably justified.
There was a
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
voucher from. the province.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: A certificats from
the department handling the relief, and a
certificate from the Provincial Trsasurer's
office. I know of no instances of the distribution of relief, sither direct or through
smployment opportunities, without proper
provincial autiority.
Hon. Mr. C0.1': Would Vhe honourable
gentleman tell us how much of the $0,000,000
was expended Vo the 31st of Mardi last?
Hon. Mr. ROBERT8ON: The Act providsd that any portion of the appropriation
that was noV used up Vo the 31st of March
would lapse. There was a sum of $1,145,000
odd tiat lapssd on the 31et cd Mardi. The
rest of Vie money was appropriated, although
of course it was noV alI sp6nt at that timp.
Speaking from memory-I have no notes bef ore me-the total expenditures Vo this date
bave amounted Vo slightly over $10,000,000.
The time for Vhe completion of some of these
works lias had Vo be extended slightly; in
some cases thirty days, and in one or two
cases sixty days; because unless Vhey are completsd the works are useless. Roughly S10,000,000 will be distributed among Vhs men who
have performed Vie services on these works.
The smployment opportunities provided
through co-operation with Vie two great railway companies constitute, roughly, noV quite
one-third of Vie total. The undertakings of
the railways are still proceeding. They are Vo
be completed within a year. The year will
noV expire until October. Those undertakings
have been of great assistance Vo men who were
deprived of their regular employment in

transportation activities. The railway companies have very fairly, I think, although not
necessarily, given a preference to men who
were ordinarily engaged in their own service,
but on account of the slump in the transportation business found themselves without
employment. Many of them have been used
on these relief works. They have received, no
doubt, a smaller rate of compensation than
they would have reeeived in their regular
employment.
I may say, just briefly, as a matter of information, that approximately seven million
men-days' work has been furnished through
co-operative effort, and a little over 300,000
men have found more or less intermittent employment. That number does not include
many thousands more who were engaged more
or less steadily in the making of materials
to go into these works.
I may say in conclusion that in every province I have visited-in the four Western Provinces-gratitude has been expressed almost
invariably for the assistance that had been
forthcoming from Federal and Provincial
Governments. There seemed to be complete
satisfaction in regard to the provision made
to meet unemployment, except that it was
not sufficient to finish the job, the period of
depression having extended so much longer
than anybody expected.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If the Government so desires, it can let it stand without any motion. I am altogether at sea on
this matter, not being familiar with the privileges of a member of this House when it is

The resolution

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had re;ceived the following
message from the House of Commons:
Resolved,-That a Message be sent to the
Senate requesting that their Honours will give
leave to the Honourable Andrew Haydon, one
of their Members, to attend and give evidence
before the Special Committee, appointed by the
House of Commons, to investigate, from its inception, the Beauharnois project for the development of hydro-electric energy by the use
of the waters of the St. Lawrence River, so far
as the matters referred to are within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, and without restricting the generality of the foregoing
words, in particular, to investigate the matters
referred to in the speech made in the House of
Commons by Mr. Robert Gardiner, the Honourable Member for Acadia, on the 19th May, 1931.
Ordered,--That the Clerk of the House do
carry the said Message to the Senate.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do not want
to delay anything that is essential; but if a
resolution of this kind were moved in my
absence, particularly if I were ill, I should
think that I was being taken advantage of
under the circumstances. There are certain
things that a member of the flouse of Commons may ignore when the House is in session. If the same is true of a senator, I do
not think we should give him leave to do
something contrary to his own rights unless
he asks it. We are asked in the motion to
give a senator leave to do a certain thing,
which he has not suggested that he wants to
do, and which, maybe, there is no power to
compel him to do. I am not sure of my
ground, and I think we ought to have a little
time to look into the rule and see what the
standing of a member would be.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I move the
motion, of which His Honour has indicated
the scope. It is merely a motion tihat Hon.
Senator Haydon be permitted to attend before the Special Committee of the House of
Commons investigating the Beauharnois projeet for the development of hydro-electric

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have not
looked into the subject at all. I have a similar
motion in reference to Senator McDougald.
Without having examined into the rule, not
having known that this was to come up, it
would seem to me that the process of compelling a senator to attend in the House of

Commons, and therefore to absent himse-i
from the business of this House, woul flot be
quite in order; but ilf we give hlm leaçve, we
excuse him from attendance here. Ris attendance here might ibe vital, for instance, to
his drawing the full indemnity; but even if
lie were absent for days and djays, this leave
would, protect him against the loss of indemnity, h.e being absent with the leave of the
Senate. But that the House of Commeons
should have power to compel the attendance
of member of this House, and vice versa, is
an opinion that I should hesitate to express.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do flot think
they hâve.
Hon. Mr. WLLLOUGHBY: 1 think the
priinary duty is attendance in this House. A
senator is presumed to be here and should be
here to attend to, the public business; therefore it would flot be right to draft him into
some other serice. Ho'wever, there is a similar
motion with reference to Senator McDougald.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would inform
the Senate that there are two similar messages,
aoking that similar leave be given to Hon.
W. L. McDougald and to Hon. Senator
Raymnond.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: The explanation given
by the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Wîllough-by) is ail right, but, as I do not want
to be forced to object, I would ask that
this matter be left over until to-morrow at
three o'clock. This message lias corne at the
end of the sitting, at a quarter to eleven
o'clock, and if I understand the rules rightly
it is necessary to have the leave of the Senate,
which means the unanimous consent. Ilf I
cannot consent, I must put in an objection,
and therefore leave of the Senate cannot be
granted. It is not un-reasonable to ask that
Vhis matter be taken into consideration tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. I see no serious
objection to our postponing the consideration
of this motion until to-morrow if my honourable friend so desires.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It would be
better to deal with ail three motions.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Ail three of
them. It is certainly true, however, that this
session of Parliamen-t is approaching an end.
The committee may desire the presence of
those senators whose names have been given,
for the purpose of having them give evidence.
The time for the committee's work is growîng
short, as well as the time of Parliament. I
arn sure the committee would flot seek their
presence were it not deemed important in the

interests of Parliament itself and of the coun-'

that the committee is considering. Under
the cîrcumstances, as my honourable friend
from La Salle feels -that this matter should
stand over until to-morrow, I would suggest,
with the consent of rny lionoured leader,
that the request should be acceded to.

IDENTIFICATION 0F ALIENS BILL
REPORT 0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN presented the report
of the Special Committee to whom was
referred Bill Ai, an Act concerrnng Mlien
Identification Cards.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill
lias been redrafted, and perhaps it is desirable that I should briefly describe the nature
of the amendments. The Committee was
mindful of the discussion that took place in
the House. The major objections were, I
think, two in number. It was contended that
the Bill might -appear to cast odium on that
portion of the population subjected to it. In
order that this miglit be remedied, the character of the Bill lias been somewhat changed.
The section relating Vo aliens already in
Canada provides that every alien who is
qualified by residence in this country to
obtain lis certificate of naturalization and
who fails Vo do so shahl be obliged to secure
a card of identification. In other words, the
section invites ail such aliens to become
memnbers of the Canadian family. If they fail
Vo apply for naturalization they should noV
obJect to the obligation of securing identification cards.

• After consulting different departments, the
Committee came to the conclusion that the
Bill should not be made applicable to immigrants from the United States. I do not think
it is necessary for me to labour that point.
We have received special treatment at the
hands of our neighbours and we must avoid
all possible causes of friction between the two
countries. Therefore the effect of the Bill is
limited to immigrants from other countries.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
then restricted the application of the Bill

suggest that the report of the Committee
be printed, and that it be taken into consideration by this House to-morrow. Everybody

familiar with it, and if any further explanatien is required it can be given then.

RIDEAU CANAL CENTENARY
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will inquire from the Government:1. Is the Government aware that this year is
the centenary of the opening of the Rideau
Canal?
2. Is it the intention of the Government to
commemorate this important event?
3. Has the Government received any communication from the municipal authorities of
the Capital of Canada inviting the Federal
Government to co-operate with them in such
celebration?
4. That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the Imperial importance of this
undertaking at the time of its construction.
He said: Honourable senators, it may be
interesting to pause for a few moments to
consider how important such an event as the
opening of the Rideau Canal was one hundred
Hon.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

years ago. The canal was suggested and discussed after the War of 1812 to 1814. The
Imperial Government realized how difficult it
would be to move troops, stores, ammunition
and supplies upon the St. Lawrence River
above Cornwall, or above St. Regis on the
American side, because at many places, where
there were no rapids, it was very easy for a
small force to attack, and the whole of
that part between Barnhart Island and the
American shore was in the United States.
Therefore, in 1825, a report was prepared-it
is very lengthy, and can be found in the
Archives here-addressed to His Grace the
Duke of Wellington, who was then commander
of the forces, and this report explained how
necessary it was, net only from a military,
but also from a commeroial point of view, to
provide for direct steam navigation between
the city of Quebec and Lake Ontario. September, 1826, when work on the canal was
commenced, was only fourteen years after the
British troops had burned down Washington;
so it was necessary for the Imperial Government to have such a safe route as the proIn this report to His
.posed canal would b.
Grace the Duke of Wellington it was recommended by Lieutenant-Colonel John By that
the Imperial Government could well afford
to spend one or two millions sterling for the
military and commercial control of Lake
Ontario. The idea, was that trade would be
brought through Canadian ports and into
Canada by way of the Welland Canal that
was to follow, the St. Mary's Canal, and all
the Great Lakes, Lake Erie, Lake Huron,
Lake Michigan, and even Lake Superior. The
Americans had builit some canals and were
drawing business from them, and the British
Government thought it was about time for
this country to secure some of the valuable
trade.
It
may be interesting for honourable
members to recall that the corner-stone of
the lockz here was laid by no less a person
than Sir John Franklin. An example of
how history repeats itself is found in the
fact that it was said that the large expenditure of money on the building of the
canal would
relieve dire distress.
One
hundred years ago this country was experiencing hard times, just as it is now, but it
lived on and prospered. United Empire
Loyalists were coming across from
the
United States when vast territory was becoming settled here, fron 1784 to 1791. The first
who came were the Dutch, from the State
of New York, and despite their loyalty they
did net speak English. It is commonly
known that Dutch farmers, like the Boers,
are determined people and make very sturdy

JULY 14, 1931
settiers. They trekked across what was then
the wilderness of New York, carrying what
they could on their backs. They drew lands
on the north shore of the St. Lawrence and
stayed there, and their names are well knawn
in that part of the country ta this day,such names as Casselman, Cook, Crysier and
Pruners. I myseif have spent days an land
that was drawn by some of these Duteh
Loyalists. However, they had nothing to do
with the Rideau Canal. Emigrants came in
great numbers to the Niagara Peninsula, in
Uipper Canada, where Colonel Simcoe was in
command. These Dutch. people had taken noa
part in the revolution, and those who had
taken part did nat want them ta share in
whatever benefits there weere. They were
disliked and nlot treated very well, and that is
one reason why they migrated. But some
true British Loyalists, who had fought for
England-and there were nlot many who did
that when the Thirteen Colonies rebelledcame over, and they received from Colonel
Simcoe the first land, close ta the border.
They were encouraged by him ta have a
militia, for whieh he appointed captains and
lieutenants. Others who came over here at
that time were people who did not care ta pay
the heavy war taxes that were put iuta effect
in the United States after the revolution.
That country was not ricli then, and the war
with England had cost it a great deal of
money. Sa people who were nat in syrnpathy
with the British, but who wanted free land
and noa war taxes, came over ta this cauntry.
And there were other immigrants who had
become disaffected. Colonel Simcoe put them
on land far back from the frontier, so that
they could nlot possibly get into contact with
their former friends.
It is interesting ta read about the Duc de
la Rochefou*cault-Liancourt, who had ta leave
France on accaunt of the revdlutian. He
stayed six weeks in Kingston while trying ta
gét permission ta visit some of his countrymen in Lower Canadba.
Lord Dorchester
temporized-for a long time would not
de'finitely refuse tihis permission, but finslly
the Duke was prohibited from making the
visit, because it was thought he might talk
seditian, or talk about France among the
Frenchi people, who were abeolutely loyal ta
Great Britain. This shows that the authorities were more particular then then we are
now as ta who should be allowed ta come
inta the country.
In those days, when the crops were good,
harvesters used ta came from Montreal to the
Kingston district. They were paid $1 a day,
and this caused dissatisfaction among the
farmers living in that section, who were
getting only $8 a month.

A little while ago I mentioned Barnhart
Island, opposite Cornwall. Tihere lias been
much discussion about that, and a great deal
of blame has been placed on the commis-sioners who decided that the island should
belong ta the United States. That island
should have been given to Canada, but the
wiles of the Americana more or less deceived
the English commissioners, who were flot so
familiar with the locality as the Americans
were. Should we ever proceed with the St.
Lawrence Waterways scheme, it will be necessary for Canada, in order ta have access ta
the power-house, ta acquire territary from
the United States. Whether they would be
very keen about letting us have territory is
another question.
1 have already said that hi*tory repeats
itself. In this connection it is interesting ta
recali tihat the first estimate of the cast of
the Rideau Canal was £169,000. Work wascommenced on the 2lst of September, 1826,.
and up to the 31st of December, 1830, thereý
was spent the sum of £575,551 4s. 2ýd., and7.
there still remained unexpended out af the.
sum provided ta complete the canal £117,898ý
7s. 74d. Sa the cost was, in terms of dallars,.
about &3,467,245, or nearly four times as great
as the estimate. A similar thing has happened&
in connection with the Welland Canal, which
at first it was estimated would. test $30,000,000. After that it was estimated by Mr.
Bowden, at the time Ohief Engineer of the
Depairtment of Railways and Canals, that
the cost wauld be M5,000,000, and I heard
the other day from. officiaI sources t-hat the
cost up ta date lias been $125,000,000, not
including interest, and some of the money
has been out twenty years. The same thing
happened in regard ta the Panama Canal,
which it was estimated. could be built for
$150,000,000, but which cost 8600,000,000, four
times the estîmate.
And Colonel Hugli
Cooper says that if we improve the St. Lawrence according ta plans that have been propared, the total cost will lie $1,300,000,000.
That shows haw estimates go up. The first
time the St. Lawrence Waterways develapment was discussed in, this House the
estimated cost wss $2M,000,000, but now it is
up ta 8400,000,000. 1 might say that I wa.s
show'ing these figures ta, the present Minister
of Railways, who sits in anather place, and
I said, "They are good illustrations ta show
that humanity does flot change." When a
work is started the total coet is estirnated,
but bef are the wark is finished it has cost
four times the amaunt provid-ed.
The grand total spent on the Rideau Canal
in the Canada-UTpper and Lawer Canada
were alwaye referred ta that way in the repart
-was £1,380,218, or nearly 87,000,000. That

SEN ATE
was paid by the Imperiai Government and the
people here got the benefit; so we were not
SQ badly off, even before we received those
great liberties that we talk so much about.
Nearly 75 per cent of the money went to
pay wages. There were no steam shovels in
those days, and ail the work was done by
hand. I arn sure it will rejoice the heart of the
Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
who is iistening to me, to know that the
workingmen who did the work got most of
the money. And ail that was being done in
the time of the Family Compact. Well, the
Family Compact was not such a bad thingaftor ail if it could get the Imperial Government to spend so much money here and create
so much work for our people. 1 see on one
of the wails here a portrait of one of my
ancestors. I arn afraid ho must have been in
the Family Compact, because I saw in the
Gazette the other day that hie had been made
a member of the Execuitive Council with Wm.
Osgoode, and a member also of the Legisiative
Couincil of Upper Canada in 1791, and ho was
Speaker of the Counicil for many years, in
fact until bis death. H1e lived until 1833; s0
he must have been in the Family Compact 41
or 42 years. I am afraid ho w'as an awful Tory.
In Septembor, 1826, Major-General Darling
wrote to Lieutenant-CoYlonel John By, asking
him to procood at once with the building of
the canai as a means. of relieving distress and
keeýping the people loyal. Colonel By allswereu
that hoe would 'begin operations without delay,
in three sections, one at what is now Ottawa,
one at Kingston and the other on the Height
of Land. I may mention that the Height of
Land is 292 foot above the level of the Ottawa
River and ýthat to get down -to Kingston a
drop of 164 foot had to be made. Ho cmployed 2,000 mon at each of the sections; that
is a total of 6,000; so that in the thon sparsely
settled state of the couîntry 6,000 mon were put
at work, which meant, on an average of four
persons dependent upon ecd workinan-and
this average would not be too great, hecaus.e
even if a man wero a bachelor ho woulýd probably be supporting bis par.ents, while married
mon would have thoir wives and chldrenthere were about 30,000 people supported by

distance from Ottawa to Kingston by tbis
watcr route is 133 miles, of wbich 20 miles are

On the l3th of May, 1831, Mr. Peter

I amn sorry that I have taken up so much
time, but I believe that this contenary should
be celebrated, as the opening of the canal
did so much to belp develolp Eastern Ontario.
The tablet on tic Wellington street bridge
indicates iow important the undertaking was.
If there had been no Rideau Canal tiere
wvould bave been no city of OJttawa, for the
capital of th-is great country undoubtedly owes
its location to the construction of the canal.
As we aîl knoxv, the land around Ottawa is
not very fertile; I arn told that only about
one-third of it is suitable for cultivation. The
canal made ea.sy communication possible
between this section and more fertile districts.

TARIFF BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 47, an A6t to provide f or the
appointment of a Tardif Board.
HIe said: ilonourabie members, Bill No. 47,
%which is now before us for consideration,
relmtes Vo the creaition of a Tariff Board. The
purpose of the Bill is Vo creeite a body with
judiciai powers which will be avaiabie for
inquiry into ail matters delegated to the
Board by the Prime Ministeir respeeting the
tariff. The Bill provides that the Board shall
be what is commnonly known as a fact-finding
b:ody. It wili not have power or~ authority
Vo determine what tariffs shouid be, but on

407

the request of the Minister of Finance it will
ascertain ail ithe facts surrounding any sublect, concerning the tariff, upon which the
Minister may desire information.
It is proposed further that the Board shall
assume the duties now performed by the
Board of Customs, and that such matters as
are now referred Vo that Board, which is at
present composed iargely of officiais of Vhe
Customs Department, shall be reviewed by
Vhe Tariff Board.
IV is aiso proposed that after a departmental inquiry bas been made by the Registrar under the Combines Investigation Act,
instead of a commissiener being appointed, as
lias been the prac ice in the past, the information gathèred by the Registrar shall be
referred to the Tariff Board, which shail aet
as the commissioner does under the present
arrangements. The Board, as 1 recali the
provision of the Bill, will have power Vo
summon witnesses and take evidence in the
same way as a court. In my humble opinion, inquiries will be shortened and the cost
probabiy reduced. Furthermore, the inquiries
wiii be carried on by a tribunal or court con-.
sisting of more than one member, whereas
under the present iaw the investigation is
ieft to the judgment of one commissioner.
It is proposed that the Board shall consist
of three members, and that they shall receive
the compensation named in the Bill. This
wiii make iVpossible Vo secure competenV and
experienced men to acV. They are Vo be appointed for a period not exceeding ten years,
and are to be eligibie for reappointment if
Vhey have not reached the age of seventy
years when their term of office expires. They
shahl be retired at the age of seventy, or, if
noV reappointed, at the end of ten yeare'
service.
These brief remarks cover the intent of
this Bill, and I move the second reading on
the assumption and with the undersVanding
that the details may be analyzed carefully
when we go into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable members of the Senate, as I was coming
up to Ottawa yesterday morning I was surprised Vo read in the newspapers that Vhe
members of the Senate who sit Vo the ieft of
the Speaker had decided Vo oppose this
measure. From this it seemed as though they
had been deliberating over the matter. I
may say that when I read the statement I
had noV yeV read the Bill which is n.ow before
US.
This measure, like ail others that come
before this Cham-ber, stands for examination,
criticism and modification at the hands of the

SENATE
Senate. We must give to this Bill the same
measure of attention that we give to all bills
that come from the other House.
I am surprised at the lateness of the hour
at which the Bill reaches this Chamber, and
even the hour at which it reached Parliamen t .
There was a tariff revision in September last,
and there is another revision, an important
one, before Parliainent at the present time.
This Bill comes in after two radical changes
have taken place in the tariff schedule. It
would have been quite easy to alter the
composition of the Tariff Board that was in
existence up to July last. and to refer to the
Board, for a finding of the facts, the matters
upon which the legislation of last September
and of this session have been based. Undoubtedly the Government wanted a free
hand in presenting its policy to Parliament,
and I do not know of what use the present
Tariff Board will be when it finds that most
of the things which might have been dealt
with by its members have been finally decided
by Parliament.
There are a few questions that I should
like to put to my honourable friend in advance
of the committee stage, in order that he may
be in a position to throw some light upon
them in committee. I desire to ascertain what
will happen if, after a matter has been studied
by the Tariff Board and legislation based upon
its finding of facts has been submitted to
Parliament, some industry feels aggrieved by
reason of the proposed changes and complains
that sufficient information has not been
obtained. Could that industry not bring
before the Board a statement of its grievance?
Could it not make direct representations to
the Board? It has occurred to me that in
the consideration of the legislation based on
the Board's findings it may be discovered that
certain parties have not been called, though
the price of their raw material has been
increased and their industry thereby handicapped. In such an event would the power
granted to the Board enable it to accede to a
request for a further study of a matter that
had been passed upon? This is one of the
matters on which I should like some information from my honourable friends.
Although I have examined into the powers
that are to be given the Board, I cannot clearly
understand the extent of them. Section 4 of
the Bill reads:
(1) In respect of goods produced in or
imported into Canada the Board shall, at the
request of the Minister, make inquiry as to(e) all conditions and factors which affect
or enter into the cost of production and the
price to the consumers in Canada;
(f) generally, all the conditions affecting
production, manufacture, cost and price in
Canada as compared with other countries.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

I should like to know if this section, or some
other, gives the Board the right to investigate
the amount of capital employed in an industry, and the rate of return upon it. Undoubtedly it is of importance to the consuming public thait the Board should have uch a
right. There is, of course, no objection to a
fair return on capital, but the case is different if an industry puts upon its capital a
fictitious valuation to the extent of three,
four or five times its true value.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Subsection (e)
of section 4 might cover that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That is one of
the questions which I put to my honourable
friends. There is another one which has been
brought to my attention by a number of my
colleagues. and it has to do with the tenure
of office of the Board. The Bill says that
eaich member of tihe Board shall hold office
for ten years. The thought has occurred to
nany, as it has to me, that perhaps this long
'term would result in an injustice to the
people, if it so happened that they pronounced
themselves against the Government policy
upon which the work of the Board was based.
I should like my honourable friends opposite
to give me reasons for such a long term of
office for the members. Of course, I know
that perhaps a good man can hardly be expected to abandon his business and become a
member of the Board if the term o office is
only one year, but there is a great difference
between thait and ten years. It seems to me
that by passing this Bill Parliament would
be binding itself to a possible encroachment
upon the right of the people to call for a
change in the economie poldey of the country
every four or five yeau.
I submit these
questions to my honourable friends, and we
may debate them at greater length when we
come to the committee stage.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Honourable senators, if no other honourable
member is going to discuss this matter, perhaps I shall be permitted to do so. The
principle of a Tariff Board has been adopted
by all parties in this country. The incoming
Board will have the benefit of the experience
of its predecessor, the first in this country,
which I had the honour of organizing. It was
largely an experiment, because what other
countries had done did not seem to be applicable to our conditions and could not be used
as a guide.
It was not an easy thing to
organize on lines that would be suitable here.
I had copies of the enactments of other
countries, but it struck me that some of them
gave too much power to the Board and some
not enough. Therefore I had to be guided by

JULY 14, 1931
the opinions of business men and by what
seemed to me advisable. Now, the success and
efficiency of a body of this kind depend largely
upon the men who are appointed as members.
Iisat in one day with the United States Tariff
Board. I discovered that it was composed of
representatives of both political parties and
that when there was a disagreement it was
usually on the question of policy.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:- On party limes?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: On party lines
nearly always. That convinced me that no
matter what the functions of the Board might
be, if it was to be useful its membership
shiould be composed of men in sympathy, te a
large extent, with the policy of the Government in power. I think that cannot be gainsaid. 0f course, the United States Tariff
Board hias greater power than ours ever had,
or, I hope, ever will have. We must not be
squintîng too long in that direction or we
sh-ah fall into the samie system. ljnder the
Ujnited States Act, the Tariff Board, after
examining certain conditions as to costs in
other countries, can make a recommendation
te the President, and hie has the power to
make adjustinents to the tariff within a limit
of 50 per cent, I think, without any reference whatever to Congress. 1 think that is
a mistake, and I am warning the Government now not to give its statute-governed
Tariff Board, together with the Minister of
National Revenue, whoever hie may be, the
power to change the tariff without consuiting Parliament. That power is now te a
certain extent in the hands of the Minister
of National Revenue, who makes rulings and
sets arbitrary prices on gooda for the purpose
of determining the duty. I think no person
will deny that a considerable mess bas been
cTeated by the exercise of that po-wer during
the past few months. Changes that were
thought to be in the interests of the people
were made, and when it was discovered a littie
later that they were contrary to those interests
they were modified or repealed. I think it
is a safe proposition that in the main Parliament should have control of the fiscal policy
of this country.
Will the House bear with me for a few
moments while 1 give an illustration to show
what can be done in the way of fact fanding?
In the case I have in mimd it was not necessary to take evidence under oath or in any
other way. An application was made to the
Tariff Board for the removal of duty on
oooperageHon. Mr. GRIF.8BAjH: la the right
honourable gentleman speaking aow of the
American Tariff Board or the late Tariff Board
of this country?

409

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Our Tariff
Board, at the time I was Chairman. Application was made for tihe reduction or abolition
of duty on staves used in the making of kegs
for containing hardware, such as horseshoes,
nails, and things of that kind. The as9tounding statement was made to the Tariff Board
that there was in Canada no lumber strong
enough in texture, when manufactured into
kegs, to stand the strain on containers for
horseshoes and nails. We began to make
inquiries into the trut/h of that atatement.
In the city of Montreal the Federal Government has an organization-I have forgotten
its name-f or conducting researches and tests.
I requested the people who were applying for
the tariff change to send me samples of their
best kegs, and 1 asked every keg manufacturer in Canada to send me at least one
sample made up in each of the different kinds
of wood. Tests were then made in Montreal.
First there was a dead-weight test, by which
the staves were kept under a dead-weight
pressure until they broke. At least two of
the Canadian lumbers stood up as welI as
the Southern lumbers in that experiment.
Then kegs were three-quarters filled with
either nails or horseshoes and put into a
large cylinder that revolved, so that they
would he carried up to a height of about ten
feet and then dropped that distance. That
test continued until something happened.
Both those -tests proved conclusively that
there was no foundation whatever for the
statement that had been made, because we
had at least two kcinds of wood that would
stand up under extraordinary pressure. One
of these was much better than, and the other
was just as good as, American timber.
This is one way of getting at the facts
without taking evidence. The flndings in thaît
case-that is, merely the resuits of the tests,
together with the drawings, and sO on-were
handed in as a report, and consequently there
was no change made in the tariff. Some
people have saîd that the Tariff Board could
not have been of any use, because the Government did nlot take action. It must be
remembered that declining te act on a report
is just as significant as acting on it, if there
is no good reason for action. I made reports
on every application sent in, merely stating
what we found.
I rather object to our calling this Board a
court. I do not know whether my honourable
friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
will agree with me or not, but I think that
if we had kept the namne "«court" out of the
Pensions Bill the people concerned would
have feit freer. It is the boast of thousands
of people that they have neyer been in cour't
in their ]ives. The ordinary man does not

410

SENATE

like the name "court," and when you confront
him with it be is inclined to think that
maybe be is getting into trouble in some way.
This Board has been declared to be a court.
Where I am now standing I must be very
careful not to say anything against legal
men, but I appeal to the sympathy of those
who are not legally trained when I make the
statement that whenever one of our lawyer
friends has the say in a matter of this kind
there is a tendency to establish a court. It
may be that that name sounds better.
It might be interesting to relate an experience that I had-I happened to be Min-ister
in some troublesome times-in the early days
of the Board of Railway Commissioners. A
suggestion was made and strongly pressed that
we should appoint a barrister to protect thc
interests of the public. I was opposed to that,
and said I felt that the people could best be
served by being kept away from courts. As
mv honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. McMeans) has pointed out, we have
too many judges and too many courts, and I
might suggest that he endeavour to have
some of the excess judges put on the Tariff
Board. During the time of office of Mr.
Justice Mabee, wrho I think was one of the
most successful Chairmen we ever bad on the
Board of Railway Commissioners, the technicalities of the law were relegated to the
background and business principles were
applied, ýperhaps sometimes to the straining
of the statutes. I will cite an incident, of a
kind that happened more than once, which
indicates that often the best results can be
accomiplished in the absence of court paraphernalia. A lady who lived not more than
40 miles from Ottawa wrote to me complaining that a railway had neglected to do certain
things that would have protected her cattle,
which she used to have driven under a culvert.
There was no necessity of having a hearing,
nor a cross-examination of anybody by a
lawyer. Justice Mabee sent out a man to
check up on the facts, and as a result the
railway was given two weelks to remedy the
situation, without any legal process. I think
I arm safe in saying that in alil the time that
Justice Mabee was Chairman of the Raihvay
Board there never was an aipîeal against his
findings, either by the railways or by other
parties concerned. I have cited these facts
Io show why I think we should try to keep
away from anything like court proceedings
before the Tariff Board.
When an application cormes before the new
Board witnesses will probably be sworn and
sulbjected to cross-examination, and the rules
of evidence maintained.
Now, I may be
wrong, but in my opinion the best way to
Right

Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

get information in regard to business matters
is not through a court process, but by a
heart-to-heart discussion with the people on
both sides of the case. If they wish to have
barristers present at a discussion, of course
they may, for that is their right; but let us
keep away from the idea that when a person
goes before this tribunal for the discussion of
some tariff matter be is in a court, and must
sit up straight for fear that there may be
a constable at the door to see that there is
no disorder.
i am opposed to the paraphernalia of a court. Although the lawyers
say that the Tariff Board is only a court of
record, it has been published throughout the
length and breadth of the country that it
is to be a court, and to the ordinary person
a court is a court.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Is not the Railway Commission a court?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes. And I
may say that it never functioned better than
when Mr. Justice Mabee was at its head,
and, as I was trying to point out, disobeyed
most of the rules of a court. The finding
of facts requires horse sense more than it
does the paraphernalia of a court.
There is something else to which, although
it is only incidental, I object-and I know
that many of you will agree with me-namely,
that a man should be legislated against
because he has reached seventy years of age.
If a man of seventy is good enough to sit
in the Senate and consider the problems of
the nation, be ought to be good enough to
sit on a board appointed to carry out the
wishes imposed on it by the Senate as part
of the Parliament of Canada. It is tirue that
some persons are old at seventy. Some are
old at forty, and some begin to deteriorate
almost as soon as they are born. But the
fact that a man is seventy years of age does
not necessarily mean that be is incapable of
being a man among men and of helping to
carry on the business of the country. Let me
suggest that this and other countries have
gone crazy on the idea of youth. They do
not look at what a man is and what he is
capable of doing; they want to look at his
teeth to sec how old he is. They even go
so far as to legislate against giving the older
man a chance. I think the Government ought
to be free to select a man for his ability.
Many men of seventy have more energy and
ability than their associates of forty or fifty.
It is possible that if this craze of side-tracking
men who have come to a certain age and
substituting younger men had not taken hold
of the countries of the world, we should not
be in the mess that we are in to-day. I
think it is the experience of men of seventy

JULY 14, 1931
years of age, or thereabouts-and a good
many honourable gentlemen are in that class
-that when younger rnen, who have gone on
the rocks, are trying to find a way out of
their difficulties, they seek the advice of the
oId heads. They say: "What would you do?"
I would go to rny honourable friend to rny
right (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), but be is only
a young man and will not reach the age of
seven.ty for rnany years; that is, in appearanice.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn serious.
I thin&- the Government is rnaking a mistake
in saying that men of seventy should retire.
A man of sîxty-two cannot he appointed to
the Board for a full terma; and a man of
sixty-one will have to quit in nine years,
before the terra is ended. I arn serious in
saying that I tbink it is a great mistake to
measure a man's ability by bis years, and to
place a provision to that cffect in the Statute
Book.
I have said all that I intend to say about
the court, but there rernains the question of
fact finding. In this respect there is no
difference between the Board that was and the
Board that is to be. When I was on the Tariff
Board my instructions were very clear: to
find the facts and express no opinions. I
tbink this is borne out in every report that I
made. I found the facts as best I could, and
I did not go to the length of taking evidence
under oath, for reasons that I have already
stated. Nevertheless, I think I got as close
to tbe men appearing before the Board as any
person really oould. None of the sessions
were secret; they were ahl wide open. We
discussed thé wbole problern sometirncs inforrnally, and I think I learned the viewpoint
of those who made representations on various
matters. After a tbrough discussion I asked
that the arguments be subrnitted in writing.
There cornes to xny mind another point,
which has been raised and discussed sornewhere, perhaps in tbe newspapers--the question
whether or not it is a mistake to have the
Trariff Board hear only those applications that
are referred to it by the Finance Minister. 1
know that some of rny colleagues will disagree
with rne when I say that I bave no objection
to the hearings being restricted to such
applications. As a matter of practice I can
see no objection to it, because I know how it
works out. No person who ever went te Mr.
Rabb as Finance Minister with a case of any
magnitude or importance failed ta bave bis
case immediately referred to the Tariff Board.
There is another aspect, too. After aIl, the
Tariff Board is part of the department of the

411

Minister of Finance, and he is, and rnust be,
responsible to the people of Canada for whaù
takes place before that Board; and e0 far as I
arn concerned-for I know how it worked out
in practice-I cannot object to the Finance
Minister having the power to pass upon ail
applications before they are sent to the Tariff
Board.
Now I corne to the terrm of office of the
members of the Board. Members of the other
House would ail like to be elected for ten
years. We in this House do nlot toierate any
such thing as a tirne limait. The Government
of Canada cloes not get a ten-year term in
office; usually it gets four years. The Prime
Minister does flot get ten years; he may have
only one or two years, the period depending
on the number of bis mistakes. Every five
years, at the utrnost, he mnust appeal to the
people for a mandate. But you do flot find
anybody refusing to become Prime Minister
on that account. Neither do you find any
person refusing to run for Parliarnent because
he is flot elected for a ten-year terrn. It
would, be more pleasant to have a ten-year
terni, of course, for then the cost of élection
and the worry would be cut in two. Neyertheless, everybody seemas eager to run, even
tbougb the terra is but four years. I know
that the mernbers of the Board of Railway
Commissioners are appointed for ten years,
but I suhmit that the duties devolving upon
them are nlot of the sarne eharacter as those
that will devolve on the members of the
Tariff Board.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: And the Grain Cornmission.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: What about the
Grain Commission?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is
nothing that resexnbles politics, per se, as the
lawyers would say, in those boards. There
is no man in Canada, woTthy to act on the
Tariff Board, who bas not Borne ideas on the
tariff. You can put a halo around anybody's
head and say that he will be independent. He
rnay be. I do not know. But any man worth
bie saît in dissecting these tariff problems
bas some idea, of the fitness of things as they
relaté to tariffs and fiscal policies. If you
appoint such a rnan to the board he will
possibly become independent if he is there
for a long enougb period, wbich would be
about a lifetime, I sbould tbink; but it seerna
to me a littie absurd to put an able man on
that Board-and he must be an able manand say: "Now, you don't know anytbing
about fiscal policies; you bave. no ides or
opinions; you must j ust put down two and
two make four." To rny mind, if you get

412

SENATE

men who are big enough to be on the Board
lhey will inevitably have some ideas on the
tariff, and if the members appointed have no
ideas on the subject, they will not be big
enough for the job.
I come back again to the ten-year term.
When the present Government came into office
it would not have the then existing Tariff
Board. I am not complaining about that at
all. As my leader has said, the Government
could have made a change in the personnel
-to which change there could be no objection
-and still have made use of the Board. I
have never criticized very much what was
donc, except as it concerned innocent people
who were put out of employment. As I say,
the Government would not have that Board,
and I am not criticizing it for that. A new
High Commissioner to London was appointed,
and I have never criticized that appointment.
The Prime Minister took the position that
in order to carry on successfully the relations
between Great Britain and Canada he must
have a man who was in sympathy with the
Government.
I have never criticized that
attitude. Even the directors on the Canadian
National Railways Board were dropped.
I
have not criticized any of those actions in my
paper, or anywhere else.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Is my honourable
friend not in error? The directors were not
all dropped.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Nearly all
were. Oh, yes! Some of the directors were
asked for their resignations, and nearly all
were dropped. The directors who were officials
vere not dropped, but the others were. The
Deputy Minister is an official.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
harbour commissions?

What

about

the

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The same is
:rue of them. If such be the case in bodies
whose work is not political, is there not all
the greater reason to contend that when ths
Government changes because the' people say,
"We do not want that policy any more-we
want a new policy," the men who find the
facts bearing on fiscal policy should retire with
the Government that appointed them? Of
course, if my honourable friend were a member of the Board he would retire; but the
proposed statute says that he need not do so.
It has been suggested that under the statute
members of the Board could be retained until
their ten-year terrm expired, but that no work
need be given them. Weil, if that were donc,
we should be paying for something we were
not getting. It has been said also that by a
Right

Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

change in the statute their salaries could be
reduced to one dollar. I think it would be
found that such action would be regarded as
a dismissal, and that the courts would order
payment of the salaries.
Now, I must not dwell on this any longer.
I feel strongly, however, that the members
of a Tariff Board, at least, should not remain
in office after the people have said that they
do not want a continuance of the policy based
upon the findings of that Board.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There is no danger
of this Board remaining after the Government
is gone.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Does My
honourable friend expect them to be guilty
of something that will cause their dismissal?
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
going to stay in.

The Government is

That is a
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
hope. Hope springs eternal in the human
breast. If the Government is going to stay
in power, 'there is no need for the ten-year
term of office. That looks like a provision
against what may happen.
Then, the Board is to take on some new
duties, one of which is to perform certain
functions now performed by the Customs
Board.
Under the
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Customs Act, and under the Combines Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am dealing
now with the Customs Board. I am in favour
of that provision. I do not wa.nt to say, "I
told you so," but I made a sinilar reoommendation to Mr. Robb on several occasions
when we discussed the matter. People would
go to him with regard to something that was
really an interpretation of the statute, and
he woild send them to the Tariff Board, and
I would find, upon oonferring with the officials of the Finance Department and the
Revenue officials, that I was really being
asked to interpret something that the Customs
Board should interpret. I made the suggesti.on that it would not be a bad idea for the
Tariff Board te have the powers then vested
in the Customs Board. For that reason, and
for the reason suggested, I think, by the
Minister of Labour, that the same officials
who give the decision form what might be
called an Appeal Board to whom decisions are
appealed, I am in favour of the change. Once
a strong-minded man has given his views on
a certain point it is very difficult to get him
to change them.

JULY 14, 1931
The explanation given by the Minister of
Labour as te the Combines Aot cleaxs up
r.omewhat a question that was in my mind. 1
was wondering just what course the complaiints
as te combînations would. take. The Miiater
of Labour makes it clear te me that the real
purpose cf the departmental investigation is
te asc.ertain whether there is anything te he
inquired into. It is like a case going before
a magistrate for him te sec whether there is
any evidence upon which te commit a man.
After the departmental inquiry has been made
the Tariff Board wvill do the investigating, instead of a commissioner being appeinted for
that purpose. Undeubtedly the Board will
report te the Government, probably to the
Minister of Labour, and that report will be
equivalent, I suppose, te the judgment of a
commissioner. Then either the federal or the
provincial authority, whichever is the proper
one, wiil proceed in the matiter, or refrain
fromn doing se.
I have put a few of my criticisaa on record.
To me the most objectionable features cf the
roeasure are those establishing the Board as a
court, with ail the procedure of a court, and
the long term of office of the members ofthe
Board.
Hon. J. S. MêLENNAN: Honourable members, as I have given some attention te the
question cf tariff boards for a considerable
period cf time-certainly sînce befere the
abortive attempt te establish one> in 1912-I
had thought that I would address the lieuse
on the subjeet. But after listening te the
twe speeches from the Cther aide cf the lieuse
it seems te me necessary te say enly that one
hopes that when the Chýairman of the Tariff
Board is appointed he will have the wisdom
of the late Mr. Justice 'Mabee and the wit
of our colleague who has j.ust addressed us.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
members, the observations just made by my
right honourable friend opposite (Right lien.
Mr. Graham), whe was the first Chairman cf
the first Tariff Board, have been very interesting. On a number of peints he is, I
think, quite in accord with the present Gevernment's intent in subm*t'ting this Bill. My
honourable friend the leader on the other side
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) very appropriatey
asked what redress the industry concerned
weuld have if the Tariff Board, after an inves9tigation, recommended a certain rate cf
duty which the facts seemed te it te justify,
and tihe Finance Minister did net agree with
tihe Board's findings.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend wihl allow me te interrupt him.,
may I state ýthat that was net exactly the

413

hypothetical case I suggested. My question
was tItis. If legisiation were introduced bazed
on facits that had been found as a resuit of
investigation, and if it so happened that the
Tariff Board had not investigated the effec't
of that legisiation upon an industry whidh
feit it would be injured by the proposed
change in the tariff, could that industry not
make direct representations to the Board for
a further investigation, with a view to having
another report sent to the Minister of Finance
on the matter?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It would appear
to me that the Board would not have fulfilleýd
its duty if it brought in a report such as my
honourable friend suggests, because subsection
<e) of section 4 of the Bill provides that the
Board shall investigate ",ail conditions and
factors which affect or enter into the cost of
production and the price to the consumers
in Canada." It would seemn to be clear that
the work of the Board would nait be finished
until it had ascertained ail the facts bearing
on the subject under consideration, and that
if any industry feit its interests had not been
fairly considered, the Board might very wel
make a further investigation, either on a
direct application by the parties concerned,
or at the request of the Finance Minister.
The Board is te be a fact-finding body,
as my right honourable friend f rom Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) has pointed out,
and peilhaps it would net be expected te make
direct representations 'te the Government as
te what should be done. Pexrhaps it is proper
te observe that the Board cf which my right
honourable friend was the organizer and
Chairman did net have facilities for getting
ail the evidence that i't needed in order te
ascertain the facts, because it was net a court
cf record. That was a weakness in the former
AIct-but I should net say Act, for there was
none; the fermer Board waà established by an
Order in Ceuncil, without legisiative authority.
This Bill is brought down se that the new
Beard will be able te operate under a statute.
My honeurable friend the leader on the
ether aide asked aIse Whether the Board would
be empowered te inquire into the f acts surrounding the capitalization cf an industry
under investigation. I thiink there is ne limit
te the inquiry that may he made by the
Board 'into any subject that it may have
under consideration, for it will be required te.
find ail the facts. It may discover an industry
te be capitalîzed at deuble the amount that
is proper or necessary for efficiency. It May
f orm the opinion thsat a certain industry
needs ne protection, because cf the fact that
iis paying a rate of wages lower than its

414

SENATE

competitors are, and lower than it ought to
pay to enable its employees to live decently
and in accordance with Canadian standards.
It may even find both over-capitalization and
under-payment of wages in an industry. The
facts, whatever they may be, would have
weight with the Board when forming its
opinion of what protection might reasonably
be afforded by the Government.
My right honourable friend from Eganville
made some interesting observations with reference te the terrn of office of the members of
the Board. It occurred to me that there was
a little inconsistency in arguing first against
a ten-year term and a few minutes later in
faveur of an extended term. However, I
will not enter into any controversy about
thatRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
That was
where age was the essence of the contract.

Tariff Board should be in sympathy with the
policies of the Government in power. That is
a doctrine of which it is perhaps very easy
to approve, but I do not think that precisely
that doctrine was in the mind of the Government when dealing with this matter.
Rather I think the intention is to establish
a Board that will have views of its own, that
wdll actively investigate the facits concerning
industry, in this country and abroad if
necessary, and consider what steps should be
taken, in the light of established facts, to protect the interests of iproducers and consumers
in Canada. In order te achieve that objective successfully it is necessary that the aim
of the tribunal shoulid be the finding of facts,
and that the responsibility for the action taken
in regard to any finding should rest with the
Governaent of the day, through its Minister
of Finance, whose duty it is to sufbmit budgets
to Parliament. I think it would be to the

With conditions in
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
Canada as they are at the present time, I do
not think the Government are justified in
bringing in a Bill of Vhs kind to create a
number of high salaried posts. I may say
that ever since I have been coming to Ottawa
I have been in favour of a Tariff Board, but
1 cannot understand why this Bill sliould
be brouglit in now. In the session of last
f ail the Goverument raised the duty on almost
everything that is imported into Canada, and
I thought they were right. During the recess
Mr. Ryckman, the Minister of National R1evenue, travelled from one end of Canada to
the other gathering information, and on the
basis of that information the Government
brought in another Bill which, they believed
would protect our people. Again I thought
Ever since Sir John A.
they were right.
Macdonald introduced the national policy,
the praotice of travelling around the country
Vo find out wliat the people need bas been
iollowed. As a result of the changes made
by the last Tariff Bill many old plants in
Canada have been revived and given new life,
and many new ones have been established by
firms who have started Vo manufacture goods
bere, thereby giving employment Vo thousands
of our people. And there is no doubt in my
mind that the tariff which is being dealt witb
in another place at tbe present time will resuit
in many other manufacturing concerns from
other countries opening up branches in Canada.
.Now, af ter the duty lias been raised in the
way and Vo the extenit that it bas been, tlie
Government bring in this Bill Vo form a
Tariff Board. 1 think they would hav been
well advised Vo wait to see how tlieir new
tariff was going Vo work out. With conditions
as tbey are in Canada just now, no government would be justiled, in my opinion, in
going Vo the extra expense contemplated by
ths Bill. Every government should. be retrencbing rather than ate>pping out in the
way "ht many governmen.ts are. Look at
Australia, almoet in banlcrup4cy. Look at
Gezmany, with lier banks closing. Look at any
other country in the world to-d-ay. I -want
Vo tell honourable members that conditions
were neyer so bad bef ore in the liistory of
the world as tliey are now. Yet we in Canada
go on creating 810,000 and $12,000 jobs Just
as if things were normal.
This Bill creates one job at 812,000 and two
at 810,000, and witli the additional cost of

lielp, offices, office furniture and travelling
expenses, the total will easily run Vo $100,000
before the end of Vhs year. We bave in
the Grain Board in Western Canada a splendid
example of wliat will liappen. In 1928 the
salaries of that Board amounted Vo $82,780,
and expenses Vo 815,515,--a total of $98,295.
In 1929 Mr. Malcolm, the Minister, appointed
a new Board at greatly increased salaries, and
in 1930 their salaries amounted to 8143,370,
their expenses Vo $27,021, the total being $170,391, an increase in that one Board of over
870,000. And tliey are not doing more than
haîf the work of the old Board, -because with
the Grain Pool working in Western Canada, as
it lias been for a number of years, there bas
not been more work for them. Vo do.
Ontario, Vo my mi, is in a better condition than any other province. A person
driving fromt Windsor Vo Montreal. can see
one of tlie best crops that Ontario lias ever
liad. In fact, I have neyer seen Ontario iooking any better tban it does to-day. But when
you go into the chties wliat do you find? Unemployment is rampant; Vhere are rnots in
many cities, and bread lines in ail. Thirty
nilton
mayors of Ontario cities met in Ham
laot week Vo plan what they were going Vo do
about unemploymenit. The mayor of Ottawa
was there. Among other thinga, tbey asked
that the Govermnent should de-clare a moratorium, wbereby their people miight avoid
iosing tlieir homes. Eacli mayor reported bad
conditions in bis city. 1 Vhink that the Govemnmenit would have been welýl advised to
leave Vhis Bill over until conditions become
normal.
Take conditions in the other provinces. In
every city there are thousanda of unempioyed.
I want Vo tell you, honourable gentlemen, that
in Western Canada there is a great deal of
unrest. What is the condition of the farmers?
Last year we bad a amaîl crop and low prices.
I know of many farmers in Western Canada
wlio did noV get more than four or five cents
a bushel for their barley, and f rom thirty Vo
forty cents a bushel for their wheat. This
year the crop is almoat a failure. In many
cases the farmers will noV have enougli feed
for their stock, and in tbousands of cases they
will noV geV back as mucli grain as Vhey sowed
Vhs spring. Last niglit we heard the Minister
of Labour tell about conditions in the West.
He said that from 100,000 Vo 150,000 persons
would have Vo be fed during the coming
winter. That be'ing so, I for one will flot vote
for a Bill of Vhs kind until conditions become
better.

JULY 15, 1931
On subsection 3 of section 3--terrn of
office:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, 1 raised a question yestorday in regard to the tenure of office of the members
of the Board, and my right honourable friend
to my left (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) spoke
at sorne longth on this point. I have received
no answer to the arguments that were made
in favour of a shorter terni of office, and I
stili feel that if the policy of a Government
were rojected by the people at an election
the new Government should not be hampered
by an unsympathotie Board that would bo
able to romain in office for some years. In
order to empliasize that view, I move in
amendment, seconded by the Right Hon. Mr.
Graham, that the word "ton" in the second
lino of this sub.seûtion be stricken out and
replaced by the word "five," so that the
subsection may read:
Each member shall hold office during good
behaviour for a period of five years fromi the
date of his appointment, but may be remnoved
for cause at any time by the Governor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Do I understand
my honourablo friend moved an amendment?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, to replace
the word "ten" by "five."1
Hon. Mr. ROBERTASON: There are several
reasons, which I think are pretty well known
to the Bouse, why the Bull was prepared in
this forrn. One of the principal rea.sons is
the honest effort to keep the question of
tariff inquiry free from anything savouring
of polities. Therefore it is proposod that the
torm of office for the membors of the Boarai
shall be ten years. That is based on a well
established procedent, to be found in the
Railway Act. I think it has nover been
soriously contonýded that the members of
the Railway Board should ho a.ppointed for
a period of less than ten years. Thoy are
presumod to act as guardians of the public
interest in matters within thoir jurisdictîon,
and, gonorally spoaking, I think they
have porformod that service well. My right
honourable friend fromn Eganvillo (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) referred to this matter yesterday, but het did not stress his point in regard
to the ten-yoar terni. The tariff is one of
the most important governmontal matter-s,
and only men of a high calibre, with wide
business knowledge and experience, should be
appointed as members of tho Board. If they
are to be set apart from influences that too
frequently affect mon in the public service,
thoy ought to be in a rea.sonably independent
position. It is evident that you cannot obtain

417

the services of men of the proper calibre, experience and ability if the compensation is
flot substantial, or if they are to stand in awe
of an approaching general election and in
fear of decapitation.
Right Hon. Mr. GPLAHAM: There are
some wonderful precedents for that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Thereforo a
reriod of ten yoars is suggosted. There is
the further reason that experience has taught
cloarly the undesirability of mombers of a
Tariff Board becoming candidates for election.
The advantage of their position is unfair to
the other candidates; and the possibility of
their becoming cEtndidates is unfair to themselves as well, for i.t lossens their influence.
It is urged by the Governmont, thereforeand the Bouse of Commons has approvedthat 'this Tariff Board shall ho given certain
judicial powors and be made a court of
record, and that the termi of office of the
miembors should be on a par with that of the
membors of the Board of Raîlway Commssioners.
I have no desire to enter into a detailed
discussion of the whys and wherefores. I
think that in the main they have been outlined. The Govornrnent desires the Bill to
pass as it stands, and therefore I arn opposed
to my honourable friend's arnendment.
Hon. P. L. BEIQUE: Honourable memhers,
I arn afraid that the honourablo the Minister
of Labour is losing sight of the fact that there
is no similarity between this Board and the
Board of Railway, Commissioners.
Somo Hon. SENATO ES: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This is a Bill to establish a Board dealing with political inatters.
Trhe other Board is not political. It has to
do with railway administration, which is outside of party politics. I think that a ten-year
termi would be too long, for the roason, mentioned yestorday by the honourablo leader on
this side of the Bouse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
that thore may be a change of govornment
during that time and it would ho inadvisablo
to have on the Tariff Board officiais who
would not bc in sympathy with the new Covernment. I arn inclined to agree with my
honourable friond from Manitou (Hon. Mr.
Sharpe) that on the ground of eeonomy this
Board should not ho estaiblished at this time
of depression. The services to be performed
under this Bill could well be carriied on, without extra cost, by officiais already in the pay
of the Govoroment. However, if there is to
ho a Board, I think that for the reasons that
have been rnentioned, the tern of office of
the members should be reduced to five years.

In my opinion the Board should be established, as in the past, by an Order in Council,
not by a statute. I see no reason for the
introduction of this Bill.
Does my honHon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
ourable friend regard the Order in Council
process as perfectly regular and legal in establishing a court?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: To establish a Board.
I do net see any reason why this is called a
court. It should be called a Board.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Would it not be
rather difficult to carry out the additional
duties assigned to this Board, under the Customs Act and the Combines Act, without
legislative authority?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I must confess that
I am not quite prepared to answer that
question.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In reply to the
remarks of the honourable gentleman from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), whose views
I respect very highly, I must say that I
disa.gree with the view that there is no comparison possible between this Board and the
Board of Railway Commissioners. I understood him to assert that the one has to do
with things more or less political, while the
other has not. My mind runs back over the
activities ef the Board of Railway Commissioners for some years past, and I am quite
sure that instances can be found in whieh
those activities were not entirely devoid of
political significance. If this Tariff Board is
to perform the kind of service the country
expects from it, namely, the finding of facts
relative to certain subjects and the study
of their effect on the welfare of the public
and of certain industries concerned, there is
a very great similarity between the two
boards. I am inclined to think that they are
very similar also in regard to the tenure of
office, and I am of the opinion that the tenyear period has a great deal of merit and
should at least be given a trial. Honourable
members who have heard or read the discussion that has taken place on this same
question in the other House must be convinced that the Government's objective is
wvholly worthy of support. I submit again
that the 'Government is not prepared to agree
to a curtailment of tîhe tcrm of office from
ten years to five years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend from De Salaberry bas referred to the
remarks of the honourable gentleman from
Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe). I realize the
importance of those remarks. I have exHon. Mr. BEIQUE.

pressed my surprise at the setting up of a
Tariff Board after the tariff had been cornpletely remodelled. It occurred te me that
it might be possible to dispense for the next
two years with a Board which, in view of the
two important revisions of the tariff that
have taken place, does net seem te be necessary. The Government of which I was a
member brought into existence a Tariff Board.
We did it by Order in Council, but it was
subject to the approval of Parliament. as
Parliament voted the money. Now the Goverement brings in this measure to set up a
new Tariff Board. While I cannot cite in
express terms the declaration of intention
made by the present Prime Minister when
he was speaking to the people prier to the
last election, I have a vague notion that he
obtained a general mandate for the setting
up of a, Board, and I feel that his policy on
this point should not be thwarted by this
Chamber. But we can discuss the form of
the Bill.
My honourable friend has said that in order
to insure the full independence of the members of the Board, it is to be enacted that
they shall net offer themselves for election te
Parliament wivihin two years after they have
ceased to be members of the Board. I do not
intend to ýcontrovert that statcment of policy,
because there is some virtue in it.
My honourable friend asks: "Where shall
we find men who will consent to sit for five
years? Should we not make sure of securing
the proper men by giving them a term of
ten years?" On this point I am quite sure
that if the Government were fortunate enougb
to secure mon who had the necessary qualifications for the office, and whvo proved their
qualifications and made a reputation for
themselves during a five-year term, their
services would be continued. But if, with the
best of intentions, the Government secured
men whose actions proved them to be unsuitable, it would b quite natural for the people,
should they alter their views on tariff questions and elect a new Government, to expect
that those mon would be replaced. I believe,
therefore, that the five-year tenure of office
would be a greater protection to the country,
as well as to my honourable friends themselves, than the ten-year term, for I am quite
sure that then the fair thing would be done
by the country irrespective of the political
faith of members of the Board. It is possible,
and I hope it is probable, that the men chosen
to do this work will be selected from outside
of the political field. If that is done, and if
they render the service which we hope they
will, they need net fear a discontinuation of
their services, no matter who is in power.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I would ask my right
honourable friend what his comment would be
with regard to the Board of Grain Commissioners, who were appointed in 1929, and
whose terms run for ten years at salaries of

$12,000 and $10,000 a year.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: They deal only with
grain.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I should not
be prepared to. answer unless I studied the
Grain Act.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I would suggest to
my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) that good men are net difficult
to find in Canada. We must have some pride
in our country, and we must have confidence
that in the nine provinces there are men who
are able to undertake and perform the sacred
duties of the Tariff Board for a term of five
years. The Governor General of Canada, who
is a Viceroy, is appointed for five years.
Hon. Mr. GRIEBACH:

No.

The LieutenantHon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
Governors are appointed for five years.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. Surely the
honourable gentleman does not seriously contend that there is any fixed tenure in the
appointnent of either of those officers. It is
perfectly well known that there is not. There
is a practice merely, but there is no term.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: The practice is for
flye years. I am a son-in-law of a LieutenantGovernor. When his five-year ternm was cornpleted he was appointed for a further tern
of five years. Generally speaking, the Lieutenant-Governors are appointed for five years.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
for five years.

They are not appointed

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: That is a play on
words. It is well known that in Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta Ihe LieutenantGovernors have been acting as such for five
years, not more.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: But they have not
been appointed for five years.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It is a play on
words; the practice is for five years. Now,
as regards the Railway Board, my honourable
friend from Montarville has rather exaggerated. I have followed the Railway Board
since its inception, and I say that every man
appointed as chairman of that Board bas been
an excellent man. Sonie of the names I forget at the moment, but the men who acted
on that Board, from Mr. Blair down, were the
Hon. Mr.

LEMIEUX.

best men that the country could secure. I
do not know what my honourable friend bas
in mind when he says, "Look at the Railway
Board." I am proud of our Railway Board.
Whether appointed by one party or by another, it bas always been a credit to Canada,
and I think every Canadian, of the East or
the West, is proud of that Board. It is a
court of record, and is so mentioned in the
Statute. I know that the functions of the
Tariff Board will be very important, but, as
my honourable friend himself says, the two
parties have been at loggerheads on the tariff
question since 1878. If my honourable friend
will look back he will find that before Confederation there were two parties in Canada,
the low tariff party and the high tariff party;
and it so happened that some who were at
first low tariff men became high tariff men
Hon. Mr. POPE: And they came into the
Conservative Party.
Certainly. This
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
shows that the tariff issue is a shifting issue.
For one period of time, owing to circumsiances not of their own making, men may be
low tariff men, and later, for certain reasons
originating in our own country or in other
countries, the low tariff men may be inclined
to increase the tariff. The tariff is not a
gospel. It is changed when the interests of
the country are at stake. Why make a gospel
of the tariff? I say it is an issue that may
change from year to year. Take the present
Government: it is a high tariff Government,
and strongly protectionist views are expressed
by its able leader, yet since September last it
bas been obliged to change some items which
were increased at that time. Why, then, make
the tariff rigid law? It is a law for the time
being, but surely it is not a crime te alter
that law when circunstances warrant it.
Therefore I say this tariff issue is essentially
a political question. What is the meaning of
the word "political"? My honourable friend
is an expert in Greek: if he considers the
origin of the word he will remember that it
relates to the administration of the "city,"
meaning the country. Why, then, impose on
the electors of Canada for ten years a law, or
decree, or ruling which may be condemned by
the people at the polls within five years?
Why have an immovable tribunal inspiring
awe and fear, whose decisions pronouneod on
the tariff could not bo reversed? Let us be
really serious. I am ready to vote for a fiveyear period. It is the will of the Government
to have this Tariff Board. I do not approve
of the high tariff of the Government, but it is
in power and bas a mandate from the people,

JULY 15, 1931
as the honourable leader of the Left, says.
But its mandate is for five years, and not for
ten, and I see no crime in lirniting to five
years the tern of office of that awe-inspiring
Tariff Board.
Now, let us not exaggerate things. In the
nine provinces of Canada we have able men,
stalwarts who are willin-g to serve their King
and country on the Tariff Board and could
do so with credit to Vhemselves and their
country.
An Hon. SENATOR: At a dollar a year.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I would not take
dollar-a-year men. We had experience in
that respect during the War, not so mucli
in Canada as in the United States. Many
persons in the United States who volunteered
their services at a dollar a year turned out to
be absolute frauds, and it was found when
the War was over that they had accumulatedJ
large fortunes by means of their positions3.
W'hat happened in the United States might
happen here. I say, give the men a salary
such as we pay good men in positions of
that kind, but give themn a terni of five years.
Do not in advance bind the Government
which will corne in after this one, whether
it bie a Liberal, a Radical or a Labour
Government. Things are very uncertain in
these years. Where is the Liberal party in
England to-day?
An Hon. SENATOR: It is dead.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Not dead, but in
agony. The British Labour Government is
made up of Radicals, Conservatives, Tories,
and Labour.
And univerHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sity professors.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Intellectuals and
university professors. Why should you bind
future Governments? I dislike this imposition on the future, when all may be changed.
1 will vote for the amendment to limit the
appointment to a termn of five years , because
it is common sense. My vote will not be
on party lines. When I took my seat in
the Senate I deterrnined to give the Government fair play, and in this matter the Government will receive fair play at my hands.
This is a question as to a terni of years.
Five-year ternis are enougli for the Governor
General, and for the Lieutenant-Governors.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Grieshacli)
says the Lieutenan-t-Govern-ors are not
appointed for five years, but who refuses an
appointment as Lieutenant-Governor?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I can tell you of some
who have refused.

421

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Oh, well, some have
refused because the salary was not higli
enougli or they did flot want to rust.
The honourable
Hon. H. W. LAIRD:
gentleman challenged me, and I answered.
A-fter the eloquent remarks of my honourable
friend I arn inclined to use that scriptural
quotation, "Almost thou persuadest me."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Say that louder,
please.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I arn so impressed
with what my honourable friend says that
1 am almost persuaded to vote against this
Bill. His appeal to me and to the House
and his eloquent objections to the longer
terrn have almost convinced me that he is
right; but there is one thing that brings a
doubt in my mind-just one thing-and, if
that were only cleared up, the probability
is that I would concur in his opinion. What
1 cannot comprehiend, in spite of my honourable friend's strenuous remarks, is this. When
the previous Government appointed a Board
of Grain Commissioners in 1929, it appointed
them for a period of ten years, and at salaries
exceeding those provided for under this Bill.
Now, my honourable friend was a rnember of the Government that constituted that
Board and made those appointments.
An Hon. SENATOR: No; hie was Speaker.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I should not say a mem4
ber of the Governent; I should say, per haps,
honourabie
that hie occupied an even more
and trusted position in the Government: he
was Speaker of the Bouse of Commone.
But he had been elected as a supporter of
that Government. I did not hear Qf my
honourable friend coming down fromn his
Chair, exercising the prerogative wvhich hie
had as a representative of the people, and
protesting against that Bill which provided
for ten-year appointments. I neyer heard of
him protesting against the salaries provided
under that Bill, which exceed the amount
rnentioned in the measuTe before us. So I
cannot regard the honourable gentleman as
b-eing in earnest to-day, when 1 recaîl that
such a short time ýago hie was a party to the
creation of a Board under virtually the sarne
provisions as in the ¶Jresent Bill. This is
what gives rise to a doulit in rny mind.
Otherwise I might 'have supported bis view.
I asked for an explanation frorn my riglit
honourab-le friend from Eganville (Rt. Hon.
Mr. Graham): hie was nonplussed for a
moment, and then, with that genial dis,position of bis, lie avoided the question,
leaving it in the air. I now propound it to
iny honourable friend.

SENATE
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: I rise to call the attention of my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) to the question
whether the effect of his proposition, if carried
out, would not be to embarrass a new Government whose poliýcy would not be in accord
with that of the Tariff Board. It is perfectly
plain that under such circumstances the Government would take measures to get rid of
the Board. The consequence would be that
it would have to indemnify the members of
the Board for their additional five years.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It seems to me
that such a conclusion does not necessarily
follow. The Board is really and simply a
fact-finding Board; that is all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
former one.

Just like the

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The Board will
ascertain what are the facts concerning an
industry; for instance, what is the cost of
production oif a certain article in this country
and in the countries that compete for the
sale of that article in our market. That is
the sort of information which the Government
wants in order to work out its policy. But
it docs nat at all follow that from those
same facts anotber Government could not
draw very different deductions. The Tariff
Board is created simply for the gathering and
accumulation of material to be used by any
Government for its enlightenment in (leveloping its own policy, whatever it may be.
May I take this opportunity of replying
to my honourable friend from Rougemont
It seems passing
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux)?
strange to me how ho could construe my remarks as an attack on the Railway Board.
I stated that the ten-year term enabled us to
get good representatives on the Railway
Board, and that without provision for such
a tenure of office we could not get them.
That was the whole of my argument in
this respect, and I think if my honourable
friend will read my remarks ho will find there
was no justification for the interpretation
that ho has placed upon them.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
I should like to associate myself with the
honourable member from Manitou (Hon. Mr.
Sharpe), who addressed the House on this
question yesterday. In the first place, I agree
with him that at the present time there is no
need for the organization of a Tariff Board in
the Dominion of Canada, for the reasons that
he stated. Such a Board would cost a great
deal of money, and during the present state
of affairs in Canada it is very doubtful
whether this large expenditure should be
Hon. Mr.

LAIRD.

undertaken. Another one of my honourable
friend's reasons appealed even more strongly
to me, namely, that the work a Tarif Board
could do at present has practically been done.
As was stated by an honourable gentleman
on my left, there is a cleavage or line of demarkation between the parties in the other
Chamber in regard to the tariff, which has
always been more or less an issue. We have
a low tariff party and a high tariff party in
Canada, and to-day the high tariff party i
in power. During the short session of Parliament last fall, as well as at the present session, the tariff question has been considered
and responsibility has been taken by the
party in power for setting the tariff as high,
surely, as anybody could naturally expect.
As is well known, I have been during my
lifetime-possibly it may be said I have had
a lifetime prejudice-opposed to high protection in this country. We have a high
protection tariff in Canada at present, and I
suggest, with my honourable friend from
Manitou, that we should try out that tariff
during the next four years and see what effect
it will have on the country. Should the
effect be beneficial, then my honourable
friends on the opposite side of the House will
deserve and receive a great deal of credit for
advocating such a tariff.
I will go further than my honourable
friend from Manitou, and say that personally
I am nat wedded to the idea that we need
a Tariff Board. At all times the Minister
of Finance, whoever he may be, and the
Government of the day, have full power and
authority to deal with tariff matters. They
are able to get all the facts required, and they
have the opportunity of consulting the best
informed men in -the country, men who are
well versed in economie and political affairs.
We know from experience that a Tariff
Board can be expensive. The proposed new
Board would be more costly than the old one,
because, as we have been told by the honourable gentleman who is piloting the Bill
through the House, the intention is to establish a court. The salaries of the members
would represent only a small part of the
total annual outlay for this body. I repeat
that, as my honourable friend from Manitou
has said, we should consider very carefully
whether we need a Tariff Board, since we
can have it only by making such a heavy
expenditure.
In regard to the amendment to reduce the
term of ofice for members of the Board from
ton to five years, I agree to a large extent
with what has been said by my honourable
friends on this side of the House, but not

JULY 15, 1931
altogether for the sarne reasons as they expressed. 1 take my stand nlot so much upon
the ground that a new Government coming
into office at any time shouid be able to
appoint a Tariff Board of its own, as upon
the ground that during the next three, four
or five years the members of Parliament and
the people as a whole will have time and
opportunity to make up their minds as to
wbether we need a Tariff Board ini Canada.
If the Board isfound to be unnecessary, we
should not keep it longer than we have to.
For that reason, honourable senators, I shall
vote in favour of the amendment for the fiveyear termi.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: The Minister of Labour
irntimated that meinhers of the Tariff Board
should be "set apart," and 1 think someone
on this side of the House referred to their
"Isacred duty." I was almost going to suggest
that apparently these men will be "consecrated" to their duty-that they will be
"sacred" men. But I do not know where such
men wîll be found. 1 differ fromn the honourable gentleman who said that there would be
difficulty in finding men to act on this Board;
but if they had to be of the calibre suggested
by the Minister of Labour and some others, I
do think there would be difflculty.
The tariff policy of the present Government
is well defined. The present Prime Minister
has had no hesitation in stating what hi$
policy will be for the next four or five years.
I think we ail recognize his courage and
sincerity in putting his program into effect.
But now At is suggested that he is going to
get a Tariff Board to advise him what to do.
Is anyone so simple as to believe that sany
Tariff Board will be created that wjll in any
way change the policy that is at present being put into operation?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not think it is
possible, and I do not think we have any
right to expect it. I feel perfectly sure that

JULY 15, 1931
(Translation) There is a general principie
which the present Prime Minister is apparently very scrupulous in observing, nameiy,
that the varjous governmentai officiais shouid
be mn sympathy with -the Government itseif.
Two recent facts prove clearly the truth of
this assertion. first, the successive resignations of ail the members of the différent
harbour commissions upon the present Government's coming to power; secondly, the
immédiate replacement of the High Commissioner for Canada in London and the appointment at Washington of a new personage, in
sympathy with the Government.
My honourable friend fromn Bedford (Hon.
Mr. Pope)-who, because of bis education
being broader than that of other members of
this Chamber, shouid understand what I arn
saying at present-treated with a satiricai
sInile the honourable senator from Brandon's
(Hon. Mr. Forke's) remark that there wouid
probably be a change of government in three
or four years. I wonder why, if the friends
of the present Government are so sure of its
permanency. they deemn it necessary to insert
in this Bull the long terra of ten years for the
members of the proposed Board, in order to
continue to govern even after the people
have turned them out of office.
I would cail attention aiso to the remarks
oi my honourable friend from Regina (Hon.
Mr. Laird) with reference to the honourabie
scenator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) The honourable gentleman from Regina is
scandaiized because the honourable senator
from Rougemont, when presiding over the
flouse of Commons, did not consider it his
duty to express an opinion at the time of
the establishment of the Board of Grain Commissioners. The reason why he thus refrained
may perhaps be found in the fact that the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Lemieux),
who was then Speaker of the Commons, had
a greater respect than others have for the
traditionq of thýat high office.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not want to
proiong the discussion, exccpt to suggest that
subsection 3 of section 3 of 'the Bill does
not provide irrevocably for a ten-year tcrm.
It provides that:
Rach member shall hold office during good
behaviour for a period of ten years from thse
date of bis appointment, but may be removed
for cause at any time by thse Governor in
Council.
So I should say that if at any time thse rnembers of the Board were not behaving properiy, in the opinion of the administration then.
in office, it would be quite within the power
of the administration to relieve the members
of their duties. But by that time this whole
discussion may weil1 be forgotten.
The only other matter to which I wish to
refer is the statement of the honourable mernber for Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) that
the Board would not be a court. I refer him
to subsection 6 of section 5, which declares
tiatThse Board shall be a court of record, and

On the preanble:

Before the
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Committee reports, may I say a word? I
see here a section providing that the decisions
of the Board shall be embalmed in the Canada
Gazette. I would suggest that in the regulatiens some additional method should he devised for the distribution of this information
to the publie. As a matter of fact, no person
in business would think of a notice of sone
transaction that required publicity being published in the Canada Gazette. I do net say
that the notice should be in a newspaper,
because my honourable friend over there
(Hon. Mr. Laird) and myself might he
thought selfish. But this reference te publication in the Canada Gazette is a stereotyped
phrase. The public do net know anything
about the Canada Gazette for ýthe disseminatien of news. The old Tariff Board had a
mailing list of the names of those who were
likely to be interested in what might come
before the Board. It was the practice te send
copies of all applications to persons whose
narnes appeared on that list, and to give
notice when hearings were going to b hield.
Within a very short time the new Board will
have such a list-and -it will grow very rapidly.
This should overcome in large measure the
difficulty in the mind of my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who wondered
wbether persons whose interests were adversely
affected would hue an opportunity to appear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I suggest
that my right bonourable friend is now discussing section 12, in Part II, which refers to
decisions under the Customs Act. I may be
ristaken, but I do not think that it relates
to the necessity of publishing Tariff Board
findings. They are findings of fact, and will
b reported to the Finance Minister, and to
Parliament as required. The publication in
the Canada Gazette, referred te, relates, I
presume, only to decisions of the Tariff Board
wlhen functioning in connection with Customs
Board matters.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Undoubtedly;
but the public will be just as much interested
in the decisions of the Board in that connectien as on anything else. I am net confining
myself to any -clause of the Bill. I rose merely
for the purpose of making a suggestion as
to how the public might be informed of what
is being dono. My honourable leader raised
the question. "Would an industry whose manager thought its interests adversely affccted
have an opportunity to come before the Board
or protest against a decision that he thought
had been made?" The only answer was a
quotation from 'the Bill. I think that in any
Right Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

case an opportunity would be given; but if
there is proper publication of notice as to
the time when hearings are to take place
nobody will have any excuse for net appearing
before the Board. I aippeal for more publicity
of the decisions of the Customs Board as well
as of 'the Tariff Board.
The preamble was agreed to.
The title was agreed te.
The Bill was reported without amendment.

Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND:

To-morrow.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With the consent
of the Senate, I suggest that it be read now.
Word has just lately been received that an
Interim Supply Bill will be 'brought to this
House before it adjourns, and that there is
to be a Royal Assent at about 5.45. If we
could give this Bill the third reading now it
would be disposed of. I am in the hands of
the House, but that is my suggestion.
I would draw
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend's attention te a very
great danger that might follow the sanctioning of this Bill this afternoon. If this Boarl
were to start its work to-morrow it might
thwart the Prime Minister's schedules now
before the House of Commons.

But the country is looking an the Senate, and
is pricking up its ears, because it has learne.that we are discussing things with some intelligence and, at times, with sorne vim,
even though we are over seventy. I think
that in dealing with this very important
measure that we have been discussing for a
day or two it would be better ta adhere
to the rule. It does flot look as though the
Government were trying to hurry us--I know
it is not--and I arn sure that it would look
better to let the motion for third reading

0F ALIENS BILL

SPEOIAL

COMMITTER

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN moved concurrence
in the report of the Special Com.mîttee ta
whom was referrcd Bill Ai, an Act ta provide
for Alien Identification Çerds.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the honourable gentleman be able ta inform this
House as tû the departments which have been
cansulted in this matter?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The Immigration
and the Justice Departments.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCIÇ: I notice that in
paragraph (a) of section 2 these wards occur:
(a) "alien" means a persan who is not a
British subject.
How does it corne that we see in the newspapers that a number of British qubjects have
been deported from Canada during several
rnonths past because, as I understood, they
were regarded as alien.s?

427

Hon, Mr. GRIESBACH : I did not hear
that question. What is the statement?
Hon. .Mr. MURDOCK: Section 2, as it is
before us, says:
2. In this Act, and in ail Orders in Cauncil
and regulations made hereunder, unless the context otherwise requires,(a) "alien" means a person who is nat a
British subject.
When this matter was under discussion before,
I asked the question-which sornebody said
wvas foolish-whether my honourable friend
from Brandon (Han. Mr. Forke) and myseif
would be required ta fill out alien identification cards. This clears the matter up for us:
we do nat appear ta be rcquired ta fill out
such cards. But in the press recently we have
read of numerous instances where it was said
that British subjects had been deported.
Why? Were they aliens?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If I understand
my honourable fricnd rightly, his question has
na bearing on this Bull, because the de finition
of siiens is clear as set out in paragraph (a)
of section 2. My honouraible friend's question
refers ta a newspaper repart stating that,
probably under the immigration law, certain
British subj ects have been deported. Well, I
arn sorry ta say that I cannot cive my honourable friend any satisfactary a'nswver as ta
thase newspaper reports; but I repeat that
bis remarks are f areign ta the present Bill.
Han. Mr. MURDOCK: "Alien," as here
interpreted, wouid appear ta be different from
"alien" as mentioned in the Immigration Art.
Lý that it?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In answer ta that
question I must say that the definition has
been taken from both the Immigration Act
and the Naturalization Act; it is theref ore
well known in law, and well tried for a number of years. Certainly, as my honourable
friand can see, the word "alien" does nat include a British bubject.
Hon, J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members, when this legîsiatian was being considered before the second reading, I expressed
the opinion that the Bill as introduced wauld
not attain the abject its pramoters desired.
But the Bi was given second reading and
referred ta a speciai cammittee.
The Bill as naw before us is virtually a
new Bill, but the best that I can say for it
is that it is less abjectionable than the other.
I still think, however, that it is objectianable,
and I shaîl endeavaur ta point out some of
the reasans. Section 4 is a great impravement
on the original Bill, as it ducs nat require
an alien in this country ta fill out his identification card until hie has been given a proper

SENATE
chance to become a British subject; but, as
I pointed out before, many of the people
who ara giving us trouble along the lines
referred to are British subjects, and this Bill
will not apply to them. I think iýt is class
legislation. If you carefully read section 3 of
the Bill you will find, in regard to certain
restrictions placed upon immigrants coming
into this country, that the restrictions apply
to people coming in by vessel. Section 2,
paragraph (c), gives this definition:
(c) "vessel" includes every boat and craft of
any kind whatsoever for travel or transport
other than by land or inland or coastal waters.
The practical effect would be that only those
coming by ocean boats would be obliged to
get identification cards before they came
ashore.
Now we have the foim of identification card.
It would be necessary for every alien to have
bis photograph and to answer the questions
on the card. It appears to me that the
requirement that the alien shall ha-ve bis
photograph taken will be very difficult to
carry out on vessels bringing in immigrants.
Another objeetion to the measure in its
present forin is this. I understood from the
promoters that they proposed to bring in a
Bill that would net apply to Americans.
Though it does not apply to Americans coming in at present, yet, as I read the Bill, it
does apply to Americans who are in this
country now and have not become British
subjects. They will be liable to all the penalties imposed by this measure.
In committee I took objection also to
section 9:
9. Any alien or other person who knowingly
makes any false statenent of fact in order ta
procure the issuance or renewal of a card of
identification shall be guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to> seven years inprisonnient.

I took the ground that seven years' imprisonment was an excessive penalty. I was met
with the argument that that is the usual
penalty for perjury. That may be true, but
it does appear to me to be a great hardship
that a stranger coming into our country, who
perhaps does net understand the English
language, should become liable to seven years'
imprisonment if, having been brought before
a tribunal, and being in a difficult position,
he makes a misstatement. That penalty seems
to me an unreasonable one to impose.
I think the Bill is very involved, so much
se as to be unworkable, and J do net think
it would be in the interest of the public, or
enhance the reputation of this Senate, to send
the Bill over to the House of Comnmons in its
present form.
lon.

Mr. DONNELLY.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I endeavour
to answer my honourable friend? His first
objection is that this Bill does net apply to
British subjects. Of course it does net, and
it is not intended te do se. It is not a
panacea for the cure of all the ills of the
country. The intention of the Bill is to allow
Canada to exercise better supervision and
control over the alien element in this country
that is causing trouble. That is as far as the
Bill is intended to go, and I do not think it
would b possible to extend it beyond those
limits.
As to the second point, respecting the photograph. I readily admit that it presents some
difficulty, yet the majority of the members of
the Special Committee, who carefully studied
this matter, came to the conclusion that the
photograph was one of the most useful elements in the case. I think that is truc. The
best means of identifying a man is bis photograph. A description such as you have on a
passport, giving a man's height, the shape of
bis face and the colour of bis hair, does not
go very far in enabling the police to identify
him. If by requiring a photograph the law
is rendered somewhat more difficult of application, it becomes by that very fact more useful.
After all, honourable gentlemen, whenevcr
an alien applies for permision to enter this
country he must provide himself with a passport, which must contain bis photograph, and
it should not be a hardship for foreigners or
aliens in this country to pay the very small
sum of money required to provide the photograph exacted by the law.
Now, as to the penalty for a false statement.
The statement referred to in the section in
question is a sworn statement, and if it is
false it involves perjury. If I understand hiaim
rightly, my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly) would like ta reduce that penalty,
as it appears to him to be too severe. Suppose
we reduced it, say, to one yrar, what would
happen? We should create two distinct classes
of people in the eyes of the law. According
to the Criminal Code every Canadian who
makas a false statement in a sworn declaration
is liable, under a charge of perjury, to seven
years' imprisonment; but under this Bill, if
modified as suggested by my honourable
colleague, foreigners would be liable for a false
statement made under oath to only one year
of imprisonment instead of seven years in the
penitentiary. Does that appear to be just,
or even reasonable?
The Committee considered this matter, and decided that for any
violation of the law a foreigner should be
punished in the sanme manner as a Canadian.

JULY 15, 1931
Then, as honourable members can see, the
penalty for all other offences is limited to a
$100 fine or three months' imprisonment.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I would ask my
honourable friend another question. Let us
suppose that 15 Germans, 10 Swedes and 14
Italians were to land, coming, in bond or
otherwise, by rail to Toronto, MQntreal, or
elsewhere. Under this proposed measure, how
would you handle those?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am perfectly
willing to admit that the law is not watertight. It is not intended to be water-tight.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I make a
suggestion, then, with a view of being helpful? I know something about the quota
regulations in effect in the United States.
I think you will find that regulations as
brought down frorn time to time in the
United States never refer to Canada as
Canada, or Canadians as Canadians. In
order to give effect to your purpose, and to
oover the point I raised a moment ago, I
think you should have section 3 read this
way:
3. Every alien of more than sixteen years of
age, from other than North American countries, upon entering Canada with the intention
of residing in Canada, shall before arrival
cemplete on oath . . . .
That covers the matter, whether the aliea
comes in on a vessel, or train, or stone-boat,
and wherever he comes from. A Mexican or
an American is not referred to as an alien
under the provisions of this Bill; and already
the British subjects are exempted.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I thank the honourable gentleman for his suggestion, but I
may point out to him at once that we were
very careful net to indicate any country
which would either be subject to or exempt
from the application of the law. There is
always something undesirable in a law that
creates a preference clearly defined between
nations; therefore those who drafted the Bill
did net wish to state that it should not apply
to such or such a country, thereby creating a
preferred or priv.ileged class of nations in contradistinction to all the others.
The second objection I wish to emphasize
to my honourable friend--and it is a very
serious one-is this, that when immigrants
come by rail it is very difficult to find the
time required for the registration, aid for
distribution of cards. When immigrante come
by boat from across the ocean there are six,
seven or eight days during which all those
formalities can be complied with. It was
pointed out by the Department of Immigration that the question of time was of great

429

imiportance when immigrants entered the
country, and that nothing must be done to
stop or interfere with the flow as it comes in.
Therefore I ar afraid that if this suggestion
of my honourable friend were adopted it would
be rather difficult for the law to be applied
to immigrants who come to this country by
rail.
Now I have just one more remark to make
in reference to the Bill. My honourable
friend from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
has made what is the most dangerous accusation against the Bill, because it is one that is
general. He says that this law is involved. It
is simple to rend, te understand and to
apply. The two depaxtrnents whom we consulted, who seem most interested in the subject and are most familiar with it, believe
the Bill can be applied. After all, honourable
gentlemen, it is r.ot very difficult when the
immigrants come across the ocean on a
steamer to have them register. As a matter
of fact tbey already have to register. Sure'ly
there would not be anything difficult about
handing them their carda. Therefore it would
be an easy matter to make the Bill applicable
to people coming into the country. Aliens
already in Canada who refuse to become
meambers of the Canadian family, but wish
to remain in the country, will have to make a
statement under oath and obtain cards of
identification frorm the municipality in whieb
they live. That cettainly will not work a
hardship upon anyone, and it will not be so
severe as the law concerning aliens in
European countries. Eight days after his
arrival in a European city where he intends
te reside a stranger must secure a card of
identification, which he must use as a passport. It requires five years for an alien to
qualiify for naturalizaition in this country,
and he will not be compelled to take out a
card until six months after tht period has
ela,psed. Those aliens who already have been
in the country five years will still have six
monthe within which to exercise their option
to become naturalized. It would seem that
there would be no difficulty in putting the
law into operation; so I think we may forget
objections that have been made on that
ground.
The important consideration is that the law
is necessary. If my honourable friend had
been in touch with the police of Montreal and
had given the sarne study to the matter as I
have, he would know what troubles the police
have in keeping watch over a great number of
aliens. If he knew all the facts, and especially
what an amount of trouble and expense is
caused by many of these aliens, I thinki he
would be more sympathetic towards this Bill.

430

SENATE

He would be agreeable, I think, to placing
this new weapon in the hands of those
entrusted with the maintenance of law and
order in the land.
I wonder whether our people realize how
much money is lost because of strikes that are
fomented here and there throughout Canada
by aliens. Because of these activities, a great
number of police and detectives have to be
employed and a wide variety of protective
measures taken. And many of the people who
cause this trouble are paid by foreign money.
i feel sure that if my honourable friend were
acquainted with the true situation he would
see the necessity of keeping track of such
trouble,makers and, if possible, getting rid of
thom when they are convicted of wrongdoing.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Carried.
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable senators, I am
perhaps a little late, but I shall not take much
time. According to section 4 of the Bill, the
persons who are required to carry these cards
are those who fail to apply for a certificate of
naturalization within six months following their
qualification, or who, having applied for such
certificate, are denied the same by the proper
authorities. But there is no provision for
determining whether a person has been justly
or unjustly denied a certificate. How is it to
be known whether the authority who refuses
to issue a certificate acts properly or not? Two
or three years ago we had before the Senate
a Bill designed to make it easier for aliens
to become naturalized, but that Bill was rejected here. If we pass this Bill, the sum of
our action will be that we have made it as
difficult as possible for an alien to obtain
naturalization, and we punish him for not
obtaining it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think that the
qualifications that must be possessed by an
applicant for naturalization are, among others,
a good reputation, supported by a favourable
report of character, the ability te speak either
French or ECnglish, and residence in this
country for five years, or at least in some
other British Dominion and Canada for five
years. Of course, it is possible that the application of an alien for a naturalization
certificate might he unjustly rejected. What
means have we of ascertaining whether that
happens so frequently that it should be
guardcd against in this Bill? We must act
on the assumption that the laws of Canada
are properly administered.
We know that
they are administered by humans, and that
humans are not perfect.
I submit to my
honourable friend that tie reverse of what
he suggests happens very often. Within the
lion.

Mr.

BEAUBIEN.

last

month, I understand, a report was made
by a special commissioner that some 129
naturalization certificates were improperly
issued.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Does that not prove that
the issuers are not infallible?
And if they
are fallible in one direction they may be so
in another.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I readily admit that
they are not infallible. But my honourable
friend's objection was that certificates might
be improperly refused.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Carried.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable senators,
I regard this as a very important matter. The
Bill, as amended in committee, probably contains some merit, but my impression is that
the procedure which is now recommended is
net sound. The Bill was introduced here some
time ago and referred to committee, and as
a result of the committee's amendment we now
have what is virtually a new Bill. It is truc
it appears in the Minutes, but so far as I
know it has not been printed, as aniended
by the committee, and distributed. My bonourable friend beside me (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
has criticised ce-tain clauses in this measure,
and se have honourable members on the other
side of the House. Instead of our going into
Commsittee of the Whole te take up the
clauses separatelv, we are asked to vote for
or against this new measure as a whole. We
bave had no opportunity of amending the
present sections, and I say this is not good
practice.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The point is
well taken.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: In the second place
there is no hope that the Bill will be passed
bxy Parliament during this session. As my
honourable friend beside me suggested, before
we send a Bill of this kind to the House of
Commons we should see that it is as nearly
pcrfect as we can make it. Now, in order to
do that we shall have to take some time in
considering the matter. As I say, there is no
hope of getting the Bill through Parliament
this year. I therefore move that the debate
be a(journed until Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators,
i have no objection at all to my honourable
friend's motion. I fully appreciate that a Bill
of this kind, which introduces a new method
of dealing with aliens, should be studied with
a great deal of care. I should be grateful if
honourable menbers would make it a point
to study the Bill and let us have the benefit

431

JULY 15, 1931
of their suggestions when the matter comes
before us again. I am quite willing that the
debate should be adjourned until next Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable senators,
I do not object to the motion. I may say
that a great deal of attention has been given
to this Bill by the committee, and especially
by the honourable gentleman from MontarThe Bill deals
ville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
with a very delicate matter, and I had hoped
that the Senate would adopt the Bill at a
future sitting, with whatever amendments, if
any, were found necessary.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Tanner, the debate
was adjourned.
RELATIONS OF SENATOR WITH
DOMINION GOVERNMENT
MEMBERSHIP OF SPECIAL COMMITTEENOTICE OF AMENDMENT TO RULES

The Senate resumed from Thursday, July 9,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Béique:
That the following senators be named to
serve on the Special Committee appointed to
inquire into the advisability of a rule being
adopted by the Senate defining the nature and
extent of the relations of a member of the
Senate with the Dominion Government:
Honourable Senators Béique, Copp, Dandurand, Graham, Hardy, King, Lewis.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable senators,
if reference is madt to page 362 of the Debates
of this House it will be found that I made the
following statement on the 8th of July:
My mind is entirely open as to the advisability of enacting a rule under which any
member of the Senate would in the future
be debarred from the right of receiving
any remuneration from a client for services
rendered to him in dealing with the Government or any of its departments. A rule of
that kind would tend to elevate the standing
of the Senate and of its members; but such
a rule would constitute an entirely new
departure.
My intention, as expressed at the time, was
that my motion should not be interpreted or
considered as a reflection upon the honourable
member whose conduct was the subject-matter
of discussion. I have since drafted a rule
which I should like to suggest to the House,
and I will give notice of it now. It is in the
following form:
No senator shall be entitled, directly or
indirectly, personally, or as a member of a
firm, or as a shareholder of a personal or
family corporation, to any benefit or profits
resulting from relations, either by himself or
by such corporation with the Government or
any of its departments.

The words "shareholder of a personal or
family corporation" should be explained. If
honourable members will refer to the Revised
Statutes of 1927, Chapter 97, they will find
that the two kinds of corporations are there
defined. Section 2, subsection (d) reads:
"family corporation" means a corporation
(other than a "personal corporation") seventyfive per centum of the stock of which is owned
by the members of one family, one or more of
which members take an active part in the
business operations of the corporation, or a
corporation (other than a "personal corporation") eighty per centum of the stock of which
is owned by persons actively employed in the
business of the corporation or by such persons
and their families.
Subsection (i) of the same section defines
"personal corporation" as follows:
"personal corporation" means a corporation
or joint stock company (no matter when or
where created) controlled directly or indirectly
by one person, who resides in Canada, or by
one such person and his wife or any member
of his family, or by any combination of them,
or by any other person or corporation on his
or their behalf, whether through holding a
majority of the stock of such corporation, or
in any other manner whatsoever, the gross
revenue of which is to the extent of one-quarter
or more derived from one or more of the
following sources, namely:
(i) From the ownership of or the trading or
dealing in bonds, stocks or shares, debentures,
mortgages, hypothees, bills, notes or other
similar property,
(ii) From the lending of money with or
without security, or by way of rent, annuity,
royalty, interest or dividend, or
(iii) From or by virtue of any right, title
or interest in or to any estate or trust.
Two days' notice has
proposed new rule of the
able members will have
considering my suggestion
the matter again.

to be given of a
Senate; so honouran opportunity of
before we take up

Would the honHon. Mr. McMEANS:
ourable gentleman tell us what is the penalty
in case of violation of the rule?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think the penalty
will be easily defined if a member of this
House violates its rule.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:

Expulsion.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would point out
that this body has no control over the senators. They are appointed for life. Even if
they violate the Independence of Parliament
Act, they are only subject to a fine, and then
not until it is sued for in the usual way.
I do not think this House has any right to
expel a member for any violation of the rules,
because he is appointed by the Government
for life. I do not see the use of making rules
unless there is a penalty for their violation
that can be enforced. I believe the Senate

SENATE
can make rules only in regard ta procedure;

TARIFF BOARD BILL
EXPLANATION

OF REMARKS

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable senators, I rise to make a personal explanation. When my good friend the senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) was
speaking on the Tariff Board yesterday, ho
made a statement which I misunderstood. I
caught the first part af what he said, but,
because of an honourable colleague sitting
next to me, I did net catch the latter part.
My honourable frie.nd from Montarville did
not speak against the personnel of the Railwav Board. He said:
May I ask my honourable friends opposite,
especially moy honourable friend the leader on
the left (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)-who, no doubt,
in days gone by lad to advise his Government
in the selection of proper representatives for
certain boarde, particularly the Railway Board
-to revert to the past?
I understood that he was criticizing the Railway Boards of the pat.
Unfortunately, I
failed to follow him to the conclusion of his
sentence. I do net know ivliether my statement cau be expunged from the Debates, but
I apologize to the honourable gentleman for
having misintcrpreted his remarks.
Hon.

Ir. WILLOUGHBY.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I thank the honourable gentleman for his generous retraction.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Honourable senators,
the honourable gentleman from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) says that because of
an honourable senator sitting near him he did
net understand what was said. As I am the
the honourable gentleman's deskmate, :I
should like further information as to that.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I beg to say to my
genial friend from La Salle that it was another gentleman who was sitting next to
me at the time. He is not in the House
at present.

THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. L. McDOUGALD:
Honourable
members of the Senate, I rise to a question
of privilege. As honourable members know,
a committee of the House of Comnions is
at the present time investigating the affairs
of the Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power
Company. In the discussion that led up to
that investigation my name had been montioned, and on a former occasion I rose in
this Chamber to a question of privilege and
explained my position in the matter. I think
it is only right and fair that I should give
to honourable members of the Senate the
official statement which bas been presented,
through my attorney, to the committee of the
House of Commons, setting forth my reasons
for net appearing before. that committee. I
should like the privilege of reading the statementHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Honourable
senators, a point of order. The honourable
gentleman is not in order, because we are at
the Orders of the Day. But I am sure the
Senate will be only too delighted to give the
honourable gentleman an opportunity to
make his statement. I am heartily agreeable
to giving him that opportunity.
Hon. Mr. McDOUGALD:
I thank you
very much. This is the statement which my
attorney gave to the committee of the House
of Commons:
Senator McDougald upon my advice bas
decided not to attend the present committee
of inquiry for the following reasons:
1. No proof has been made of any of the
matters that lie has been charged with and
therefore there is nothing before this committee
that he can be called upon to controvert.
2. In Mr. Gardiner's speech of May 19, 1931,
delivered in the House of Commons, he stated
"that the people of Canada to-day are asking

JULY 16, 1931
if that statement made by Senator McDougald
If it is not true, then Senator
is true.
McDougald deliberately deceived the Senate
The statement
and the people of Canada."
referred to by Mr. Gardiner as having been
to say here, and
made was as follows: "I want
say it with emphasis, that I do not own a
dollar's worth of stock in this enterprise, and
have no interest in or association with that
company in any way, shape or form." The
company referred to was the Beauharnois
Light, Heat & Power Company.
3. An attempt bas been made to prove that
this statement was untrue by adducing evidence
to the effect that Senator McDougald at the
time of his rnaking that statement was interested in the Sterling Company, a company incorporated to study the possibilities of power
developrnent in the Soulanges section of the
St. Lawrence River and develop such power.
Senator McDougald's statement was to the
effect that he was not interested in the Beauharnois Light, Heat & Power Company, which
is an entirely different matter from the development of power in the Soulanges section of the
St. Lawrence River.
4. Further, after the application had been
made to the Department for the diversion of
waters in 1924, the matter was left dormant,
and when Senator McDougald was asked by
Mr. Henry to proceed further with the matter
he was told by Senator McDougald that in view
of the latter's appointment to the National
Advisory Committee lie would not pursue his
interest further at this time, and it was not
until the late summer of 1928 that any deal
was made by the Beauharnois Company for the
purchase of the Sterling Company's assets,
under the terms of which Senator MeDougald
acquired interests in the Beauharnois Company.
This, many months after his declaration in the
Senate, April 19, 1928.
5. As regards Senator McDougald's connection with the Beauharnois Company as a result
of his acquisition. in the name of J. P. Ebbs,
of the interests of the late W. B. Sifton, this
was not made until after his speech in the
Senate, April 19, 1928, and equally cannot
militate against the truth of his statement.
I find the statement difficult to read, and
with the permission of the Senate I shall
place the remainder of it on Hansard.
6. Evidence has been made in connection
with the sale of the assets of the Sterling
Company with the apparent purpose of showing
that Senator McDougald made undue profits in
the matter, to the detriment of the Beauharnois
Company. Mr. Sweezey, on behalf of the
Beauharnois Company, was the buyer and
agreed to the price suggested by Mr. Henry
for reasons which he considered good and sufficient; and as a matter of fact Mr. Sweezey
showed good judgment in purchasing such
assets, as, he thereby acquired for his company: (1) Mr. Henry's technical engineering
knowledçe and experience; (2) Senator McDougald s assistance as a person able to furnish
capital when required, and (3) particularly the
removal of the obstacle that stood in the path
of the company by reason of the prior application of the Sterling Company for the diversion
of waters, etc., which prior rights, had same
been acquired by other inimical interests,
miglit have prevented his company from proceeding in the carrying out of his plans.
22112-28J

435

7. Anything in connection with the above
does not reflect on Senator McDougald, and
for this reason I have advised him that there
is nothing he is called upon to controvert.
Senator McDougald invested large sums of
money in the enterprise, and is one of the few
who still hold all the shares they acquired in
the company.
8. Senator McDougald's second reason for
declining to appear before this committee is
that one of his judges is both his accuser and
judge, whieh is contrary to the elementary
principles of the administration of justice; and
lie is satisfied that public opinion will support
his refusal to appear before his accuser who is
also sitting in judgment in the matter.
9. Senator McDougald's third reason for
declining to appear before the committee is
that neither this committee nor the House of
Commons by which it was constituted has any
power or authority to investigate the conduct
of a member of the Senate of Canada.
10. Senator McDougald authorizes me to
make the following statement:
That at the end of May, 1928, W. B. Sifton
came to Senator McDougald and urged him to
purchase his interest in the Beauharnois
Syndicate held in the name of L. CIare Moyer,
giving as his reason ill-health and the fear that
lie could not carry on his activities in the
Beauharnois Company much longer. He asked
Senator McDougald to buy out his whole interests in the Syndicate held by Moyer, offering
the same at the price he had paid for them.
The Senator accepted the ofer and refunded
to Mr. Sifton the amount he had invested in
the Syndicate.
Now, honourable members of the Senate,
in concluding that statement my attorney said
there was another place where I could be examined if my colleagues saw fît. I earnestly
ask that a special committee of the Senate be
appointed at once to investigate my interest
in, and my connection with, the Beauharnois
Power Company, and I assure the Senate
that I will facilitate in every way the bringing before the committee of any material it
may require, to substantiate anything I have
said; also that I will put before it the facts
concerning my interest, as to how and when
it was aoquired, and as to my connection with
that company from its inception to the
present time. I may say that I am, I think,
one of the few who still have all their original
shares in the venture. I have never sold a
share; on the contrary, I purchased more
shares after the venture got under way, and
still have them.
I ask that honourable members of the
Senate give my petition consideration, and I
assure them that it will take but a very short
time for me to explain in detail my position
with regard to everything I have had to do
with the projeet. There is nothing for me to
bide, nobbing that I am ashamed of. I have
no apologies to make, and I should welcome
an investigation by honourable members of
the Senate.

SENATE
The Hon. the SPEAKER: As the Rules require two days' notice of a motion for the
appointment of a special committee, it would
be advisable for the honourable senator to
give notice of motion.
TARIFF BOARD BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. WIIJLOIUGHBY moved the third
reading of Bill 47, an Act to provide for the
appointment of a Tariff Board.
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: Honourable
senators, I should like to move an amendment
to the motion for third reading of this Bill.
I want to say that I am taking this action
individually. My amendment is not a partisan amendment, or anything of that kind
at all. I have not consulted my leader. I
am taking my stand as an individual member
of the Senate, and I think that is perhaps a
good thing for any senator to do. It may be
that we who come to this Chamber cannot
altogether put aside tihe feelings of party
allegiance which we have had in the past,
but I think it is net a bad thing to get rid
of those feelings as far as possible and try to
deal in an independent and non-partisan
manner with any matter that comes before
us. I am going to more that this Bill be
not now read a third time, but that it be
read a tihird time this day six months.
I listened very carefully, a few nights ago,
to the graphie description by the honourable
Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) of
his tour throughout Western Canada and of
the existing conditions in this country. It was
a very arresting statement and one that gave
us evidence of the fact, with which perhaps we
were to a certain extent already familiar, that
the financial situation, from the standpoint
of the Covernment and of municipalities all
over Canada, is net as good to-day as it was
seoe timr ago. I was not in the House when
my honourable friend from Manitou (Hon.
Mr. Sharpe) spoke on this Bill. Having read
his remarks, I think he struck the right note.
I submit, honourable senators, that if ever
there was a tine in the history of Canada
when we should exercise economy and carefulness in the expenditure of money, this is
such a time. From this viewpoint, the present is probably a more important period
than any other since Confederation.
It seems to me altogether unnecessary ta
appoint a Tariff Board at the presont time.
A Tariff Board may be a good thing, but why
the hurry? As the previous Board was appointed by Order in Council, it was casily
Hon. Mr. McDOUGALD.

disposed of, and we are now being saved the
large expenditure that otherwise we might be
making.
While a Tariff Board appointed under this
legislation would not be a judicial body, it
would have very wide powers of investigation.
As I understand the Bill, the intention is that
the Board should investigate manufacturing
costs, not only in Canada, but in every country in the world. That is a pretty large order.
I do not know whether that indicates an intention to have agencies in Paris, London,
Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, Japan, China, Australia, and every other place of importance
under the sun, but I suppose it would be
nocessary to have some such organization if
the terms of this Bill were put into full effect.
That would mean considerable expense. The
cost at the outset might net be very great.
but the Board, in common with all such
establishments, would grow. The number of
its employees would increase, and in time
it would become a huge machine spending
thousands and probably hundreds of thousands
of dollars of money belonging to the people
of Canada. And I submit that we can ill
afford to make expenditures in that way at
the present time.
As bas previously been stated in this Chamber, the prosent Government bas already
grappled with the tariff question. On two
separate occasions the Government, in its
wisdom, bas increased the tariff. It seems to
be fairly cognizant of all the important tariff
matters, and I cannot understand why it
wants to saddle the country at the presont
time with a fact-finding commission, at
tremendous cost to the people.
The only
reason I can conceive of for such a thing
is that somebody may want a job, and want
it in a hurrv.
Among the very wide powers of this proposed Tariff Commission would be the power
to examine witnesses under oath. Just how
far that would extend we do net know, but
it certainly would bo going pretty far to give
a commission, acting directly under a Govcrnment, the authority to pry, at its discretion,
into the private affairs of people in any section of the Dominion. Such authority would
perhaps not be so much out of the way if it
were given to a purely judicial body, but
this Board would be nothing of the kind; it
would bo an agency for the Government,
acting directly under instructions of the Government, and that means it would necessarily
be a partisan commission. I do not sec how
it could possibly bo anything else. I should
not like to have a partisan commission come

JULY 16, 1931
down to the Province of New Brunswick and
investigate the private affairs of the manufacturers down there.
I am moving the amendment because it
seems to me that the Senate should place
itself on record in a case of this kind. Some
people have the opinion that it is not within
the duties of the Senate to move for the
rejection of any Bill that the Government
has introduced, and there is a hesitancy on
the part of many members of the Senate to
interfere with any action of the Government.
So far as I am concerned, I have no desire to
interfere with the Government's functions. We
know that the present administration was
elected by a popular majority in favour of a
high tariff. For my part-and I think this is
truc of every member of the Senate-I am
quite willing that the Government should
have every opportunity to carry out its
policies and to test the effect of them by
actual operation throughout the country.
Time alone will tell whether those policies
are good or bad. Individually we may be in
favour of free trade, or moderate protection,
or a high tariff, and we may make arguments
in support of our belief; but these arguments
will change no one's opinion, because the
more we argue the more strongly will menbers on each side of the House hold to their
opimons.
As I have already said, I do not think it is
necessary to inflict an expensive Tariff Board
upon the country at the present time, when
our attention has been called to the necessity
of providing relief for the unemployed and
financial assistance to tide over the present
situation, particularly in Western Canada,
where the crops are a complete failure. The
Government of Canada will have its hands
full for the next few months without bothering
about a Tariff Board. A Bill of this kind
can just as well be introduced at another
session as now, if it should be found necessary.
Some analogy was drawn yesterday between
the Grain Commission and the proposed
Tariff Board. The appointment of the Grain
Commission may have been a great mistake.
I am not saying it was, but it may have been.
In any event, the conditions existing when
that commission was appointed were quite
different from those facing us to-day. If it
should be true that the previous Government
made a mistake in appointing the Grain
Commission, is that any argument for making
another mistake by appointing a Tariff Board?
I heard the honourable gentleman from Regina
(Hon. Mr. Laird) say yesterday that he was
almost persuaded to support an amendment
to the Bill. In view of the ilogical reasons

which he then gave for supporting the Bill,
I thought that perhaps he might be fully
persuaded to change his mind to-day.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Wait and see.
Hon. R. FORKE: If honourable members
will allow me, I should like to make a brief
statement. Yesterday I forgot to mention
that until last year the Grain Commission
was paid entirely by profits made from farmers' grain. It was not costing the country
anything.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Why did it flot continue that way? It is wasting a lot of money
to-day; that is dead sure.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: That may be, but it
did not cost the country anything up to last
year.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I do not wish to
elaborate my proposition further. I rose in
my place, as a private member, simply to
put myself on record. If some honourable
member will second my amendment, I will
move that this Bill be read a third time this
day six months. I have not even asked for a
seconder.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I second the motion.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It is seconded by
the Hon. Mr. Lewis.

NOTICE

OF MOTION

On the motion to adjourn:
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
members, although the Order Paper has been
cleared, may I say a word in reference to the
remarks of the honourable gentleman who,
at the opening of the session this afternoon,
presented a question of personal privilege and
suggested the appointment of a committee to
investigate certain matters touching a member of this Chamber? Without having had
an opportunity to give the question much
thought, I believe that under a rule of the
Senate a motion along the lines of the one
suggested must be preceded by two days'
notice, and the rule has not been complird
with.
It may be said also that the Senate, at the
request of the House of Commons, gave
leave to the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
McDougald) and two others to appear and
give evidence before a committee of the
Commons that for some days, if net weeks,
has been inquiring into certain matters. That
committee is still sitting; I believe it is :n
session at this moment. Despite the consent
of the Senate, the honourable member (Hon.
Mr. McDougald) has seen fit to decline,
through his counsel, the invitation te appear
before that committee.
I think it is fair te suggest that the rights
of any member of this Sonate, no matter
which side of the House he sits on, are in
no way impaired by the fact that temporarily
ho may be under a cloud. It was his option
to accept or to reject the invitation to attend
the committee of the other House. He chose
not te accept it, and now asks that a committee of this House be appointed te inquire
into the same matters in regard to whichli he
has declined to give evidence before the
committee of the Commons.
I submit that if a committee of the Senate
were to be established, it should be done
upon the motion of the honourable member
who made the statement, because his rights
in this House have as yet been in no way

439

impaired. Therefore it would be in orderand I rose particularly ta mention this--for
him ta g-ive notice of thec motion that he
desires this flouse ta consider. When that
notice is given, and the motion cornes
regularly before the Senate, it can be properly
deait with. If in spoaking as a layman I
have displayod a lack of comprehension af
the situation, any legal gentleman who
desires to correct my statement is at liberty
ta do so., Speaking as one who has had a
few years' oxperience in this Chamber and
lias perhaps a reasonable understanding of aur
rules, I beliove that if the honourable mcmber who spoko on a question of personal
privilego dosiros the establishment of a committoe of tho Sonate, ho should himself give
notice of ý motion, which could thon bc
deait with under our riiles.
Do I understand
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
my honaurablo friend ta say that the hoourable gentleman has ta givo notice ofthe
motion and thon select the committec himself?
Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did not say
anything about selecting the comnmittee. The
first question ta ho decided is: Should a
comrnittoe be esta'blishod for the purpase mndicatod? If it were docided ta establish such
a cammittee, its personnel would be quite
anathor matter.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAMflonourable members, it does flot strike me
quite that way. If an honourablo member
of the Sonate wants an, opportunity ta give
evidence before his colleagues with respect
ta any matter whicb, justly or unjustly, may
be reflecting upan him, ho bas the right ta
ask this flouse ta appoint a committoe; but
the mombor himself sbould nat givo notice
of motion for the appointment of a committee, nor should ho move the motion. The
honourable gentleman from. Wellington (Hon.
Mr. McDougald) bas asked the flouse ta, givo
him an opportunity ta appear before a comnmitteo, and the question now is whether the
flouse will or will not do so. The hanaurable
leader of the Govornment can, of course, if
he sa desires, give notice of motion.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I fully agree with the
right honourable gentleman. I think it ù~
vory rnuch out of place for the senatar wha
lias made this explanation ta give notice of
motion for tho appointment of a select eornmittee. Not only the leader of the Gavernmont, but any momber of this Chambor,
other than the anc cancorned, has the privilege
of giving notice of motion.

bers, I have the highest regard for the legal
ability of the mover of this motion. At the
týime lie gave notice of it I asked him what
penalty he had provided for any infraction
of the rule. 1 understand that the Independence of Parliament Act, iwhich is intended
to regulate the conduet of members of this
House, provides a penalty of $200 for every
day it is contravened; but action must be
taken within a year. Now, if we were to

House except those to regulate procedure,
under which an honourable member may be
called to order by the Speaker. I suppose His
Honour the Speaker might call upon the
Sergeant-at-Arms or the Gentleman Usher of
the Black Rod to put out an unruly member.
While I have the greatest sympathy for the
honourable gentleman's motion, I do not
think a rule of the Senate would serve any
useful purpose. As has been suggested by the
leader on this side of the House, the question
would have to be dealt with through an Act
of Parliament, which must be passed by both
Houses. We know that there is a great deal
of criticism about this House at the present
time, and probably it is time to pass such a
rule as the honourable gentleman bas suggested, but I cannot sce what possible effect
it would have unless there were some way of
enforcing it.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I am quite unable to see how this rule could
work out. I have in my mind the case of a
corporation that had business with a department in connection with a rebate on income
tax. I happened to be connected with that
company, and that is why I speak of it as a
senator. The company, having in some marvellous way overpaid its income tax, not by
a large amount, but to the extent of twenty
odd thousand dollars, made application for
a rebate, and received back the sum of
$22.000. Although I was a director of the
company, I did not personally know that
such an application was being made, but
when the time came to declare a dividend
of course I as a shareholder got some profit
and benefit froin that. So far as I can see,
this rule would place such a director in an
exceedingly difficult position. He is taking
a profit, and it bas required dcaling with a
department.
If the honourable member who moved this
resolution refers to services rendered by a
senator for the purpose of obtaining such a
rebate-that is, to a senator going before a
department for a fee-I should say that would
come within the Act alrcady in force. As I
read the motion, it says that no person who
happons to be a senator may attend to the
business of, or even be a shareholder in, a
coipany that is recoiving any rebate or anything of that kind from any department. As
my honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Smeaton White) has said, we have in this
very Chamber probably a half dozen honcurable senazors who are newspaper men,
whose papers are necessarily more or less
prominent, simply because they belong to
senators, or the senators make them promiHon.

Mr. McMEANS.

nent. I have no doubt that every one of
these papers bas certain dealings with the
departments. if only in the matter of rendering their bills from time to time, because they
do public advertising. I know that the paper
in Brockville is the only one in the district,
and it carries Government advertisements from
time to time. So it is with the honourable
senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan). What position are these honourable
gentlemen to be placed in-to say nothing of
cases where joint stock companies of which
they are members may secure contracts of
greater or less amounts?
I think that the whole cule would work
such hardship that a man who is a member
of a joint stock .company paying dividends
could not sit here. I might also bring in
the point as to a barrister. No senator could
be a member of a firm that took any parliamentary work at all. None of the partners
of a senator could come to a department and
attempt to negotiate work for any clients,
because the senator, as a member of the firn,
would probably receive some benefits or profits from the fees in that connection.
I think that, as the honourable leader of
the Government has said, this is a matter
which requires very long, careful and serious
consideration. I am absolutely against the
proposed rule.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I rise to a point of
order, honourable members, on the ground
that this matter is already, and bas been for
some time, before the House. No. 2 of the
Orders of the Day states that the honourable
member for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique)
has on the Order Paper a motion to be dealt
with this evening, as follows:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion
of Honourable Senator Béique that the following
senators be naned to serve on the Special
Committee appointed to inquire into the advisability of a rule being adopted by the Senate
defining the nature and extent of the relations
of a miember of the Senate with the Dominion
Government.
I may say that a motion relating to this rule
has been before the House since July 9, having
been first placed on the Order Paper by the
honourable member for De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique), and it bas not been disposed
of. The same honourable gentleman comes
forward this evening and moves a motion
which is practically to the same effect, inasmuch as it provides a new rule thatNo senator shall be entitled, directly or indirectly, personally, or as a member of a firm,
or as a shareholder of a personal or family
corporation, to any benefit or profits resulting
fron relations. either by himself or by such
corporation with the Government or any of its
departmients.

443

JULY 21, 1931
Now, I would refer ta the Rifles of the
Senate, No. 25a, which has a bearing on this
question. It reads as follows:
No question or amendment shall be proposed
which is the samne in substance as any question
or amendment which, during the samne session,
bas been resolvefi in the affirmative, or negative,
unless the order, resolution or vote on sucli
question or amendment lias been rescinded.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: No; I arn discussing
the question of brînging in an amendment
punishing men who may be
for the purpose oAf
guilty.

It is possible that the wliole of. Rule 25a
does not apply to this case, but I submit
that the Order standing in the name of the
honourabie member for De Salaberry for disposai to-night, which lias been on the Orders
of the Day since the 9th of July, should have
priority, and should lie disposed of before the
resolution which lie lias moved to-niglit, and
which is now before the House. I submit that
these twc motions of the honourable gentleman directly deal witli the saine subjeet; consequently the motion now moved by him is
not in order, and the subi ect properly cornes
up first under No. 2 of the Orders of the Day.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The rule quoted
by the honourable member, No. 25a, says:
No question or amendment shall be proposed
which is the saine in substance as any question
or amendment which, during the saine session,
has been resolved in the affirmative, or negative,
unless the order, resolution or vote on such
question or amendment has been rescinded.

.Hon. -Mr. BEIQUE: The lionourable gentleman evidently saw that bis first objection
wvas not propemly taken, because when lie came
to rend the mile lie saw that no resolution had
been actually passed. As te, the second point,
snrely tlie honourable gentleman can hardly
be seius in stating that tlie relative position
of matters whicb come before tliis lionourable
J-buse may not lie clianged. An item in tlie
Orders of tlie Day lnay lie the fimst order today andi the fourth or sixth to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Does my lionourable
fiend think it easonable for liim to bave
before tlie House haîf a dozen motions dealing witli tlie sarne subjeet?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Honoumable members,
1 fail to see liow tliis mile could possibly interfere with newspapers that liave dealings
with the Governmnent. This is not an Act,
or an amendment to an Act or statute; it is
simply a proposed mule of Vhis Chamber, and
as regards providing penalties, or anything of
tliat kinfi. it does not arnount ta anytliing.
We enact ruies only for our guidance, for the
purpose of governing procedure in variaus
phases of the business in the House. Even
if this rule were adopted it would have no
effect, for it cannot be enforced, as lias been
pointefi eut, tliere being no penalty provided.
If it is necessary te provide a proper penalty
for those wlio are guilty of an infraction of
the law, then aur statute sliould be amended.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:- Is the lionourable gentleman discussing tlie peint of arder?

Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
the point of order.

Order! Order!

I ask for a ruling on

I understand that rule as affecting a vote,
a motion or a resolution which lias been
deait witli by the House. But I think there
may be on the Order Paper more than one
motion of the same kind. The moment that
one is resolved in the affirmative, or in the
negative, it does away with the others. 1
would say that if the Senate took action on
the present motion, the point taken by the
honourable member would be correct and the
second order could not be called.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDtJRAND:
members of the Senate, some time ago I
stated that we had no mile covering thevarions activities of a member of the Senate
in his relations with the Government or its
departments, and I thouglit it would be of
advantage to the Senate to, appoint a cernmittee of this Hanse to see if a general rule
could not be framed, or some line drawn,
as between certain things which. should be
permissible and others which should not
be. I realize that the matter is net a simple
one, and I should have preferred that a
commîttee deal with the whole problem.
I was glad to hear my honourable friend the
leader of the Government repeat virtually
what I said-that probahly in our investigation we miglit find it desirable that a joint
cornmittee of the twa Houses sliould be
established for the purpose of uniformity.
Just now, however, we are dealing with this
proposefi mie of my honeurable friend from
De Salaberry:
No senator shall be entitled, directly or indirectly, personally, or as a member of a firm,
or as a shareholder of a persona] or family
corporation, to any benefit or profits resulting
from relations, eitlier by himself or by sncb
corporation with the Government or any of its
departments.
Amendmnents made be made to the present
motion, but, if we are now going te a vote.
1 shall vote in the affirmative.

SENATE
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, as far as I am concerned, I should like
a little more light on this subject before voting. One thing I should like to know is whether
we are being asked to adopt a rule of ethical
conduct, as my honourable friend the leader
on the other side not very long since expressed
it, or are being asked to enact a law. If a
law is to be passed, the light in which the
matter appears to me is very different from
what it would be if the proposition were
merely to declare some ethical principle. My
honourable friend the leader on the other side,
during a discussion of kindred subjects not
long ago, drew a very clear distinction between what he called the ethical side of the
subject and the legal side. As I say, I am still
cloudy as to what the honourable member
from De Salaberry means; whether he means
that this House should adopt a rule that is
within the meaning of a law-a law set out in
our Statute Book-or whether he is merely
asking this House to declare an ethical principle.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

I would say-

Hon. Mr. TANNER: If my honourable
friend will permit me, I will finish the few
remarks I have to make. This subject-matter,
as I sec it, has been before this House in
three distinct stages. At the first stage an
honourable senator, without anybody in this
House making a charge against him, voluntarily made a statenent of certain facts, or
what we presuine were facts. He told the
Hose all the facts in connection with a
matter in which he was concerned. Thereupon a proposal was made on this side of the
Hoiuse to the effect that there was a duty
upon the Senate to consider those facts. No
one was making any charges against the honourable member, but he accused himself. In
order to approach the matter with due dignity,
it was proposed from this side of the House
that the Senate should appoint a committee
to consider the facts stated by that honourable member, and to advise the Senate what
ought or what ought not to be done, or
whether anything could be done.
The majority of the honourable members
of this House brought on the next stage when
the honourable member for De Salaberry
moved an amendment to the motion to which
I have referred. That amendment virtually
obliterated the motion made on this side. In
other words, honourable members who were
in the majority said, "We will not take these
matters into consideration," and they voted
accordingly.
Hen. Mr. DANDURAND.

We have at presont on the Order Paper a
motion precisely the same as the one that was
made from this side; a motion asking for a
committee to consider a statement made by
another honourable member of this House a
few days ago.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: It is, in effect, precisely tihe same motion which honourable
members on the other side of the House
voted down.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Motion No. 2.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Not word for word
the saine, but it embodies the same poiicy
and the sanie principle.
At the second stage the honourable member
from De Salaberry gave notice of a motion
for the appointment of a conmittee to consider the advisability of making a rule. Now,
at another stage, we are confronted with a
motion for the adoption of the rule itself,
which the honourable member for De Salaberry has drafted.
There we are, and I am at a loss to understand just where we fit into this matter.
Then there is this other aspect of the question. This Senate Chamber is not Parliament, but only a constituent part of it.
The House of Commons, the Senate and the
Governor
General
constitute
Parliament.
So far as I know, the Senate and the House
of Commons are the only bodies that can
legislate for this country; but this Senate cannot of itself make a law, nor can the Conmons of itself make a law. Parliament is a
purely statutory body, created by the British
North America Act, which confers legislative
authority on it, and not on this Senate nor the
House of Commons alone. That Act governs
the privileges and immunities of Parliament.
Now, we have chapter 147 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, which my honourable
friend from De Salaberry bas quoted to-night.
On the subject under discussion that is the
only law. My honourable friend may make
ton thousand rules such as he proposes, but
if those rules are not within the four corners
of chapter 147 they amount to nothing more
than waste paper, in my judgment. I should
like to hear whether I am right or wrong on
that point.
Whait does the honourable member propose?
He proposes thatNo senator shall be entitled, directly or indirectly, personally, or as a nember of a firm,
or as a shareholder of a personal or family
corporation, to any benefit or profits resulting
froin relations, either by himself or by sueh
corporation with the Government or any of its
departments.

JULY 21, 1931
Now, section 21 of chapter 147 of the
Revised Statutes of 1927 says:
No person, who is a member of the Senate,
shall directly or indirectly, knowingly and
wilfully be a party to or be concerned in any
contract under which the public money of
Canada is to be paid.
That is the law. Does my honourable friend
from De Salaberry propose that that law
Or does he propose
should be enlarged?
to narrow it? If so, where does he get the
authority for enlarging or narrowing it? Can
this Chamber alone alter a statute that has
been passed by Parliament? It seems elementary to me-I may be labouring under a
misapprehension--that no such thing can be
done.
My second point is that this statute which
I have just read is fully as comprehensive as
the rule which the honourable gentleman
proposes. Notwithstanding all the law that
has been quoted in this House on previous
occasions, I am bouid to say that it is my
opinion. and I take the risk of stating it, that
the words "or be concerned in" are just as
comprehensive as any words in the motion
before us.
The proposed rule would apply not only to
a senator personally, but to any senator in
his capacity as a member of a firm, or as a
shareholder of a personal or family corporation. I would draw attention to subsection 4
of section 21 of chapter 147 of the Revised
Statutes, which reads:
This sectionThat is the one I have already read, which
provides that no senator shall be a party to
or concerned in any contract under which the
public money of Canada is to be paid.
-shall not render any senator liable for such
penalties, by reason of his being a shareholder
in any incorporated company, having a contract
or agreement with the Government of Canada,
except any company which undertakes a contract for the building of any public work.
In view of the statutory provision that a
senator shall be exempt from certain penalties
"by reason of his being a shareholder in any
incorporated company," I should like to know
where my honourable friend gets his authority
for saying that this Chamber can make a rule
that would render a senator liable by reason
of his being a "shareholder of a personal or
family corporation." As I have always understood, the greater includes the less; therefore,
since a senator in his capacity of shareholder
of an incorporated company is exempt from
certain penalties, he would not be made liable
merely because the company happened to
be a family corporation-or the Beauharnois
Corporation. All that the law requires is
that the company be incorporated: if I

445

am a shareholder in a corporation, any corporation. that has a contract with the Government, the law exempts me.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I can
only say, with all deference to my honourable
friend, that unless lie is proposing this rule
as a declaration of ethics-that is, if le is
asking this House to adopt it solemnly as a
law binding upon the Senate-he is wasting
time.
•

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: May I ask the
honourable gentleman from De Salaberry a
question? He is familiar, as all other honourable members are, with the matter which
brought about this whole discussion, namely,
the case in which the honourable the senior
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) was
concerned. I should like to ask him this: If
the rule le now proposes had been in force
some years ago-as least two years agowould the conduct of the senior senator for
Ottawa have been contrary to that rule?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think I have already
stated my opinion in that respect. I have
said on two or three occasions that there was
no rule at the tine, and therefore nothing had
been violated.
That is not in
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
reply to my question. My question is: If this
rule had been in existence at the timeHon. Mr. BEIQUE: Of course, if this rule
had been in force there clearly would have
been a violation of it.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Beique
negatived on the following division:

On the notice of motion:
That a Special Cominittee of

of the Senate be appointed to inqire into and
report

ipon

the

matters

referred

to

by the

Honouirable Senator McDougald at the sitting
of the Senate on the 16th day of July. 1931.
in regard to his connection with the Beauharnois J'ower

Corporation.-lon. Mr. Hardy.

Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable members, when I gave notice of this motion, at the
last sitting of the Senate, I did so very hurriedly, as I said at the time, just as the
House was about to adjourn. In that notice I
referred to the 16th of July because I thought
the statement made by the honourable senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. McDougald)
on that date covered everything he had said
here upon the question, including his remarks
on the occasion when he considered that he
was attacked. As the honourable senator had
stated, both in this Chamber and publicly,
that he would not appear before a committe
of the Hoise of Commons, and as he asked
for a committee of members of the Senate, I
felt it was only fair to him that a committee
of this House should hear what he had to
say. It seemed to me, when I gave notice of
the motion, that only by appointing such a
committee could we get a statement from the
honourable gentleman. Since that time there
have been other developments, and I believe
that my motion is not now necessary. Strictly
according to the rules I am not compelled
to rise or say anything at all; I could merely
signify to the Clerk my intention to withdraw the notice. But I did not want to place
myself in the attitude of running away
from the motion, once I had given notice of
it, and I much prefer to leave myself in the
hands of my colleagues. It is my intention
to withdraw the notice, but should there be
any question of my rigit to do so without the
unanimous consent of the Sonate, I would
lon. Mr. BEIQUE.

respectfully ask for it, although I do not
think it is necessary. I ask for leave to withdraw the notice.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Before unanimous
consent is given for the withdrawal of the
notice, I should like to offer a few observations
on this matter. The House is familiar with
the sequence of events. On a certain date a
committee of the other House desired that
House to issue an invitation or request to
three members of the Senate for them to
testify before that committee, and in due
course the request came before us and was
considered. The Senate, in giving its consent
to the attendance of the three members, safeguarded its constitutional rightsHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the honourable gentleman allow me to interrupt him?
Is there anything before the House?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN,
ing before the House.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

No, there is nothYes, there is.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There was a
notice of motion, but the motion has not been
moved. So I ask His Honour the Speaker if
there is anything before the House.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
The honourable
gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy)
moved that the notice be withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentleman has moved that it be withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: No; pardon me. I said
that I should like to withdraw it, but that I
was in the hands of the House. I have not
made a motion.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The bonourable
gentleman asked for unanimous coneent to
withdraw.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I ask His Honour
the Speaker if there is anything before the
House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion proposed by the honourable senator from Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy) is at present before the
House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

But it is net

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: It is before the House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is the motion
fo withdraw.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It
is not
necessary to have a motion for withdrawal.
Before any discussion can be in order there
must be something before the House.

JULY 21, 1931
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: The motion is before
the House.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I stated that I withdrew
the notice.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentleman asked for unanimous consent.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator mentioned the unanimous consent of
the Senate, being in doubt whether he was at
liberty to withdraw his notice. He is at
liberty to do so. If he desires te drop his
notice, he should se signify.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Drop.
TO DISCUSS
MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT
MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourable senators, I beg leave te move the adjournment of
the House, for the purpose of drawing attention to a matter of urgent public importance.
As I was about to observe, the House is
familiar with the sequence of events in this
matter. There was, first, a request from the
other House that we should permit three
members of this Chamber to go down to that
House to testify before the committee now
sitting. This House, in giving its permission
to the three members to attend that committee, adopted the formula dictated by precedent, having regard for the rights, privileges
and immunities of members of the Senate,
and concluded the permission with the words
"if they sec fit."
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Is the honourable gentleman debating on the motion to adjourn?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: A motion to adjourn
is not debatable.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is, for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgent public
importance.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The motion to adjourn
is not debatable.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am not discussing the motion to adjourn; I am discussing a matter of urgent public business.
The House, in putting the words "if they
see fit" at the conclusion of the consent,
thereby declared its adherence to an ancient
and constitutional right, that members of this
House cannot be compelled to go before a
cormittee of the House of Commons. Of
those thrce members the honourable gentle-

447

man from Lanark (Hon. Mr. Haydon) submitted medical evidence that he was unable
to attend before the committee; the honourable member for De la Vallière (Hon. Mr.
Raymond) attended and gave evidenoe; and
the honourable gentleman from Wellington
(Hon. Mr. McDougald), through his legal
adviser, who appeared before the committee
in another place, gave, in a carefully prepared
statement, four reasons why he should not
attend-in other words the reasons why he
would exercise his constitutional right, .his
personal right, to refuse to appear before that
committee, if he saw fit, even though he had
the consent of this House.
On the 16th instant the honourable gentleman from Wellington, from his place in this
House, read the reasons which his counsel
had, given before the Beauharnois Committee
for his refusal to attend, and in addition he
made these observations:
I think it is only right and fair that I should
give te honourable members of the Senate the
official statement which has been presented,
through my attorney, to the committee of the
House of Commons, setting forth my reasons
for not appearing before that committee. I
should like the privilege of reading the statementThen he read the statement, and he concluded
with these words:
I ask that honourable members of the Senate
give my petition consideration.
He decided te exercise his constitutional
right to refuse to go before that committee. He
se informed the committee, and so informed
this House; and I submit that thereupon
there was laid upon this House the duty and
obligation of asserting its right, going to the
rescue of the honourable gentleman, and defending him from any attack that might be
made upon him. I venture to assert that all
the members of this House, regardless of
what their opinions may have been as to the
wisdom of the course taken by the honourable gentleman, were prepared to support him
to the utmost in the position he had adopted.
In furtherance of this earnest request the
honourable gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) moved for the appointment of a committee of the Senate te conduct a similar investigation.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He gave
notice.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: He gave notice.
Then the committee of the House of Commons issued its subpoena to the honourable
gentleman from Wellington (Hon. Mr. McDougald). Without any notice to this House,
and, I gather from the remarks of the honourable gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr.

:48

SENATE

Hardy), without any notice to him, the honourable member from Wellington turned up
in the committee of the House of Commons
and there gave testimony.
I submit that under the circumstances, and
in order that mistakes may be avoided in
the future, it is proper at this time that I
should place on Hansard the law with respect
to this question of members of the Sonate
being compelled to appear before a coinmittee of the other House. The law on the
matter is to be found, in the first place, in
the British North America Act, section 18,
as amended by 38-39 Victoria, chapter 38,
1875, which reads as follows:
't'he privileges, immunities and powers to be
held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Senate and
by the House of Commons, and by the Members
thereof respectively, shall be such as are from
time to time defined by Act of the Parliament
of Canada, but so that any Act of the Parliament of Canada defining such privileges, immunities and powers shall not confer any privileges,
imnunities, or powers exceeding those at the
passing of such Act held, enjoyed, and exercised
by the Commons House of Parliament of the
United Kingdoin of Great Britain and Ireland,
and by the Members thereof.
Then in section 4 of the Sonate and House
of Commons Act, chapter 147 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, we find these words:
The Senate and the House of Commons
respectively, and the inembers thereof respectively, shall hold, enjoy and exercise,
(a) such and the like privileges, immunities
and powers as. at the time of the passing of
the British North America Act, 1867, avere
held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons
Bouse of Parliament of the United Kingdom,
and by the memubers thereof, so far as the same
are consistent with and not repugnant to the
said Act; and
(b) such privileges, immunities and powers
as are from time to time defined by Act of the
Parliament of Canada, not exceeding those at
the time of the passing of such Act held.
enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House
of Parliament of the United Kingdom and by
the meuibers thereof respectively.
You will notice it is provided, not that the
privileges, rights and immunities of the members of the Sonate of Canada shall be equal
to those of the members of the louse of
Lords, but that the rights, privileges and iumunities of the Sonate of Canada shall be
equal ,to those 'of the House of Commons
in Great Britain.
Rule 94 of the Sonate of Canada reads as
follows:
94. When the attendance of a senator, or any
of the officers, clerks or servants of the Senate
is desired, to be examined by the Commons,
or to appear before any committee thereof, a
message is sent by the Commons, to request
that the Senate will give leave to such senator,
oficer, clerk or servant to attend; and if the
Soenate grant leave to such senator, be may go,
if he thinks fit; but it is not optional for such
officer, clerk or servant to refuse.
lon. Mr.

GRIESBACH.

You will note the distinction between the
members of this House and the servants of
this House.
Without such leave, no senator, officer, clerk
or servant of the Senate shall, on any account,
under penalty of being comnitited to the Biack
Rod or to prison during the pleasure of the
Senate, go down to the House of Commons, or
send his answer in writing, or appear by counsel
to answer any accusation there.
and
Rules
Beauchesne's
Parliamentary
Forms, second edition, page 198, note 677,
reads as follows:
Whenever the evidence of a Senator is required before a Commsittee of the Commons, it
is usual for the Chairman te move in the House
that a message he sent to the Sonate requesting
their Honours to give leave to . . . . one of
their members, to attend and give evidence
before the Select Committee, etc.
Bourinot's Parliamentary Procedure, fourth
edition, page 480, states:
Whenever the evidence of a senator is required before a committee of the Commons, it
is usumal for the chairman to move in the House

that a message be sent te the Senate requesting their honours to give leave to . . . . one
of their members, to attend and give evidence
before the select committee, etc. The Senate
will consider the message and give the required
leave te the senator, "if he thinks fit." If the
attendance of a member of the Commons is
required before a committee of the Senate,
the sanie procedure will be followed. In the
case the attendance of an officer of either House
is required a message will he sent; but in the
message in reply the words, "if lie thinks fit"
are omitted.
At page 158 of the Debates of the Sonate
of the session of 1883, in speaking to a motion
to permit certain senators to attend and give
evidence before a coimittee of the House
of Commons, Hon. Mr. Miller, pointing out
that a member of the Sonate has no right ta
go before a committee of the other House
without the leave of the Sonate, made the
following statement:
It is a very important privilege of this
Houtse and should be strietly regarded.
May's Parliamentary Practice, thirteenth
edition, page 578, reads as follows:
If the evidence of a member he desired by
the House, or a Committee of the Whole House,
ie is ordered to attend in his place on a certain
day. But whben the attendance of a mnember as
a witness is required before a select committee,
the cbairmsan sends to iim a written request
for his attendance. Pursuant to the resolution
of the l6th March, 1688, if a member of the
House should refuse, upon being sent te, to
couse to give evidence or information as a
witness to a committee, the committee ought to
acquaint the House therewith, and not summon
suols member to attend the committee.
There bas been no instance of a member
persisting in a refusal to give evidence: but
members have been ordered by the House to
attend select commsuittees. In 1731, Sir Archi-

JUIY 21, 1931
bald Grant, a member, was committed ta the
custody of the Serjeant-at-arms, "in order to
bis forthcoming to abide the orders of the
House,"' and was afterwards ordered to be
brought before a committee, fromn time to time,
in the custody of the Serjeant. On the 28th
June, 1842, a committee reported that a member had declined complying with their request
for his attendance. A motion was made for
ordering him to attend the committee, and give
evidence; but the member having at laist
expressed bis willingness to attend, the motion
was withdrawn.
If the attendance of a peer should be desired,
to give evidence before the House, or any coinmittee of the House of Commons, the House
sends a message to, the Lords, to request their
lordships to give leave to the peer in question
ta attend as a witness before the Huse or
committee, as the case may be. If the peer
should be in bis place when this message is
received, and hie consents, leave is immediately
given for him to be examined, if hie think fit.
If not present, a message is returned on a
future day, when the peer bas, in his place,
consented to go. Exactly the samne form is
observed by the Lords, when they desire the
attendance of a mnember of the bouse of Comnmons. The attendance of a member to, be
examined, when the Lords are sitting on the
trial of an impeachment is secured by means
of a message: but if the Lords be sitting as a
court of criminal judicature on the trial of a
peer, they order the attendance of a member
of the bouse of Gommons without message.
Whenever the attendance of a member of the
other House is desired by a committee, it is
advisable ta give him private intimation, and
to learn that hie is willing to attend, before
a formal message is sent to, request bis attendance. But these formalities, tbough occasionally
adopted, are flot usual or necessary in the case
of private bis. where the attendance of members of either House as witnesses is voluntary.
If a cnember shouid be in custody when leave
îs given him to attend the House of Lords, the
3erjeant-at-arms is ordered to permit him to
ittend, in bis custody.
The same ceremony is maintained between
the two blouses in requesting the attendance
of offcers eonnected with their respective
establishments: but when leave is given them
to attend (see p. 583), the words "if they think
fit," çvhich are used in the case of members,
are omitted in the answer.

fore a cornmittee of a Hlouse other than the
House of Commons; and thfat theref are a
member of the Senate is nlot obliged to attend
as a witness before a committee of a House.
other than the Senate.
In this case the honourable gentleman froma
Wellington was asked for by-the other House,
and the consent of this buse was given for
him to attend if hie saw fit. He did not eee
fit, and he took a most public manner of
declaring that it was not his intention to go.
He threw himself into the arrus of the Senate.
The Senate, I take it, stood ready to uphold
its ancient prîvileges, rights and immunities.
In answer to a subpoena of the committee of
the Hue of Commons, and without a word
of warning to this House, the honourable
gentleman attended and gave evidence before
that committee. Out of these cirftumstances
a precedent may he estahlished. It may be
assumed by the publie, or by the press and
a great many people, that a subpoena of the
bouse of Commons runs in this Senate whenever it is seen fit to issue one; and it is for
this reason that I hiave risen to caîl attenition to the rights, privileges and immunities
of the members of this bouse in respect to
compulsory attendance hefore committees of
the House of Commons. There is danger that
the case of the honourable gentleman from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. *McDougald) may be
taken as a precedent, and it is now desirable,
either by the recording of this debate, or by
a f ormai motion of this bouse, that it be
made clear that this House does nlot acquiesce
in the action of the bouse of Gommons in
this respect, nor does it relinquish the rights,
privileges and immunities which constitiitionally belong to members of this bouse.
I have much pleasure in withdrawing my
motion to adjourn.
The motion was withdrawn.

Standing Order No. 64 of the House of
Lords provides that:
No lord shah! either go down to the House
of Commons, or send bis answer in writing, or
appear by counsel, to, answer any accusation
there, upon penalty of being commîtted to the
custody of Black Rod, or to the Tower, during

From the foregoing it seems to be clear
that a mensber of the Senate shail hold, enjoy
and exerrise such and the like privileges, immnunities and powers as were held, enjoyed
and exercised at the time of the passing of
the British North America Act, 1867, by mem.ý

the Senate with that of the Commons, and
the making of the Law Clerk's Branch a part
of the Justice Department.

PRIVATE BILL
THIRD READING
Bull 30, an Act respecting the St. Lawrence
River Bridge Company.-Hon. Mr. Hardy.
IDENTIFICATION 0F ALIENS BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING-DEBÂTE
ADJOURNED
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN moved the third
reading of Bill Ai, an Act to provide for
Alien Identification Carde.
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
I should like ta
ask the honourable gentleman what procedure
or method existe, either under this Bill or
under our general laws, for identifying gunmen and other bandits who invade Canada
from the south.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I understand that
under the general law every persan wha
crosses the line has to register. I think I
mentioned to the House previously that the
Immigration Department objected ta the
proposai that Americans who came ta Canada,
whether for the purpose of reeiding here or
not, should be subject to the identification
carde, and therefore Americans were excluded
from the operation of this measure. The
Bill would ciympei people who corne ta Canada
by vessei ta register and to carry an identification card. My honourable friend wili ses
that the word "vessel" is defined in paragraph (c) of clause 2 of the Bill as follows:
"vesel" includes every boat and craf t of
any kind whatsoevsr for travel or transport
other than by land or inland or coaetal water.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
Sa that
suspicious characters who invade aur towns
and cities remain under the control af the
police and, on suspicion, may be arrested and
have their records investigatcd?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know that je
not altogether satisfactory for those who wish
the law applied ta ail aliens, but, as I have
already stated ta the House, the committee
felt it was wise ta follow the recommendations
of the Department of Immigration.
Hon. J. MURDOCK: Honourabie senators,
my honoura:ble friand is entirely mistaken in
suggesting that everyane whio crosses the line
has ta register. I speak with some knowledge,
22112-89J

for 1 think I have crossed tihe line more oftexi
than any other member of this House. Ail
that an American citizen, whether a gunrnan
or not. needs to do is ta suggest that he is
coming into Oanada for a short time-that
hie intends to return to the United States
after a brief visit. We are living in an age
in whiah, to some extent, untruth, camouflage
and four-flush are prevaient, and in rny judgment the effect of this Bill would be to plaLce
a further prexnium on things of that sort. I
shou.ld be whole-heartediy in f avour of the
Bill if Canada could proceed in a businesslike
way to keep an e.bsoiute check upon every
alien within our borders. But this Bill does
flot propose that. Ail that this Bill proposes
is the placing of a mark upon those who
arrive at the ports of Canada by vessel,' and
my honourable friend knows that, it would, not;
touch ýone-tenth of the aliens that are in the
country.
Section 4 of the Bill provides for a check-up
on aliens who have been in Canada for some
years. The section reads:
Every alien of more than sixteen years of
age, who, being qualified by hie prod of
residence in Canada or in Hie Mfajeety'e
DominionsI should like my honouraÀble friend to explain
later what is the purpose of the words "Hie
Majesty's Dominions" in this section.
-to request a certificate of naturalization,
faile ta apply for such certificats within six
xnonths fromi the coming into force of this Act,
or who thereafter becoming so qualified f aile
to apply for such certificats within six monthe
following eueh qualification, or who having
applied for euch certificats je denied the eame
by the proper authority, ehali complets on oath
before and obtain from the clerk or eecretarytreasurer, or other pereon duly authorized to
act in hie etead of the cîty, town, village or
other municipality whsrein the alien resides,
a card of identification.
If I can read English, thýat clause is surely
intended to be applicable to every alien now
in Canada or who may corne to Canada,
whether by rail or otherwtise, from the United
States or elsewhere. When this matter was
discussed, briefiy the other day, I understood
my honourable friend to saY that the measure
was not intended to apply to American
cities But, I repeat, if I can read the English language correctly, this section 4 clearly
covers all a.hiens, inciuding Arnericans. Now,
the question that occurs to me is: Do we
want to encourage retaliation of the kind that
might ensue from the passage of this Bill?
I firmiy believe that flot a single member
of this honourabie House thinks for one
moment that this Bill ii be passed in the
present session of Parliament. In other words,
it is simpiy a gesture; and if 1 as a new andi

SENATE
inex.perienced member of this Chamber might
express my vicw, I wouid say that it is a mistake for the Sonate of Canada to undertake to
enaect such a half-baked measure for the purpose that it is int-ended to cover. This is my
own thought, and I express it with ail due
respect. We might be devoting our time and
energies to something a great deal more
worthy. One week ago, on the outskirts of this
City, the body of a man xvyho was hemn in Canada was discovered in a barn, and the coroner's
jury fouod that ho died of starvation. Think

That is what the discussion seems lilce te me.
1 of course shall have to comply with whatever
mnay be the judgment of the majority of this
House, but 1 say again that I think it is a
great maistake for the Sonate of Canada te

undertake te de anything, lot us go about it
in a clear-cut, businesslike fashion, and net be
hedging, as Ibis Bill proposes. I understood
an honourablo gentleman the other day suggested that we shouid hedge, or, in other
-words, w~e should exelude Americans from the
provisions of this Bill. I think that Americans
should be exciuded. but in a specifie manner,
and that arrangements shouid ho made te
kcep a check te see that somo of them, if
ihey romain within our borders, have cards of
identification. In my judgment, Canada bas
at times suffered more from nions whom this
Bill wouid net beg-in te rcach. 1 shouid like
te support my honourable friend if ho would
undertak-P te bring down a Bill dcsigned te
reach thoso whe have been undesirable in
the past, but who o'ould ho exempt under
tbis Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourabie sonators, 1 fail te grasp the arguments of my
honeurable friend.
Wbastever mny ho said
of the Bill, there is ne doubt, first, that its
objeet is geod; second, that the Bihl bas been
demanded hy legitimate authority; third, that
it bas been (irnfted with care, that the preper
<lcpartments hav e been consuited nnd that
tbeir adviee bas b'een foliowed. But my honourable friend attaeks the Bill by saying that

Mr. MURDOCK.

it is uscless because it dees net npply
Aiericans coming into this country.

te

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And others.
Hon. Mr. BEAUTBIEN: That was bis fimat
argument, but a few minutes afterwards ho
said that the Bili1 did apply te Amýemicans
within the country, and that therefore il
should not ho tolerated.
It is difficuit te
foiiow my colleague on the sbifting ground
of bis attnck on the mensure. 1 may ho at
fault; I may haveo been obscure in my remarks; but I tbought 1 made it clear that
the Immigration Department recommended
that the mensure sheuid net appiy te incoming
Americans.
If 1 did net make it elear, 1
hope I have done se new.
As I toid the
honourabie leader on the other side of the
lieuse, tbis Bill is net perfect.
It is net
watem-tight. Whcn you cannet have a whole
loaf, il is sometimes wise te take haîf a leaf,
and that is what ive are taking, but my bonourable friend sbouid net talk of tbat baîfloaf as a half-bnked measure.
I tbink that
if ho bnd read the Bihl care'fuliy 'ho would
not have cailed il a half-baked ineasume.
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: I have read it a
dozen times.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: WeiI thon, I wiii
net say 1 amn serry for my honeumabie friend,
but stili 1 cannot blame the menasure fer it ail.
I shaîl tmy te answem the objections that he
bas laid 'befome the lieuse. This Bihl is nlot
intended te appiy te inceming Americans. I
understand that there are seme very serieus
easens why we, cannot make il applicable te
them. We do net inteýnd that Ameiricans shahl
ho stepped at the border and teid that they
will have te register and carry identification
cards.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Is my honourable
friend refemring te citizens of North or Seutb
America?
lIon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The situation is
different with regard te Americans who have
been in tbis country five yeams. We think it
is net unreason chie te say te them: "You
have heen wi'th us for five years, and yeu can
now, if yeu se 'desire, enter the Canadian
family. We weiceme yeu inte the Canadian
fnmily." As a matter of fact, after an American or any ether alien bas spent five years in
this countmy ho -is allowed a, fumthem delay ef
six menths in whicb te decide whetber 'fie
wishes te be.ceme a Canadian.
My bonourable friend wants me te expiain
wby the womds "or in lis Majesty's Dominions" are insLrted in section 4. The explanation
is simple.
One of the qualifications of an

JULY 22, 1931
alien for naturalization is that hie must have
x'esided for ftve ye-ars in Canada, or for a
similar period in any other part of His Majesty's Dominions, provided that for the lust year
he has been a resident of Canada. It seemed
to us -that there was no reason why in this
respect we should depairt from the naturaliza-.
tion law.
.Hon. Mr. GREISBACH: If the word
"other" were inserted, to make it read "or in
Hlis Majesty's other Dominions," the section
would be irnproved, would it not?
1Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Iif the section ia
read carefu.lly it cannot, I think, be taicen to
mean anything but Canada or any other
Dominion. It reads:
Every alien of more than sixteen yeara of
age, whio, being qualified by this Perid of
residence in Canada or in His 9ajesty's
DominionsHon. Mr. GRIESBAGH: That suggessHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That suggesta that
thequalification can bc met either by residenoe
in Canada alone or in Canada and any other
British Dominion.
'Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH: I arn reiferring to
the construction of the sentence. Itl it read
"His Majesty's other Dominions" it would
imply that Canada is one of the Dominions
and thait the applicant could qualify b~y
residence in this or a-ny other Dominion. But
if the wàrd "other" is not insertedl the imnplication is that Canada is some other kind of
organization than a British Dominion.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am perfectly wiliing to admit that my honourable friend knows
bis language better than I, and I am agreeable
te the insertion of the word "other" if lie
thinks that would make the section clearer.
I think 1 have deait with the objection
raised by my honourable friend fromn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) that, the Bill in one
respect. does appiy to American citizens and in
another respect dloes nut. As I have pointed
eut, it is true that it does not apply Vo American citizents when they are entering the country, and it does apply to them when they have
resided in Canda for a period of at lest five
years.
It seexns to me that this is flot a harah
measure, and it is one that may be of great
use. When my honourable friend refers to
the fact that some people are suffering from
hunger in this coun.try, I may tell him that I
know of some industries in which good, honest,
sober workmen suffered from hunger for years
because of certain paid elements coming Vo
Canada, disturhing the population, keeping it
constantly in a state of agitation, disorganizing

453

the work and vcry often destroyîng the very
instruments essential to its livelihood. It seems
to me that if we purge the country as much
as we can of such elements of disorder normal
conditions wiJl the sooner return Vo us. At al
events, we should noV be obliged to care for
people whose only purpose in invading this
country is to create disorder.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I asic the
honoura-ble gentleman if hie can state whether
this Bill, as soon as it had been passed, would
not make it neceasary for identification carde
to be issued Vo about 150,000 Americans who
have been in Canada for many years?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I muet frankly say
I do not know, and I believe my honourable
friend is mentîoning a figure which is nothing.
but a guess, for no one wil1 know unýtil we get
the census returns.. But if the proposition is
reasonable and just for one man, it is
reasonable and just for 100,000 men. Surely
when those people are allowed facilities Vo
come at any time into the Canadian family
and do flot want to do eo, they cannot coinplain if we treat them as in fact ail European
countries treat Canadians.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Has my honourable
friend coneidered that there are in the United
States hundreds of thousands of Canadians
who have neyer become naturalized subjects?
While I have no quarrel with this Bill, it
seems to me to be on rather dangerous ground
if it treats Americans in Canada, who are noV
naturalized, on any basis different from that
on which the United States treats Canadians
who reside there, but have neyer taken out
naturalization papers.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend's remarks are quite to the point, and I
think it would be preposterous on my part
to say that if we would apply this law to
Americans in our country we shouid resent
any similar law beîng applied to Canadians in
the United States. But 1 should like Vo find
out where the hardship would be. I do not
hesitate to cross the line and register; and
there ýmust be twenty per cent of the mexnbers
cf this House who travel across Vo Europe and
register, though Vhey do not go therc Vo reside.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But I amn not talking
about Europe; I am talking aibout the United
States.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know, but I arn
just making a casual remark to. show that,
after ail, it would noV be a very great hardship if that were the case. If there were such
an interchange of treatment between the two

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN,

often looked at obituary notices, and I have
rarely found that a person dying in this
country has flot brothers, sistera or other
relatives living over in the United States,
wbo are noV citizens cf that country. If the
United States should pass an Act such as
this, every Canadian living in that country
would be called upon to register and Vo carry
an identification card. That legislation would
apply to a nation of 110,000,000 people, and
iV is quite possible that the Uniited States
immigration authorities would 'find conditions there similar Vo what I said miglit
exist in Canada. It might be f ound that
hundreds and perhaps thousands of Canadians
living in the United Sta.tes have neyer had,
legal entry into that country. I arn afraid
that this might cause a great deal of friction
between the.immigration authorities of Canada and those of the United States. From
experience I know that in immigration
matters it is pretty difficult for two nations
Vo deal constantly with each other without
friction ariaing. Great care and caution are
required if international friction in regard Vo
immigration is Vo be avoided. If every Canadian living in the United States should be
called upon Vo sign an identification card, and
if it were found, as I arn afraid it would be,
that a very large number of Canadians in the
United States had no right Vo be there, they
would be sent back to Canada. The feeling
created by such action would be injurious Vo
the beat intereats of the two countries. That
is the difficulty that I anticipate.
On the other hand, I arn quite in sympathy
with the idea, of aliens, say, from. the continent of Europe, who have noV taken out
naturalization papera, being required Vo
obtain identification cards.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, I rise Vo express in a few words rny
opinion with regard Vo this Bill. If American
citizens were lef t ont of it entirely, I rnight
be inclined Vo vote for it; but I share very
largely the opinion expressed a few minutes
ago by rny deskmate (Hon. Mr. Gordon).
I know a number of American citizens who
have resided in rmy own city for years and
have been in a large way of business, and
I do noV feel inclined Vo vote for a measure
that wonld compel themn Vo go Vo some
official and ask for an identification card. I
cannot do that. We know very well that a
large number cf Canadiana who have been in
the United StatVes for years are noV naturalized
in that country, and do noV wish Vo become
naturalized. They may expect Vo corne back
to Canada some time as Canadian citizens.
Except for the clause which refera particu-

455

larly to Amnerican citizens, I shoi.ild be in
favour of the Bill; but on account of this
clause I shall reluctantly vote against it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!1
Hon. R. DANDTJRAND: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to etate my difficulty. I have
aiready asserted that 1 ehould vîew wiith
favour a Bull that would insure control over
the transients, of doubtful charaoter, ooming
into Canada fromn the south. I see ia this
Bill nothing which would help in t.hat respect.
On tihe other hand, I observe that Americans
'wh.o have been with us five years and six
months would have Vo regiater. I arn firmnly
eonvinced that moet of those Americans who
have been with us for miore t.han five years
have a good record in this country; yet in
this Bill they are regarded. as an element that
should be obliged to carry idenitification card&.
This is perhaps a weak feature of the Bill.
If we are Vo have no control over Americans
who have been in this country less than five
years, soine of whom may be just the kind
of people we need to watch, then those
Americans who have been here for a longer
time, and whose record is blameless, should
flot be asked to register.
I do flot see why, in a country like ours,
it is necessary to exercise pressure upon aliens
to induce themn Vo beore natuTalized. People
corne and go tbetween one countiry and
another, and yet retain their nationality. If
they are good people Vhey are honoured as
such. I could name many men who came
from Great Britain to the Ujnited States
twenty-flve or thirty years ago and have
remained good Britighera. I have in mind
two brothers who are at the head of public
servi-ces in Chicago and have been there for
twenty-five or thirty years: one of them. bas
become an Amnerican citizen, but the other
has remained a British subjeet. I know of
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Americans
wbo are in various services, industries, or
other emplovrnent in Canada and who have
4ieen here for a number of years. I have been
invited more tihan. once Vo dine with the
American colony in Montreal on the fourth
of July and have at among a most respectable
group of people. They have even the American Church in Montreal. I arn somewhat
doubtful of the propriety of distuxrbing the
minds of those good people, and of ninietenths, I will say, speaking off-band, of the
American population in Canada, who have
flot seen fit Vo adopt British nationality.
At the saine time I admit that the Bill,
in so far as it relates Vo certain elements
that corne Vo Canada from Europe, bas somip

virtue; therefore I should hesitate te register
my vote against it. Inasmuch as the Bill will
clearly net become law at this session, I do
not think that at this stage we should bo
asked te array ourselves either in faveur of
or against it. I believe that this discussion
will be beneficial, in that it will draw the
attention of the thinking people of Canada
te this problem. We might decide to send
the Bill back to the committee for further
examination, and the committee might continue its labours and endeavour to present
to this Chamber, before the end of the session,
a Bill amended with respect to the American
element that has proven its value by a sojourn
of five years or more among us. I offer my
suggestion net so much with a view to the
immediate modification or amendment of the
Bill as because in my opinion no definite
advantage would accrue from an alignment
pro and con, and we may be able to take up
the Bill again next session with greater and
better success.

Government. My own opinion is that the
Government should express its approval or
disapproval of this policy, as a guide, because,
after all, it is the Government that is responsible in such matters.

Honourable
members, I am not sure that J am orthodox.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Politically?

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Usually I am.
I am not se sure, however, that men who
decide to remain in any country permanently
should net become citizens of the country in
which they are earning thoir living. But there
arises another question that is incidental to
this Bill. Our transportation systems on this
continent stretch into both countries, and in
the working out of details in the management
of those lines men are necessarilv transferred
from one country to the other. The transfer
may net be permanent. Thev expect to be
in one place for five or six years, but in nearly
everv case they hope to be sent back to their
own country. I should net like te see such
men compelled to carry registration cards.
They have not changed thoir occupations or
their employers.
We in the Senate are proposing, as we have
a right to propose, a change in the policy of
the Dominion Governmont in matters of
immigration, and it occurs to me that it is
the business of the Government to introduce
or to take charge of a Bill of this kind, if
it desires such a measure. The Government
of Canada, backed by Parliament, is responaible for the podicy of the -country. This Bill
is very far-reaching and affects matters that
may create discord, or at least friction, and
I think that we should be guided a little by
what the Government thinks, because it is
futile for the Senate to pass such a measure
unless it meets with the approval of the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
One thing has
struck me very forcibly during this discussion.
After all, it is not strange. One senator after
another bas risen in his place and said: "I
am acquainted with many good Americans and
I would not impose upon them the obligation
of registering and taking out a card." From
this it would appear tha.t the members of this
House regard this measure from what to me
is a quite unexpected viewpoint. This measire was intended for people of a very different
kind from those with whom you and I associate. It is all very well for yeu or for me
,o stand up in this House and say: "I should
not like to displease the excellent company
in which I move."
But what about the
slums?
We know them at

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend has had greater experience in that
regard than I. Is not lawful order in the
slums something that interests us?
Those
whose duty it is to maintain order in the
doubtful strata of the population, and who
perforce must live among people that you
and I do net know, and probably never will
know, want the Bill. That is why it is
before you. I respect the sentiments of those
who are desirous of net offending people
moving in their own circles of society; but I
would ask honourable members to give
thought to those who have no choice as to the
class with which they shall associate.
It seems to me that the answer to the
argument about immigration policy being a
proper matter for the Government to deal
with is clear and unmistakable.
The Government is free te accept or to reject this
Bill. When the Bill leaves this House is
there any danger of its surviving unless the
Government is satisfied with it? Why express
any doubt as to the propriety of presenting a
measure of this kind? Such measures are
frequently initiated in this House. Of course
they are subject to the approval of the Government. If the Government does not accept
this Bi.ii, as is possible for many reasons
mentioned in this House, and which I appreciate, it will turn the Bill down. There can
be no danger on that score.
This measure bas been dealt with to the
best of the committee's ability and is now in
the hands of the Senate. I know very well

JULY 22, 1931
that it has not the ghost af a chance ta
becomè law at present. It is too late in the
session for that. But it is not too late to
obtain the opinions of honoura-ble members
of this House, and it. is quite possible lthat
such opinions may be af great use in preparing
gt another session a measure acceptable tu
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The hanourable gentleman says the Bill has no chance this session.
Then why not let it stand over until next
session, when we could give it a little more
consideration?
Samne Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not know
whether I should 'accept the suggestion that
has came from bath sides af the House. This
is not my Bill.
Han. Mr. BUREAU: Oh, yes.
Hon. .MT. BEAUBIEN: Oh, na; although I
fully apprave the Ineasure. I am pleading fer
the Bill, that is aIl. I would suggest that the
debate be adjourned until to-morrow. Meantime I shaîl cansuit my ohleagues of the coimmittee. who have taken great pains with this
measure, and if they are i.nclined ta have the
Bill past.poned till next year I shaîl be very
glad to accept the suggestion that has been
maxle.
The debate was adjaurned.
CANADA SHIPPING BLL
THIRD READYING

Hon. Mr. TANNER maved the third reading of Bill 97, an Act ta amend the Canada
Shipping Act.
W9hat is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
necessity for fixing a date? The section ta
be amended says:
Every British subject who served as a
master or mate of. a sea-going or coasting
sailing vessel af aver seventy-five tons, grass
tonnage, before the first day of January, one
thousand nine hundred and twenty, for a fui]
period ai twelve months within ten years immediately preceding the date of his application
for a certificate of service.
In the Bill bel are us the only change is in the
date, which is the first day oi January, anc
thousand nine hundred and thirty-one.
I confess that I amn not familiar with the
general economy «~ the Act; but as we are
altering the date now, may we nat alter it
again in five or ten years, and say, "Before
the first day af January, 1941"? Il the dates
were eliminated it wauld be a general Act,
applicable for aIl turne.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:-. 1 had a memorandum
yesterday, but; the1 Bul went. through withaut
anyone asking.î .r an 'explanationRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
brief ?

Loat your

Hon. Mr. TANNER: -and I did flot take
up the tiine of the House in giving one. It
wvas suggested in the other House, I believe,
that the matter should be thrown open, as
bas been suggested by my honourable friend.
Under the Merchant Shipping Act the date
was fixed as 1920, as is stated in the note.
Because af conditions which prevailed no
persan was taking advantage of the provision
of the law to get what is called a certificate
of service, and the Act practically went out
of operation. Within tbe last f ew years, however, a ne-w condition bas arisen, particularly
in Nova Scotia, which affects the fishing classes
an the southern shore of that province. The
qnasters of flshing vessels, who are very coinpetent men, had «been devoting most of their
time to fishing, but within the last f ew years
the fisheries have not been so profitable and
they have been going into the coasting trade
and other activiities witb their vessels. If
the law hiad been a general one they could
bave got those certificates of service, but
to-day they canat, and the purpose of this
Bill is to enable them ta secure certificates
of service, provided that tbey can show that
within ten years priar to 1931 they have been
in command of vessels as sailing masters or
chief officers, and can produce satisfact-ory
evidence of sobriety, experience, ability and
general good conduct, and can pass the sight
test and 'the prescribed examination in signalling, and sa on. Otherwise they would have
to go through the long apprenticesbip of
junior mate and senior mate, and tben rise
to the rank of sailing master. The whole
purpose of the Bill is ta aid men who are
kçnown ta be perfectly campetent to bandle
their sbips during the fishing season, and who
want the privilege of engaging in the caasting
trade during periads when they are nat fishing.
The Department af Marine thoraughly approves of the Bill, and the Minister of
Marine, who appeared before the committee
ai the Hause of Commons, said that the Department was quite satisfied ta have the legislation go through.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

SENATE
PENSION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the second
reading of Bill 110, an Act to amend the
Pension Act.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill is
simplicity itself. It increases the number of
members of the Pension Tribunal from nine
to twelve.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not the Commission.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have requested
the Deputy Minister, Mr. Scammell, to be in
attendance.
If honourable gentlemen want
any detailed information that is not in my
possession, I shall ask the Deputy to take a
seat on the floor.
I should like to produce at this time the
reply to an inquiry by the honourable senator
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) bearing on
this very subject.
1. What is the total number of applications
for pensions disposed of by the Pension
Tribunals since they began their sittings to
date?
The answer is 2,161.
2. What is the average number of cases per
week which the Tribunals have been disposing
of?
The present average is 100.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is that per day or
per week?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Per week.
3. How many of the cases respectively have
the Tribunals decided: (a) favourably, and
(b) unfavourably to the applicant?
The answer is: (a) 1,036 and (b) 1,115, a
total of 2,151.
4. How many of the cases heard by the
Tribunals have been appealed: (a) at the
instance of the Commission Counsel, and (b)
by the applicants?
The answer is (a) 717 and (b) 550.
5. How many cases has the Appeal Court
disposed of in the above mentioned period?
The answer is 592.
6. In how many of the cases respectively did
the Appeal Court decide: (a) favourably, and
(b) unfavourably to the application for pension?
The answer is: (a) 152 and (b) 440.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Those were rejected?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, rejected.
There were 152 decided favourably to the
applicant and 440 rejected.
7. What is the estimated total number of
applications undisposed of and now referred to
or likely to be referred to the Pension
Tribunals?
The answer is 27,678 referred.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

8. What is the estimated average number of
such applications likely to be disposed of each
week by the Pension Tribunals when they are
enlarged under the Bill now before Parliament.
The answer is 140. That would be an increase of 40 per week over the average number
that the Tribunals have been disposing of to
date.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the
honourable gentleman tell us what period
these answers cover?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
from last year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
legislation?

I

presume,

Since last year's

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes.
The first clause of the Bill provides that
subsection 1 of section 9 of the Pensions Act
shall be repealed and the following substituted
therefor:
The Governor in Council may appoint not
less than nine and not more than twelve persons
to be members of a Pension Tribunal; one of
such persons shall be appointed Chairman of
the Tribunal, and he and eight members thereof
shall hold office for ten years and the other
three members for two years, subject only to
earlier removal for cause.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suggest to my
honourable friend that the Bill be given second
reading and that we go into Committee of the
Whole, so that we may take up each clause
separately.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is agreeable.
The motion wvas agreed to, and the Bill waa
read the second time.
CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby,
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.

the

Hon. Mr. Gordon in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I ask leave for
Mr. Scammel to take a seat on the floor.
On section 1-Pension Tribunal:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman explain the necessity of increasing the number of members of the
Tribunal from nine to twelve?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The reason is
that the Tribunal has been wholly unable to
cope with the work. The Bill provides also
for an increase in the number of commission
counsel. It was stated in one of the answers I
read a few moments ago that there were still
27,678 applications undisposed of, that these
were being disposed of at the average rate of

JULY 22, 1931
about 100 a week, and that with the increase
in the rnembersbip of the Tribunal it was
estimated this average would be increased to
140 weekly. 0f course, many appeale are not
rneritorioue. It costs an applicanit nothing to
appeal after hie has masde -his application. I
do not desire to exopress any critieism, at ahl;
I arn iereiy pointing out that an appellent
doe not incur any expense, for counsel is provided and there are no fee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When we were
dealing with the Pension Bill lest year I underetood there were. a certain number of applications to be dealt with by the Tribunal.
Can my honourable friend tell us what tha.t
number was, se that we rnay sec what the
increase has been under the present law?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There were
about 6,000 at that time. 'Phere are between
19,000 and 20,000 more now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Some of those
have applie. to the Tribunal for reconsideration?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, that is
correct. But that number includes the new
applicants, of course.
What proporHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tion of those 20,000 applications bad already
heen passed upon and dismissed under the
old !aw?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUJGHBY: In round figures
possibly 5,000 applicants whose dlaims were
rejected before are now appealing.
Hon. Mr. DANDI-TRAND: And the others
feit that under the law as it formerly existed
they could not appeal?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I suppose the
law bas been widened a littie as to the burden
of proof.
Hon. Mr. KING: May I inquire of the
bonourable leader whether it is the intention
of the Government when appointing three
new commissioners to consider those who
were forrnerly members of the Appeal Board
and were dismissed hast year?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I arn not in
a position to commit the Government in a
discretionary matter of that kind.
Hon. Mr. KING: I thought it would be
well to draw attention to it.
I suggest to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the honourable leader of the Government that
those former members would appear to hve
two special qualifications. In the first place,
I arn under the impression that they were
returned soldiers; and, secondly, having served

459

for a number of yeare, they acquired valuable
experience. I arn speaking generally, and
have no particular person in mind.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They have this
further qualification, as 1 understand, that
they were appointed for a number of years
and because of a change of government were
dismissed before they had completed their
tern. This Bull provides for a ten-year terin
f or nine members of the Tribunal. I understand that soifie of the former members of
the Board haed two, three or four years of their
terni to serve when they were dismissed.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-Commission counsel:
I suppose that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this Tribunal sits in more than one section?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Four.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And they move
about the country?
Hon. 'Mr. WILLOUGHBY: They do.
That would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
explàin the need for the counsel, I suppose?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3--application to be made to
the Commission:
Honourable
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
members who heard the figures quoted a
short while ago by the leader of the Government mnust have been impressed with the fact
that the present Tribunal, consisting of nine
members, bas since its inception been disposing of an average of 100 cases a week, or
about 5,000 a year. It would appear that
the Appeal Court is the neck of the bottie,
for in the samne period it has disposed of
only 592 cases, or only a little more than
10 per cent of the number disposed of by
the Tribunal. There are 27,678 cases at
present undisposed of. The Bill provides for
in increase of three in the memhership of the
Tribunal, from nine to twelve. It seems *to
me to be obvious that the estimated average
of 140 cases a week will be beyond the powers
of the new Tribunal, if nine members can
handle only 100 cases a week. It will take
the Tribunal over four years to dispose of
the present number of applications.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: And that is without
considering new cases.
If a
Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
bueket of water were taken out of the Rideau
Canal and durnped into the Ottawa River,

sou

SENATE

the volume of water in the Ottawa would
undoubtedly be greater, but nobody would be
able to notice the increase.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
How many
years does my honourable friend say it will
take to catch up with the applications now
on hand?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It will take four
years at the present rate of progress.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would be interesting to know how many years the applicants have been waiting already.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
matter.

That is another

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am told that
the Appeal Court bas been working only
one year.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is so. To
catch up with the work within the next few
months it would be necessary to appoint a
hundred new members to the Tribunal. I
mention this so that those who are interested
in the matter will not be misled by what is
merely a gesture.
Section 3, which is now before this Committee. is really important. Prior to the
legislation of 1930 there were a Board of
Pension
Commissioners and an Appeal
Board. Under that systein the commissioners
received applications, heard the applicants,
investigated their claims and came to a decision, either favourable or unfavourable. If
the decision was unfavourable, an appeal lav
to the Appeal Board. Now, a good deal of
the pension legislation of last year was not
very well digested; it contained some very
poor features, which apparently could not
be altogether eliminated. Among the mass
of that legislation there seemed to b something which relieved the Board of Pension
Commissioners of the duty and obligation
actually to hear applications, as they formerly
did. The Board reccived the applications:
those that were not granted they shipped off
to the Tribunal, and it is such applications
that now amount to 27,678. The amendments proposed in this section are designed
to replace upon the shoulders of the Board
the duty and obligation of actually making
a complete investigation of each case from
start to finish.
Hon. Mr. KING:

That is very proper.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is provided for
in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection
1 of new section 51, and in subsection 2,
which makes the following further provision:
Hon.

Mr. GRIESBACH.

Should the application be not granted the
Commission shall refer the same to the Chief
Pensions Advocate and the Chief Commission
Counsel for presentation to the Pension
Tribunal if the applicant or any person on his
behalf duly authorized in writing so requests.
Under the interpretation of the legislation
of last year such applications were examined
in a cursory fashion and then sent to the
Tribunal.
Subsection 3 provides:
The Commission shall reconsider all applications which have been referred to the Chief
Pensions Advocate and Chief Commission
Counsel between the first day of October, 1930,
and the date of coming into force of this Act,
in respect to whioh the Chief Pensions Advocate
has not notified the Pension Tribunal that such
applications are ready for hearing.
I understand that to mean that all those cases
which have been dumped on to the Tribunal
since the legislation of that year, and which
are not ready for trial, will now go back
to the Board of Pension Commissioners for
further hearing.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If that is so, it
means the applications are being kicked ifrom
pillar to post. I have no confidence that the
increase in the membersbip of the Tribunal
will make much difference in the situation.
However, the purpose of this section is to
put the Commissioners back to the work
they formerly did, and to require them to
make definite findings, which must be conveyed te the applicants. That is the sounder
way of doing things, I think, and it ought to
have been provided for last year. But I am
not prepared to say to what extent this section will help towards clearing up the present
situation.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Was that the way it
stood before the legislation ni lest year,
largely?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Largely, yes.
While on my feet I will deal with the other
olauses. The other items here are more like
inatters of detail-the calling in of a judge
of the Superior or District Court, as I take it,
to serve on the Appeal Court, and a reference to the possibility of two membors sitting
instead of three. If the calling in of an extra
judge and the reducing of the court occasionally to two would enable more work to be
donc, I would support the Bill. I am bound
to sav 1 am net wildly enthusiastic about any
of it.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 and 5 were agreed te.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.

461

JULY 22, 1931
The CHAIRM AN: Shall I report the Bill
without amendment?
Beforo we go
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND:
out of Committee I would impress upon my
honourable friend the importance of appointing to that Board or Tribunal the best men
available, because, as hýas been pointed out
by my honourable friend from. Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach), the work is very heavy
and it requires considerable courage to expedite it in such a way as to do justice to
the applicant and at the samne time to the
federal treasury. Already thousands of dlaimns
have been examined and re-examined. By
virtue of the legisiation of last year a new
opportiunity for hearing was granted to many
or ail applicants. I feel that here is a point
in the general financial economny of the country where the officials should have ail the
necessary qualifications to dispense evenhanded justice between the two interests concerned. We ail want to do the right thing
by the returned soldier, but at the saine time
we must not forget the horrible abuses we
have witnessed during the last fifty years in
the United States. We should guard against
anything that would lead to such a result as
we have seen there. Therefore I would impress upon my honourable friend the necessity
of appoin.ting the best men possible to review
ail these cases.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In answer to
the honourable gentleman I would say that
I appreciate the propriety and suitability of
his comments and counsel, and shahl convey
the same to the Minister.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
CUSTOMIS BILL
SECOND

EEADING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the
second readîng of Bill 39, an Act to amend
the Customs Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEEPROGRESS REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Gord-on in the Chair.
On section 1-discounts:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Apparently the
main, if not the only, purpose of this Bull
is to see that this country gets the. benefit
of the fuil customs duties that should be
payable here on the entry of goods from

outside. Ail business men know that deductions from -the sale prices are often made
when goods are sold wholesale or on commission, and sometimes when they are sold
retail. This Bill is to provide that in estimating for duty the value of goods coming into
Canada no deduction shaîl be allowed which
is not actually made to customers on sales
for home consumption in the country of
export. This provision would apply largely
in our dealings with the people to the south
of us. AI! deductions must be shown on
invoices and must be accounted for absolutely;
$0 the duty will have to be paid in full on
the real price of the commodity in the home
market. That is virtually the whole purport
of this Bill. The amount of the invoice
mighit be less than the actual sale price in
the other country. Under this Bill we insist
that if there are deductions made to the customer, there must be invoices to show
absolutely what is paid by the purchaser
in the country other than Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Tha;t
largcly strengtbening the Dumping Act?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

is

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable leader on this side whether this
Bill has the effect of changing the penalty
for the smuggling of goods to the amouint of
over $200? Is the law changed in that
respect?
We are now
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
on section 1.
H-on. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We have not
got that far. We are now dealing with the
ordinary, legitimate dealer.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-proviso:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I understand
that the amended subseetion refers to wine,
fermentcd liquors, etc., that are being properly imported into Canada, say at Halifax
or in New Brunswick, and that by this amendment it is declared. that the provisions of the
subsection shaîl not ap.ply.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY- No, they
would flot apply.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-power to examine on oath:
These subHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
sections siinply provide snachinery for the
officers in the carryiig' out of their duty.

SENATE

2

The CHAIR.MAN: Is it the wish of the
Committee that I should go over these subsections?
No, unless
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
some one objects, because this is the machinery by which they may investigate any
complaints.
I see in the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
note as to section 4 this comment:
Under the provisions of the Customs Act as
at present existing no officer of Customs is
empowered to examine persons upon oath in
the course of any inquiry or investigation.
Such inquiries are of frequent occurrence and
often take place at points where commissioners
or other persons authorized to administer caths
are not available.
Then we have the section:
4. The said Act is amended by inserting the
following section immediately after section one
hundred and thirty-four thereof:"134a. (1) The commissioner of customs,
assistant commissioner of customs, any inspector
of customs ports, any collector of customs, and
the chief of the preventive service and any
divisional chief of the preventive service, and
any other officer designated by the Minister,
may conduct any inquiry or investigation in
matters relating to the Customs, and may
summon before him any person and may
examine him and require him to give evidence
orally or in writing, on oath or on solemn
affirmation if he is entitled to affirn in civil
matters, or by statutory declaration, on any
matter pertinent to such inquiry or investigation, and any person thus authorized to conduct
an enquiry or investigation may administer
such oath or affirmation.
This amendment gives authority to the
Minister to appoint one of those officials
named.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes.
It must be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
assumed that at all those points men will be
found who have the knowledge necessary
for the carrying on of such investigation. I
am not familiar enough with the Customs
service to know whether this provision will
work out satisfactorily.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: In that case
would the man who is summoned be allowed
to have counsel?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
There is no
provision for it. I think we shall have to
leave something to the discretion of the
officer. We must presume that he will carry
out the law.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
able enforcement of the iaw?

The reason-

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes.
that ean be left to his discretion.
Section 4 was agreed to.
Hon.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

I think

On section 5-ternitorial

waters defined:

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I have an amendment to propose to section 5. The suggestion
is that the section be amended for the purpose
of making a clerical correction in its form,
so that paragraph (b) will not form part of
the new subsection 7 of section 151 of the
Act, but will be subsection 2 of section 5 of
the Bill.
The CHAIRMAN:
Section 5, with this
amendment, would then read as follows:
5. (1) Subsection seven of section one hundred
and fifty-one of the said Act, as enacted by
section one of chapter sixteen of the statutes
of 1928, is repealed, and the following is substituted therefor:"(7) For the purposes of this section and
section two hundred and seven of this Act,
'Territorial waters of Canada' shall mean the
waters forming part of the territory of the
Dominion of Canada and the waters adjacent
to the Dominion within three marine miles
thereof, in the case of any vessel, and within
twelve marine miles thereof, in the case of any
vessel registered in Canada, or any other vessel
which is owned by any person domiciled in
Canada."
(2) This section shall come into force on a
day to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor
in Council published in the Canada Gazette.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Unless we have the
subsection that is to be repealed, it is pretty
difficult to follow what this means.
Subsection 7 of section 151 is repealed, but what
thaît provides for is not apparent from the
note. It is impossible for me to gather the
effect of this repeal.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand the suggestion to be merely that section 5 becomes
a subsection of 7. Am I correct?
ion. Mr. McMEANS: I understand that
section 5 is divided into two subsections.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Possibly my honourable friend would read the repealed subsection; then I for one might understand the
meaning of this.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
If it is important we can get it out of the Statutes.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I am informed by
counsel that the only part of the section that
is changed is underlined:
-or any other vessel which is owned by any
person domiciled in Canada-and
that paragraph (b), immediately following, has becen added in the Commons. It
is not intended that this subsection should be
carried into the Act, because when the Act
comes into force it will no longer be necessary.

JULY 22, 1931
Hon. Mr. HARMER: The amendment naw
moved is exactly the saine as the present
subsection of the Bill.
The amendment
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
would change only the numbering.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would yau read
the last clause as you have it in the arnendment, Mr. Chairman?
The CHAIRMAN:
This section shahl corne inta force an a day
ta be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in
Council published in the Canada Gazette.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It says "section"
instead of 'subsection."
Hon. Mr. McMFEANS: It refera ta section
5 of the Bull. The letters "(a)" and "(b)"
are struck out, and instead of paragrapl (b),
which says that subsection 7 of section 151
of the Act shahl corne into farce on a day to
be fixed by proclamation, it says thaît seotion
5 of the Bill shaîl came inta farce, etc.
The CHAIRMAN: Clause 5 of the Bull la
ta be struck out? You mean the whole section?

Hon. MT. DAN-DURAND: TheP reduce the
prison terni and increase the money penalty.
My hionourable f riend perhaps can tell us why
men rnay be condemned ta pay a larger
amounlt in fines, while the gaol sentence is
reduced.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is because of
the lenity of juries and that trait of hu-man
natuIre which makes one hesitate ta "sock"ýta use the vernacular-a man with a long gaol
texm, thougli it does not prevent the imposition orf a heawy fine. It is thought that by
reducing the terni of imprisoniment we are
more likely ta get a proper decision from a
jury. 1 arn remînded also that the nuniber ofl
peremptory challenges allowed under the Code
is based on the period of imprisonment that
can be imposed.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I understand that
under the law as it was bef are, the judge had
no latitude. Is that right? The law said that
on conviction a man would be liable ta a fine
crf $500, or ta imprisonment for a. term, not
exceeding seven years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And flot lem
than one year.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is not my
point. The ameadment says that a persan
sha I be liable ta a penalty 'nat exceeding
$1,000 and not less than $200."l Previously
I very well rethere was a fine of $50.
member that when these articles were arnended before, there was a prolonged discussion
in this House. At that time, if I remember
rightly, the smuggling of silks was taking
place an a very large scale. Truclads of
silks came into the city of Montreal. One
truck was seized in a lane somewhere at the
back of Morgan's, and a severe fine was
imposed. Since that time such srnuggling has
ceased, I understand. I arn informed that
those who suffered from that kind of smuggling
in the past are fearful of this fine being
reduced. I should like ta know why it is
being reduced from. a fixed sum of S50 ta a
minimum of $200.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: How about
the prison terni?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It is nat impased.
The explanatory
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
note states thatUnder the provisions of the Criminal Cade,
Sec. 932, every one indicted for an affence for
which hie may be sentenced ta imprisoniment
for more than five years, is entitled ta challenge
twelve jurors peremptorily, whereas if the
maximum term of impri8onment is less than
five years, hie is entitled ta challenge anly four

SENATE

jurors peremptorily. No penalty of imprisonment for over four years has ever been imposed,
and by reducing the maximum to four years it
will be made more difficult for a defendant by
exercising his right of peremptory challenge to
select a jury to his liking.
The money penalty should range from a
maximum of $1,000 to a minimum of $200, the
latter being the maximum for the lesser offence
where value is under $200.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am glad to
know that my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) finds some virtue
in the legislation which was brought forward
hy the previous Government. I remember
that in 1925 I had considerable difficulty in
inducing some of my honourable friends to
accept that legislation. We had to go to
Committee in order to show the great evils
that it was hoped the proposed legislation
would cure. J am happy to learn that that
legislation was effective, and I hope this will
not impair it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
The explanatory
note applies to the term of imprisonment, but
not to the fine.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Sec the last two
lines, and the explanation of section 11.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: You are doing away
with the maximum?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Where the value of
the goods is over 8200 the fine ranges from

8200 to $1,000.
The CHAIRMAN:

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Let us consider 9,

Section 12 was agreed to.
On section 13-vessels used

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To what do the
words "or subsequent transportation" apply?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGIHBY: If the goods
were taken off a boat and put into a truck,
this would apply.
Section 13 was agreed to.
Sections 14, 15 and 16 were agreed to.
On section 17-persons smuggling goods in
company:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It looks to me,
Mr. Cha'irman, as if this were carrying the
penalties a little too far. The proposed section
says:
If any two or more persons in company are
found together, and they or any of them have
any goods liable to forfeiture under this Act,
every such person having knowledge of the fact
is guilty of an offence and punishable in accordance with the provisions of this Act as if the
goods were found on such person.
Suppose that two ladies travelling together
are over in an American city and one of them
purchases a dress or two. If the other one
knows this but does not tell-and maybe if
she does tell-she is liable to be indicted for
having committed an offence, although she
is not a party to the transaction at all and has
committed no offence. They are merely travelling together.

The CHAIRMAN:
10. Paragraph (b) of subsection two of section one hundred and eighty-nine of the said
Act is repealed, and the following is substituted
therefor:
"(b) If the value for duty of the goods is
two hundred dollars or over, be guilty of an
indictable offence and liable on conviction to
a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars
and not less than two hundred dollars, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding four
years and not less than one year, or to both
fine and imprisonment."
Section 10 was agreed to.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The explanatory
note does not satisfy me at all. It is only
an explanation. This will become the law
if we pass it.

On section 11-further penalty if value two
hundred dollars or over:

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Under this section a person would be guilty
of an indictable offence even if the value for

duty of the goods were less than two hundred

dollars. This is not desirable, but the person
should be punishable in accordance with the

JVLY 22, 1931
provisions of section 217, which Provides for a
summary conviction where the goods are under
the value for duty of two hundred dollars.
tTnder the existing law one would be in a
worse position.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn thinking only of the iaw that we are now considering. If two gentlemen were in New Yorkif, for instance, my two honest looking
Western friends opposite were in New York
travelling together, and one of them, to the
other's knowledýge, bought a watch and smuggled it into ýthis country, the one who did
not'have the watch. would be liabIe to punîshment, although hie had had ncsthing to do
with the transaýction. The inférence is that
a mani could be punished because he would
not tell on bis friend.
One is judged
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
by the company one keeps.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: To my mi.nd
Vhiat is not justice.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I quite agree wit2h
*my right honourable friend, but that law is
already in force. This clause does not make
a new law in that respect.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We are
amending the former law and making a new
one.
This makes the
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
punialiment easier.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY- This mitigates
it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: To my mind
it is not juat at ail. I despise an informer.
This section would penalize an honest man
who refuses to follow the example of bis
pal and smuggle something into the country.
A man who has done notihing wrong would
be indicted be-cause his conipanion was convicted. I amn altogether opposed to that
clause.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: I am entirely in
agreement with by right honourable friend.
Unless a travelling companion. aids and abets
his friend to smuggle something, he ia surely
not gui'lty of wrongdoing.
He must have
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
knowledge of the act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In the hypothetical
case which the right honourable gentleman
cited, one of the men might be aware that
his friend smuggled. the watch, but unless
he aided and abetted. his friend in smuggling
it hie is. surely not guilty of any off ence
against the law.

465

Hon. Me~. McMEANS: He would be, under the present law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, as the law
stands at the present time. But it appears
to me that, for the reasons indicated, we
sbould not perpetuate this legisiation.
A lady in
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Brockville, let us say, might be asked to
aocompany a «neighbour on a trip to Ogclensburg. The neigh-bour might buy some
goods in Ogdensburg and smuggle then into
this country. Her companion would be perfectly innocent and would have done no
-wrong, but because she was with someone
who did wrong she would be liable to punishment. I do not think there is any principle
of justice in that.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I do not think that
is the intention of the law at aIl. I think this
section is meant ho apply where one persan
smuggles goods and the other keeps a lookout.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Ar~e there any
records of convictions under this section?
Hon. Mr. MûMEANS: I do not know of
any case. I was in Buffalo the other day and
heard of a man who took his car across the
line for repairs to the factory where ih was
built. Later he brought the car back ta
Canada. and the Customs officers seized it
beoause hie had not reported the repaira.
Right Hon. Mr. GRA2HAM: He brought
over saine goods himself. But suppose a companion riding in his car were indicted, that
would be similar to the cases I was auggesting.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He did not imnport
any goods.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They were an
the car.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: But he did not
import the labour.
Hon. Mr. WILLOU'GHBY: This is a very
drastie clause. I do not remember that it
came up laist year. I have flot heard of any
injustice or hardship occurring because of 1h.
Nothing of the kind has come ta the attention
of the Department, so far as 1 know.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: My family
neyer smuggle anything. If they buy anything in the United States they report it.
Suppose Mrs. Graham happened ta go ta
Ogdensburg with a neighbour, and that neighhour bought a dreas there and smuggled it.
It would seem ho me a great injustice that
Mrs. Graham should be indicted, si*mply

because she knew of the smuggling, when all
her life she has honestly acted on the principle that imported goods should be reported.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I fully agree with my
right honourable friend frorn Eganville, and
I suggest that all the words after "repealed,"
in the second line of section 17, be stricken
out.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I suggest that
this section stand and that the leader of the
House should consult the Government about
it, in view of the strong objections that have
been taken here.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That would be
quite agreeable. The section is very drastic.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am afraid that my
right honourable friend from Eganville is a
little bit exercised over this matter on account
of his proximity to the border.

SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA AND LOAD
LINES CONVENTIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the
second reading of Bill 96, an Act respecting
the International Convention for the Safety
of Life at Sea signed in London on the thirtyfirst day of May, 1920, and the International
Convention respecting Load Lines signed in
London on the fifth day of July, 1930.
He said: I do not suppose it will be necessary to go into Committee on this Bill. If
the House is agreeable, I shall read a memorandum that I have here:
This Bill, as indicated by its title and as
provided more specifically by section 2 thereof,
has for its object the ratification of two international conventions respecting shipping.
One of these, set out in schedule 1 to the
Bill, is known as the International Convention
for the Safety of Life at Sea, and was signed
at London on the 31st day of May, 1929; the
other, known as the International Convention
respecting Load Lines, was signed at London
on the 5th of July, 1930.

A provision of the first of these conventions
is that it shall be effective as from July 1,
1931, provided the requisite number of ratifications shall have been effected before that date.
The other is not to become effective until on
or after July 1, 1932.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

It will be useful at this point to refer as
briefiy as I can to the steps that led up to the
conclusion of these two conventions. I shall
for that purpose deal first with the Safety of
Life at Sea Convention.
It will doubtless be within the recollection
of many honourable members that following the
disaster to the steamer "Titanic" in the month
of April, 1912, there was a general awakening
of all the nations, in the interests of humanity,
to the necessity of examining with the greatest
care and thoroughness the possibility of
strengthening the then existing measures providing for safety of life at sea. Almost immediately following that disaster, inquiries into
the causes that led to it were instituted by
Great Britain and the United States. On
behalf of Great Britain the inquiry was conducted by a board under the chairmanship of
the late Lord Mersey. So complete and comprehensive was the report of this board that it
at once arrested the attention of the whole
civilized world and made abundantly clear the
fact that the time had arrived for action on
The British
the part of maritime nations.
Government was so profoundly impressed by
the report of Lord Mersey that it hastened
to take action, and accordingly issued invitations to all the maritime nations to come
together for the purpose of devising, if possible,
means for the greater security of those who
were travellers by sea and also of those whose
calling was of the sea. As illustrating the
purpose that the Imperial Government had in
mind in calling this conference, I quote the
following extract from the invitation issued to
the several nations:"It would be the object of the conference to
endeavour to bring about agreement among the
participating states with reference to the conditions necessary for safety to be laid down in
the case of passenger steamships, and with
reference to other measures in the interests of
the safety of maritime passenger traffie. In
the event of such agreement being arrived at
and embodied in a convention, each signatory
state would be responsible for giving legislative
and administrative effect to the provisions of
that convention and issuing the necessary
certificates to its national ships which comply
with those provisions. The conference would
further deal with the conditions under which
certificates so issued should be accepted as
valid by the other signatory states."
Canada was represented at that conference,
which met in London on November 12, 1913.
The result of the conference was embodied in
a convention concluded and signed on January
20, 1914.
The parties to this convention
were: the British Empire (including Canada,
Australia and New Zealand), Germany. France,
United States of America, Austria-Hungary,
Italy,
Spain,
Sweden,
Norway, Holland,
Belgium, Denmark, Russia and Japan. It was
agreed at the time that the convention should,
if ratified by the signatory nations, come into
force on July 1, 1915. Meantime war broke
out and for quite obvious reasons that convention never became effective.
The position,
therefore. prior to the conference of 1929, was
that while an international standard on many
points for ocean going passenger ships had been
agreed to in 1914, it had not been put into
operation as such. In the intervening period
marked advances had been made both in the
types and methods of construction. and much
additional experience had been gained by all
the maritime powers.

JULY 2QZ19l31
The British Board of Trade in 1927 submitted
to the nations that had signed the convention
of 1914 a memorandum showing in some detail
the work that had been done in the United
Kingdom on the subjects covered by the convention, and putting forward tentative suggestions
for its amendment ar>d for the holding of an
international conference te consider the matter.
The Board of Trade pointed out in this memorandum that their proposais were based on technicai considerations oniy, which shouid be the
same for ail shipe of the samne class, whatever
flag they fly and shouid, if they werewl
founded, provide an adequate baais for discussion. Ail the maritime nations agreed te the
holding of a conference. and one was convened
in London on April 16,,1929. Canada was again
represen.ted at that conférence, which was organized under the presidency of Vice-Admirai Sir
Herbert W. Richmo.nd. When the conference
met it had before it a mass of valuabie information derîved freim actuai experience gained on
the ships of ail nations during the previeus
flfteen years. Therefore At was that the conference of 1929 set te work under conditions
more favourabie than those of 1913-14.
Foiiowing the method adopted at the conference of 1913-14, the conference of 1929 undertook, through five conîmittees, a detailed
examination of the problem before it, under the
following headings: construction, if e saigappliances, radio-telegraphy, safety bf navigtin
certificates. The work of the conference was
compieted on the 3lst of May, 1929, and the
convention now submi.tted for ratification was
signed on tlîat date by the foiiowing nations:
Germany. Commonwealth of Australia, Beigiu*
Canada, Denmark, Spain, the Irish Free gtate,
the United States of America, Finland, France,
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireiand. India. Itaiy. Japan. Norway.
the Netheriands. Sweden, and the Union of
Socialiet Soviet Repubics.
I shahl net deai at length or in detail wi.th
the articles of the convention. The primaTy
object of these articles is te provid-e greater
safety of life at sea. They cover methode of
coneqtruction, life-oaving appliances9, radio-teiegraphy. safety of navigation, and certificates. It
was arranged that two years shouid elapse beta cen, the signing of the convention and its
cpming into force. This was in order that al
intereste affected shoiiid have ample opportunity
of studying its provisions. There is no record
of, txception having been taken by any intereýst
to any of the provi.sions of the convention.'
From this fact it may be assumed that the requirements laid down in the convention meet
the generýai approvai of the nations and may
xiow be submitted for ratification by thie Parliament. May I quote an extract from what
Sir Herbert Richimond said when submitting
the convention te the conference for adoption:
"When 1 one myseif to review this brief
summary 1 have attempted of the work donc, 1
.feel that some of you may f eei disappointed at
niot seeing particuiar measures to which yen
mgv have attached epeciai importance, embodied preciseiy in the form you desired. But
against that 1 wouid ask you te bear in mind
how rnuch the convention as a whole owes te
the frank manner in which you have deait with
oue another throughout the conference. You
have pooled your knowledge; ou have tested.
it by the experienee of al. er more, I need
hardiy remind you, can be done by the nations
acting together than by the separate action of
any single nation.

"I1 now submit the convention for your approval. I do se with confidence, in the flrm
belief that your labours wili produce the reeuits
at which we have aimed-increased. safety of
life at sea without the imposition of burdens
upon shipping which mîght injure that great,
thiaî superlatively important industry. Every
proposai has been subjected te a scrutiny of the
niottt rigorous nature. The advances which the
convention makes are, I venture te think, profitable te the world at large."
May 1 aise quote an extract from the speech
of Senetor Rie, head of the French representativesý, who spoke net oniy for hie own group, but
at the speciai request of ail the delegations, in
support of the convention:
"As yen have rightiy observed, the new
convention represents a great charter from
which the moet satisfactery resuits may be expected in international relations. By fixing the
minimumn conditions of safety applicable te all,
the convention wiil henceforward avoid the
diflicuilties which at any moment might arise
from the divergencies existing between the
maritime legislation of different ceuntries.
"It constitutes not oniy a general agreement
of the utmost value; it is, above ail, a great
work, of humanity.
"Perfection in the construction of ships;
elaboration of detaiied and strict miles for
preventing the occurrence of accidents of every
sort; determination of the type and number of
iife-saving appliances. ensuring the maximum
effieiency in case of shipwreck; such are the
fundamentai bases of the work which. we have
built up.
"This convention goes stili f urther. It involves in many places, and especiaily in the
chapter on radio telegr aphy, the application of
a new and important, principle of solidarity at
sea. This time we have not been content with
increasing the safety of the ship, strengthening
the mulles regarding construction and increasing
the ineans of safety for passengers and crew.
Hcnceforth each ship is given a generai disinterested mission of iifesaving and assistance te
other ships, wbich constitutes a generous and
fruitflil innovation, a valuabie example of the
great brotherheed of the sea.»
The rest of the memorandum deals with
ioad fines. I shall read it, if the House desires, or place it on Hansard.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Ail riglit.
The rest of the memorandum foiiows:
The ahipping intereste of ail the nations have
long desired uniformity in the assigniment of
load uines te merchant shipa. The British (loyorrament appoinited n oommittee in 1927 te study
the whoie question of the assignenent of ioad
lines and report its findings. That conmnittee
reported in'1929, and ite report was submitted.
te the Goverumente of the severai maritime
natbions fer further &tudy and consideration.
The British Government subsequentiy issued an
invitation te the Governinents of the nations
inter-ested to send representatives te an international conference te be heid in London. The
inivitiation was accepted. and acordingly a conference convened in London on May 20, 1930.
The Governent of Canada was represebted
at this conference, which was presided over by

418

SENATE

Admiral Sir Henry F. Oliver, the head of the
British delegation.
Altogether representatives of thirty Governments were in attendance at the conference,
which continued to sit until July 5, 1930, when
the convention which this Bill proposes te ratify
was approved and signed by the accredited
delegates of all the nations represented. These
were: Germany, Comîmovnwealth of Australia,
Belgium, Canada, Chile, Cuba, Denmark, the
Free City of Danzig, Spain, the Irish Free
Sta.te, the United States of America, Finland,
France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, Greece, India, Iceland,
ltaly, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, Norway, New
Zealand,
Paraguay, the Netherlands, Peru,
Poland, Portugal. Sweden, and the Union of
Socialist Soviet Republics.
It should be kept in mind that the assigniment
of load lines is primarily for the protection of
human lives. All other considerations are secondary te this first and great purpose. As in
the case of the Safety of Life at Sea Conventien. the best methods of ship construction were
thoroughly considered, and the convention in
this respect represents the combined experience
of the technical experts of all the nations. It
also provides the manner in which ships shall
be equipped and manned.
The convention
divides the oceans and seas into seasonal zones.
This division was determined, net on economic
grounds, but strictly on meteorological records
of storims and hurricanes in the several areas
over a period of more than twenty years.
Canada is interested in all the zones into
whieh the oceeans have been divided, by reason
of the fact that as tine goes on our ships and
our men will be found on all the oceans, in all
seasons. We are especially interested in the
zones in the North Atlantic and North Pacifie
oceans.
In the North Atlantic the southern
hundary of the seasonal winter zone is a line
drawn frein the east coast of North America
along the parallel of latitude 36° north, te
Tarifa in Spain.
In this zone there will be
six months summer and six months winter for
the purpose of load line.
That is, slightly
deeper loading will be permitted during the
period froin the 16th of April te the 15th of
October than during the remainder of the year.
This division, it will be seen, places the ports
of St. John. Halifax, Sydney, Montreal and
Quebec in the same area and subject te the
same considerations as the United States ports
of Portland, Boston, New York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore. etc. The convention also provides
that in this zone the summer season is extended
one month for ships loading for Southern ports.
In the North Pacifie the southern boundary
of the seasonal winter zone is a ine drawn from
the east coast of Korea along the parallel of
latitude 350 north te t-be west coast of Honshiu,
Japan, and from the east coast of Honshiu
along the parallel of latitude 35° north te
longitude 1500 west and thence along a rhumb
line te the west coast of Vancouver Island at
latitude 50° north. Thus it will be seen that
the ports of Vancouver and Victoria. and the
west toast of Vancouver Island as far north
as 50°, will for certain voyages be in a permanent sumner zone.
The saine condition
applies te Prince Rupert for vessels taking the
inside passage.
Representations have been
made te me te the effect that t-be northern
boundary of the permanent summer zone in
the North Pacifie should be extended to include
Prince Rupert. I am advised that that issue
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

was raised in London during the conference,
but it was pointed out that there was great

difflculty in extending the permanent summer
zone te approximately 54° north on the Canadian coast while the northern limnit on the
Japanese coast was 35° north. It was further
peinted out that any difficulty in this connection
could be overcome by using the inside channel.
The convention as signed does not apply te
the Great Lakes. This omission bas attracted
attention and representations have been made
regarding it. The exclusion of the Great Lakes
wvas mad2 at the instance of the United States
delegation and on the requ'est of the Government of that country. The existing legislation
authorizing the assignment of load line by the
United States authorities expressly excludes
the Great Lakes. The matter was the subject
of discussion between the Canadian and the
Aimerican delegations at the conference.
The
desirability of marking vessels trading on the
Great Lakes w as conceded and it was informally understood that the question of umaking
arrangements to that end would at an early
date be brought te the attention of both Goveruinents.
The convention as now submitted for ratificatien bas been before interested parties for over
six months, and so far as the Marine Department is concerned no serious objection has been
voiced te any of its provisions. As already
pointed out, the main purpose is not te expedite
commerce, although the importance of thmat is
not lost sight of, but te provide greater safety
for human lives. The president of the conference. Adniral Sir Henry F. Oliver, in submi.tting the convention for the approval of the
delegates said:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members of the Senate, this piece of legislation is of considerable importance, but it
follows a line to which the world to-day is
becoming accustomed, that of co-operation in

international matters. Innumerable problems
that cannot be dealt with by any nation alone
can be grappled with and solved by all the
nations acting together. This is one of the
important matters in which nations must
unite to lay down rules which shall govern
all. An effort is now being made to extend
this principle to ]and questions, and more and
more we shall set co-operation become the
general law of nations.
I am happy to note that the United States
occasionally joins with the rest of the world in
international co-operation.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

of the Canadian National Railway lines to form.

Canada, and will inquire whether any investigations have been made with this object in
view.
He said: Honoura'ble senators, I desire to
caîl the attention of this House, and of the
Governinent in particular, to certain conditions, which perhaps are extraordins.ry,
now facing the railway companies in Canada.
It is a very long time since railway building began in Canada. It started as far back
as 1836 in and around the city of Montreal,
and in 1852 in certain parts of Ontario. For
a long time afterwards -a railroad was t-hought
to be the most advanced means of transportation that could possibly ha conceived.
Piehaps there was a time when no hon-oura;ble member of this House imagined hie would
live long enougli to discover that railways
could ba too numerous.
From the point of vicw of national importance, railroad construction in Canada mauy
he divided into three periode. In the first
period, for the purpose of conveying products
of the Maritime Provinces to the centre of
Canada, the Intercolonial Raiiway was built,
in addition to the canal system, which was
designed for the transportation of goods to
Ontario and the West, and which, as it has
turned out, has also been used for shipmente from the Wcst eastward. The Intercolonial, like the canal system, was neyer
expected to ha a paying proposition, and ail
attempts to make it psy have faiied. As I
have stated in this honourable bouse bef ore,
I arn entireiy opposed to having the Intercolonial utilized for any other purpose than
developing the Maritimes, benefiting the
industrial life of those provinces, and eonveying to themn certain necessary agricultural
products that are grown farther west. American raiiroads give a discount in freight rates
on eastern products going westward beyond
Chicago, and we couid f ollow a similar priticipie ini the operation of the Intercolonial.
The next important development was thc
building of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, for
which the Conservative Party was responsible. The party to which honourabie gentlemen opposite belong did not support that
undertsking in its early d'ays; it severely
criticized every inch of construction and every
messure that was adopted to help the project along.
Then the provinces stsrted to build railways, giving thein provincial charters. Nearly
ail those roads have been unable to carry
on independently and have had to be grafte!i
on to one or other of the national systems.
The old Grand Trunk Railway preceded,
the Canadian Pacifie, but it couid not be
called a national road, although it was aideï
with the money of Canada.

ROOT VEGETABLEïS BILL
CONSIDERATIO'N 0F MESSAGE
COMMONS

FROM

The Sonate proceeded to consider a message
from the House of Commons disagreeing to
the amendment made by the Sonate to Bill
87, an Act to amend the Root Vegetabies Act.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, y-ou will remembor tbat when the
Root Vegetablos Bill firat came before this
House tbe honourable member for Queen's
(Hon. Mr. Sinclair) desired an additional
clause. I did not see that it was going to
interfere with the working of the Act, and
I quite readýily acceded to it. The amendment to wbicb objection is now taken is the
one that wc inserted at the instance of the
honourable gentleman, namely, that the regulations sbould be printod in the Prefix of the
Statutes. Tbe objection taken by the officors
administering the Act is this. The ordinary
citizen, the man in the street, would flot have
acceas to the Statutes. The regulations miglit
be changed during tho course of the ycar, as
is frequently donc, and by amending- the
Act in the way suggested wo might deprive
the public to a considerable oxtont of the
opportunity of obtaining the curront official
information as to what the law and rogulations are. The Statutes are puhlishod only
once a year, whereas the rogulations might
be published montb by month, or week by
week, just as the public interost required.
Thereforo I beg to move that the Senato
do not insiat upon its amendment to Bill
87, entitlod "An Act to amend the Root
Vegotables Act," to wbicb the House of Comnmons bas disagreed.
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I fail to sec the strongth of the
honourable leader's argument. I did not
tbink, and I do not now believe, that it was
intended by the amcndment to discontinue
publication in the Canada Gazette. The
annual printing of the rogulations passed during the preceding year would have furnished
suppiementary information to the public.
However, I undorstand from my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) that, as ho
approved of the Bill as it stood, hoe wiil not
insist on his amendmcnt; but hoe can speak
for himacîf.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR. Honourable gentlemen, I agree with what the honourable leader
on this sidc of the House bas raid. The
amendment that I offered was init-iated by
mysoîf. I thought it would help a little in
making the regulations more readily availabie
to anme people who at the prosent time bave

trouble in getting into toucli with them. 1
would point out to the honoura-ble leader of
the Government in this flouse that the proposed amendment would flot have taken anything away fromn the provision with. reference
to the publishing of the regulations. My
amendment in no way detracted from the
present Act. We were only adding a littie
further publicity by having any changes in
the regulations, and the regulations themselves, printed in the Prefix to the Statutes
next issued after such changes were made.
To say that this would delay the publication
of the Statutes each year is drawing the
point pretty fine. I do not think it would
delay such publication more than two hours.
I oannot see how it could he said that it
would be misleading to the public, because
the regulations are now published in full and
the amendments are issued from. time to time
in pamphlet form. We ail know how many
pamphlets corne to our offices at present from
various Governent departments, and how
they are strewed about and mislaid; whereas,
if we had the information in the Statutes,
as I suggested, it would be on file and always
ready for re'ference.
However, as the honourable leader on this
side has said, while I do not agree in the
slightest with the reasons that have been
given against my amendment, I will not insist on it. It was only a minor amendment.
The statute is what rnight be called a skeleton
Act, the pith of the legislation being contained in the regulations, and for that reason
I thought my amendment would help; but
as I amn fully in accord with the Act itself,
and strongly support it and the inspection
that is carried on under it, I agree to the
adoption of the motion made by the honourable leader of the Government.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Honourable
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
gentlemen, in a moment I amn going to move
that the Senate adjourn until Monday. The
Clerk of the flouse has been kind enough to

PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. T. J. BOURQUE: Honourable senators, on a question of privilege in which I
think ail members of the Senate s9hould be
interested, I direct attention to a newspaper
report of July 22, the newepaper being The
Telegraph Journal, published at Saint John,
in New Brunswick, the province from which
I corne. The reference is to the proposaI of
the honourable member for De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) for the adoption of a rule
governing the relationship of senators with
the Governrnent or Governrnent departments.
I read what 1 consider to be the misleading
introduction in the newspaper mentioned, as
follows:
Senate defeats -Béique motion. Would have
barred senators from benefits of Governrnent
relations.
I contend that that staternent leaves the
Senate under the imputation that its members are opposed to a law against improper
relations between them and the Government
or Government departments. The imputation rnay be unintentional; certainly it is flot
justifiable. As one who voted against the
motion, I protest.
The matter is now dealt wiùh and governed
by a statute law, chapter 147, sections 21
and 22 of the Revised Statutes, with which
every one of us is familiar. Such a rule as
proposed by the honourable senator for De
Salaberry could not have been bînding on any
senator and could not have been enforced.
These facts should have been stated by the
newspaper il it desired to give its readers a
correet, understanding of the vote in the
Senate.

1My awn view is that any arrangement which
makes for the interchange of products that are
interchangeable is f ar better for the countries
concerned thszn a high wall of protection,
for if we surround -our country with a high
Chinese wall and say we will buy nothing, we
shall seli nothing. Buying muet correspond
ta selling, particularly in a c.untry like
Canada. I think it je agreed by everyane that
we cannot consume adi aur products m'id that
we muet have -outside markets. Inetead of
criticizing this trade arrangement, I think it is
along proper limes, because it makes for an
interchange of producte wheréby we can sel
goode of which we have a surplus and buy
on hetter terme goods that we do not produce. I will mot make a detailed examination
af the large number of items mentioned in the
echeduies. My inclination at thîs time of
stress is ta smotbier any criticismn such as I
might have made under other circumetanees,
and 1 wouid express the hope that the good
effecte of the treaty will exceed ail aur
expectations.

Hon. E. D. SMITH: Honourable senators,
as I amn qualified, according ta the remarks of
the rîght hanourable gentleman from. Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) ta say a
f ew words upon this treaty, I take the opportunity of doing sa. The Bill was given ite
second- reading at aur hast sitting with such
lightning speed that it had passed that stage
befoi'e I realized it was proper ta ta'lk on the
matter.

This Australian Treaty is framed somewhat
differently fromn the previaus one. I remember very well that when the previaus treaty
was brought into this Chamber in 1925 1
inoved in opposition ta it a resolution which
I had no intention of pressing, for my abject
was only ta bring out discussion. My criticismn at that time wae that the Government
haed slready adopted low tarifsé and that the
treaty would give certain goode from Australia
the benefit of even lower duties than those
which were already in effect against importe
from other countries. I suggested that it would
be better ta rais the duties i the general
tariff so that when a reasonable reduetion was
made ta Australia, or any otiher cauntry with
whieli we desired ta, deal i such a manner,
there wauld still be lef t sufficient protection
ta preserve the Canadian market ta a large
extent for Canadian producers. That criticiem was ehown ta be juetified in somns
measure, because when Canada adopted the
New Zealand Treaty the duty on butter was

475

so low as to give New Zealand a great advantage in the Canadian market, and flot to protect our fartners at ail.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But it is higher
now.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I think that low duty
had something to do witii the change in
the complexion of the House of Commons on
the 28th of July laet. This treaty je framed
upon different limes. Though giving preferences to Australia, the Government of Canada has th*ought it necessary to maintain the
duty on certain goods from Australia at a
point high enough to afford the -Canadian producers some protection. As the general tariff
has been plaeed somewhat higher, Austoeaia
stili has an advantage in this market. The
trade -agreement follows lines such as I
suggested six years ago, when the previaus
Australian Treaty was discussed in the Senate.
I think this treaty will be to the advantage
of hoth countries. In negotiating an agreement of thîs kind it should he the aim of each
country-and it ie avowedly Sa in this instance-to get considerable advantage without injuring the other. When that aim. is
a-chîeved the treaty ie an idea. eand model
one. Surely it is possible ta arrange treaties
of that kind. Under the present treaty nearly
ail the goads mentioned ini the Australian
tariff may be imported from. Canada into
Australia at preferential or special rates. It
seems ta, me that these special rates will he
of great advantage ta this Dominion, particularly the rates applying ta our exporte of
lumber, fieh and neweprint. It happens that
these are producte of three great industries in
British Columbia, which is the province nearest ta Australia. *No one can deny Vhat at
the present time the lumber and neweprint
industries are in the doldrums and need wliatever assistance can be given them by the
breaty with Australis. There is euch a large
difference between the duties ta be levied
under this treaty and those applicable under
the generai tariff that 1 cannot help thinking
that ultimately, if not immediately, a large
trade will be built up with Australia i Iumber, newsprint and fish. On the other hand,
I think, this tariff will be of great advantage
to Àiustr&lia in many ways, with regard ta,
products that that country can ship ta
Canada without injurioualy affecting our
producers.
But there le one fiy i the ointment, and it
is here that the ides af the right honourable
gentleman from Eganville (Righ.t Hon. Mr.
Graham) is applicable. The fiy i the ointment is that the duty upon wine je rediuced to
a very low figure. Whether thaît je going ta

SENATE
work a great injury to our Canadian grapegrowers or not depends upon the action of
the Government in passing some remedial
legislation or some regulations to offset the
disadvantage that Canada may suifer.
Under 'this treaty Australia should be able
to capture the greater part of the Canadian
market for high-class wines, which now come
from Europe-from France, Spain, Portugal
and Italy. The wine which Australia is permitted to ship into this country, and upon
which there is paid a bonus of 42 cents a
gallon, is of a high grade, testing 34 degrees
proof spirit. That wine will come into cornpetition with other wines, par.ticularly those
of the four European countries that I have
mentioned. The du'ty levied under the French
Treaty, which is the prevailing duty on the
wines of the four countries I bave mentioned,
is 55 .cents on wine testing 26 degrees 'proof
spirit, plus 3 cents for each degree of increased
strength of spirit up to 40 degrees. This ensures, as against European countries, a duty
of 79 cents a gallon on wine of the same
strength as the Australian, namely, 34 degrees.
Then the European producers have to pay
the cost of transportation to Canada. Those
are the impediments in the way of shipping
wine 'frorm Europe to this country-a duty of
79 cents a gallon, and .the freight. What is
the situation with regard to Australia under
this treaty? In the first pilace, as I have
said, Australia gives a bonus on wine of 34
degrees ýproof spirit at the rate of 42 cents a
gallon; secondly, the duty on that wine coming into Canada is only 25 cents a gallon.
So Australia bas an advantage of about 95
cents a gallon over the European countries.
As Australia produces a grade of wine equal.
I understand, to thalt produced in the
European countries I have named, and as
it can be laid down here nearly a dollar a
gallon cheaper, Australia ought to be able to
capture the Canadian wine market. You will
see, therefore, that we have granted a considerable advantage in that regard.
A very large quantity of wine is brought
into this country, and it is increasing. Under
the French Treaty the European wine producers had a considerable advantage over our
own manufacturers. In 1922, the earliest year
that offers a fair comparison, France exported
to this country 114,864 gallons; last year she
exported 338,369 gallons. In 1922 Spain exported to Canada 110,034 gallons, and last
year 290,589 gallons. Portugal expoited to
this country in 1922 only 21,117 gallons; but
last year the quantity increased to 140,720
gallons. Italy in 1922 exported to Canada
only 5,938 gallons; last year, 73,659 gallons.
The total from all these countries amounted
Hon. Mr. BMrrT.

in 1922 to 251,953 gallons, and in 1931 to
813,337 gallons, an increase of 234 per cent
in nine years. During the same period our
population increased not more than ten or
fifteen per cent. This shows h-ow reduced
duties tend to increase imports.
Now that there is an advantage of almost
a dollar a gallon in favour of an Australian
wine similar to the wines that come from
European countries, surely the trade will go
largely te Australia. So far as that is concerned, it is all to the good. I believe
thoroughly in encouraging trade with the
other Dominions and the Mother Country,
and in giving them a preference even over
friendly countries with which we have been
trading.
But we must ask what effect this is going to
have on the Canadian wine industry. It is
truc that at the present time we do not
manufacture very much wine, if any, of the
grade that I have referred to. Possibly no
harm will be done. If prices remain at the
present level, I do not believe the Canadian
wine industry will suifer any injury; but with
the enormous advantages that the Australian
producers have under this treaty they coid
reduce their prices so that our Canadian wine
makers could not possibly compete unless
some very important concessions or ameliorations were granted by the Government. The
bonus of 42 cents a gallon on the Australian
wine covers not only the duty of 25 cents a
gallon, but also the freight to Vancouver,
thus enabling the producers to lay down their
product in Canada freight and duty free. It
will be difficult, therefore, not only for the
European producers, who have to pay a heavy
duty, but also for our own wine makers, to
compete. There are several concessions, however, that would enable our own wine manufacturers to enter into successful competition.
Before discussing that point, however, let
me indicate some of the handicaps under
which our own wine makers labour. First,
they are subject to the excise tax of 71 cents
a gallon, whereas wine coming from Australia
does not pay any excise tax. Then they have
to pay an excise tax of $9 a gallon on the
spirit that is used to fortify the wine. In Australia spirit is free. Because of that tax of $9 a
gallon our wine makers do not use spirit. The
complaint has been made that our wine
makers do not make a good wine. They cannot, because they cannot afford to pay the
S9 a gallon for spirit to fortify the wine.
Then there is the sales tax of 4 per cent.
Further, the wine makers must have refined
sugar; they say nothing else will do. Prior
to the present session of Parliament there

JT.LY 27, 1931
was a rebate on refined sugar, equivalent to,
the duty paid on it. That rebate amounted
to about $1.89 a hundred. That has been
abandoned. Ail the wine makers get now is
a rebate of 28 cents a hundred-the duty on
the raw sugar paid by the refiner in Canadaa difference of about 81.60 to their disadvantage. In spite of ail this they have to compete with the Australian wine makers, who
receive a bonus of 42 cents a galion.
I wjsh now to say just a few words in regard
to the situation of our grape-growers. Grapegrowing bas been quite profitable in Canada for a number of years. It began to be
profitable, I think, when the prohibition law
was passed in the United States. At that
time the price of grapes in that country went
so, bigh that we Were able to export them
fromi Canada, and the growers here got big
prices f or them. For two or three years the
price was maintained by reason of the purchases of our wine makers, and as a resuit
the growers made heavy plantings, at the
rate of 2,000 acres a year, for perhaps four
years. The first plantings are now in full
bearing, the second plantings in haîf bearing,
and the others are bearing a littie or coming
into bearing, and during the next few years
grape production will be increased. Up to
the present production bas been absorbed
by the wine makers and the fresh grape
market. The fresh grape market has taken,
I should sa:ý, around 6,000 tons, and the wine
makers have taken in good years as high as
14,000 tons. This year the crop is expected
to reach 30,000 tons.
About a year ago the wine makers filled
their tanks with concentrated grape juice
fromn California. Prohibition in the United
States caused a great increase in the production of wine in that country, and the price
of grapes went very high--$120 a ton. As a
consequence the growere in Clifornia commenced to plant heavily; they planted. 200,000 acres within two years. When I say that
we have flot more than 12,000 or 15,000 acres
of grapes in Canada you will realize what
that meant-over-production. Then the price
went s0 low that one year the Government
paid the California growers $9 a ton to leave
a portion of their grapes on-the vines in order
that they might get something for the remainder. Then they found an outiet for
their product by making concentrated grape
juioe. Our wine makers became aware of
that before the grape-growers did, and fflled
up their tanks with it. They bought the
equivalent of ab.out 10,000 tons of prapes.
wbich. was shipped over here in. tank cars.
Then the grape-growers of Canada appealed

477

to the Government, and at the >ast session
of the last Parliament provision was made
to enable the Government by Order in Council to place a higher duty on this conoentrated
grape juice, if it saw fit. Previously the duty
was not more than one-quarter of the duty
on fresb grapes. A few days after the election, before the late Government went out
of power, it passed an Order in Council providing that the duty on concentrated grape
juice sbould be equivalent to the duty on
freslh grapes. If that had been 'done a year
earlier it would have saved the situation.
The importation of that grape juice is one
of the things that are helping to cause an
overplus of grapes at the present time of
depression, when there is not as great a demand for wine as there has been in previous
years. This year there is bound to be a surplus of anywbere from 10,000 to 15,000 tons
of grapes unless some very drastic steps are
taken, by regulation or otherwise, to remove
some of the impediments in the way of manufacturing wine. Unless that is done the
grape-growers here will suifer a great calamity,
just as the California grape-growers did.
Now I will mention some of the things that
I tbink ought to be done by the Government. First, it should grant a remission of
the sales tax of 7j. cents a gallon on wine.
That is an easy thing to do, but it will detract from the revenue going into the
treasury.
Hon. Mr. SMEATON WHITE: I th-ink the
sales tax would apply to the Australian wine
as well as to the Ca-nadian. I think it is
ievied on bath.
Hon, Mr. SMITH: Probably it Ïs. I ehould
noît have said the sales tax; I meant the
exccise tax. I mentioned the sales tax before.
That might be remitted. But both the sales
tax and the excise tax produce considerable
revenue, and at the present tirne the Goverument cannot stand any reduction of revenue.
There are other tbings, however, that could
be done and would not cause any loss of
revenue. Owing to the ladk of regulations
and 'ta the irresponsibili.ty -of many wine
makers, wine bas been made from as little
as five pounds of prapes to the gallon. When
I tell you that it takes thirteen and one-half
pounds of grapes to prodiice a gallon of pure
grape juice, you wilýl realize what poor wine
it is. The Government might pass a regulation requiring manufacturers to, use not less
than nine or tcn pounds of prapes to a gallon
of wine. The wine makers say that there is
an objection. to going beyond that" point;
that because of the acidity of the grapes they

between Dominions. H1e knows a great deal
about such matters, and I have no doubt
that hie is rig.ht, in that statement. It seems
to me there are many good features in this
agreement between Australia and Canada.
With regard to the general tariff, my opinion is
that we require duties only on things we can
manufacture or produce, and that other t'hings
should enter Canada free of duty. There is
a. great opportunity for trade with Australia
in accordance with that policy, and I arn
glad to see .we are taking advantage of 1V.
For example, Australia requires certain woods
which are not grown in that country and which
we can supply, such as fir and pine lumbher.
These and other goods, including newsprint,
are to be admitted into Australia on special
termne, and in return we shall allow the free
entry into Canada of certain goods which Australia produces and we do not, such as walnut,
silky oak, peanuts, prunes, dried currant-which we use in carload lots--and other
things. Why should we have a duty on these
products? I understand that British Columbia
is now making somne attempts to produce
prunes, but so' far only on a small mcale.
Therefore no harmi can be done by the free
entry of prunes into this country at present;
on the contrary, our consumers will get Vhe
beqnefit of ths resu.bting low prices. I notice
that oranges also are Vo be on the free list
for six months sach year. I shall fot go into
details, for I have not ths figures bef ors me,
but I arn sure that the importation of these
goodsa under the treaty will not harm anyone
in Canada. I f eel satisfied that Austrailia is
getting a fair bargain also. In My opinion
this is an ideal treaty, and ths more of the
same kind that we con. make with oCher
Dominions, the better.
'Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Hlonourable
senators, I wish Vo make a few observations
on the treaty, especially with regard Vo the
fortunate frame of mind of the two contracting parties. Honourabis members know that

I joined Vhs Australians, spending a couple
of weeks on Vhs ocean with themn and somne

I received the grea test hospitality. I was
miuch impressed by the attitude of the Antipodeans towards Vhs Mother Country, and
by their evident desire for the most friendly
trade and other relations with the rsst af
the Dominions. Australia is even more
British than we are. Its population is very
largely drawn from the Old Land, and its
foreign element is comparatively small. The
feelings between that country and Canada
are pleasant, as they ought Vo be, and it
would be rather our own fault if we changed
our attitude. I do noV think thers will ever
be any occasion for that.
This reaty has one signal advantage over
the previous one. IV was always obvious to
me that the old reaty would prove harmful
Vo our farmers. There is no necessity to
argue that point now. IV muet be conceded
by both parties, for Vhs party that was

Why would Vhs laVe Government have Vaken

be brought to the attention of the Government by the honourable gentleman to my
right (fon. Mr. Robertson), and some of the
conditions referred to may be romedied. As
I have already said, such a procedure is
possible under this troaty. It is perfectly true
that in other respects this treaty doos not give
to Canada many striking advantages that the
old treaty did not, but we cannot expect to
have it ail our own way. As the honourable
member for Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon) remarked, this is, on the whole, a good treaty
for Canada. My 'purpose in rising was to
emphasize the fact that now we can negotiate
for a change in any part of the treaty which
in operation proves to be injurious.
Hon. A. H. MACDONELL: Honourable
senators, I desire to congratulate the honourable gentleman from Wentworth (Hon. Mr.
Smith) on the 'lucid way in which he presented his case. But he omitted to inform
us on two points which I think should be
cleared up in order that wo may be able to
decide whether this Bil shold be passed or
net. I shouild like to know the approximate
number of grape-growers who will be affected
if this Bill is passed, or defeated. Secondly,
I should like my honourable friend to tell me
approximately the amount af Canadian capital
that would be affected by the passage or rejection of this Bill. We rcally cannot proceed further with this matter until we know
whether there are few or many grape-growers
concorned, and whether they have invested
only a few thousands of dollars or many
hundreds of thousands.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I might say to my honourable friend that there are at least 15,000
acres of grapes. On each acre there would
be at least $100 worth of material-such as
vines, posts, wire, and so on-which I suppose might be considered as an investment.
That is in addition to the value of the land.
I do not know the number of men, but it
would be in the thousands, who are engaged
in producing grapes in the Niagara district.
The industry is a very important one from
other points of view. Grapes can be grown
upon land that is not quite suitable for
peaches, cherries or berries, and about half
the land in the Niagara district, where the
climate is so favourable for the production
of grapes, is of this type. That district
bas room for the production of at least
three times as many grapes as are now
being grown thore. But even if we utilized
all our suitable land we should fall short of
Australia, where at present 44,000 acres are
used by grape-growers.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: May I ask what
is approximately the amount of Canadian
capital that would be affected if this Bill were
passed?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: The wine industry is a
aig one.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: We want to
know the approximate figures.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I do not know what the
capital is, but it is large. I do not go so far
as to say that the Bill will seriously injure
the wine industry or the grape-owners, provided the Government adopts some of these
proposais to take up some of the surplus this
year.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: The honourable gentleman tas quoted figures showing the increse in the importation of wine from 1922
to 1929. Could he give us also the increase
in the production of grapes in the Niagara
district during the same period?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: In Canada?
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Or in Canada.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I could not give that.
It has increased very much. Speaking roughly,
I should say it bas doubled.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
members, may I refer briefly to the subject
under discussion? I have Lad an opportunity of knowing something of the consideration given to the treaty and the work done
upon it. It is doubtful, I think, whether more
time or greater care tas ever been given ta
a treaty between two Dominions of the
British Empire. This treaty was negotiated as
a result of extensive conferences, held first
in London, when the Imperial Conference was
in session, and subsequently when the Hon.
Mr. Meloney, Mr. Abbott, and other gentlemen from Australia, including Mr. MaaGregor,
Trade Commissioner in Canada, spent not
merely days but weeks in carefully discussing
the details of these proposais with the
Canadian Government in order to ascertain
what effect they would have on the trade of
both countries.
There is one feature that has not been
mentioned to-night, which may be worthy of
the attention of the House. Both countries
produce certain articles of the same kind,
but the season current in one country is the
opposite of the season in the other. When it
is summer in Canada it is winter in Australia.
An interchange of the products of the two
countries is possible without their coming
into conflict. The treaty provides that certain

JULY' 27, 1931
sea-sonal fruits may be shipped from Canada
to Australia at seasons of the year when they
are plentiful here anid when, because it is the
middle of the winter in Australia, t-hey are
flot being produced there. During certain
months; of the year we slip fruits to Australia, and during certain other months they
ship the same kind of fruits to Canada. This
resuits in benefit to both countries.
I think that seldom, if e'ver, fias there been
as careful a study of the effects of proposed
changes in the tarif! relating to Australia as
in this instance, and I arn sure that the trcaty
will be of great service to Canada by reason
of the fact that it covers over four hundred
articles on which Australia gives us the benefit of the British preferential tarif!. I think
also that no treaty has been more closely
scrutinized than the present one by the
business interests of both countries. Af ter
careful investigation by the business men of
Canada, the treaty is found universally satisfactory, with. the exception of the grape industry. Even our friends the grape-growers
are, I believe, coming to the conclusion that
if the- business interests of Canada had
wakened up to the facts a littie earlier, and if
a littie protection had been imposed against
the great influx of grape juice that came
here in carload lots, they might flot be facing
the dangers that they now fear. However,
that situation cannot be helped. It is the
fauit of nobody in particular. But the situation would not have been so bad il the wholesale export of California grape juice had been
discovered sooner than it was.
I can assure the honourable member from
Wentworth (Hon. Mr. Smith) that the suggestions lie lias been good enough te, make
wiIl be brouglit to the attention of the Minister of National Revenue, together with the
Prime Minister and tlhe Minister of Trade
and Commerce, who have taken a very great
interest in the negotiating of this treaty.
Very likely some of the honourable senator's
suggestions w.ill bear fruit wlien tliey are
considered by the Government.
Tlie motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and 'passed.

the necessity of the re-election of members of
the House of Commons of Canada on acceptance of office.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

What does it

Honourable
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
senators, very little explanation of this Bill
is necessary. In Great Britain the age-old
practice has held until comparatively recent
years, that if a member elected to the House
of Commons accepted an office of profit under
the Crown he had to go back to his constituency for re-election; but, as all honourable
members are no doubt aware, the British
Parliament a few years ago passed a statute
containing provisions similar to those in this
Bill. For a few years prior to the passing
of that Act in the Old Country a member was
not obliged to seek re-election if appointed to
an office within nine months after his election,
but he was obliged to seek re-election if he
received an appointment after the expiration
of the period of nine months. We know of
cases in which ministers have failed in their
attempts to be re-elected. In this country,
however, the return of a minister is virtually
certain. In some cases the circumstances attending such a re-election have not been conducive to governmental morality. The opposition goes out to flesh its steel, and, I dare
say, promises of appointment to office have
been made to enlist aid to carry the reI think the proposed change is
election.
wholly admirable. It results in the saving of
a certain expense to the country. I well remember reading of the old days of pocket
boroughs in the Old Country-how some territorial magnate controlled the elections in several constituencies.
Such a thing is not
possible in Canada, in any of the other
Dominions, or in Great Britain to-day.
I
think re-election involves unneeossary expense and probable turmoil, and, unfortunately, as I have indicated, it results sometimes in what is a too apparent public auction
of offices.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Honourable members, I suppose that the
Commons, like the Senate, feels strongly
about its dignity and that it is entitled, if
not by right, at least by custom, to control
its own affairs and determine the way in
which its members shall be elected. Of
course the whole country, including the
Hon.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Senate, is interested in the Government. The
Government has a representative in the
Senate, but happily not through an election;
and while he could do some of the things that
the leader (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) has mentioned, he could not lose his seat by doing
them.
There is a good deal to be said in favour of
a measure of this kind, but I should like
it better if a time limit were set, because
conditions change very rapidly. I think it
would not be unwise to provide that a member of the Commons appointed to office after
a period of two years following the general
election-I would go so far-might have his
appeal for re-election challenged. Governments have been known to grow very weak
within two years, and the result of the byelection would perhaps be a warning to the
Government either to brace up or to prepare
for the inevitable.
However, the Commons, I presume, has
threshed this matter out thoroughly and has
arrived at the conclusion that it wants to
manage its affairs in the way indicated by the
Bill, and, as our member of the Government
does not have to become involved in all
those evils of election time, I do not feel
inclined to press for amendment of the
measure.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 53, an Act for the promotion
of vocational education in Canada.
Honourable members, perhaps
He said:
this Bill is of sufficient importance to warrant
a word of explanation before it is passed.
The previous Act referring to this matter was
called an Act respecting technical education.
This time the title is changed: it is an Act
for the promotion of vocational education in
Canada. The purpose of the Bill is similar
to that of the Technical Education Act passed
in 1919. At that time the term "technical
education" was used, rather than "vocational
education," because Parliament had previously
provided special grants for the advancement
of agriculture and agricultural instruction.

JULY 28, 1931
Those grants having been discontinued in
1924, I think, and agriculture being an important and indeed a basic industry in Canada, it is now proposed to make the grants
referred to in the Bill available to assist the
provinces in promoting vocational education
whether of a purely technical nature or relating solely to agriculture, which is becoming more and more technical in its operation.
Little need be said, I think, regarding the
desirability of technical education. It is true
that prior to 1900 very little special recognition
or assistance was given to technical education
throughout the world. Primary education was
carried on in schools, and for higher education
colleges and universities were available. As
time went on, however, and the world became more and more industrialized, various
nations began to pay special attention to the
training of youth in connection with industry,
and to-day thirty industrially important
countries have legislation dealing with technical and vocational education.
In 1905, I think it was, certain men who
were particularly interested in the welfare
of the working man first proposed that consideration should be given by Canada to the
subject of technical education. In 1907 the
Trades and Labour Congress of Canada went
on record in this respect, and in 1908 the
Canadian Manufacturers' Association did likewise. In 1909 a motion passed in another
place to institute a governmental inquiry into
what was being done in this regard in other
countries, and what could be done in Canada, resulted in the appointment of a Commission, which toured various countries of
the world and gathered exhaustive and
extremely interesting information. The efforts
of that Commission culminated in a report
that was filed with the Government in, I
think, 1913.
Then the war broke out. Naturally, at
such a time the country's domestic afairs
were temporarily set aside and its main
energies devoted to the struggle that was
going on, and it was not until 1919 that the
Government of Canada again found time and
opportunity to deal with technical education.
In that year a Bill was brought into the
House of Commons by the honourable member for Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) proposing the establishment in Canada of a system
of aid to the Provincial Governments in
carrying on the wofk of technica-l education.
That Bill was accepted by Parliament and
became operative the same' year. It provided for assistance to the provinces in the
form of a grant of $10,000,000, extending over
a period 'of ten years, to bec distributed on
22112-311

483

the basis of population, and fixed a minimum
of $10,000 a year for each province to be used
as a nucleus in carrying on the work.
During the next ten years certain provinces,
which were a little more advanced industrially
than others. found it desirable and necessary
to take a special interest in the legislation;
other provinces, not so highly industrialized,
and more interested perhaps in agricultural
activities, did not take full advantage of the
Act. During the ten years that Act was
operative some $7,000,000 odd were distributed
in grants to the various provinces of Canada
to help defray the expense of carrying on
technical education work. This distribution
was of great assistance towards increasing the
number of schools for technical education
and the opportunities for industrial training.
In 1927 various Provincial Governments,
business interests, employer interests and
labour interests joined in requesting the.
Government of that day to continue the grants:
for technical education beyond the periodc
specified in the law, which expired in 1929.
If any honourable gentleman desires the
facts in that regard, I shal be glad to submit
them in detail. In 1929 the Government did
not see fit to renew the Act, but introduced
a Bill under which the unexpended portions
of the grants to the provinces which had not
exhausted their allocations under the 1919
Act remained at their disposal.
Since 1929 some of the provinces that in the
beginning did not take full advantage of the
opportunities afforded by the Technical Education Act have begun to show a more active
interest in education, and so it has come to
pass that every Provincial Government in
Canada and every employer interest, labour
interest and business interest have joined in
expressing the view that vocational education,
as it is now termed, should be continued.
It was felt, however, that large expenditures
of public moneys should not be made until
the necessity and the consequences of such
expenditures had been carefully considered;
and in the preparation of the Bill that ie
now before this House due regard was paid to
those factors.
The Act of 1919 provided for grants to the
provinces on the basis of $1,000,000 a year
for ten years. At the expiration of that term
there was an unexpended balance of roughly
$3,000,000. That amount has since been
greatly depleted by the provinces which of
late have taken full advantage of the opportunity to improve their educational and
training facilities.
The Government has
thought it well, therefore, to contract activities
just a little, and instead of appropriating a.

not contemplate any interference by the
Federal Government in the educational systein of any province. We all know, because
we have had many evidences of it, how jealous
the provinces are on this subject, and how
they have resented every attempt on the part
of the Federal Government to interfere in
any way with the conduct of education. I
do not feel quite satisfied in my mind that
this Bill does not contemplate some such
intervention. A reading of it has somewhat
impressed me with the possibility that this
is the entering of the thin edge of the wedge.
There is nothing in the Bill to show the
extent to which this Government may claim
the right to interfere in the carrying on of
vocational work according to the policies of
the several provincial educational systems, or
otherwise. If this Bill is merely an offer to
contribute a certain sum of money, just as an
individual offer might be made to help
vocational education in a province, there cannot, I confess, be very much objection to it.
My diffliculty is that thus far I do not see that
that is all it amounts to, and I should like
very much to know whether I am right or
wrong.
Another thing that I think we ought to
know is, at whose instigation this Bill has
been introduced. Have any of the provinces
asked for it, and, if so, what provinces? Have
they expressed their concurrence in the provisions of the Bill? Are they satisfied that

In other words, it is proposed to appropriate
over a period of fifteen years a sum equal
to the aggregate voted by Parliament in 1919
for the ten succeeding years. The present
Bill provides also that the Governor in
Couneil, on the recommendation of the Minister, in relation to the agreements between
the Federal Government and the various
provinces, may make regulations governing
the interpretation of the Act so that it will
be a little more elastie in its operation than
was the former measure. The sum appropriated is to be devoted to the promotion of
technical and vocational education by affording better opportunities for the acquisition
of skill than would otherwise be available, to
the rising generation, especially young people
who are far removed from the larger centres.
Perhaps this explanation will suffice for the

On behalf of the Government of this province I would urge that the assistance rendered

my honourable friend will accept my word
that it is so.
Then, following the letter from Hon. Mr.
MacLean which 1 have just quotcd, a similar
communication concerning the same subject
was received from. every other province in
Canada. The latest is one received on May
9, 1931, from. a Provincial Government, pressing the matter upon us, and calling the attention of this Government to the fact that it
ought nlot to overlook the renewal of the
technical education grant.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What aibout the
other point, as to the Dominion Government's
share in the expenditure of different amounts
by the provinces? Perhaips interference is not
the right word. Is this Government going to
take any part in the primary school, college,
or univeisity educational systemes of the provinces which. are going to carry on this work?
Or is the matter to be left entirely anid exclusively in the hands of the provinces?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would point out
to m.y honourable friend that the Bill proposes eco-operative action between the provinces and the Federal Government much along
the samne lines followed for the ten years that
the former Act was in force. I would respectfully suggest to himi and to the House that
thoseý, details might be discussed in Comýmittee to 'better advantage.

480

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I will move the
Bill into Committee, if you like.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable members, no one will question the advisability of
vocational education being developed in this
country in all its various aspects. The primary
question whieh presents itself to' my mind is
as to the wisdom of the Federal Government assuming at this stage such a large
financial responsibility. We know the state
of the treasury, and we suspect what it will
be next year. I will not make any predictiýon
extending beyond the next twelve months,
but I hope we shall see afterwards a prosperous
period. Under the present circumstances I
an somewhat doubtful as to the propriety of
deciding here and now that we will saddle
the federal treasury wiýth an expenditure of
$750,000 a year for fifteen years. This represents an enormous sum.
If this proposition is to be accepted, I
commend the clause which declares that the
payments shall be made to correspond to the
proportion which the population of the province bears to the population of Canada, as
determined by the latest federal decennial
census. The Confederation compact laid down
certain rules as to what the provinces should
receive from the federal treasury. The financial clauses were perhaps the hardest to
agree upon. The provinces were handing over
to the Federal Government their customs and
excise and were receiving in return so much
per head of their population according to the
census of 1861. This basis has been adjusted
and now payment is made according to the
population at the latest decennial census.
In this 'Chamber I have alwavs taken the
ground that the Federal Government should
respect that arrangement in increasing its
payments to the provinces. I remember that
this Chamber twice rejected a Bill which
involved an expenditure of S10.000,000 upon
roads, because it insisted that the payments
should be in proportion to population; then
the Government yielded, and brought down a
Bill in which that principle was respected. I
am happy to observe that in this instance
the principle is adhered to.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby, the

Hon. Mr. Gillis in the Chair.
Sections 1, 2 and 3 were agrced to.
TTi.

Mr.

ROBERTSON.

On section 4-agreement with province:
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think the Minister
should explain to us the nature of this section,
and the new ground he is taking in regard to
the agreement, as compared with the old Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This section refers
to the agreement made with the provinces.
which outlines the activities that may be
regarded as coming within the scope of the
Bill. The Technical Education Act of 1919
was confined exclusively to industrial education,
the development of industrial activities, and
the training of industrial workers. As I
stated in my remarks on the second reading,
there was another grant thon in force, amounting to $1,000,000 a year, under what was known
as the Agricultural Instruction Act, whereby
similar assistance was given to the agricultural
industry. Some provinces are not as highly
industrialized
as others, and are more
particularly engaged in agriculture. That
agricultural grant was dropped by the late
Government in 1924. The present Bill wvas
drafted so that the agreement which must b
negotiated between every province and the
Dominion, in order that the intent of the
legislation may be carried out, may include the
education of the people, particularly the
younger generation, in agriculture as well as
industry, if the conditions of the province concerned indicate the need of such education.
It might be mentioned, in reply to a question
raised a while ago, that the total yearly payments to any Provincial Government are not
to exceed a proportion of the yearly appropriation corresponding to the proportion which
the population of the province bears to the
population of Canada.
This is the same
limitation as was applied under the Technical
Education Act. There is no change in that
regard, as to the proportionate grant being
based on the population.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I understood that
the old Act provided for a flat grant of $10,000 annually to each province, and a further
sum according to population. If I understand
the Bill rightly, the Minister bas eliminated
the flat grant and based the payments entirely
on population. That is scarcely fair to the
smialler provinces, because they have to pay
a higher cost per head for education than the
larger provinces, and are not able to go into
such a viaried line of education.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I quite appreciate the anxiety of my honourable friend
fromn Prince Edward Island, because under
the old Act his province reccived the same
primary payment out of the grant as any
other province, oven the large Province of

JULY 28, 1931
Ontario; but I arn inclined to think that it is
flot unfaîr to fix the amount of the payment
on the basis of population. If there were a
fiat grant of 810,000 for every province, and
in addition a per capita allotment, the total
paymept to Prince Edward Island would ha
o'bviously out of proportion to those made to
the other provinces. Prince Edward Island
dîd not take full advantage of the grant avaitable under the Technical Education Act of
1919, the reason being, I presume, that it was
receiving corresponding advantages from the
Agricultural Instruction Act. The Government feels that it is fair to place that province on a par with the rest of Canada as to
the right to participate under this proposed
law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can the honourable Minister tell us how much of that
$10,000,000 provided for under the Technical
Education Act was spent, and what eaclî
province received?
Hon. Mre. ROBERTSON:
Yes, that information is here. If honourable members
will refer to Vocational Education Bulletin
No. 30, issued by the Department of Labour,
for the fiscal year 10,29, they will find the
amount available for Prince Edward Island
was $198,187.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In 1929?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTISON:
No; for the
ten-year period.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Up to 1929?
Hlon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, up to 1929.
There was actually paid to Prince Edward
Island the sum of $71,665. Perhaps it is flot
necessry for me to quote the figures for the
other provinces.
Out of the total of
810,000,000 provided for in 1919 there was
paid to the nine provinces a total of $7,964,600.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What was the
rule by which the amounts were apportioned?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: On the basis of
the census.
Hlon. Mr. SINCLAIR: After the flat payment of $10,000 was made.
Hon. Mr. RO'BEiRTSON.- Af ter the fiat
payment of $10,000. Now Prince Edward
Island has a population of between 80,000 and
90,000. 'If aIl the provinces received a fiat
grant of 810,000 and the remainder of the
$7'50,000 were to be divided into paymonts
based on population, Prince Edward Island
would get more than twice as much per
capita as any other province. The Government felt there should not be such discrimination, inasmuch as the Garden of the Gulf,

487

as it is commonly and justly known, has a
per capita wealth equal to that of almost any
other province.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: When I -asked the
Minister a question I did not intend to discuss this Bill from the viewpoint of Prince
Edward Island particularly, aithougli I arn
quite ready to do that. In considering technîcal education or vocational education one
must remember that Prince Edward Island is
flot an industrial, but an agrieultural province.
Hfon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

And fishing.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
Agricultural and
flshing. Under the first Technical Education
Act the grants were conflned to vocational
and technical education and Prince Edwnrd
Island had very f ew channels through which
the money could be axpendad. This proposed
legisiation applies also to agricultural aducation and tharefore will work more fully to
the advantage of the people of my province.
Our position was explained by the Provincial
Premier to the Royal Commission that investigatad Maritime dlaims a few years ago,
and the iCommission recommended that grants
for agricultural education should be made
from the amount stili remaining under the
old Act. il think the Department of Labour

doing so.

Yes, and is still

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
Sînce that time
Prince Edward Island bas been reoeiving more
benafit from the expenditure of that money
than it formerly did.
There is another question 'I should like
to a-sk the Minister. Under the old Act a
portion of the moneys allotted to, each of the
provinces could be spant on buildings, equipmuent and plant. Will it be so under the naw
Act, or is it the intention to confine expenditures more strictly to education?
Hon. Mr. ROBERT-SON: The present
Bill contemplates that only a proportion,
whîch. shahl be agread upon, shall be spent
for such purposes out of the grant to each
province. The Technical Education Act of
1919 provided that flot more than 25 per
cent of the moneys should go into plant and
equipment and that at least 75 per cent
shouhd be used for educaition itself. I thirjk
I made a somewhat crude remark during the
discussion on that Bull in 1919, when I stated
the intention was to spand flot, more than
25 par cent, of the grant on bricks and mortar,
and at least 75 per cent on brains, because

the object was to promote technical education. Under this Bill there is no set amount
or proportion for buildings and equipment,
but that is a matter to be agreed upon between the individual provinces and the
The

Federal
knows that a number of provinces are well
supplied to-day with buildings, equipment
and plant, while others are not in such a
fortunate position, probably because they began technical education activities comparatively late, and therefore their needs in this
respeot are correspondingly greater. During
the fifteen years that this Act will be in
operation it may be found necessary to spend
25 per cent or even more of the grants to
some provinces on buildings and equipment,
while a smaller proportion may be required
for such things in other provinces. Therefore the fixing of the proportion is left to the
discretion of the provinces concerned and
the Federal Department of Labour, which will
be administering the Act.

attention of the Minister. He mentioned

spending a considerable amount on technical
education at the Technical College in Halifax, where a course is given every winter for
the benefit of fishermen in the Maritimes. Is
it intended that this technical education shall
be carried on in future under the Department of Labour?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This Bill does
not contemplate any interference with the
activities of the Department of Fisheries.
The statement of my honourable friend only
demonstrates the fact that Prince Edward
Island is not being overlooked in regard to
technical education, even as it applies to the
fishing industry; and still further justifies the
attitude of the Government that the provinces should share the grants under this Bill
on a per capita basis.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think the Minister misunderstood the point I made. The
centering of the technical education at Halifax is not a compliment to Prince Edward
Island, but rather the reverse.
If the
technical education in fisheries came under
this proposed legislation, Prince Edward Island
fishermen would be able to take the course
in their own province. At the present time
there is only one centre for this training in
the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Will my honourable friend permit me to interrupt? A few
moments ago he referred to the fact that
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Prince Edward Island was an agricuiltural
province, and I interjected "and fishing." But
I said nothing at all to indicate that this
Act would apply to the fishing industry.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: My honourable
friend's interjection was quite right. But the
point I am trying to make at the moment is
that our fishermen have to go to Halifax if
they desire to take advantage of the technical
education provided under the authority of
the Department of Fisheries. If that education were given under the authority of this
Act, or if the educational activities of the
Departments of Labour and Fisheries were coordinated, the money to pay the cost of
educating Prince Edward Island fishermen
would be spent within the province. As it
is now, the Provincial Government has had
to go so far as to pay the travelling expenses
of young fishermen to Halifax. Many of these
young men find that the cost of leaving home
and staying in Halifax for the duration of the
course is more than they can well afford.
I can assure the Minister that our people
would benefit greatly if the instruction were
given in the Province of Prince Edward Island, and I hope he will take the matter into
consideration.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think it is quite
possible that some agreement can be worked
out betwcen the Federal Government and the
province that my honourable friend represents.
The Act is based upon the assumption that a
certain amount of money will be granted to
each province, conditional on the expenditure :of a like amount by the province. If
Prince Edward Island spends a certain sum
to send fishermen to Halifax for special education on technical linos, there is nothing to
prevent the making of an agreement between
the province and the Federal Department of
Labour that a portion of the province's
grant h:ould be earmarked to cover such ex.
penses.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
The honourable
Minister says there is nothing to prevent an
agreement.
Is there any reason why the
Act could not be made to cover that?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes. The Art
must be drawn to meet conditions in the
various provinces. Some provinces have no
fishing industry; Saskatchewan, for example.
It is not possible to provide in the Act itself
for all detailed arrangements that mav be
necessary.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Are we to understand from what the Minister has stated that
the amount of the grants by the Dominion

JULY 28, 1931
Governmant is to be determined in any way
by the sum the provinces spand on vocational
education?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Surely.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:- I do not sac anything i the Bill ini regard to that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn unable to
refer my honourable friand to the particular
clause at the moment. But he surely remembers
that the 1919 Act, which bas bean in operation
now for thirteen yaars, provided that the grant
aiiocatad by.the Faderai Governmant to each
province wouid ha made oniy on condition
that tha province spent an equal amount of
its own rnoney.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not ramember
that. But I arn deaiing with this Bill, and
I do not see anything of the kind in it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourabla
friand may ha quite right. The regulations
and agreements made with the provinces wera
executed a good many yaars ago, and I have
not iooked into them. Subsection 2 of section
4 of the Bill provides:
The total payments made to the government
of any province in any one year shahl not
exceed a proportion of the yeariy appropriation mentioned in section threa of this Act,
corresponding to, the proportion which the population of the province bears to the population
of Canada, as determined by the Iatast faderai
decennial census.
It may be that the provision to which I
refarrad is contained in the regulations, but
at the moment I arn unable to state definitely
whether this is so. I assure my honourabie
friand that the Faderai Government is not
going to hand out grants to any province for
the promotion and assistance of vocational
or technical aducation unless the province
gives practical evidence of its desira to promota such aducation within its own boundaries.
Hon. Mr. COPP:

To what extent?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I can give my
honourable friand assurance now that so
the prasent Govarnment is concernad
is no intention to maka a grant to any
ince in excess of what the province
spends.

Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my bonoura<ble friend say that that wiil ha made part
of the raguhations to ha formuiated under

section 5?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If necessary, yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I1f that is the intention, suraly there, shouhd be something
more in this Bill, because at the present time

49

it contains nothing on that point, whatever
there may have been in the A-e of 1919. 1
can understand it if my honourable friand
says that is going to be a matter for regulation under section 5.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Read section 4.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Section 4 says:
The payments to be made to any province
shall be conditional upon an agreement being
entered1 into between the Minister and the
government of the province as to the ternis,
conditions and purposes on and for which the
payrnents are to be made and applied, and
such agreements shall be subject in ail cases
to the approval of the Governor in Council.
1 have explained to mny honourable friand
the senior rnember for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belco.urt) what the practice has been, and 1 asseTt,
as the Minister at present rasponsible for the
adjmini.stration *of the Act, that the Government intandis there shail bc a continuation of
that practice, so that the provinces must do
their share in order to be aligible for assistance.
-Hon. Mr. COPP: Why flot put that into
the Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
what provisions were in the Aet of 1919. If
the clauses of the present Bill agrea with the
text of that Act, it would be interesting to
k-now what agreements ware made betwaan
the Federal Governrnent and the provinces
and wh'at regulations were issued. I notice
that section 5 of the Bill makas these provisions:
The (}overnor in Couiicil may, on the recommandation of the Minister, make regulations
with respect to the f oliowing matters:(a) The definition of the expression "vocational aducation" in this Act;
(b) The particular types and grades of vocational education to Nwhich assistance may be
granted;
(c) The procedure to be foliowed in the
administration of this Act;
(d) The axtent te, which assistance may be
made available towards the continuance of
existing vocational education work;
(e) The axtent to which assistance may ha
made availabie for lands, buildings, aquipmant
and furnishings;
(f) The axtent to which any portion of the
annuai appropriation under this Act rexnaining
unexpendad at the expiration of anky fiscal year
may be carried forward and ramain available
thareaftar for the purposes of this Act;
(g) The auditing- of vocational education
accounts; and
(h) Any other matter as may ha deanied
expedient or necessary for the purpose of
carrying out the provisions of this Act.
I do flot know whether the ternis of this Bill
are the sama as those of the former Act, or
whiat the ragulations were under that Act.

situ

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
ternis are almost the same.

In effect,

the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Agreements were
made with the provinces on the basis of those
regulations?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is truc.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As my honourable
friend is going to administer the Act, I am
quite prepared to accept his statement as to
what he is going to give the provinces; but I
maintain that that feature is not covered by
the Bill. However, in view of the honourable
Minister's statement, I am not going to insist
upon its being covered.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I may say to my
honourable friend that it would be unfair to
put such a provision into a Dominion Act,
because, as he mentioned an hour ago, education is at times a matter somewhat controversial and the regulations governing the
operation of this Act ought therefore to be a
matter of agreement between the provincial
and the federal authorities. I trust that my
honourable friend will accept that as sound.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If I understood the
Minister aright, each province must spend an
amount equal to that spent by the Federal
Government. If so, that must be the basis
of the agreement. Under the old Act it was
so stated. Subsection 1 of section 5 of Chapter
73 of the Statutes of 1919 says:
The grant payable to any province in any
year shall not exceed the amount provided for
each province by the next preceding section,
nor shal it exceed an amount equivalent to
that which the provincial government shall
expend on technical education within such year.
If I understand the Minister aright, there is
no such provision in the Bill, and the amount
of the grant is to be arrived at by agreement
with the province.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is intended to
continue that arrangement by regulation, and
to give the province an opportunity for coosultation in regard to the conditions which
are to govern its actions.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The very fact that
that is to be done by regulation conveys the
impression to the ordinary mind-to mine
partieularly-that there may be a change from
vear to year. It seems to me, however, that
there is a principle involved, which, I should
tike it, 'is not intended to be changed from
time ta time. That is the reason I ask if
the provision cannot be included in the statute
itself rather than in the regulations.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The regulations,
when made, remain in force for the term of
the Act unless there is good reason for changing thein. That reason, I assume, would have
to come from the provinces, because the
Federal Government proposes only to assist
then in carrying on vocational education
work. If the provinces agree to a dollar for
dollar basis and do not ask to have it changed,
there should be no difficulty; but if a province
should find reason for change, it would have
an opportunity of approaching the Federal
Government.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If such change were
asked for, it could be made without coming
to the Federal Parliament.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Quite so. With
the approval of the Governor in Couneil.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: So in that way we
are making the Bill more elastic and are not
laying down the principle that the provinces
must spend dollar for dollar with the Federal
Government. It is within the right of the
Governor in Council to change that principle.
It is the basis of the whole agreement, and
I think it should be embodied in the Bill.

What clause sets

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: May I ask the honourable Minister if there is any reason for
dropping that provision from the present
Billl? Was it found that section 5 of the Act
of 1919, providing that the Federal Government should contribute an amount equal to
the amount contributed by the province for
technical education, hampered the administration of the Act.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The clause the
honourable gentleman has just read.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is in the Act
of 1919. I am looking for a similar clause in
the present Bill.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: So far as I am
aware, no real difficulty arose under the old
Act, except that it seemed to inflict upon
the provinces something that they might not
feel inclined to accept. This Bill leaves the
matter wide open and gives the provinces
cqual rights with the Dominion in negotiating

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Perhaps I owe an
apology to my honourable friend for not
making myself clear. The very language that
the honourable gentleman has just read seems
to me to make it clear that the grant is conditional upon payment by the province of an
amount equal to the grant.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
that out?

ternis. If the Federal Government were to
attempt to do by legisiation what ran be
done by regulation, it might be found that
whýiJe it suited Quebec it would no~t suit
Prinice Edward Island. Therefore it wus feit
that we should flot tie one province down to
the same agreement as that for another province by putting into the Act an arbiitrary provision.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The regulations wilI
vary in the difi'erent provinces.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: That goes to the basis
of the whole Act. Under the old Act the
Federal Government was willing to, asist the
provinces to the extent to which they were
willing to Vax the.mselves for a particular purpose. To-day a province may say. "We do
flot want to spend a cent," and there is nothing
to prevent the Governor in Counicil from
approving of payment and saying, "We will
give the money in spite of you."
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend overlooks the fact t-hst the regulations
inust be approved by the Governior in Council, and thact he can approve them only after
an agreement has been reached between te
province concerned and the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: And the Governor in
Council can approve a grant to a province
without that province providing a cent.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: There is nothing in
the Bill to prevent it. In the old Acit there
wvas somethîng to prevent it.
Section 4 was agreed to.
Sections 5, 6 and 7 were ag-reed to.

GRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. WIiLLOUGHBY moved the second
reading of Bill 1113, an Act to amiend the
Criminal Code.
He said: Honrourable members, if you look
at this Bill you will flnd that'it contains a
series of amendments which are unrelated

491

Vo one another, and that there is no common
principle underlying them ail. 1 suggest that
we give the Bill the second reading and senci
it to Committec of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As it is an
omnibus Bill, we had better go into Committee
on it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think s0.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: Honourable members,
it has been usual to refer bis relating to the
Criminal Code to a special committee. Honourable gentlemen will rememiber that when
the late Senator Ross was leader of the
Senate amendmients to 'the Criminal Code
were always referred to a special committee,
and that certain amen'dments that hiad gone
through. the other House were thrown out
when they reached that committee. Amendments were brought forward by the Women's
Christian Teruperance Union and similar
organizations until it almost seemed that any
particular group of people could get through
the other House a Bill to niake a crime of
an action that neyer before had been regarded as such, and simply because the members of that House, who are only human,
preferred that it shouid not be said. on the
hustings that they approved of suclian action.
I think it wouid be better to refer this Bill
to a special committeeso8 that we could cali
the Deputy Minister of Justice or other
witnesses who are interested in the Bill. I
arn one of those who look with great suspicion
on amendments to the Criminal Code which
make offences of things that neyer bef ors were
offences. This is being dons fromn time Vo
time at the request of this, that, or some
other society. To my mind it is a serious
matter to amsnd the Criminal Code, and
amiendments should not be .passsd without
serious consideration. This B'ill makes new
offencs.s and creates nsw crimes, and many
of the amsndmsnts should be examined with
great particularity. I would move the adjournmient of Vhe debate in order that the
leader on this side of the House may indicate
whether or not *he consents Vo Vhe formation
of a special committes Vo consider this Bill
t'horoughly.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 arn quite
aware that the policy referred to by the
honourable gentleman was adopted on one or
two occasions with respect to buis amending the Criminal Code; but at least some :)f
that legislation was of a social character and
enacted *a certain social code in which many
members of this House did not believe.

492

SENATE

May I ask the
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
honourable gentleman whether he will consent to the Bill going to a special committee?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I will come to
that shortly. There is no objection to the
Bill going to a special committee if that committee can consider it and dispose of it before
prorogation. We have heard that Parliament
will prorogue by the end of the week. If
we amend this legislation, it must go back to
the other House after we have dealt with
it. If I were perfectly sure that the appointment of a special committee would not delay
the Bill, I would net object to its going to
such a committee. I do not think, however,
that the Bill contains any of the ultra-moral
provisions to which our late leader on this
side. and manv other senators, took exception. If ihere is any such provision it is perhaps the eue contained in section 2, which
deals wifh parading while nude, and is applicable to the Doukhobors.
Personally I
have no objection to the course that has been
suggested.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: There is one
observation that I should like to make,
whether the Bill is dealt with by Committee
of the Whole or by a special committee.
Section 3 of the Bill says:
The said Act is further amended by inserting
immuediately after section two hundred and
twenty-two thereof the following section:Every one is guilty of an indictable offence

and liable to a fine not exceeding five hundred
dollars and not less than one hundred dollars,
or to six months' imprisonment, who manufacturcs, imports, offers for sale, sells, distributes
or uses any living culture or preparation of
living micro-organisms-and so on. Honourable members will recall
t
that on several occasions I introduced in o
this House a Bill looking to the prohibition
of the manufacture, importation and sale of
fircarms. I think everyone will agree that
the section which I have just read is in some
way, at all events, quite germane to the provisions of the Bill that I introduced. I may
remind my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby) that my Bill had the approval
and commendation of several-I think mostof the Attorneys 'General of the provinces
and had the strong support of the chiefs of
police of Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, and
other cities. I appealed to this House on
several occasions to support the Bill, and th
House responded by passing it. For some
reason or other it was not taken up by the
preceding Government and net passed by the
House of Commons; that is, the Bill we
passed here did not become law. I have
appealed to the proper authorities during the
present session to take up the Bill passed by
lon.

M-r.

WILLOUGHBY.

this House after very careful consideration,
but apparently my appeal has not been heard,
for we have now before us, I assume, all the
amendments proposed te the Criminal CodeHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: -but

I presume se.
there is no

mention in these about firearms. I would
ask my honourable friend opposite who leads
this House and has charge of the legislation
whether he will not remind the authorities,
to whom I have referred, to take up that Bill.
I believe the time has come when the Government ought to take upon itself the responsibility of introducing on its own account the
measure which this House has passed on
several occasions. If, as has been suggested,
the amendments now before us are referred
te a special committee, there will be ample
time to have a provision such as I proposed
introduced from that committee.
I do not intend at this hour to labour the
question or to repeat here the arguments
used in support of the Bill, by myself and
others, on the different occasions to whici I
have referred; but I imagine that the reasons
that induced this House to pass the Bill on
those occasions are still fresh in the minds
of all. I think that events which have been
occurring weekly, or almost daily, in the last
few years have intensified the arguments
advanced in its support. It seems to me that
a measure to prevent the manufacture, sale
and importation of fire-arms in this country
bas become much more necessary, and indeed
urgent, than wien we discussed it before.
I therefore consider it my duty to appeal
to my honourable friend opposite and ask
if he will net exert himself to have the
Government take up that Bill and make it
a part of the amendments to the Code.
Hon. Mc. WILLOUGHBY: The Bill referred
to was the subject of a great deal of discussion last vear, but I cannot undertake on
behalf of the Government to place it on the
agenda for next session. We have a member
of the Governmient here. I suggest that,
without any pledge being given, the Bill
might be brought te the attention of the
Deputy Ministor or the Minister concerned.
Now,. if it be the wish of honourable gentlemen on both sides of tlic House to send the
present Bill to a commoittee, and if that committee will meet and do its work to-morrow,
such a reference is quite agreeable to ic.
I would ask my honourable friend the leader
opposite if that is his wish.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: I have glanced
througli the Bill and have very little to say
on the different sections, except clause 2.

493

JULY 28, 1931
which may caîl for some comment. I have no
objection to our exarnining this Bill in Coinmittee of the Whole; but I am willing that
it shouhd go Vo a special comrnittee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would observe
that section 2 refers to conditions that have
recently arisen and seemn to justify approval
of the section as submitted. In the Province
of British Columbia the census enurnerators
have lately experienced difficulties due to
conditions that were nothing short of disgraceful.
I am not disHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cussing the merits of the proposition. I arn
in agreernent with virtually the whole section, except that I doubt the propriety of
the hast paragraph.
Section two hundred and five of the said
Act is amended by adding thereto the followini subsection:'(2) Every one is guiity of an offence and
hiable upon summary conviction to three years'
imprisonent who, while nude,"
-et cetera. That is ail right; that meets
with my approval; but it seerns Vo me that
the Iast paragraph might weil be struck out.
because it beclouds the whohe of the section.
It is this:
For the purposes of this subsection any one
shali be deemed to be nude who is so scantily
clad as Vo offend against public decency or
order.*
I think that might raise considerable discussion. The first part is very clear, and we
could ail agree to that, it seems to me.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is, as to
a person absolutely nude?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: This particular
paragraph is an attempt Vo describe the meaning of the word "nude." I have consulted
the Oxford dictionary, where the definition
of "nude" is "naked." This paragraph gîves
a definition that is not Vo be f ound in any
dictionary. 1Vis an arbitrary definition, and
I doubt the value of it-or of the whole section, for that matter.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 agree with
my honourable friend frorn Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans). We layrnen do noV know
much about these amendments Vo, the Crimmnal Code, although we shail have Vo be
subjeet Vo Vhern, the saine as the rest of you.
Many an amendiment Vo the Crirninal Code
is slipped i just to cover sorne special case
that sorne leading member of Parliarnent or
sorne leading hawyer or judge has corne across
in his practioe, and perhaps it covers only
the one case. We layrnen should feel safer
if a special cornmittee of the lawyers would
tske this Bill and examine it.

As for this particular paragrapli that we
are discussing, 1 shouid hate to be on a jury
that had to interpret what "nude" meant.
I rnight geV the interpretation ail wrong.
What rnight be considered nudity by a jury
in one part of Canada might not be considered nudity at ail in some other section.
If you could put a clause in there to commit men who wear too much clothes in the
summer, and add to their discomfort, I should
vote for it more Teadily than for one condemning those who wear Voo littie. We talk
about. -the ladies being subi ect to fashion,
but we men are mu-ch worse than they are.
We are afraid. to go anywhere in our shirt.,leeves for feur that some person will obi oct
to it, and we wear enough clothes in the
summer Vo protect us against a temperature
of ten degrees below zero, and so we suifer.
I ithink there ought to be some amrendment
to the Criminal Code to indiet men for being
slaves of fashion, and being so much afraid
of whaît people will say that they wear so,
much clothes that they are uncomfortable al
summer.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: As I indijcated

Bill ho referred Vo a special comrnittee.

We liave strieken out the words "offend
against publie deceney or order" and have
subsfituted the words "ýexpose the genital
organs." The reason for thaf amendment is
thaf magistrates and justices of the peqe
throughîout fthe country wouid have been
interpreting in many different ways the words
'1se s(antily clad. as to offend against public
decency or order."
What would offend in
Monfreal miglit not offend in Winnipeg, or
vice versa, and it was thouglit better to make
fthe section clear, se that there ceuid bie ne
difference- of opinion as to what the clause
meant.

JULY 29, 1931
Your Committee thouglit it well also to
add that no prosecution under the Act shall
take place without the consent of the
Attorney General in the province in which
the offence is committed. It appears fromn
our perusal of this clause that it was intended
to operate only in the Province of British
Columbia, the only province in which nuide
processions are held, and that the purpose
was to impose a severe penalty in order to
put a stop to that sort of thing. At the present time such processions are prohibited, but
the punishment is light-only six montlis in
gaol-and the termi is regarded rather as a
holiday than as punishment. This clause
changes it to three years in the penitentiary,
and that terni will possibly have a different
effeot.
The last amendmient that the Committee
made was the striking out of clause 15, which
says that an appellant may apply for bail
to any judge of a Superior Court or of the
Court of Appeal. The present Act provides
that the Chief Justice or the Acting Ohief
Justice of the Court of Appeal or a judge
of that court to be designated by him may,
if he sees fit, admit the appellant to bail.
Representations were made to the Committee
that this proposed section miglit be dangerous, as a convicted mnan might be let out on
bail without the knowledge of the Chief
Justice or the Acting Chief Justice, and might
jump his bail and escape the penalty. It wus
thouglit wise that the present statute should
be left as it is.
Hon. N. A. BEIÀOOURT: Honourable
members, I should like to suggest to the
honourable gentleman that the purpose of the
Committee with regard to section 2 of the
Bill would be completely met by the elimination of the last clause of that section, ivhich
reads:
For the purposes of this subsection any one
shail be deemed to be nude who ie so scantily
clad as to affend against public decency or
order.
In other words, there would be no necessity
for the new definition that the Oommittee
lias suggested if these words were stricken out.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What words?
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: The whole of that
paragrapli I have read.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: I miglit be able ta
explain the Cornmittee's view.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Perhaps it would
be better that I ihould explain rny point
first; then my honourable friend would be ini
a better position to deal with it. 1 think that
in section 205 as amended, subsection 2, para-

graphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), there is a complete provision to cover the matter in question. The *only thinig that makes these four
paragraphs somewhat ambiguous is the defining paragraph at the end, which I submit
should be striken out.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does my honourable friend understand the word "nude"
to mean naked?
Hon. Mr. BLOOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GR'IBSBAGH: Suppose a man
had a handkerchief around his neck.
Hon. Mr. BFJCOURT: My honouraible
friend gave us the Oxford dictionary definition of the word "nude"' yesterday, and 1
t'hink that definition is quite right. Nude
means naked.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Then a man with
a handerchief around bis neck would flot be
nude, and therefore would flot offend against
the statute?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
ring around lis finger.

Suppose lie had a

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:- The dictionary
definition of tlie word "nude"' is "naked."' A
man is not nude if any part of bis body is
covered.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHflAM:
wearing spectacles?

Or if lie is

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The purpose of the
definition. as I understood it, was to prevent
the Doukhobors from violating the intent of
this amendment to the Code by wearing
nothing but a coat, or a pair of shoes or
socks. or something of that kind. Some
definition is necessary to make it clear when
a person should be deemed to be nude, and
the only way the Committee felt that could
bc done was to provide that a person should
be deemed to bc nude if a certain part of
the body was exposed, whether any clothing
wsworn on other parts or not. It is a
rather difficuit question to deal with.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The only point
1 am making is that paragraplis (a), (b), (c)
and (d) of subsection 2 are ample for the
object at which we are aiming, and there
would have been no confusion in anyone's
mind if the defining paragrapli had not been
added. Evidently tlie gentleman wlio drafted
the Bill thought it necessary to put in those
words at the end to remove tlie possibility
of doubt, but in my opinion lie bas only
made the thing ambiguous.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would my
honourable friend read the Committee's suggested amendment that wvould make it necessary for the Attorney General of the province to give his consent before a prosecution
could be begun?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
No action or prosecution for a violation of
this section shall be conmeneed without the
leave of the Attorney General for the province
in which the offence is alleged to have been
committed.
In the Lord's Day Act there is a similar provision, but it goes further and limits the time
for bringing an action to sixty days from the
time of the commission of the alleg-ed offence.

rontemplate that citizens of the great republic to the south of ns should be se, regarded, or that any of them who are among
us should be interfered wvith in any way.
The suggestion has been made that before

JULY 29, 1931
Honourable
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
senators, I presume it would be difflcult for
the Committee to which. this Bill was referred
flot ta accept the recommendations that have
come from bath sides of the House, and
just at this moment from the representative
of the Government. I feel that the purpase
behind such recommendations has heen flot
Vo defeat the measure, but to perfect it Sa
that it may be in such commendable formn as
readily Vo meet with acceptance in both
Flouses next session. In the name of the
Commi'ttee I therefore willingly consent ta
the withdrawal of the Bill for ths session.
May I take this opportunity of expressing
a thought thýat has occurred ta me? It is
very easy, Vo Vhrow a doubtfui colour an new
legislation. Anyone who takes that attitude
on a proposaI. for meritarious legisiation
renders the country a disservice. There is no
doubt that the purpose of this measure is good,
aithough the means by which the Bill was intended Vo attain its objeot may nat have
been perfect. But, I ask In ail earnestness,
vrhy give this Bill the colour of an Act likely
to lay discredit at the doar of aliens in this
country? Is it noV a fact thae the aliens
who live here are interested in arder being
maintained in the country just as much as
the Canadians thcmselves? Now, is it an
extraordinary thing ta, request from suc1
aliens that they co-operate with us in a reasonabie measure, the purpase of which is Vo
preserve order? I trust that my colleagues wil
fairiy consider this mneasure as ane intended
ta obtain fromn aliens their support and cooperatian in legislation that is necessary for
public order. Why noV present it ta the
public in its proper light? Although it may
be slightly troublesome for aliens ta register
and take out cards, they cannot fail ta understand that this precaution is in their interest,
as well as for the good of ail Canadian
citizens.
Now, honourable gentlemen, my last
thought is this. We are heading Vowards a
hard winter, and liard days are heydays for
troubie-makers. IV is quite passible that next
session -additional and perhaps mare pressing
reasons will cali for this legisia ian, which
tends ta the better contrai of the troubiesame
foreign elements in this country. With the
hope, at ail events, that the Government will
take a keen interest in this matter, amend the
present draft if necessary, and bring it in as
a Government measure next session, I .beg
leave ta withdraw the Bill.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourabie
gentlemen, my honourable friend from Welland was siightiy in error, I think, when lie
spoke of this Bill as being discussed whule hie

was in Western Canada. If hie wili look at
the records of the House hie will find that the
important discussions on this Bill took place
on July 15, and particularly on July 22, just
seven days ago. At that time an amendment
was moved to give it a six-months hoist.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was in Toronto on the 22nd.
Hon. M.r. MURDOCK: Well, I have no
objection to my honourable friend's statement, but I want to cali his attention to the
fact that the discussions were of more recent
date than his trip to Western Canada. I think
the debate which took place on Juiy 22 indicated, without a vote being taken, that the
sentiment of this House was very substantially
against this Bill as brought down. I said
then, and I repeat naw, that I arn ail for a
real, honest-to-goodness identification card,
but this half-baked measure was simply a pretence *of doing that which was necessary. So
that a vote might noV be taken, this Bull has
been permitted Vo stand from JuIy 22 until
Vo-day. I have not the siightest objection Vo
my honourabie friend from-Welland assisting
my honourable friend the sponsor of this Bill
in dealing with it, if the assistance is necessary
in order ta save the distinguished countenance
of that dîstinguished gentleman; and I acquiesce in the withdrawal of the Bill.
The amendment and the motion were withdrawn.

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, I crave the indulgence of

in a frank.way the question of transportation
in Canada, and perhaps elsewhere. The demand comes in the form of a Bill at this

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Instead

of an

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
This is a
change from the method of placing the
amount in an estimate to which there was
attached, for the purpose of covering all the
peculiarities that might arise in securing the
money, a long explanation which was understood by some people, but, I am afraid, not
by the vast majority, even in this House. I
t
hink that this plan is an improvement, because the Bill gives an explanation and leaves
the House freer to discuss the question than
it would be to discuss an estimate presented
in the last few hours of the session. Of course
this Bill will pass, as did the estimate, for it
is a money Bill emanating from the Government. !I think this is an improvement on the
old method because in my time as Minister
I occasionally had great diffliculty in explaining the meaning of the "explanation" at the
foot of the estimates.
The situation of railway companies throughout the world, at the present moment, is not
inspiring, and Canada is no exception in this
respect. In the executives of the two great
railways of this country we have men who
are, in my opinion, equal to the executives of
any railway company anywhere-and I have
met a great many of them, as has my honourable friend during the course of his lifetime.
The fact that our railway companies have
not the net or the gross earnings that they
enjoyed in better times is not a conclusive
argument, in fact is no argument at all, that
those railways are not being well managed.
Every railway company I know of in the
world is encountering a similar experience in
regard to earnings. The Canadian National
have in Sir Henry Thornton and Mr. Hungerford-to mention just one of his staff-and
the Canadian Pacifie have in Mr. Beatty and
Mr. Grant Hall, men who are, I think, equal
to any officials I have known or read of in
similar positions.
Why are the railways not prosperous at
the present time? For the same reason that
so few of us are prosperous in our businesses.
The prevailing conditions strike the railway
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

companies perhaps harder and more quickiy
than they strike any other business organization in the country. If the people are not
raising crops to be transported, there is little
for the railways to do. Immediately the
numbers of trains and train crews have to
be reduced, and this reduction is felt in every
hamlet in the Dominion of Canada, and particularly in railway centres. I need not dilate
on this point further than to suggest 'o
the House that in my humble judgment the
railway companies of Canada are not experiencing the best of the conditions in this
country. Some of our people, with whom I
do not particularly want to associate myself,
always make a point of taking a whack at
the railway companies when they run short
of other material, because such criticism
sounds well; but under present conditions,
I think, the railway companies of Canada are
doing all that can be expected of them.
I know that some honourable gentlemen
will say that railway rates in Canada at
present are high, but comparatively they are
not. The rates in the republic to the south
are considerably higher than the Canadian
rates, yet in the United States an application
bas been made for an increase, and that claim
is now being pressed. Whether it will be
granted or not I do not know, but it shows
the trend of thought among the railwav conpanies there.
A great nany changes and
plans have been proposed in order to improve their conditions. The Canadian railways obtain their traffic from a sparse population, consisting in certain districts of only
a few persons per mile as compared with
thousands per mile in some parts of the
United States. Outside of the business that
the Canadian Pacifie and Canadian National
Railways do in the United States, where the
average density of population is much greater
than in Canada, our railways serve a population that is very meagre indeed; and when
with this .fact is considered the long haul,
such as that froma the Prairies to the East,
or that from the East to the West with return
cargoes in payment for the Western wheat,
it will be seen that the Canadian raivays
are very badly handicapped.
Some person has said that it would be wise
to take up some of the tracks on one of our
railways and use the grade as a highway. I
have not looked into that matter, but it
must be borne in mind that all there would
be in that grade for use as a highway would
be the right-of-way. The grade itself would
have to be made over in order to accommodate a highway sufficiently wide to take
care of the traffic. Then there is this other

JULY 29, 1931
point, which is particularly applicable to a
Government-owned railway, that when a
railway line was constructed com.munities
grew up on eitheT aide of it, and to take
away froxi tlier the transportation facilities
that induced them to go into those sections
is not so easy as it may seem, and any Government considering the question from the
national standjpoint would hesitate to take
the risk of doing that.
It has been said that the present is a time
for economy, and I agree thoroughly with
that staternent. I arn strongly in favour of
economy on our transportation lunes so long
as the economy does not ailow the lines to
deteriorate below the standard of efficiency
and safety necessary in the interests of the
country and the people. It is not easy ta
point aut just where eonomies should be
effected, and I airn not sure that we can progress very far along that uine. No men know
better than the railway managers where furI do nlot
ther economies can be effected.
pretend to know mucli about the transportation proiblem and the inner working of railway companies, though it would not be presumiption if I said th-at I knew at least as
much as a great rnany other people. Hewever, it is quite propeT ta impress upon our
railway companies the great importance of
economy. I believe that this lias been done
and that tliey are doing their best ta liring
expenses down ta the lowest possible level
consistent with due regard ta proper standards
of efficiency.
To my mind the Canadian Pacifie Railway
i.4 the greatest transportation company in the
world, and it is wel1 rnanaged. The Canadian
National is the longest railway systern in the
world . and I submnit that ixnder ail the condiitions it also is well managed. May I be
pardoned for pointing out that a private corporation is not nearly se difficuit ta manage
as a publicly-owned eoncern. Every member
of Parliament lias a personal interest in a
publie utility, because the reipresents the people
ýWho own it. When I was Minister of Railways I somnetimes f aIt that memibers were
taking too keen an interest; I mean, superficiaily. Yet it must bie admitted that in a
Governmrent-owvned utility such as the Canadian National Raiiways every memnber of parliament lias a deeper interest than lie would
have in a privately-owned company. That
portion of the public who have àn interest in
a .privately-owned company are tlie shareholders, ta whom the directors are responsible.
Tlie directors, largely, do the business. I
miglit go furtiher and say tliat in any private
ecompany most of the business is done by the
22112-32J

499

executive officers, who are confinrned. in their
action by tthe dir-ectors, and thtat at shareliolders' meetings the shareliolders are usually
represented by proxies and there is seldom
any great excitement. But the people have
a right ta take an interest in a publicly-owned
utility, and members of Parliament have a
rdglit ta do certain things that the people
expect them ta do. They are not entitled,
liowever, ta dictate exactly how the utility
should lie managed, because in th-at they are
amateurs and they would be tackling a professional problem. The question has be-en
put ta me: "What would the management of
any private company do if the shareholders
were ta grill thiem for a monthl, and if everything said were taken down, and discussed
everywhere?" My answer às that they would
neot stand for it. It is unthinkable that tliey
$hould. I do not criticize that method, liecause the people feel that Parliament ks the
place to obtain the information tliey want,
and tliey expect thle mem-bers of Parliament
ta get it for tliem. However, I think that is
as far as members of Parliament should go in
interfering with the management of a public
utility company. The Government sliould
keep an eye on expenditures and returns, but
the management of the railway sliould lie leît
ta the executive. That is the system that lias
always been followed heretofore.
It miglit not bie out of place for me ta
say that if it be wrang for us ta have the
Canadian National Railway System, the
management of that system is not responsible for that condition. This House, join'tly
with the House of Commons, is responsible
for the buying of what is now the Canadian
National Railway Systern, and for handing
over the management ta a board of directors.
If the present Canadian National management had been asked ta provide Canada with
a railway, would tliey have bujît the variaus
lines tliat were handed over ta them? Surely
not. Nevertlieless, they are asked ta manage thase uines.
There is a difference between a privatelyowned company and a public utility. I will
state that difference as clearly as I can, and
in doing sa I will use the names of aur two
railways, thougli wiat I say applies ta any
private company and any public utility. The
management of the C.P.R. has ta manage a
combinatian of what I miglit call previaus
successes. The lines of that railway were
built wliere the C.P.R. wanted tliem, and
wliere it was believed tliey would secure,
at least in time, sufficient traffic ta make
them pay. The Canadian National management, on -the other hand, lia ta manage a
combination of previous failures, and must

SENATE

500

make every effort to consolidate them so as to
establish an efficient transportation system.
One of the difficulties-and you can sec it at
a glance-was to harmonize the officials of
the two old companies, between whom there
were certain jealousies, some of which perhaps are net yet dead. I can assure you,
honourable gentlemen, that at the time of the
bringing together of the two sets of executive
officials and employees there existed considerable friction and not a little jealousy. How
could it be otherwise? But I say with all
confidence that no man I have ever met
could have succeeded botter than Sir Henry
Thornton in dealing with such a situation,
t
owing to his peculiar ability in that respec .
Men were brought into the same office who
had previously been opposed and almost antagonistic to one another. They were asked
to work together harmoniously. Human
nature is human nature, and the men frein
the Canadian Northern thought that the men
from the Grand Trunk were getting the
plums, and the men from the Grand Trunk
thought the men from the Canadian Northern were getting them. Sir Henry Thornton's
first great task was to bring about harmony
among those men. He was asked to take
control of railways that had previously bern
in competition, and railwvys that had been
built by Governments from a national standpoint and were never expected te pay, and to
weld them into one paying system-a task
comparable to that of a person asked to
buy half a dozen bouses in different parts
of the city of Ottawa and make a hotel of
0
them. I submit that the difficulties wer
almost insurmountable and that under al] the
circumstances Sir Henry has donc marvellously
well.
When this matter was being discussed by
the Government and he was asked to undertake this work I said to him, in the presence
of the Prime Minister: "Sir Henry Thornton,
I want to point out te you that you are
undertaking the biggest raialwy job in the
world. You will have te answcr to Parliament; you will have to answer to every
member of Parliament, directly or indirect ly;
you will be subjected to requests, complaints
and criticisms that no head of a private compan' would have to submit to. You had
better think before you accept the position.
All these things will como. and I want te
warn you of them now." The reply of Sir
Henryv was eharacteristic of him. HP said:
"I like hard jobs. If it woren't a hard job,
I wouldn't take it." It was under those conditions that he was enrigi. and again I
want to point out that I think be has done
remarkably well.
Right Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

Now let nie say a few words as to criticism.
First of all I want to inform the press and
the people who criticize the construction of
the Toronto terminals-and they are costing
a good many millions of dollars-that there
existed in Toronto a situation that; had to
be remedied. That situation was not the
fault of the Canadian National management.
The problem was handed over to the railway officials and they were told to work it
out. Years before the Board of Railway
Commissioners had ordered the removal of
level cross.ings or street grades in certain sections of the city of Toronto, the cost of this
work to be shared by the City of Toronto,
the Toronto Harbour Commissioners, and the
railways. For years the project had been
banging fire.
Tbe liabilitv of the Grand
Trunk Railway Company in this connection
having been assumed by the Canadian
National Railway System, the Canadian
National was desirous of getting it somehow
out of the way. I am not sure whether a
lawsuit had been entered; at least, one was
threatening. I paid a good many visits to
Toronto, and finally, through the efforts of
Colonel Dubuc and the late Mr. Graham
Bell, the parties were brouglt together on a
Then the
proposal, to which all agreed.
money was voted and the work begun. How
could the Canadian Government escape the
obligation to oarry out, at least approximately, the contract that had been made by
the company that it acquired?
Then take the situation in Montreal. I
will say that that city was much more patient
than Toronto. In regard te Montreal the
Railway Board made a similar order, under
whieh the Grand Trunk Railway was to olevate its tracks in that city. Net only the
citizens of Montreal, but, as well, all persons
who have ever visited that city, must realize
the danger arising from level crossings there.
During its later years the Grand Trunk Railway did not have money to carry on the
work. When the Government took over that
railway with all its liabilities, including this
order of the Board of Railvay Commissioners,
this matter came up for consideration, and a
cuestion arose among the engineers as to
whether the order should 'be carried out
literally or whether a larger plan for the
development of a terminal should be adopted.
I may say that personally I favoured joint
terminals. I may say also, without fear of
contradiction, that neither party seemed to
be prepared to join with the other to secure
them. After full discussion, and after the
matter had been placed before Parliament by
the officials of the railway, the larger work
was decided upon, because it was recognized

JULY 29, 1931
that the work that had beau ordered fifteen
years before would not be suitable to the
Montreal of to-day. The work is costiug a
great deal of money, but I submit that the
Canadian -National management is respousible
only to the extent that the work it has undertaken goes beyond what originally was ordered
by the Board of Railway Commissioners. All
the management did was to point out that
if the work was goiug to, ha done it ought to
ha doue proparly in the first place, so that
it would not have Vo ha changed within a
few years. Therefore the proposed axpendiVure is ýchargeable only in a comparatively
small degrea to, the Canadian National management.
Criticism has beau directed also at the
building of the Vancouver Hotel. The Canadian National Raîlway management was not
responsible for the building of a hotel in
VTancouver. I may tell honourable members
that I held off the building of the Vancouver
Hlotel as long as possible. That hotal was buiit
in accordance with the Vermis of an agreement
under which the Canadian Northern Railway
was given certain properties and privileges.
The building of the Canadian Northern in
British Columbia was not a faderal matter.
Mackenzie and Mann entared into an agreement with the Governiment of the day in
British Columbia, whereby that province
should have control in the ntter of rates.
and the authority of the Board of Railway
Commissioners to fix rates should not ha
LaVer the Canadian Northeru
recognized.
]lailway in British Columbia be-came voluntarily, or was declared to ha, a work f or the
genaral advantage of Canada-I forget which.
In any event thara was a liability, and members of this House and members of the House
of Commons cannot geV away from the fact
that wheu we bought that railway we assumned
that agreament. So thera can be no criticism
of the management of the Canadian National
for the erection of the hotel in Vancouver.
I am not crîticizing anybody. I am simply
outlinîng the situation. The Canadian National Raiiways made a compromise and carried out only a small par.t of the uudertakings
of the Canadian Northern Railway which. had
been promised in exehange for privileges raceived fromn tha Province of British Columbia.
I am not trying Vo defand extravagance. I
beliave that in times like this nona of us is
hurt by being shaken up a bit and told that
we must live a little more economically until
.times improve. I understand that both our
.railways are reduciug expandituras and eutting down capital investmeut. What the future holds for transportation companies I do

-501

not know. I have confidence, however, in
our railways. If I had any C.P.R. stock I
would hold it, because I think that, with the
brains that are behind the company and the
natural resources that we have in this country,
it is a perfectly saf e investment.
Ag to the amalgamation of lines I do flot
know what Vo say. My honourable friend fromn
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) touched on that
matter the other day. On more than one
occasion it has been poînted out to me that
such a course would ha the proper one to
pursue. As to that I am not sure. I should
not like to say that I am in favou-r of such
"proposai at the present time. To my mind
a Government monopoly is not much better
than any other kind of monopoly. The rates
of a railway, whether privately or publicly
owned, can be controlled by a commission;
but without competition the accommodation.
that you are going Vo get cannot ha controlled.
Before there was keen competition betweent
our railways there used to be many complaints about the service. If my honourabefriand from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans),.
for exampla, wanted a car on Tuesday for the
shipment of wheat, hie might flot get it tiii
Thursday. 0f recent years, with competition,
a car is at the shippar's door almost before heasks for it. Rapresentativas of both companies attend evary meeting of farmers or shiprpers to inform, thamn of the banafits of using
a particular lina.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: 1l should like Vo
aek the right honourable gentleman a question. Did hie attend, or did hie read the report of, the committea of tha Senate that
secured tha evidance of United Statas experts as to what should ha doue with the
Canadian Pacifie Railway and the Canadian
National Railways? IV is my opinion that if
the recommendations of that committee had
been followed this country would have saved
many millions of dollars. The committae,
which met about five years ago, took evidence
be-hind closed doors, because the witnesseswould not give evidence if it wus going Vo be
published. I just eall the right honourable
gentleman's attention to that report in case he
has forgotten about it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHIAM: I am sorry
to, say that I had not the honour of being
a member of the Senate at that time, and did
not get behind the closed doors. One can
gain a great deal of information at a meetingý
of that kind that cannot be obtained from',
the printed report. The suggestion at that
time was, if I remember, that the two, lines
should retain their entities, but that they
should ha operated under one management.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Was the right honourable gentleman flot a witness before that committee?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Unfortunately
the Senate committee did nlot recognize my
abilities along that line.
1 thought the right
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
honourable gentleman was a witness.
No. If I
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
had been, 1 would have remained long enough
to get seime information.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:

They missed something.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not se much
as one rnight imagine. What was proposed
at that time might work out, but some of
the conditions in connection with the arrangement, as reported in the newspaipers,
were to my mind impracticable. But honourable gentlemen know botter than I do what
the report contained. The time may come
for further conversations in regard to what
can best be done.
If I am net ibeing too wearisemne, I want
to refer briefly to automobiles and trucks.
The nuinicipalitics are getting the worsc end
,of the deal with the truck business. In Ontario-and I suppose the same condition
-obtains in every other province-the main
:street of most towvns is the truck highway, but
the provine' does not contribute one cent tawards the upkeep of it. In Brockville, for
instance, the main street is about a mile and
a haîf long and is very expensivo to maintain.
Trucks, sometimes with one or two trailers-small trains--are travelling. over it throughout the night at a speed of* froým thirty te
fifty miles an heur, regardlcss of the legal
rate, and do more damnage te the highway in
one night than our local traffie would do in
years. I think the time bas come when the
provinces, which colleet taxes from gasoline
saýles, automobile and truck licences, and s0
on, should make some contribution towards
defraying the cost of keeping up the highways
within the borders of the municipalities. I
do net know what will happen in the future.
It bas been suggested that public conveyances
su.ch as trucks and buses should be placed
under some restriction or control as te rates
of speed and matters of that kind. Railways are under restrictions and can be cernmanded to, comply with them; but no one
can interfere with trucks and buses unless
they violate the law, and many of them break
the speed laws at night without being detected.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Restrictions are made
by the municipalities.
Right Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But most of
the municipalities are asleep at that time of
the night.
Another suggestion bas been made by a
gentleman who bas studied tbe question, that
trucks and buses should net only be placedc
under control, but should provide their ewn
highways. I think that is impracticable, and
I tbink that the people are being se accemmodated by these conveyances that they
would hesitate te approve of such a suggestion. But something must be donc te equalize the taxation ameng- municipalities, railway companies, and truck or bus companies
I
and other competitors of the railways.
do net want te take up more tîmeHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Go on.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do net wvant
te take up more time, but 1 am rather enjoying the discussion, although I cannot give
niueh information. I look upon this whole
matter with considerable serieuisness; net that
I have mucb doubt of tbe ultimate success
of the transportation companies.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Has the right honourmble
gentleman any comment te make upon the
Merchant Marine and the loss of $80,O00,000
that it entailed?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I had forgotten it, but I shall gladly oblige my honourahlP friend. The acquisition of the Canadian Merchant Marine was a war-time development, although, I imagine, most of the
vessels were built after the war. At that
time-and I want te put f erward tbe best
side for the predecessors of the Liberal Gevernment-there was a shortage of tonnage ail
over the worlýd, owing te the war losses, and
the Canadian Government undertook te build
some fifty ships, if I remember rightly, or
perhaps a few more. In doing se it was
trying te meet the demands raised by our ewn
people for more tonnage. 0Ofcourse, war-time
prices prevailed and the ships were constructed at considerably higher cest than
they otherwise would 'have been. As I remember it, there was con.siderablo werk for
the Merchant Marine te do for a tîme after
the war ceased, and they were assignod te
varieus routes. These vessels neyer have
paid and they are of a type that nover will
pay, under our prosont transportation conditions. W'hen I investigateýd the matter soe
years age I found that their style of construcition prevents their being used satisfactorily for the carrying of grain and ether
products from the Wesýt, or in the lake trade
generally, although some of themn were ongaged in this work. The Gevernment tried te

IULY 29, 1931
utilize this fleet of vessels, or most of them,
in extending the trade of Canada with other
countries. Some of them were put on the
West Indies service, and a few were sent on
more distant routes, to Australia and ail over
the wcrld; others were used for the carrying of wheat. Alt'hough there has been a
ieavy loss, iargeiy owing to the conditions
prevailing when the ships were constructed,
'and to the method of construction, etili the
Merchant Marine has made Canada known in
a great many ports of the world where perhaps otherwise it neyer would have been heard
of. My own view is that the sooner what
is known as the Merchant Marine can be
weeded out and sold-I arn not referring
now to vessels that ply between Canada and
the West Indies-the better it will be for ail
croncerned. I would go even further and say
that the ships should be weeded out even if
lhey could not be sold, so that we might get
rid of the deficit, because 1 see no future for
them. In order to make the Merchant Marine
pay we should have to get modern vessels,
as we found it necessary to do on the West
Indies route before we could comply with
the conditions of the treaty with those islands.
I apologize to the House for talking at such
length. In concluding I want to point out
what the Canadian National bas accomplished
by way of improvement in conditions up to
1930. The figures I shall quote do not take
into consideration the Eastern limes, what
we know as the Intercolonial Railway, because they were not taken over until after
the Duncan Report, if I arn not mistaken.
In 1922 the annual net receipts by the railways that are now known as the Canadian
National were $1,174,475.94.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Did that include the
American Unes?
Rîght Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That includes
tSie net income £rom ail the lines.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Except the Eastern
lines?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Except the
Eastern limes. I wiil nlot go back and refer
to them now, although I had intended to.
lon. Mr. BELCOURT: Are those receipts
froin ail traffic?
Right Hon. Mr. GR.AHAM: Freight and
passenger traffic; ail kinda of traffc. A railway can make up so many sets of figures that
it would take hours to go tihrough thern, but
it is possible to get them boiled down to a
point where they may be grasped by a layman. In 1923 the net income had increased
to $12,M4,847.85. The figures are:

The year 1928 was a banner year, 1929 was

Iput these figures on record to emphasize
my point, that, considering the previous
failures handed over to the Canadian National System to be consolidated, I think the
record of management of that consolidation
ought to be satisfactory to the people of Canada.
Hon. Mm. MeMEANS:
Can the right
honourable gentleman tell us how much extra
capital investment was involved in the production of the results that he has referred
to?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Very many
millions.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
It is an easy
matter, after the spending of four hundred or
five hundred millions, to get something out
of it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 0f course,
I did nlot buy these consolidated failures.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Why was it that the
receipts dropped from forty-nine millions in
1928 to'twenty-one millions?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They dropped
from forty-nine millions to th-irty-seven millions in 1929. The reason is that the railway
has been affected by bard times, in common
with every other industry. I imagine that
the smaller shipments of wheat froin the
West were responsible for a decrease in
traffic.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Exactl.y. When the
right honouraible gentleman was Minister of
Railways it was contended in another place
that wheat was carried at a big loss te tihe
mailways; that the faiimems of the West were,
in effect, ge'tting a bonus.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I should like
someone to get Hansard and show me when
1 said that.
Hon. Mm. MeMEANS: That waa a com-mon
stateznent.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have heard
it said. But the railways ca.nnot niake money
if their cars carry a load only one way and
return empty. If there were no eastbound

SENATE
traffiEc it would be necessary to charge a
higher rate than anyone would want to pay
for freight going to the West.
I believe in the strictest economy by the
Dominion Government as welil as by everybody else. I am not strongly in favour of
requests from the provinces for us to di,g into
the federal treasury whenever they want some
assistance. The Dominion Government carries
a very heavy burden resulting from the war.
Business men are being highly taxed. Ontario
has begun to tax them this year as it never
did before. I believe in the future of Canada
under economic and safe management. If
we let the executives cf these two railways
work together harmoniously and serve the
people of Canada at the lowest possible rates,
it will not be long before the depression
comes to an end a.nd the incomes of the
railway companies are revived. There is no
fear in my mind that railway securities in
the Dominion of Canada will not be paid
in full.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: The right honourable gentleman lhas made a very interesting speech on railway operations. I do not
intend to invade that field, but I should like
to say a few words on the Bill before us.
Its purpose is to provide moneys whereby the
expenses, obligations and deficits of the Canadian National Railways may be met. I agree
entirely with my right honourable friend that
our two great railways are being efficiently
managed, particularly since the extravagant
capital expenditures on one of them have
been curtailed. Both have been going through
severe times, and the reasons are not far te
seek. In 1928, one Of the years mentioned
by my right honourable friend, Western
Canada produced more than 500,000,000
bushels of wheat, which sold at $1.25 a bushel
or higher. In the present year there will be
less than 200,000,000 bushels produced in the
same area, and the price, roughly, is 60 cents.
So it is not difficult for any person, whether
a railway expert or a layman, to understand
why the railway companies are experiencing
a depression.
The conditions which have brought about
the tremendous reduction in the purchasing
power of the people in Western Canada are
the result, not of anything done by the railway management, or by members of Parliament or any other person, but of an act or
Railways arc
dispensation of Providence.
unable to earn revenues as large as they could
in 1928, 1929, and some previous years. Only
744,000 cars of freiglit had been loaded on all
the railways in Canada during the first six
months of this year, as compared with
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

1,143,000 cars in the corresponding period of
1929. The figure for the similar period in
1930 was between those two. The railways
are suffering because of decrease in traffic, for
which neither the Government nor the companies are responsible.
More than 20,000 railway employees have lost
in my humble opinion
their employment.
there is a limit to which economy can be
carried with safety in railway operations. I
am not at all sure that maintenance work
is being kept up on the railroads to the point
that safety requirements would dictate.
It is of course desirable that in all walks
of life, during such a period as we are passing
Lhrough, an endeavour should be made to
reduce expenditures in accordance with the
reduction in earnings, and this is more necessary now than in the heyday of prosperity.
My right honourable friend has given us an
excellent report on the management of Our
railways. That other great railway system,
which has been as hard hit as the National
System and which has to pay its own way,
has been forced to reduce its dividend payments largely because it is the heaviest taxpayer in Canada and is helping to pay the
deficits on the lines of its competitor, the
payment of which deficits is guaranteed by
Bills like the present one. It is important to
Parliament and to the country that every
care should be exercised to sec that economy
is practised sanely, but net so extremely as
to render dangerous the operation of the railways and thus adversely affect the public
interest.
May I say a word with reference to railway rates? In Canada these are to-day
approximately twelve to twelve and a half
per cent lower than in the United States.
Notwithstanding that difference, American lines
are asking for an increase in their rates. The
railways in the United States have an advantage over Canadian lines also in density of
population: we have about 220 persons to the
railway mile, whereas they have 486, or more
than double the number. Our railways have
to contend not only with lower freight rates,
but with more difficult climatic conditions
than generally prevail in the land to the
south.
I am not sure that it is wise for this
House to discuss freight rates in detail,
because there is a tribunal charged with the
responsibility of regulating those rates, which
has been established for many years and enjoys the confidence of the people of this
country. It is not my purpose to criticize
anything that has been done in the past, but
I would point out that we may well reach a
point where the existing scale of freight rates

JULY 29, 1931
will not be sufficient to maintain rea.sonable
speed and a rea.sonable standard of efficiency
on these great transportation systems. So the
question of freight rates is a very important
one and should receive the careful thought
of every public man.
I want ta add my tribute of admiration
and congratulation to our great railway coinpanies, which during the present period of
depression have tried, to aid in the general
attempt ta provide employment and relieve
distress. Bath of those great railways came
forward a year ago and after a short discussion
voluntarily offéred to do what they could ta
create employment oppoi-tunibzies; and although they have had to reduce flheir own
staffs by over 20,000 men within the past
eighteen months, because of necessities which.
my right honuurable friend bas pointed out,
they have been able ta absorb a very substantial number of those men in employment
of various kinds, though at less remunerative
rates than their regular employ'ment afforded.
The expenditure of a score of millions of
dollars by the twa railway systems within the
past twelve months, on work whîch is proceeding towards completion this year, has
greatly aided in mitigating unernployment. I
doubt that the aid those railways have given
ta the L)eople of Canada in relieving distress
and need has been fully appreciated.
There is need at the present moment, and
there will be continued need, for further effort
ta assist in solving the great problem naw
confronting us, which is being discussed in
another place, perhaps this afternoon. The
purpase of the present Bill is simply ta bring
relief ta the Canadian National Railways by
enabling them ta meet their obligations, and
the deficits on their operations during the
present period of depression. 1 arn confident
that rny right honourable friend was correct
when hie expressed his faith in the future and
pointed out that although Canada has had
several periods of depression that have affected
the transportation systems as well as general
business, there has always followed a revival.
This year in Western Canada there is a
terrible situation, awing ta crop failure over
a large area, and in a very substantial area
this is the third year of such experience.
Neyer in the history of Canada have there
been more than three successive crop failures
in any given area, or over any large area, and
we may with confidence assume that we have
reached the bottom of the depression and
that future years wilýl hold better things in
store for general business, for individuals, and
for the transportation systems, which are sc
vital ta the requirements of the Canadiar
people.

b)

While I gladly j oin in the expression of my
right honourable friend that we can look
with confidence to the future stability of our
transportation system, I would add, without
naming any particular Government, that I
think Governments and Parliament have
gone rather far in continuing to purchase
bankrupt scrapped railroads and add them
to the Canadian National System. A number
of such purchases have been made within
very recent years, and it is my humble opinion,
fromn the littie knowledge 'I have of railway
matters, parti-cularly froin observation, that
those roads cannot be made profitable for a
very long time, if they can ever be. I trust
that this Parliament will exercise greater care
and greater economy in both the building and
the purehasing of railroads until we have
business enough to pay for the reasonable
operation of the roads now existing.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend permit me to ask him a question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Surely.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: With reference to
the amounts mentioned in this Bill-in section
2, paragraph (a) $31,387,M82,56, in paragraph
(b) $9,299,613A44, and in paragraph (c) S27,832,504, totalling $68,500,000-I would ask
whether those different amounts to which
expenditures were made or indebtedness incurred during 1931 were the subject of inquiry by the committee of the other House
which sat for a great part of this session and
inquired into the aiffairs of the Canadian
National Railways.
My recollecHon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
tion of what occurred at the session held a
year ago is that the committee did go
exhaustively into the commitmnents of the?
railways at that tîme, and they substantially
curtailed some of the expenditures, b'ut not
to the extent that conditions in the country
have since made desirable in my judgment,
which. is based on present knowledge, particularly as regards the cammitments that
had been made the year 'before in connection
wit'h the purchase of a considerable mileage
of railway line which has ever since been,
and for a long time will continue ta be, unprofitable.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The fact that in
another place this matter was enquired into,
and full information given, relieves this
*House to a great extent of the necessity of
*inquiring into these different amounts and
*how they are made up.
L Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I can state ta
my honourable friend that I am sure it was.

And the recom-

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And the recommendations also.
Hon.
R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I desire to say a few words on
this report of 1925. The Senate was unanimous in adopting the report of the special
committee appointed to investigate the railway situation in Canada. The report was
based on the general statement made to the
committee by railway people, mainly Canadians, and by bankers as well.
I refer
especially to the experts who were then
administering the two railways and to men
who had administered them before. Those
men were probably in the best position to
give advice. The general opinion was that
there was not enough freight in the country,
especially in the West, to justify the maintenance of the two establishments as they
existed. Figures were given, and comparisons
were made with railways running in the
American West, as to density of population,
volume of freight in relation to the sparseness of our population, etc. From the facts
brought before us it seemed to me a hopeless
situation. The result of the inquiry and report
was that this Chamber adopted the idea of
having the two systems brought under one
management, though retaining their separate
entities. The plan was to allow the Canadian Pacifie to guarantee the dividend it was
earning; to revalue the Canadian National
on the basis of mileage as compared with the
C.P.R.; and to have one and the same management, provided partly by the C.P.R., privately
owned, and partly by the Canadian Government, and thus to remove costly competition
between two rival systeis covering the same
field. Competition had been giving to some
centres four times the accommodation actually
needed. I believe the Senate's proposal was
a very constructive one.
After having accepted the facts and opinions
submitted by those experts, what did we find
within the next twenty-four months?
We
found that their statements had been contraHon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

dicted by the reality; that in those twentyfour months, although competition was maintained and capital expenditure increased, the
Canadian National was making wonderful
progress. As has been stated by my right
honourable friend, the railway which in 1925
vas a debit that would not have been taken
over by any syndicate-Canadian, American
or British-unlcs we agreed to throw into
the bargain, as a bonus, $25,000,000 or
550,000.000 a year for five or ten years, had in
twenty-four months become an asset which,
if the annual net income of $40,000.000 was
reckoned as five per cent, was worth $800,000,000; and it went on improving from year to
year.
To-day we are facing a very difficult situation, and new conditions have arisen, which
must be taken into consideration. The truck
business and the motor car traffic are new
developments, which have cut into the income of the railways. But I am not despondent. I hope that our Western Provinces will
again yield good crops and that prosperity
will return to our railways. However, if it
be true that a commission is to be appointed
to investigate our transportation system, I
feel it my duty to draw the attention of the
future commissioners to the unanimous report of the Senate of Canada in 1925 on this
railway question, and to suggest that they
should study it carefully.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

%xplanatory note in the Bill, which shows the
imount of money already invested. The Bill
i)rovides for a further loan of $700,000. Unloubtedly my honourable friend knows the
locus very much better than I do. It has
been the experience of this House for a very
long time that harbour commissions corne hack
fromn time to time for fresh advances for further harbour developments. The Quebec Harbour Commission has done so on several occasions during the time that I have been in
this House, the Montreal Harbour Commission has done likewise, and at the present time
there is an application from Saint John. There
has been very little reluctance on the part of
the Dominion Government at any time to advance credit for the equipment of harbours.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: ls it anticipated that the sumn mentioned in the Bill will
complete the work?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I understand 80.
My honourable friend to my right (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) suggests that these expenditures
were ahl authorized before the present Government came into power, and therefore have
been approved.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I can understand the haste to approve of themn again.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Maritime revenues, like those of the railways, have fallen
away this year. Three Rivers is a busy littie
city with a reasonabhy prosperous future; and
while I do not know much about the harbour,
I might point out that the amount asked is
comparatively small.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can my honourable friend tell us to what extent the Three
Rivers harbour is meeting it-q obligations?

SUs

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am sorry to
say that I have no statement as to whether it
is paying its way or not. I hope it is doing
better than a certain harbour a little farther
down the river.
Hon. JACQUES BUREAU:
Honourable
members, if the honourable leader will allow
me, I should hke to say that to date the
Harbour Commission of Three Rivers has, I
believe, 'been meeting its -obligations. In 1927
a sum was appropriated by the Public Works
Department for the improvement of the docks
occupied by the Dominion Coal Company
under lease from the Three Rivers Harbour
Commission. In 1929 a law was passed authorizing a $2,000,000 loan by the Government to
that Commission. After the passing of this law
it was agreed between the Dufresne Construction Company-who had the $200.000 contract
from the Department of Public Works-and
the present contractors, with the approval of
the Department of Public Works, that the
contract should be transferred to the present contractors, and the amount of $200,000
paid out of the loan of $2,000,000. Consequently the contract was transferred, and
liability for the $200,000 was assumed by the
Three Rivers Harbour Commission.
The docks at Three Rivers, where the
Dominion Coal Company stores very large
quantities of Nova Scotia coal in order to
supply the requirements of the paper mills at
Grand'Mere, Shawinigan Falls and Thrse
Rivers, were badly in need of repairs.
At the time of the letting of the contract the work that was proposed involved
an expenditure of more than the $2,000,000
authorized by the Act, and there was a tacit
understanding between the Harbour Commissioners and the Dominion Government that
there would be an additional grant to cover
the difference between the amount authorized
and the amount necessary to complete the
work. The Commissioners stipulated in the
contract that unless the grant was made they
would stop the work when the moneys
available were exhausted, and the contractons waived any claim for damages against
the Harbour Commission on that ground,
should the Government fail to grant the
money. Under the supervision of Mr. Swan,
an expert in harbour works and, I believe, the
ian who laid out Vancouver harbour, the
plan for Three Rivers was prepared. I am informed-I cannot state it positively-that
some changes have lately been made in the
plan.
Though there may have been a slight
falling off in navigation this year by reason
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

of the fact that some of the paper mills are
operating only part time, and 'others not at
all, there has been otherwise a steady increase
at Three Rivers, and the improvements that
are 'being made to the harbour there are
necessary in order that proper accommodation
may be provided.
So far as I know, the members of the former
Board have complied with all the provisions
of the law regarding the sinking fund, and
every obligation has been met by them. As the
work progresses the Harbour Commissioners
issue debentures and deposit with the Finance
Department an amount equal to the amount
paid to the contractors. This sum of $700,000
is required to finish a work which is essential
to the welfare of the St. Maurice Valley
region, and, I 'think, of benefit to the country
generally.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Not having
stopped at the port of Three Rivers for some
years, I was delighted, when passing there this
week, to see the modern works that have been
installed. There has been a transformation in
the harbour. I have no doubt that Three
Rivers is developing rapidly, and in view of
the industries tributary to it, I think this
expenditure on the harbour will be money
well spent.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should like to
confirm what mv leader has said. I know
the locality very well. I spent many of my
younger years in Three Rivers, and have
frequently had occasion to go back. Every
time I have done so, particularly during the
past ten years, I have marvelled at the tremendous industrial development that has
taken place. As $2,000,000 has alrcady been
spent there, I think the additional expenditure of $700,000 is well warranted.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have no knowledge of any change in the plans, but I do
know that the work under the $2,000,000
vote bas been progressing very well. The
work bas become necessary largely owing to
the rapid development of the whole St.
Maurice Valley country. I know that last
fall the vote of the Harbour Commissioners
at Three Rivers was almost exhausted, and
that if the works are to be completed Parliament must provide further funds. Although
the expenditure exceeded the vote of 1929,
no further vote could be passed until this
session. In my opinion the expenditure of
$700,000 is entirely defensible.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAýM: I understand
from certain British Columibia mednmbers that

error in defining the boundaries of the harbour.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Týhe harbour
limits are very specifically set out in the enacting section of the Bibi-a rather unusual

Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAIM: It looks as
thougli they were taking in something that
had not belonged to the harbour before. The
Bihl says:
To include ahi the foreshore and water lots,
wharves, piers, and docks, in or along the

Is His Majesty, through us, giving some of

possible. It is only a usu'fruct aftdr all.
Hon. Mr. KING: For some time there lias

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wouid the hionoura'ble gentleman expiain?
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Before the motion is
carried, I should like to say a word or two
in regard to this Bill. The purpose of the
Bibi is to give the farmers of the West five
cents on eveTy bushel of wheat sold for cx-

509

port. In the section of the country from
which. I corne, extending south from Saskatoon to the boundary, and spreading east and
west for some distance, this will not be
applicable, because we have no wheat. 1 suggested to some members ini another place
that it would have been better to grant a
smnali amount per acre to those who had cultivated the land and were unable to get any
return. That proposai, which was iooked upon
with sorne favour at first, wouid of course
have been better for the districts that are
desolated.
I may say that in the district to which 1
have referred there have been iight crops,
because of dry weather and so on, but tis
is the first complete crop failure in forty-nine
years. In the iast two years at ieast the
crop that was harvested gave the farmers
comparatively small returns. Indeed, in most
cases the receipts were not sufficient to pay
the cost of -production. Because of that fact
a great many people in the West are hard
pressed and wili have considerabie difflcuity
in maintaining themselves this winter. It is
fortunate that the Goverument of the day is
making provisions so that no one need
starve. The average farmer flnds it hard to
accept anything in the way of ckarity, and I
think it might be weil for the Government to
consider the advisabiiity of making loans to
those who have sufficient property to give
the necessary security. Much good couid be
donc in this way if the rate of interest were
iow. But many farmers have no property that
wouid be suitaýbie as eecurity. While the
payment of five cents a bushel wiil heip those
who have wheat, it of course will flot be of
any benefit to a great many people in the
area to whîch I have referred. who will flot
have any crop this year. However, the Government lias determined that no one shahl be
in want, and I feel satisfled that a scheme
will be devised to give assistance to ail who
need it.
Honourabie
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
senators, loans such as were suggested by niy
honourable friend would be a great boon,
because many farmers would undoubtedly receive from them more than they wili from.
the payment of five cents a bushel on wheat.
I know very intimateiy the district referred
to by the honourable gentleman, but before
dealing with the conditions there I wiii speak
briefly on the question of loans. Last year
the boan agents received, a large number of
applications. I happen to know two who had
a fairly large businessHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Representatives
of the Provincial Government?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
No; I am
speaking not of them, but of agents of the
ordinary loan and insurance companies. They
procured many applications and the necessary
inspections were made. The loans were not
granted at the time, no matter how adequate
the security was, and so far as I can learn
from recent letters the greater part of them
have not been made yet. I have personal
knowledge of many instances where the land,
if worth only 50 per cent of the value it had
before the slump, would have furnished adequate security for a loan, and yet the owners
were unable to borrow, under the existing
conditions, from the loan and insurance compames, even at 8 per cent, which is a special
rate.
Money can make its own terms, I
suppose, just as water will find its own level,
but 8 per cent is more than the farmers can
pay to-day. It was in most cases more than
could be paid before the last crop failure and
the slump in the price of agricultural produets. As all honourable members know, the
Government of Saskatchewan conducts a
Loan Board. which has lent a very large sum
of money. If it granted all the applications
on hand, the sum would be considerably
larger, but I learnt on a visit home during
the current session that it has virtually no
funds to let out, and is making very few
advances. The Dominion Farm Loan scheme
does not apply there, because of the existence
of the local board.
A large section of the country referred to
by the honourable gentleman from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis) contains some of the
very choicest land. Honourable members who
are familiar with the Regina plains, or who
have been on the 'Soo line from Moose Jaw
to Portal, know that that territory is regarded
as one of the finest agricultural districts in
the world. There is not the same variety of
ýlandscape as is found in Ontario, for example,
but as a prairie country it compares very
favourably with anything to be found in the
States or elsewhere. A great many farmers
in that district not only have no whea.t for
sale, but will not have any for next year's
seed. I recently received a personal letter
from a gentleman who has visited a large
number of farms, all of which I happen to
know, and he tells me there is absolutely no
wheat on them. Even if there were some it
would not pay the farmers to harvest it. Of
course, they are doing all they can to maintain
themselves by other means. Those who have
some live stock, particularly cows, are fortunate, if there happens to be an adequate
water supply-which is not too common in
the district I have in mind-for they will be
able to keep the pot boiling by the sale of
Hon.

Ir.

milk or cream. They will need for their own
use the coarse crops, such as oats, barley and
perhaps sweet clover and rye, all of which
are in very limited quantities.
When I was home last I travelled from
Moose Jaw to Regina, some forty-two miles,
and about the same distance south, and I saw
scarcely a blade of green grain. It looked
like a veritable Desert of Sahara. The conditions are almost incredible, even to those
of us who have lived many years in the West.
While it is truc that last year was a lean year
and 1929 was only medium, the farmers were
then in far better circumstances than they
are now. A great sum of money will be necessary for relief; a fact that I dare say will continue to be impressed upon the honourable
gentleman to my right (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
It is a fortunate thing that many of the farmers have life insurance policies, against which
they will be able to borrow.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A great many
of them are borrowing on their policies.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: They are fortunate in having life insurance, which as a
rule is not so commonly carried in the rural
districts as in the cities. To all intents and
purposes, the banks are not lending. I am not
finding fault with them, for it is their business
to act conservatively and look after the interests of their shareholders and depositors.
Farmers are finding it very difficult to borrow
even trifling sums to enable them to keep on
living from hand to mouth. People of the
better elements in the West are not quarrelbing with the banks. Of course, we have out
there some people who belong to the Red element, who are opposed to the ownership of
property by any man, government or institution, and who hold dogmas that are very much
in favour in another country. I am not speaking on behalf of those people, but of the
staid farmers. They are solid citizens. They
may grumble at conditions, but as a rule they
are good pay.
Conditions in the West this year are more
serious than the people of the East realize.
From a short distance south of Saskatoon
right down to the American boundary, and
somewhat east of Regina up to Maple Creek,
well on to the boundary of Alberta, there is
virtually no crop nor anything out of which
the farmers can hope to make a livelihood.
Many of those who own stock will not bavr
enough hay for the coming winter. I know
a little about agriculture, for unfortunately
I am interested in it to a fairly large extent.
Last year I had to bring in oats for a couple
of my farms, eight or ten carloads in each
instance, because I had no hay.

JULY 29, 1931
The East lias a big heart and I arn sure ît
wilI respond liberally to the great need among
thrifty -and industrious classes in the West. I
believe Parliament will be generously minded
also. In the past we have neyer made a
cail that lias nlot met with a hearty response.
On behaif of those who will be administering
relief in the West, I asic honourable members
to try to realize the true situation and nlot to
imagine that Western farmers want to sponge
on the people of the East, simply because aid
will be asked for on a larger scale than prier
to the last couple of months we had conceived would be necessary. I douht whether
people of any other class have quite so mucli
pride in money matters as farmers have; not
because they are ricli, but because they
possess a certain spirit of independence. They
are more reluctant than perhaps any other
people to go into debt or to asic for Government assistance. I 'hope that honourable
members who have an influential voice in the
money markets and in big business of the
East will give the most sympathetic consideration to appeals that will be made during
the current session for assistance to the West.
Hon. R. FORKE: Honourable senators, I
do not wish to repeat the arguments that
have been so ably presented by the honourable leader of the Government, but there are
a few observations I desire to make. Agricultural problems that seem to be almnost unsolvable are arising to-day, not only in Canada but throughout the world. Not only in
the West, but everywhere, agriculture is sick
and farmers are finding it difficuit to make
ends meet.
The honourable senator from Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) struck the ntail on thc
head when lie stated that the grant of five
cents a bushel, as proposed in this Bill, would
help the man who had wheat, but nlot those
who had none. Yet I arn not inclined to find
fault with the Bill.
Reference was made by the Hon. the
àdinister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
to the decline in the price of wheat. I do
not like to speak of my own experience, but
by doing so I can be more sure of my facts.
I do not mind telling honourable members
that I arn just 35,000 poorer because I have
been farming in the last three years. A great
anany other farmers have had a similar experience. I do net owe one -cent on my faim,
I pay no interest, and I have a good property.
Without desiring to be egotistical, I would
say that I have often been referre-d to as one
of the most successful farmers in the West.
Yet I have lost money. Now, what can bd
done in a situatibn of that kind? Some peo-

511

ple say we should go into mixed farming. As
I stated a little while ago in this House, 1
have 100 head *of cattle, 200 sheep and 22
horses, and it is a serious problem for me to
know what to do with them this winter. My
farm is in the extreme western part of
Manitoba, just bordering on Saskatchewan.
I think I should lie just as happy if I had no
wheat crop at ahl ths year, because then I
should not have to go to the trouble of biarvesting and threshing it. In the long run I
shahl not be in pocket because I have a little
wheat. 1 arn fortunate in having enougli
old wheat and oats left over from last yeaî
for rny next year's seed, but I do not know
any other farmer in my district who is in
exactly the sarne position. I mention these
facets to show the conditions that the farmers
are experiencing at the present tîme.
I feel perfecthy sure that farmers in Ontario
do not reahize the seriousness of the Western
situation. While listening to a debate ini
another place 1 heard a member stronghy
-objecting to this Bill on the ground that
the legisiation wouhd be sectional. He contended that farmers in Ontario weîe faced with
considerable difficulties at the present time.
Like many honourable members, I have driven.
over a good part of Ontario this sum.mer, and
I neyer saw better crops anywheîe. Some
of the people may have difflculty in making
ends meet, but there is no comparison between
the conditions in this province and those in
Western Canada.
The Hon. the Minister of Labour said that
the present price of wheat wss 60 cents. It
wouhd not be so bad if the farmer got that
mucli, but the fact is that the average price
received by the farmer is 37 cents a bus5hel.
There bas been a drouglit from the time we
were getting about 11.40 olear down to the
present time, when we get only 37 cents. Is
there any other industry in the woîld that
could stand sucli a blow as that and would
not be in a desperate condition? Sucli is the
condition that we are in at the present time
in Western Canada.
I ar n ft going to take up any more time.
I think the Hon. the Minister of Labour is
fully seized of the situation. I think the Government, as a whole, is also seized of the
situation; and I want to pay my tribute to
the Government of the Dominion at the
present time for the way in which it lias met
this situation and is trying to relieve it as
mucli as possible. I amn sure it wihl have my
hearty support in aIl the endeavours it is
înaking.
I notice a. clause in the Bill that I would
like the Minister to explain. In section 2,

512

SENATE

paragraph (b), in regard to the regulations
that are to be made, I read:
(b) determining the person to whom the said
suin of fixe cents per bushel shall be paid and
the method of the payiment thereof;
I should like to have that explained. Who
is going to get the five cents? How is it going to be paid? What is the method to be
adopted? When that Bill was introduced the
sum of five cents was to be paid only on
export wheat, and it seemed at that time
probable that the only parties who would
benefit would be the transportation companies
and the dealers. Perhaps the regulations will
be made in such a way that the money will
go direct to the farmer who sells the wheat
to be exported.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: According to my
information and belief, this Bill is not at all
confined to export wheat. On every bushel
of wheat that is grown this year and marketed
within those three provinces the farmer will
receive the benefit of the bonus-if it may
be termed such-when he delivers his wheat;
and the five cents will be paid in the form
of certificates redeemable for the amount. I
do not understand that the bonus is to be
paid on wheat that the farmer may have in
stock, grown last year.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: So I believe that
on this year's crop. whether it is exported
or not, it is the intention to pay the bonus.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
delivered?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

But it must be
Yes.

Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable gentlemen, I should like it understood that any
remarks I have to make are not in opposition
to this Bill. It is only under very exceptional
circumstances that such legislation could be
justified. It is sectional legislation, inasmuch
as it applies only to the three Prairie Provinces. I regret, as I think al the members of
the Senate regret, that such exceptional conditions exist at present; and in my opinion
they justify the Government in presenting
this legislation.
My reason for speaking at all is this. There
is apparently, both in Parliament and throughout the country, a feeling that in the growing
of wheat, so far as Canada is concerned, the
three Prairie Provinces have a monopoly, or
that they are the only part of Canada that
produces wheat in any large quantity. It has
been my privilege to drive over a great portion of Western Ontario during the past month
or so, and I have been struck with the very
Hon. Mr. FORKE.

large acreage that is growing wheat at the
present time. The crops are very good.
You might ask, "Why is it that our statistics
do not show such a large production of wheat
in Ontario?'
One reason is that the average
farmer in Western Ontario does not place his
wheat on the market, particularly when it is
at such prices as now prevail, because it is
more profitable to feed it to live stock,
especially hogs, while the prices of hog products are as high as they are at present.
Though we hear very little about Ontariogrown wheat, I may assure the members of
this House that the growing of wheat is a
very large industry in Western Ontario, and,
generally speaking, it has been very profitable.
While we are discussing the interests of
farmers in the West, I think I may repeat
what I have said in this House before-that
with the present land values in Ontario there
are much better opportunities for growing
wheat on a commerical basis in this province
than there are in any part of the West. Land
values to-day in Ontario are only about fifty
per cent what they were tea years ago, and
there are plenty of opportunities for growing
wheat, or any other crop for that matter, on
a very large commercial scale.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
May I ask
the honourable gentleman a question?
I
find in section 1 these words:
1. The Governor in Council may authorize
the payment, out of the Consolidated Revenue
Fund, of the sum of five cents for every bushel
of wheat gro'wn in the provinces of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba in the year 1931,
and delivered to any licersed elevator in the
Western Inspection Division, commission merchant, track buyer or grain dealer, as defined
by the Canada Grain Act.
When this Bill was first brought down my
attention was called to the weakness of this
section, for according to my information there
is no distinct definition of those different
persons in the Canada Grain Act.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I think the
term " track buyer " is defined, is it not?
Right lion. Mr. GRAHAM: I am asking
for information. It is a matter for lawyers,
of course, but nothing should be taken for
granted, because some litigation might arise
If we had a clear definition of those different
individuals it might prevent trouble.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I cannot refer
you to the Act, but my recollection is that
a track buyer gets a licence from the Department. I think the term " grain dealer" is
self-explanatory, is it not, and also the term
"commission merchant"? I do not think those
are technical words. The only word that
strikes me as technical is " track buyer ".

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Hon. Mr. Willoughby, seconded by Hon. Mr.

SAINT JOÏHN HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND

R.EADING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the second
reading of Bili 134, an Act to provide for a
further loan to the Saint John Harbour Commissioners.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: H1onourable members, even et the risk of incurring the displeasure of honourable members for taking
up the time of the House et this late date,
when thoy are eager to geV away, I take this
opportunity to place upon Heansaxd some of
the edvantages which the port of Saint John
2211"-31

615

offers to the shippers of Canada. At the same
timo I desire to place upon record what in
my opinion is ample justification for the
appropriation of somo 310,000,000 under this
iljl.
Before dealing with the subI ect-matter of
my remarks, I wish, on behaîf of the people
of the city of Saint John and the surrounding
territcry, which I -have the honour to represent in this House, to express appreciation
of the many kind messages and expressions
of regret recoived fromn ail parts of Canada
following the disastrous fire that visitod the
city of ýSaint John and swept away a large
portion of the harbour front, on the western
side of the harbour, the construction of which
entailed the oxpendituro of much money and
the sacrifice of much time.
This Bill, honourablo miembers, provides
moneys for the reconstruction of et least a
portion of the herbour front. I understand
that it is the intention of the Commission to
uise $5,000,000 of the amount for the reconstruction of a portion of the burnt-over area,
and to expend $5,000,000 towerds the coinple'tion of a progrem laid out at the time
of the formation of the first Herbour Commission, of which I had the honour of being
the chairman. I trust thet the shippers of
Canada will take note of the decîsion of the
harbour authorities to have the reconstructed
area ready for business, and capable of accommodating that portion of Canada's trade
which naturally would go through the port
of Saint John, by the time the waters of the
St. Lawrence are frozen over and its harbours
lose their usefulness for some five months.
1 congratulate the Governmont upon the
introduction of this measure and the prompt
manaci' in which it hias deait with what I
regard as a mnatter of national importance.
Its promptness emphasizes the fact that it has
recognized that the port of Saint John is one
of Caniada's national ports, and as such shouid
he equipped- in such a manner as wili insuro
the propor and efficient handling of a large
part of the products of the manufacturers and
agriculturists of this country.
Unfortunetely Saint John bas not alweys
been recognized as one of Canades national
ports. During the Confedereition overtures
it was stated that not onilv would rail communication with the Maritime Provinces be
estabished, but the ports of those provinices
would ha buift up and- proper facilities installed ini ordor that the prodiiets of Canada
would flow through Canadien ports instead of
through Boston, Portland, Balrtimore, and
other American porýts ýon the Atlanti. During
the discussion of the Confederation pact very

Hon. Mr.

rOSTER.

JULY 30, 1931
facilities were developed upon such a scale
as to afford additional facilities beyond our
present need, for the proper and thorough
handling of a large and growing import and
export business; second, to make all port
facilities eventually available to all lines of
railway upon an equitable and fair basis;
third, to own, control and operate all harbourfront railways and pier accommodation. Those
policies clcarly laid down the principles at
which we aimed.

In connection with the flrst, which was to
provide additional facilities, we had before us
the report of the so-called Duncan Commission; and I might explain that the fact that
the harbour had not been developed up to
1895 or 1896 caused a great deal of disappointment and unrest, and that was one of the
reasons which brought about that well known
saying, "Maritime Rights," following which
the Duncan Commission was appointed. I
should like to place on Hansard, if I may,
an extract fron the report of Sir Andrew
Rae Duncan, because it may be a guide in
future when other money will probably be
required in connection with the port of Saint
John:
We are satisfied that neither at Halifax nor
at Saint John-although developments at Saint
John have been more extensive than at Halifax
-is it possible, in present circumstances, to
secure adequate port development. We recommend that, in respect of each of these two
harbours, the Federal Government should establish a statutory Harbour Commission, whose
business it would be to see that the port
facilities are developed on such a scale as will
gradually-but by no means slowly-create
channels through which trade can expand both
winter and summer. The development of a
port is as much a matter of mechanical and
technical equipment, business organization and
practical administration, as is the development
of any extensive manufacturing or industrial
business.
We believe it is in the publie interest of
Canada, and in the interest of the future
growth and expansion of its activities, that
its Atlantic ports should be developed, just
as it bas been that its railways and canals
should be developed-though development of
these has naturally come first. We believe
also from the evidence we have had that, under
existing conditions of proprietorship at these
ports, there will neither be inducement enough,
nor impetus enough, to create really great
ports, since for some time, at all events, it
will be necessary to create facilities even ahead
of expansion of trade. All that the Fathers of
Confederation said about the importance to
Canada of outlets and inlets on the Atlantic
ocean open all the year round is as true to-day
as it was then (and is indeed, from a commercial point of view," more immediately true
now than then), and, in respect to ports-as
well as in respect to the railways-the experience of the late war is fresh enough in mind
to illustrate one phase of the national viewvoint and national necessity.

517

I may say, honourable gentlemen, that that
was the guide which we had in framing the
policy of laying out a comprehensive plan of
development which would allow of future
expansion.
At the present moment, I understand, there
is in Canada a very eminent engineer, Sir
Alexander Gibb, who is making an examination of Canadian ports, and it may be
that such an eminent engineer will not agree
with what we did in the early stages of the
Harbour Commission. I do not want to say
that he will disagree, but sometimes engineers,
like lawyers, differ in opinion. After having
our plans prepared we consulted the Shipping
Federation of Canada, in Montreal, as to the
location of the facilities. We consulted
shipping men generally, captains and navigators in the harbour of Saint John, as to
the placement of the wharves. We also consulted the railway officials, and we received
approval of the plans from the Department
of Marine and Fisheries. As I have said, I
do not anticipate any criticism as to the
placing of those structures, but I would put
on record the fact that we did consult those
people who, as we thought, had intimate
knowledge of the requirements of the port,
and the proper position for those facilities.
I wish also to say that we fcund, by statistics we had gathered, that a great deal of
delay had taken place in former years with
regard to ships entering the port of Saint
John. Those statistics showed that in one
year sixty steamers had been delayed in
securing accommodation at our port, and this
demonstrated the necessity of providing facilities on an increased scale. For that reason
alone I am sure the people of this country
generally will commend this application.
I notice by the provisions of this Bill that
it is in the nature of a loan. As I have said,
I understand it is intended to provide $5,000,000 for reclaiming the burnt-over area, and
$5,000,000 for carrying on work which had
been previously planned. I had hoped that
the Government might see its way to provide at least a portion of this money, not by
way of loan to the Harbour Commission, but
by way of a separate vote or grant. I based
that hope upon the fact that under the present
Bill the Harbour Commission of Saint John
is charged with interest upon a certain proportion of those facilities which have been
destioyed, and to add a further interest
charge on the amount necessary to restore
those is placing rather a handicap upon the
Harbour Commission. Frankly I must say,
from experience, that I do not sec how it
will be possible for the Harbour Commission

518

SENATE

at Saint John to provide for not only the
interest charge upon the capital cost of those
structures which have bcen swept away, but
also the additional charge for the money required to replace them.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Were they fully
insured?
Hon. Mr. POSTER: I will say to my honourable friend the leader of the Government
that that question arose shortly after the fixe,
and I think some criticism was levelled at
the Harbour Commission because no insurance was carried upon those properties. That
came rather as a little bit of criticism on
the Harbour Commission that was originally
appointed. Having been chairman of that
Harbour Commission, I should like to say,
in that regard, that we went very fully into
the insurance question, and the reason no
insurance was carried upon the properties in
Saint John harbour was that the insurance
rate exacted by the Underwriters' Association
was so high as to be prohibitive. The rate
upon the wharves on the harbour front of
Saint John at that time would have been
about three and a half per cent, and if we
had insured the harbour front properties up
to their value, or a reasonable proportion
of the value, the drain on the revenue of
the harbour would have been too great. At
that time we had an investigation made as
to the feasibility of introducing a sprinkler
system on the harbour front, but, owing to
the nature of the construction, that plan was
not feasible. Those are the reasons why insurance was not carried on the harbour front
properties.
Some disappointment has naturally been
felt by those of us who believed that some
policy other than that outlined in this Bill
might possibly have been worked out. I
'have before me a declaration of policy made
by the present Prime Minister during the last
election. Having had some little experience
in connection with harbour administration, I
can quite appreciate his expressions on the
hustings. Before reading this declaration of
policy I wish to say that I fully agree with it.
Halifax and Saint John should be national
ports. They belong to the people of Canada.
They should be great free open ports. A great
free port is the only way in which we can have
the products of this great country compete in
the markets of the world. This port is a great
national undertaking and unless treated as such
we cannot succeed. My aibition is to see this
port the cheapest in the world.
That was the delaration made by the Prime
Minister in the city of Saint John as reported
in the Telegraph-Journal of that city.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

Then in the Ottawa Journal of July 1, last
year, I find the following:
The port of Saint John, the Conservative
leader declared, should be a great free port,
a national port. And towards the implementation of this object he gave his pledge. The
Conservative leader referred to a report that
he was opposed to the port of Saint John as
at present operated. "Of course I am," he
declared. "I am opposed to the collection of
tolls in this port which prevents it froua being
built up."
The difficulty, however, is that the administration of the harbour is under the Harbour
Commission Act, which lays down principles
on which a Harbour Commission should carry
on its work. One clause in the Harbour Commission Act states that the Commission is
charged with the raising of revenue and that
it must receive from the revenue obtained
and the tolls imposed upon traffic sufficient
income to meet those conditions which are
embodied in the Harbour Commission Act.
The Act says:
19. (1) The Corporation nay levy such rates
as are fixed by by-law, and mnay by by-law
commnute any rates authorized by this Act to
be levied, on such terns and conditions and for
such suins of ioney as the Corporation deems
expedient-and
so on. But it must be realized that
in fixing those rates the Harbour Commission
must take into consideration the expenses of
the Commission. Naturally the Act lays
down the expenses for whieh the Commission
must provido. In this case iwe were charged
with raising the necessary revenue to meet
the payments that are plainly specified in the
Act. Section 22 of the Act states these as
follows:
(a) The payment of ai necessary expenses
incurred in the collection of the said revenue,
and in the management and operation of the
harbour

services, and in the maintenance

and

ordinary repair of its works and facilities,the exenditure of all revenue to be subject
tocthe supervision and control of the Minister:

(1) lle paynent of interest on any debenturcs issiued uînder the authority of this Act.
-and so on. Therefore, while the incentive
to the Harbour Commission is to lower the
rates so as to make them compare with those
of Boston, Baltimore, and other Atlantic
ports, the Commissioners are charged with the
duty of maintaining their revenue to such an
extent as to pay all expenses, to pay for
maintenance, and if possible to pay a certain
amount of interest on the money which was
borrowed from time to time.
Honourable gentlemen will see that while,
as a former chairman of a harbour commission, I would naturally approve of the prin-

JULY 30, 1931
ciple as laid down by the Prime Minister, yet
it seems to me, in view of the specific provisions in the statutes setting up those harbour
commissions, that before it will be practicable
to adopt that principle of making our ports
free, or making then cheaper, in order that
they may better compete with American
Atlantic ports, it will be necessary to do some
recasting of the whole harbour commission
administration. I presume that the finances of
the country, at the present time at all events,
will not allow of such a thing; but let us
hope that the principle that has been laid
down by the Prime Minister may be put
into operation in future years, so that the
ports of Saint John and Halifax may reap the
advantage from decrease in the rates, and
become more attractive thereby.
I should like to point out that I have had
numerous inquiries in regard to the cost of
providing facilities in the port of Saint John.
I have been asked to explain why the cost
of a wharf or pier in the harbour of Saint
John is greater than at some other points.
This, of course, is due to the rise and fall
of the tide in the Bay of Fundy. The necessity of providing about 25 feet of additional
height to allow for the rise of the tide increases the cubie content of such a construction. But the variation in the level of water
in the Saint John harbour, as between the
low and the high water, is no greater than
that which prevails at some ports in other
parts of the world; and when the plea is put
forward that it is a detriment to shipping, we
can only make comparisons with some other
places.
I noticed that an honourable gentleman in
the House stated the other day that the
Montreal Harbour Commission had paid its
interest every year. I am sure we all fully
rejoice in that statement, but J would point
out that the cost of providing a channel to
the port of Montreal would naturally be
based on the necessary provision for the
shipping getting into the harbour. If the cost
of construction in the harbour of Saint John
is greater than it may be in Montreal, it is
offset in various ways.
I have also heard the complaint that the
rise and fall of tide that I speak of are detrimental to shipping, and I should like to place
on recoid the fact that, though there is a
considerable variation in the tide at Saint
John, the disadvantages of such a variation
are not confined to Saint John, for at Bristol
there is a variation of 42 feet; at Avonmouth,
40 feet; at Newport-Bristol Channel, 38
feet; at Cardiff, 36N feet; at Barrow Pier,
28 feet; at Liverpool, 27½ feet; and at Saint
John, 26k feet. I have already mentioned the

519

fact that while the rise and fall of the tide
are considerable, they are more than equalled
in other places. It will be observed from the
figures I have given that the rise and fall
of the tides at Saint John are not greater
than those prevailing at some of the world's
largest ports. They are practically identical
with the variation at Liverpool.
I notice that some criticism has been made
in the press of the provision in the Harbour
Commission Act for the repayment of a certain amount of money to the City of Saint
John. I should like to read a statement from
a newspaper published in one of the large
centres of this country. I have been too long
in public life te find fault with newspapers.
One of the functions of an editor is to give
expression to his -views. He has the advantage of reaching very many more people than
can be reached by ordinary mortals, and therefore he should be more careful in his statements. I had something to do with the
drafting of the provisions of the Harbour
Commission Act, but I do net want to deal
with this newspaper comment except to say
it is misleading and unfair. It says:
The smoke had not cleared from the ruins
of the fire-swept St. John, N.B., terminals
before the spirit of the Maritimes asserted
itself. A ringing call went out from the great
winter port for the press of Canada to rally
to the aid of the stricken port and persuade
the Government to replace the structure
destroyed by the conflagration. And accompanying that call was a heart-rending story of
how St. John had fought, bled and died to
attain its supremacy as the greatest political
port in Canadian history.
It appears that the city actually did some
building on its own account and at its own
expense. It is declared that it spent $3,000,000.
At least that is the amount recovered from the
Federal Government when the port was
nationalized three years ago. And the industry
and zeal displayed in recovering that sum was
worthy of the best traditions of the Province
down by the Sounding Sea.
Now, not only the buildings and wharves
sold to the Government are gone, but all the
structures since built by the Government as
well. And St. John sorrows for the loss of
what may prove to have been years of misspent
political pull.
As I have already pointed out, certain
facilities were provided by the port of Saint
John at a critical period of time. I sometimes wonder what the pork packers and the
munition workers in some parts of Canada
would have done during the war period if the
City of Saint John had not gone down into
its pockets and expended that $3,000,000. I
want te make it clear that the interest on
that sum has net been paid by Canada, for
the Harbour Commission has up te the present
provided the interest and sinking fund upon
that amount out of the revenues of the

SENATE
harbour. I have in my tand a report of the
Harbour Commissionors which shows th-chairgo for the interest upen that $3,0000
bas been paid te the City of Saint John.
J notice from the press that negorictions
are geog on at the prc sent time wirh regard
te the doeponing cf the St. Lawrenee watorway. That is a big question, and I do net

mendations which, I am sure, would commend
themselves to any harbour commission in
Canada. In dealing with the third recommendation of that report the Commission at
Saint John found what it considered to be a
very unfair discrimination in regard to insurance rates, and took steps to arrange with
marine underwriters and others that the rates
charged for vessels using Canadian ocean
ports should be as low as the rates for vessels
using United States ports. With that end in
view the Harbour Commission of the city of
Saint John has been working for some time
and has produced very good results. I think in
a matter of that kind a -local commission can
perhaps accomplish more than a centralized
body could. I had always wondered why
there was such a great discrimination in insurance rates against the port of Saint John
as compared with Portland. An investigation
was begun during my term of office, and was
continued by my- successors. Following a
suggestion of the Department of Marine and
Fisheries, a representative of the Saint John
Harbour Commissioners, Mr. Alexander Gray,
C.E., general manager, went to England and
interviewed authorities there, with good results. The Imperial Shipping Committee was
very favourably impressed with the representations that were made, to the effect that
aids to navigation in the Bay of Fundy had
been very greatly improved and that there
had been no wrecks over a period of years.
That Committee submitted a representation
to the Institute of London Underwriters, the
Liverpool Underwriters Association and Lloyd's
Underwriters Association that the additional
insurance premium on hulls to the port of
Saint John should be eliminated, and as a
result the Joint Hull Committee added the
following note to the North American Agreement:
No additional premium to be charged for
vessels calling at Saint John, New Brunswick,
if properly fitted with and equipped for the
.use of wireless direction-finding apparatus.
Honourable members will appreciate the importance of this achievement, which resulted
from the activities of the local Harbour Com.
mission.
One important discrimination still remains
against the ports of Saint John and Halifax,
namely, that they are not inoluded in the
North Atlantic Chartering Range. The terpm
"North Atlantic Range" is used in chartering
tramp vessels for carrying grain, the principal
advantage being that the charterer has the
option of specifying any port within the
range at which he wishes to load. After his
appearance before the Imperial Shipping

521

Committee, Mr. Alexander Gray came to the
conclusion that the representations made
for inclusion of the port of Saint John in the
.chartering range will be given favourable
consideration when the necessary facilities now
in course of construction are completed, provided it can be shown that the working expenses at Saint John are no greater than those
in American Atlantic ports. We hope that
funds proposed by this Bill will enable the
Commission to complete the facilities to
which I have referred.
I can assure honourable members that when
the improvements that are in mind are completed the port of Saint John will be on a
par with any Atlantic port in the United
States and there will be no excuse for
Canadian shippers to patronize American ports.
In recent months we have heard a good deal
about a "Canada First" policy. While we
may disagree as to the means by which such
a policy should be carried out, I am sure we
are all united in supporting the principle.
In connection with that policy a creed has
been published for our people to follow,
and it urges us to support Canadian manufacturers and producers, but I regret to say
that it does not urge the manufacturers and
producers to patronize Canadian ports on the
Atlantic seaboard in preference to American
ports. The port of Saint John is to be rebuilt, its facilities being largely increased. I
hope the shippers of Canada will in the future
have their shipments in and out of the
country billed through the seaports of the
Maritime Provinces, and especially in the
winter-time. If they would do so our railways would receive much larger revenues,
which they greatly need. I know that charges
at the port of Saint John will be found
reasonable. The longshoremen at Saint John
are very efficient, and their scale of wages is
very reasonable. The rail rates on grain and
on all other Canadian products shipped to
Saint John are on an equal basis with those
for shipment to Portland, Boston, New York,
Baltimore and other ports on the American
Atlantic seaboard. I have already pointed
out that the insuranoe rates on both hulls
and cargoes have recently been adjusted on
the same basis. The British preference applies to shipments via Canadian ports only.
All things considered, the people of Canada
have every reason for supporting our own
Atlantic ports, and I commend this Bill to
honourable members for their favourable consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SENATE

CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby, the
Senate went into Committe on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
On section 1-short title:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yesterday I
was unable to answer a question asked about
another harbour. I have the officer of the
department here now, and if there is any
question in reference te the expenditure on
the Saint John harbour I can get the information.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask the
same question that I put yesterday in regard
to the harbour at Three Rivers, and inquire
to what extent the Saint John harbour has
met its obligations?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: As is the case
at Three Rivers, the interest on the construction work is charged te capital account. The
interest on the original acquisition of the
harbour is charged in the ordinary way to
revenue account.
Section

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is obvious to
everv member of the Senate that I am not

submitted by the honourable member from
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope). I must rely, therefore, upon the knowledge and experience of
members of the Senate who are more familiar
with the subject than I 'am. I take it for

who have the experience te enable thicm te

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the second
reading of Bill 106, an Act te amend the
Special War Revenue Act.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What is it all about?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
That is all.

More

taxes.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Could we have
a brief explanation?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Special Revenue
Acts have net been altogether unknown in
years gone by. This Bill amends the existing
law in same respect. Without entering into
the reasons, I may say that the Bill provides, as is well known, for a thrce-cent rate
on certain letters. It also provides ýfor a
stamp tax on cheques for amounts in excess
of $5, and for a tax on certain insurance
premiums, particularly those remitted te conpanies outside of Canada. Because of falling
revenues the gencral sales tax, with which
everyone is familiar, is increased from 1 per
cent to 4 per cent. That tax has fluctuated
from yecar te year, sometimes upward and
sometimes downward, according te the need.
It has been as higE as 6 per cent. It is now
fixed at 4 per cent.

JULY 30, 1931
As abil the items of the Bill have been
very thorougbly discussed in another place,
and have been agreed to, I think unanimously,
a discussion in detail at this late period of the
session, does flot secan to be neoessary, particuîarly as this House dces not, attexnpt to
amend revenue bille,
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I should like
to asIc the Minister why the Governanent
thinks it necessary to continue a war-time
ineasure. Why sbould we, at this long distance
from the war, 'blame the war for existing
conditions and refer to the war in this
Revenue Act? ls it flot about time we
dropped the war as an excuse for taxation.?
1 admit that taxation is necessary; but why
not cali this a Revenue Act and d-rop the
war-time label? This is not a war-time tax
at ail.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
With ail due
respect to my right honourable friend, I can
scarcely agree with hirn. This tax is necessary
because heavy annual expenditures arising
out of the war are a burden that mnust stili
be carried by the country, and because
revenues have been falling during the pat
year or so. I h-ave not heard any suggestion
in Government circles that the titie of the
tax should be changed while the burden of
taxation resuIting frorn the war still remains
with us. If my right honourable friend desires to suggest another titie for the Bill, I
shall be glad to give it consideration. The
need for a change has neyer occurred to the
G overnment.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Perhaps it
would flot have occurred to me if I were in
the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
During the
past eight years I have had occasion to present various arnendrnents to the War Revenue
Act, and I have always done so in the hope
that conditions would improve so that we
could get down to a peace level and forget the
consequences of the war.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Were rny
honourable friend's suggestions made in the
House or outeide?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I say that in
the past I have brought in many amendments
to the Special War Revenue Act.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The honourable gentleman neyer thought of reducing
taxes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Matters have
not improved, unfortunately; but it is the
world-wide depression that is responsihie for
this increase in taxation.
No particular

523

feature of the Bill has caught my attention
Taxes, of course, are not agreeable, but the
people must bear thern in order that income
and expenditure may be balanced, and it is
the firat duty of a Minister of Finance to
see that bis budget doe balance. If nobody
on this aide of the House desires to diseuse
any particular clause of this Bill, I arn agreeable that after it has been given the second
reading it should receive the third reading
without being considered in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIIW

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the
second Teading of Bill 111, an Act to amend
the Customs Tariff.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Explain.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My right honourable friend is strong on asking for explanations. I will do the best I can.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I do not
desire to be unduly strong in that respect,
but a measure revoiutionizing taxation, or
partially revolutionizing it, ought to *be explained to the House.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Measures containing amendments in taxation relating to
customs are with Parliament every year. One
or two of the proposals in this Bill are
slightly different from those of the past. One
feature that I have in mind at the moment
is that certain duties formerly performed
by a special board under the Customs Art
now fail to the lot of the Tariff Board that
we discussed here a few days ago. The Tariff
Board is also to have jurisdiction over certain matters that previously came under the
Combines Act. So far as changes in taxation
are concerned, they are perhaps more numerous than extensive, and unless honourable
members desire to discuss matters which, have
already been discussed for weeks in another
place, and which, I frankly confess, I arn not
capable of discussing very intelligentiy in
detail, there is not much more to be said.
However, I am at the disposai of my honour.

Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honouîrable
gentlemen, I arn net geing te discuss this Bill,
cither in general or in debail. I rise merely

JULY 30, 1931
for the purpose of contrasting the policy embodied in it with some policies of the present
Government which to my mind are worthy
of a great deal more commendation than this.
As has been said, this Bill is intended to carry
out the policy announeed during the last
election. A few days ago, when my honourable friend introduoced the Bill ýproviding for
a treaty with Austra.lia, I indulged for a
moment the hope and the belief that it indicated a change of mind on the part of the
present Government in regard to the tariff.
In my opinion that treaty with Australia
points the way to the best solution of Canada's
economic difficulties. I hoped that the policy
exemplified by that treaty would be chosen
in preference to the policy enunciated in the
present Bill. Increasing the tariff to the extent that it is done in this measure is not
to my mind a happy way of dealing with the
difficulties of the present situation. I think
that the more closely world conditions are
examined, and the more intensely the result
of high tariff in other eountries is studied,
the more apparent it becomes that the building up of high tariff barriers vill not solve
the present economic situation of the world
or the problems of Canada.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIR.D READING
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Before the Bill IS
read the third time I should like to ask a
question of the Minister. Did I understand
him to state that goods now shipped ta
Canada on a through bill of lading, in a
British bottom, got the benefit of the preferential tariff? Does he claim that that is
new legislation?
Yes, I think
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
the clause refers to the possibility of goods
shipped on a through bill of lading, and transhipped from one port to another, coming
through to a Canadian port.
That has always
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
been the law.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Let me read the law
as it is given in the note to the Bill:
Section 5. "(2) Goods entitled to the benefits
of the British Preferential Tariff shall be entitled to the discount authorized by this section,
when such goods are shipped on a through bil'l
of lading consigned to a consignee in a specified
port in Canada, when such goods are transferred at a port of a B-ritish colony or possession not enjoying the benefits of the British
Preferential Tariff, and conveyed without further transhipment into a sea or river port of
Canada."

525

Now the words "of a British colony or
possession not enjoying the benefits of the
British Preferential Tariff" are changed to
the words, "in a British possession and conveyed without further transhipment into a
sea, lake or river port of Canada." That is
all the difference. It has always been the
law, except for a slight change of the wording.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bll
was read the third time, and passed.
OLD AGE PENSIONS B:ILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 136, an Act to amend the Old
Age Pensions Act.
He said: Does my right honourable friend
want any details?
Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM: My wants in
regard to details are never supplied.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This Bill makes
only one change in the law that has been in
effect for several years, since 1926 or 1927.
Up to the present time the Federal Government, in co-operation with the Provincial
Legislature, has undertaken to pay fifty per
cent of the cost of old age pensions. By this
measure it is proposed that the Federal
Government shall bear seventy-five per cent
of the total cost.
The reasons for that change are simple and
need no lengthy explanation. Honourable
members of the Senate, as well as members of
the other House, are familiar with the provision of the Old Age Pensions Act, under
which the authorities of a province, by accepting the ternis of the Act, make it effective in
that province and undertake to pay one-half
of the cost. Two of the provinces, I think,
apportion their cost jointly with the municipalities. Some of the older provinces, usually
referred to as the Maritime Provinces, where
persons over seventy years of age represented
a much larger proportion of the total population than in the newer Western Provinces,
found they were quite unable to bear the fiftyper-cent load that would be placed upon them
by the operation of the Old Age Pensions law.
Each of those provinces passed legislation
which was, I believe, to become effective by
proclamation, but they felt -that they could
not proclaim it until the Federal Act was
somewhat changed to lighten the burden that
would be placed upon them, and to make it
correspond more closely with the burden
resting on the newer provinces, with their
smaller percentage of people seventy years of
age or older.

526

SENATE

I might mention that old age pensions
became payable in British Columbia on
September 1, 1927; in Alberta on August 1,
1929; in Manitoba on September 1, 1928; in
Ontario on November 1, 1929; in Saskatchewan on May 1, 1928, and in the North West
Territories on January 25, 1929.
The provinces east of Ontario have not yet
expressed a desire to operate under the provisions of this Act. Concurrent legislation was
passed by New Brunswick in 1930, and by
Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island in
1931, and this legislation will come into force
by proclamation. During the past year Old
Age Pensions Acts have been amended for
the purpose of securing to the provinces the
benefit of the Dominion Act decreasing the
percentage of the contribution of the province.
The Old Age Pensions Act passed by Nova
Scotia in 1931 provided for the general sheme.
The Prince Edward Island legislation mentioned has net been received by the Department of Labour as yet, but it is presumed
that it will follow the lines of the Nova
Scotia Act.
Suîbstantial sums have been paid by the
Federal Government. It may be interesting
to refer to these. Up te March 31 last there
werc in Canada sone 57,930 persons pensionable under the Old Age Pensions Act. It is
perhaps unnecessary to give the details here,
but they nay bo found in the Labour Gazette
for May, 1931. The total amount of pensions
paid since the inception of the Old Age Pension
Act to March 31 of this ycar was
$19,102,834.47.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Tîat is the
total amount?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The
total
animunt. The Dominion Government's proportion of that total was 39,552,477.44. The
figures for the various provinces are also given
in the sane issue of the Labour Gazette. As
the principal object of this Bill is to increase
the Fcleral Government's contribution from
50 per cent to 75 per cent of the sums paid
out by the various provinces, honourable
members nay not consider it necessary to go
into Cormittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Has the honourable
Minister a memorandum containing the provincial figures to which he bas referred?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The document
I have in my hand bas been reprinted from
the Labour Gazette for May of this year.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Would there be any
objection to baving the figures placed upon
Hansard as part of the honourable gentleman's speech? I think they would be interesting.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There is no objection on my part to putting upon Hansard
all the figures contained in this document. I
have read only a few of them, because I did
net consider the others were relevant to the
siubject under discussion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the
honourable gentleman tell us what bas been
paid by Ontario during the last twelve
nonths?
I suppose the payments do not
extend much farther back than that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Perhaps the
honourable gentleman would be interested to
know that the average pension paid to eligible
persons over seventy years of age in Ontario
was $19.15,-somewhat below $20, it will be
observed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
That is per
nonth?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes. The total
a mount of pensions paid in Ontario during
the last quarter of the fiscal year 1930-31 was
$1,578.840.82, and the Federal Government's
share was $789,420.40.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
That would
be on the basis of about S3,000,000 a year
ai the Federal Government's share for the
Province

of Ontario?

lon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The
total
aimont paid in old age pensions in the Provinet of Ontario from the tinte the Act went
into force until 'March 31 this vear was
s9,324,110.57, of which the Federal Governitnt's share was $4,662,055.27.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Wltat period
does that cover?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The whole
period since Ontario caine under the Act.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I should like
to know the date.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Act becane
effective in Ontario on November 1, 1929.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The share of
the Dominion Government for pensions in
Ontario would be about $3,000,000 a year?
lion. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Well, it is a
litle over four and a half millions since
Novecmber 1929.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What was the
anount that the Government paid for the
quarter-year?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
$789,420.40.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At that rate, it
would be a little more than $3,000,000 a year?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Yes, roughly.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Put all the
figures on Hansard.

on a contributory basis.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
perîîsed the debate

I

have

not

that, took piacc on this

JULY 30, 1931
suble-ot, in another place, but perhaps I arn
to some extent familiar with tihe idea that
the Government had in mind. It was publicly
announced about a year ego, I think, that
the policy of the leader of the present Government contemplated the ultimate establishment of an oki age pensions law under which
the, Federal Government would bear the total
cost. Tha-t of course implied the establishment of necessary adLministrative niachinery,
for it is unthinkable that if the Government paid the total cost resulting fr.om legislation on an important matter of that kind,
it would not control the operation of the Act.
It is not tisual for Governmnents in granting
such large sums of money to entrust the distribution to outside parties. Diffierent opinions
ivere expressed tihroughout the country as to
the best means of conducting an old age
pensions system. I ùhink it can be truly said
that some people advoca.ted non-contributory
pensions, while others suggested non-concontributory unemployment insuranýce, which
bas been pressed upon Govcrnments from
time to time. It is possible that the decennial
cpnsus taken tbis year will give us more
accurate knowledge than we now possess as
ta the number of unernployed in Canada, the
total population of the eountry, and other
interesting facts. When that information is
available a new old age pensions scbeme may
be devised. Pensions may be granted to
persons for services rendiered as citizens, or to
workmen in industries, or in various other
ways. Pensions and insicrance are not on
the same footing, as ahl honourable rnembers
will agrec. and the Gov'ernment deisiýred ta
niake it cecar, I tbink, that insurance must
oyfnece3ity bc on a contributory basis. It was
feit that eventualiy a plan might be develoýped for com!bined action with regard to
old age pensions, annuities and unemployment insuranc-e, but that it was inad'visable
to attornpt anything of the kind until further
informnation was in thie hands of the Gýovernment and availaible for study by actuaries and
other experts in working out a plan, if so
desi-red. 1 think when this Bill was introduced the Go-vemnent had something like
that in mmnd. It is noV improbable tha-t such
a plan wauld be on a contributory basis, so
that the people who benefit would feel Vhey
had a proprietax-y right to do so. We have
in Canada, as fionourable members know, the
Annui-ties Act, unduer which at present approximatelry 50,000 people are making contributions.
The Bihl was apparently amended in another
place by the elimination from. the preamble
of the words that have been quoted by my
honourable friend. As I have already stated,
the principal abject of the measure is ta in-

529

crease the Dominion Government's contribution to old age pensions from 50 per cent ta
76 iper cent of the sums paid out by the
various provinces.
It rnay be of interest Vo reinark here that,
many people in Canada who are eIigible for
oId age pensions have noV applied for thern,
because they feel that to do so would mean
a sacrifice of their independence. They look
upon pensions as something savouring of
charity. In some provinces-I have one
particularly in mind-Vhe opposite view is
being enterfained to a considerable extent,
and it is claimed that the Federal Giovernment
is hiable for contribution towards pensions for
persons over seventy years of age who are
living in old people's homes which are supported by municipalitie8. I arn noV at ahl
sure that state of affairs will continue very
long, for the Government desires that the
operation of the Act shaîl be uniform throughouit the country.
I bave another observation which may be
of interest Vo honourable members. During
my recent trip through Western Canada I
found instances of people who have resided in
thiis country for more than twenty years and
neyer thought it necessary or desirable Vo
become Canadian citizens until they reached
the age of seventy and wanted to become
eligible for pensions. This matter is receiving
the attention of the Government at the
present time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Like my honourable friend, I have not read the debatte on this
matter in the other House. I do noV know
why the Government dropped certain words
from the preamble of the Bill, but I knvw
that Great Britain started out as we did,
with a non-contributory scheme, and within
three or four years the burden upon the British
treasury had became s0 heavy that a contributory system was found- necessary. It
seems evident that beo re long aur federal
treasury will be carrying the whole burden
of old age pensions, and I venture to predict
that that burden, will be found very heavy.
0f course, some plan must be devised, whether
on a contributory or a non-contributory basis.
I have been agreeahhy surprised ta find that
many labour organs in this country advocate
the establishment of a contributory rather than
a wholly non-contributory system. In view of
this fact, it seems Va me that preparations
should be made for the establishment of such
a seheme in the near future. 0f course, it may
be necessary ta consider the establishment of
a plan that to some extent at -least will operate
on *a non-contributory basis, for persans who
have passed the age of forty and wish Vo ta2ke

advantage of it with.in twenty-five or thirty
years wvill flot, ho able to make very substantial

to think of making some arrangement that
will be satisfactory to ail concerned. The
Dominion Government is assuming more and

by the provinces. 1 am somewhat surprised
at, the elimination from the Bill of the words

Lion. Mr. BEIQUE: Perhaps the Hon. the

hiave been. When we are discussing a matter

te say 'a few words in support cf this Bill. These who bave not visited
the, port cf Chiuutiimi recontly would ho surprised te find considerable activitv and consiuler'ube ehînge in that old French Canadian
seti leneent. As heneurable iienibers are aware,

or bousts cf baving, the ycungest Harbour
Comnnuî,sion'in Canadla. This Com-mission is
carî'ying on a ery successfutly and is unique in

JULY 30, 1931
that its members serve without remuneration.
The harbour is under very capable management. The amount asked for under this Bill
is required to complete work that was begun
several years ago. The $450,000 will make possible the completion, along the front of the
town, of properly equipped docks, providing
three berths for ocean-going steamers. Last
year the river Saguenay was dredged out as
far up as Chicoutimi, and to-day there is ample
water for ocean steamers to proceed direct to
that port. 'Last year a 7,500-ton steamer discharged its cargo there and I should think
that this ycar steamers up to probably 10,000
tons could reach the port quite conveniently.
Chicoutimi is the north-eastern terminal of
the Canadian National Railways, and is also
the terminus of the Canada, Steamship Lines,
0f recent years we have read of the great
developments that have taken place in the
Saguenay district.
It possesses marvelous
water-powers, which are capable of a development quite ample to take care of many new
and large industries. At present there is in
operation a large aluminum works, and the
pulp and paper milîs do a very large business.
The local traffic of the port of Chicoutimi
is considerable. In that north-eastern section
of the Province of Quebec there is already a
very large and growing trade, and I am satisfied that in the future there will be a still
greater development.
I bave much pleasure in supporting the
Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill

and eighth nmendments, and bave disagreed
with the fourtb amnendment made by the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Wbat is the
fourth amiendment?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: 1h is the amendment
to the clause which says that anyone shaîl
be deemed to be nude wbo is so scantily clad
as to offend against public decency or order.
After the amendment had heen made in the
committee it was decided to insert tbe provision that no action or prosecution sbould
take place witbout the consent of the Attorney
General. If the committee bad considered
this provision first, it would not bave tbought
the other amendment necessary. What tbe
committea feared was tbat under the section as it came fromn the Commons a charge
could he laid that someone bad offended
against public decency simply because be was
not wearing bis overcoat. However, 1 think*
that if the clause providing that no prosecution inay takze place without the consent of
the At'torney General remains in the Bill,
that provision will be quite sufficient.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
After we bad
added the clause providing for the authorization of tbe Attorney General I realized that.
tbe amendment to the definition of nudity
was of far less importance than it bad been.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Under tbe circumstances I would move tbat this Bouse do
not insist upon tbe amendment disagreed to
by tbe House of Commons, and tha.t a

That sbould

front, but I am not opposed to cars going to
the rear-or over the rear, for that matter.
While I contend that parking anywhere on
the grounds is at present illegal, I am in
favour of increasing the facilities if space can
be found in some area other than the front of
the buildings.
I should like to refer to one or two other
points, in the hope that they may be considered by the Committee next session. Some
time ago I called attention in this House to
the condition of some of the monuments on
Parliament Hill. I am pleased to be able to
tell the House that I have had interviews with
officials of the Public Works Department, who
have looked over the statues, and the Chief
Architect has given me his personal assurance
that steps will be taken to remove the stains
which I mentioned and to restore the monuments to a decent condition.
I want to suggest to the Committee that
the lawns in front of this building are not
a credit to the bountry. I do not profess to be
a farmer, although I have donc a little gardening, but I should be ashamed of myself if I
could not grow a better crop of grass than we
see on those lawns, and I am sure bonourabie
members who take the trouble to walk over
the grounds will agree that there is a great
need for improvement. My opinion is that
in order to grow good grass it is necessary
to have suitable soil which is kept well fertilized, and to use plenty of seed-not to be
content with one seeding, but to be sowing
continually. So far as I have observed, nothing is ever donc to this grass year after year
beyond cutting it. Consequently it is getting
thinner all the time.
I should also like to draw attention to the
condition of the roadway leading up from
the gate nearest to the Chateau Laurier. At
the other entrances we have concrete walks
and pavements, but at this eastern gate the
mud and water in the spring is sometimes
ankle deep. The conditions there are worse
than can be found on any country roadway,
and I fail to understand why they have been
a}'lowed to become so bad. Why cannot the
Public Works Department lay a proper concrete walk from that gate up to the buildings?
Some time ago I inquired in the House for
the names of the persons to whom statues
have been erected on the parliamentary
grounds, and I was informed that they are as
follows:
Sir George E. Cartier
Sir John A. Macdonald
Queen VictoriaI do not know why she was placed third in
the list, but she was.

533

Hon. Alex. Mackenzie
Hon. G. E. Brown
Baldwin-Lafontaine
Hon. T. D. McGee
Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
I have no criticism to make of the erection
of statues to these persons, but I am at a
loss to understand why no such honour has
been paid to any of the statesmen from the
Maritime Provinces who did so much to
bring about Confederation in 1867. Without entering into historical details, I can
say that the Dominion of Canada would not
have been established at the time it was if
Sir Charles Tupper had not brought Nova
Scotia into the Union. I am speaking now
only for my own province, and I leave it to
some other honourable senator to suggest
what representative of New Brunswick should
be honoured on these grounds. I hope the
Government will see to it that in the near
future monuments are erected here to Sir
Charles Tupper and to some statesman of
New Brunswick who was foremost in bringing that province into Confederation.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, it seems to me that some consideration should be given to the Committee's
fourth recommendation, which proposes that
parking should not be permitted anywhere on
the parliamentary grounds. Every day we
see driving up to these buildings automobiles from different parts of the United
States, bearing visitors who we hope will
get a good impression of Canada. If we keep
policemen at the gates to stop visitors and tell
them they are not allowed to park nearby,
I am afraid that very few of them will see
what kind of Houses of Parliament we have
in this country. I am of the opinion that
the recommendation that cars should be
parked behind the Confederation Building,
about four blocks away, is probably aimed at
some members of the staff. But visitors will
not park their automobiles at such a distance
and walk up to these buildings. I hope it
is not the intention of the Committee totally
to prohibit parking at the rear of the buildings.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
as a member of the Committee which made
the report, I may be ailowed to make a
few observations. I have no wish to usurp
the privileges of the Chairman. of the Committee in this respect. I presume that the
honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) is correct as to the legal aspect
of the parking situation, for he knows the
law better than a layman, such as 1, can be
expected to know it. I may say, however,

SENATE

534

that the allocation of parking areas in the
precincts of Parliament is in the hands of the
Department of Public Works, which has
Iined out spaces for cars on both sides and at
the rear of the buildings. I do flot know
whethr'r it possesses the necessary authority
to do that, but at any rate the spaces are
plainly marked and cars are directed to them
by police on the grounds. Unfortunately
many cars encroach upon the adjacent lawns,
and the intention of the Committee, as 1
understand it-at least, this was in my mind
and I arn sure it was in the mincis of the other
members-is that there should be a eoping

With reference to -'le remarks of my hionourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), I think it can be said that additional
parking facilities are needed on Parliament
llI.
The Committee rccommended that
space should be provided in the rear of the
ncw Confecderation Building. As ail hon.ourable members know, the Gov4ernment owns
the whole tract of land in that vicinity from
Wellington street down to the river, and room
for a large number of cars should be available
there. It is immaterial whether this space

regulation by the Department of Public
Works, acting under authority of the Goverurnent. I sugges, hionourable members, that
the appearanoe of Parliament Hill would be
greatly irnprovcd if no cars wero allowed to
be parked in the immediate precinets. My
honourable friend from Parkdale hias said that
Ameýrican visitors would not care to, park their
cars behiind the Confederation Block and walk
iap te, these buildings. He hias no doubt
visited Washington, and I presume is aware
that he would, not be ailowcd to leave bis car
standing close to the Capitol. By prohibiting
parking in the rear of this building we should
not cause offence to our American frîends,
for their Governmcnt at Washington hias made
similar regulations.
The remarks of the honourable gentleman
from Pictou (Mr'. Tanner) with regard to Sir
Cha.rles Tupper apply with equal pertinence
to Sir Leonard Tilley. Had it not been for
these two men and the parties that they led,
Confederation certainly would flot have been
achieved at the time it was. The entry of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into the
Union was due very largely to the skill and
adroitness of these two stat-esmen. I can only
,assume that the absence of monuments to
their memory is due to an oversight, and I

AUGUST 1, 1931
vailing abroad as well as in this country, and
it has been thought wise by the Governmenr,
and approved by the other Chamber, that the
administration should possess ample power to
preserve and maintain peace, order and good
government throughout the Dominion. This
also is one of the purposes of the Bill.
It may be fitting at this time to make a
f ew observations regarding the economie
situation that has now existed in Canada for
about two years. In 1929 unemployment was
not sQ serious as it has since become, but
before the spring of 1930 it had caused m.uch
suffering. Last year the Governinent was
authorized by Parliament to make a large contribution towards the relief of unemp1oymernt
during the past winter. Parliament appropriated the sumn of 82W,000,000 and placed it
at the disposai of the administration for that
purpose. Agreements were made with the
various provinces and larger municipalities
whereby, through a. systemn of co-operation,
a very substantial number of employment
opportunities were created and the situation
was greatly relieved. This is the third year
of crop failures in the West. Ahi over the
country the prices obtainable for agricultural
products are very low. Only a few of our
industries, which need not be mentioned just
now, have revived. Some of the major ones,
such a.s those engaged in the production of
humber. pulp and paper, have remained very
quiet, and many men have been thrown out
of empho' ment. As a result of these thingi
there wihh undouhtedhy be greater need for
assistance this winter than there was even
a year ago. Every member of Parliament,
1 think, regardlcss of his political affiliations,
recognized the necessity for relief. By the
Bill the Government is authorized to perform what seems to be a national duty.
Perhaps it is not desirable at this late hour
of what we hope will be the hast day of the
session ta enter into a lengthy discussion
et the second reading stage. In passing I
may be pcrmitted, however, to indicate
briefly to honourable members what has
been donc as a resuit of the Unemployment
Relief Act of last year. More than 300,000
people f ound intermittent employment, for
various lengths of time, on the co-operative
works carried on during last winter and up to
the present. There were employment opportunities created and works authorized on a
co-operative basis by municipalities, provinces
and the Federal Goverument to the value of
$70,8W6,437. The amount to be used out of
the 820,000,000 appropriated by Parliamnent
depended to a large extent upon the works
that municipalities and provinces would

537

undertake. The Federal Government'é allotment for the cost of such works amounted
to $14,742,9oe. In addition, out of last
year's grant, the Government set aside for
direct relief purposes, that is, for relief
where employment opportunities could not
be provided and peophe were consequenthy
destitute, the sum of $4,000,000. 0f that sumn
there had been spent up to July 28 last

$1,736,W06.

We are sure, however, that oe

what more than haîf a million dollars is stili
outstanding on accounts payable for direct
relief granted. Most of the works undertaken
were to be concluded not later than July 1
of this year, and to a large extent they have
been, but according to agreement made a year
ago the railways' program, amounting to about
$M5,000,000, cannot be compheted until about
the end of the present year. There has beon
paid out af the federal treasury, as the Gox'ernment's proportion of the cost of works
undertaken and completed, the sum of
S9.410,790. There remains unexpended, to
cover the cost of works not yet compheted,
the sum of $5,332,171, and when these works
are finished, payment will be made out of
this sum.
The direct relief fund has been drawn upon
largehy since these figures were compihed, because in places where authorized works have
been compheted normal seasonal undertakings
and emphoyment opportunities have not been
avaihable, and consequently largo numbers of
people who ordinarihy would have found
cmphoyment at this season of the year have
become dependent upon direct relief. This
assistance is moted out at the discretion of
the municipal authorities, for they must
necessarily be the sole judges of the needs of
the people within their jurisdlictions. Under
agreements executed last fahi, aIl the provinces
bear one-third of the cost of direct relief, the
balance being borne equahhy by the municipalities and the Federal Goverament. The
1'ederal Government's contractual obligations
have not yet been met, because the accounts
have not been rendered.
As we have passed through the midsummer
season and are approaching the faIt, there is
prospect of a stihl greater need of state assistance. This is particuharly truc of the provinces west of the Great Lakes. In the northern
parts of the provinces of Ontario and Quebea,
because of a contraction in the lumbering,
pulp and paper industries, and in the larger
centres of these provinces, the necessity for
aid next winter wihl be great. To a degree
the same condition wihl exist in the Maritime
Provinces. Thanks to a kind Providence, crops
east of the Great Lakes are hountiful, and

Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND:
WVill the assistance bc extended along the saine uines under
Ibis Bill as it ivas iider lte other Bill, flame]y
throughi the provinces and municipalities?
Hon. Mcr. ROBERTSON: A definite pronounicement in that regard would probably be
prematurc. The expcrience of last year bas
shown that co-operation îvith the provinces
and municipalities is in most cases quite
satisfactory, but that there are some isolate(l
instances in regard to which the regulations
gox erning the administration coitld be improved. E is truc also that a considerable
nîîmbec of the municipalities, especially those
ini M'e.-teî'n Canada, have heen unable to
collet-t anlything like the tîsual amount of
taxes; in marinv (-a,.es the ainount collected bas
been lec-s than fift per c-nt: therefore they
xviii be c1uite unablo to continue on a co-opet'ative basiis to pav the share that thcy bore last
ecar. In sut-h in-dantns thiere may have to bc
somef variation in the proportion thcy xvili pay.

The cost of ailninistrat ion of the Act cf a
ycar ago has been surprisingly small. Evcry
effort bas been mnade te administer it as
efflciently and cconomieally as possible. Onehalf of one per cent cf the $20,000,000 votcd
lasI. year was set aside for the cost of adniinistcring the fund, and while, as I have
aqlrcacly intimated to the House, there are
further payments te be made in this cconnection, the cost of administration ip to the
present timie bas net amnounted te more than
$27,624.
Hurt. Mir. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May 1 ask how
much cf the sumn of 520,000,000 is still left?
Hon. Mr'. ROBERTSON: The Bill cf 1930
provided that the sum remaining unexpended
on Mardi 31, 1931, would lapse. That unexpended portion amountcd te $1,157,038.
One activity te which I have net yet
referred is the construetion cf grade crossings.
I take it that my right honourable friend tic
ex-Minister cf Railways (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) will be interestedl in that phase cf
the work. The Grade Crossing Fund had te
its credit last summer a very substantia.1
balance running into hundreds of thousands cf
dollars. Te t.hat xvas added an appropriation
cf $500,000 from the unemplcyment relief fund.
These .sums werc te, be used for grade separatien, a work wiich servcd a deuble purpose in
creating empîcymnent opportunities and at the
samne lime reducing the hazards at railway
ci.ossings.

Com 0)1ittee Hon. RAOUL DANDURAN-\D: Honourahie
niemibers, my honocrable friend is quite right
w-bon lie says that he bas heard ne criticismn
of the. cnd wbich the Goveroi-ment had in view
in introducing this BiI.l. The enly criticismn
that has beecn stressedl relates te the power
which the Gevernmcnt sceks and the method
by Nvhich it is te administer the relief.
Unquestionably this is a i eîy uniusual ineasure.
1 doubt whether there is any precedent for ià
ici our annals, or in the legi.slation cf any
other Parliament in tbe world in times cf
peace. The guarantees allewed to the Mentreal
Harbour Cominissioners for the building cf
the Montreal bridge have been citeil elsexvhere,
btut in that case tic amounit involved ivas net
large and the cost cf the îîndertaking was tu
ho borne by the Montreal Hacheur Board, the
City cf Montreal, and the provincial authorities. Therefoce I Ihink it cannet ho contradicted tbat the presenit Bill, conferring
linliimited power te e-xpcnd an unlinîitcd surn
in any forrm the Government may desire, and
anywhere in Canada, is somcthing entirely new.
There is ne limitation what-ever.
The terms cf the preamble are net as ivide
as the termis; cf the Bill itself. Usually the
contrary is truc. The preamble says:
Whereas by reason cf the continuing world
wide ecniii depressien tîtece exists ici many
parts cf Canada a serieus state cf unemploy-

mnent and distress; and whereas the partial
failure of the wheat crop of Western Canada
bas intensified the adverse economie conditione
theretofore prevailing; and whereas it is in the
national interest that Parliamnent should support
and supplement the relief measures of the provinces and other bodies in such ways as the
G.overnor in Council may deema expedient, and
for that purpose should vest in the Governor in
Council the powèrs neceesary te insure the
speedy and unhampered prosecution of all relief
measures and the maintenance of peace, order
end good goverrnent in Canada.
A littie farther on, the Bill provides that the
Governor in Council mayAssist in defraying the cost of the production, sale and distribution of the products of
the field, farm, forest, sea, river and mine.
Then, en'tering a wider field, it says:
Assist provinces, cities, towns, mnunicipalitieg,
and other bodies or associations, by loaning
moneys thereto or guaranteeing repayment of
moneys thereby, or in such other manner as
may be deemed necessary or advisable.

The terms of the Bill strike me as exorbitant, but for my part I wili leave the responsibility with the Government, who will have
to apply them. I have faith in the honesty
of purpose of our Prime Minister, and in the
integrity of the Minister of Labour, who will
be chargcd with the direct administration of
the Aot. I realize that they are assuming very
great risks, and I shall be abie to judge of
their performance when, under the amendment voted by the House of Commons, and
which now cornes to us, they render an account
cf their stewardship before or during the
month of March next.

But that is not ail. It covers a stili wider
area of possibilities when it says:
Take ail sncb other measures as may be
deemed necessary or advisable for carrying out
the provisions of this Act.

might jeopardize its enactment and interfere
wvîth the time set for prorogation. However,

provision to cover actions taken where prosecutions are instituted under section 6 and
penalties recovered.

1 regret 'to say that the drafting of this

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

THIRD ]READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON
reading of the Bill.

moved the third

Perbaps I had better read section 7:
7. A report shall be laid before Parliament
within fifteen days after the expiration of this
Act, containing a fuit and correct statement of
the moneys expended under this Act and the
purposes te which they have been applied,
together witb copies of ail orders and regulationcs of the Govruor in Courieil made under
the provi.Pions thereof.
Now if we look at section 6 we find that:
6. The Governor in Council may prescribe
penalties that may be imposed for violation
of the orders and regulations made under the
authority of this Act, but no such penalty shaîl
exceed a fine of one thousand dollars or
imprisonment for a term of more than three
years, or both fine and imprisonment, and may
aise prescribe whetber such penalty shall be
imposed upon summary conviction or upon
indictmcent.
That section confers a very wîde power, and
1 think that at the very earliest opportunity
Parliament ought to be advised of the proceedings taken during the year under section
6. 1 do neot know that it is possible at this
stage to insert a provision to the effect that
Parliament should be se advîsed, but I think
that section 7 ought to be made to cover details of actions under section 6 as well as the
other items mentioned.

court), we sbould take all tihoee matters into
consideration, and, ta use a honely phrase,
make thbe aanendiment sensible. I may lie
criticized by my colleagues in the Government
for miaking suicl a suggestion at the present
moment, but I do so because I bave some
responsibility in connection witb the administration of tbe Art. I do nat intend, however, ta move an amrendinent, for the Bouse
of Conamons, tlie governing body bliat lias
ta, provide tbe funds, bas expressed by its
action a desire tliat tliese reports should lie
macle in a certain manner. 1 do feel, bliaugli,
that it was a mistake ito bave tbe Art expire
on thie lst of March ingtead oi thbe 3lst.
Bon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I repeat what
I said-that it was with considerable besitation
1 suggested my amendment; not because I did
flot think it wvas a proper one, for in fact I
believe it was quite proper, but berause af the
fart that if the amendment were adopted the
Bill would bave ta go back ta the Bouse of
Commons and that mniglit very seriously inconvenience bath Bouses. My honourable
friend bas discussed a point that is entirely
different from that whirli I raised. The termination ai tbe Act -is a question whicb was
nat at ahl involved in my suggested amendment, and as ta that question, of course,I
have no comment ta make.
I rise at tbis moment merely ta say that
I do not propose ta insist on tbe suggested
amendment. Since I was on my feet before,
I bave realized that in any case the information which would lie rovered by my amindment could easily be obtained at any period
next sessian,
Bon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, by put ting
questions on the Order Paper.
Bon. Mr. BELCOURT: Exactly; and in
view of that, I do flot want ta stand for a
moment in the way oi legislation, and do
nat insist on the amendment I suggested.
Rigbt Bon. Mr. GRAHAM: Banourable
members, I sbould like ta suggest ta my bonourable friend the probable source of that
amendmrent ta wbirhb li objects. I thorougbly
ag-ree wîth him that if the Art says lie must
make a report flfteen days after its expiration
lie rannat make a real repart. It bas always
been insisted cîpon, in regard ta Bills for the
construction ai brandi railways, that a repart
ai ail the expenditures and the workings
should lie laid bei are Parliament within fifteen
days after the apening ai the f ollowing session.
But that was a different tbing irom wbat the
prescrnt Bihl calls for. The expenditures on
those brandi uines were rhecked up from day
ta day, and fromn week ta week. and s0 far

541

as the expenditures were concerned, the reports could be made in a very few days. 1
imagine that this amendment has been taken
froin the standard clause included in al
branch line railway Bills in recent years, and
that it bas been inserted in this Bill without
full consideration being given to what was
meant by the demand for a real accounting
within fifteen days after the expiration of this
Act. While I agree wjth my honourable friend
the Minister of Labour in the opinion that the
Bill in this formn hampers him, I must leave
him to work out bis own salvation, feeling
that bie is competent and will lie able to do
it, thoughlihe cannot witbin fifteen days mnake
as full a report as ought ta be madle.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: This legislation
proposes to give greater powers to the Administration to maintain "peace, order and good
government in Canada."
Does that
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
mean good government or bad government?
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: 1 merely quote
the words "good government in Canada."
Now, my bonourable friend lias just indicated,
weith respect ta this Bill, tliat at present we
have bad government in Canada. 1 arn
referring, not to tbe Administration itself,
but ta tbe fact tbat tbere is not the right
arrangement as between. the two Bouses of
Parliament for the condurt of tbe country's
business. Would senators and mem-bers of
Parliament not be better informed if every
minister, for tbe purpose of explaining buisl,
could appear in the Bouse in wbicb bie bas
not a seat? For example, would it not have
bren ta the advantage of the House of
Commons that the Minister of Labour (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) sbould be able ta go there
and make clear the intricacies of tbis mneasure,
whichlibe will bie administering?
The Riglit Hon. tbe Prime Minister is
credited with possessing a spirit of initiative.
I know lie is interested in maintaining barmoniaus and efficient relations between the
two Chambers. Be may be unaware of the
discussion that we liad liere on this matter
at the beginning of the presenit session. If
tbat is so, could it not bie drawn ta bis
attention? And when lie bas a few moments
af leisure, perliaps lie migbt consider tbe
suggestion that bis colleague could present
bills bere during the long debate on the
Address or on the Budget in the other House,
and that the Minister of Labour auglit ta
be able ta cross over ta tbe Commons ta
explain buis. I amn under tbe impression that
aur bonourable friend the Minister bas been
criticized because lie has a seat in the Senate.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Under clause 2
the Government becomes the assignee of the
powers conferred under the agreement with
the Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: Yes, but I should
like to know what effeet this cancellation will
have upon the fortunes of the company, which
bas heen granted powers by the Province of
Quebec under a lease that entails a number
of heavy obligations on the part of the comnpany. For instance, there was to be an annual
return of money to the province, and this
would go on increasing as the development
progressed. In what manner are the rights of
the province in thjs regard protected?
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Clause 4 of
Bill 144 covers that situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are dealing
with Bill 143.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: But the two
Bis go together.
Hon. Mr. TODD: I do not think the rights
of the province are affected. It is only the
water that is affected under the Order in
Council.
Righ't Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Quebec dlaims
the water.
Hon. Mr. TODD: Yes, but they get part
of it from here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that in -the matter of that development the
Federal Governmient reeognized but one duty
-to protect navigation, wlvicha cornes within
federil jurisdiction. In eonformity with the
division of constitutional powers, the autliorimation given by the Province of Quebec is
subject ùo the approval of plans by the federal
,authorities. That cosnpany, h-aving obtained
by Order in Council t.he authorization to proceed wi'th the work, and having secured the
approval of its plans, is now ledft without
power.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: 1 gather from
what was said in another place that the plans
were never appraved. It was not shown that
they lhed been approved by the Government.
The general
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
plan was approved, and there remained only
the question of the diversion of the water.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE- I think the
Order in Council called for the submission o
plans for approval by the Minister. The
Ministur neyer approved of ûny plans. That
was the statement made in another place.

543

'

Hon. Mr. TANNER: The Deputy Minister
of Pu.blie Workis, in giving evidence before
the Comimnittee, said very positively that these
plans had neyer been approved by -the
Minister.
H{op. Mr. BBDOOURT: May I draw my
honourable friend's attention to a matter that
has occurred to me by reason of what has
been saîd hy the leader on this side of the
House? The rights of the Province of Quebec,
whatever týhey may be, are reserved.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

In Bill 144.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the point
that my honourable friend to my left raised
a moment ago. But it occurs to me, and I
think it muet occur to -other members of the
Senate, that there are other rights, whicha
appertain to the public and which a.re not in
any way gurarded, saved or resecved by either
of these Bills. By section 1 of Bill 143 the
agreement between the Beauharnois Light,
Heat and Poýwer Company, Limited, and the
King, dated the 25th of June, 1929, is annulled.
Under the provisions of that agreement contracte and -agreements probably have been
entered into between the Beubarnois Coinpany and persons who have supplied either
work or inaterial for the construction, and
others who have bought the securities of this
company. I would ask whether their rights
are not wiped out by the cancellation of thc
agreement between the company and His
Ma] esty. It is quite proper to protect the
rights of the Province of Quebec, whatever
they may be; but what about the rights of
third parties who have had dealings with this
ecompany arising out of the agreement in question?
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: And the b.ondholders?

Hon. SMEATON WHITE: The Dominion
is to give certain rights to the water. The
province granted the charter, and it is for
the province to sec that the rights given under
that charter are protected in every way. I
think the province is going to look after those
rights. 1 do not think this legislation interferes in any way wîth rights granted by the
province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understand that.
But does that mean, in my honourable friend's
opinion, that the rights of third parties are
not and cannot be affected by either or both
of these Bills?
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: That you eaunot say.

be vested in the Province of Quebec over or in
respect of the use of the waters of the River
St. Lawrence for the development of hydroelectric power.
It says "the rights, if any." That raises the
question of ownership.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: In the other House just
now the Secretary of State has made an
amendment changing the words "the rights, if
any" to read "any rights".
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Then we are
discussing a Bill that is incorrectly worded,
for that amendment is not in here.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have two
trifling amendments here that would not affect
the point the right honourable gentleman is
discussing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is clause 4 of
Bill 144 amended?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If so, how is
it amended?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Section 4 is
not touched at all, according to the amendments that have been brought to me. In the
tenth line of the Bill, on the first page, the
words "New Welland Canal" have been
changed to "Welland Ship Canal."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am talking
about section 4.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have nothing
before me.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: The amendment I mentioned was made in the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am now told
that at the request of the Attorney General
of Quebec this Bill has been amended in accordance with the point I am making, and
the words "if any" have been stricken out.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: An amendment to section 4 has just come to me. The
section as amended reads:
Nothing in this Act contained shall be
deemed to affect any rights that may be vested
in the Province of Quebec over or in respect
of the use of the waters of the River St.
Lawrence for the development of hydro-electrie
power.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Evidently
members of the other House saw the light
while they were going through this Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The right
honourable gentleman's light shone over in
the darkness.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am informed
that the Attorney General of the Province
of Quebec has taken the saine stand as I
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

have with reference to this Bill. My honourable friend says that the words "New Welland
Canal" have been amended to read "Welland
Ship Canal." That is another change that
I was going to suggest. Most people refer
to the "Welland Canal," but there are the
New Welland Canal, the Old Welland Canal
and the Welland Ship Canal. The New
Welland Canal is the legal name of the
canal that is being superseded by the Welland
Ship Canal. We are not discussing the New
Welland Canal now.
Section 1 of Bill 144 provides:
The canal now being constructed by the
Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company,
Limited, a body corporate, incorporated under
the laws of the province of Quebec, between
Lake St. Francis and Lake St. Louis, on the
south side of, or in or along the St. Lawrence
River, and the works on lands or lands covered
with water, excavations, embankments, retaining structures, remedial works, dams, locks and
other works appurtenant to said canal, now
executed or hereafter to be executed, are
hereby declared to be works for the general
advantage of Canada.
The words "the works on lands or lands
covered with water" seem to me to leave it
open to the suggestion that the Government is
seeking to expropriate land that, according to
the Privy Council, belongs to the Province of
Quebec. This is one of my reasons for
declaring that the foundation is being laid
for a big row with that province, which
strongly adheres to the principle of privato
ownership. By declaring certain works to be
for the general advantage of Canada we cannot make them publicly owned. Any railway
may be declared to be a work for the general
advantage of Canada. It is under the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners, and subject to federal legislation,
but still it may be a private enterprise. It
seems to me that according to section 1 of
Bill 144 it may be said in Quebec that the
Dominion Govemrnent is in favour of private
enterprise, and in Ontario that it is in favour
of public ownership. The Ontario press is
taking the declaration that the works are
"works for the general advantage of Canada"
to indicate public ownership. In my opinion
Quebec would be perfectly justified in contending that some of this proposed legisiation
is ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I wonder
whether my honourable friend has the correct
amendments that have been made to Bill
143 in the other House?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If the Bills
we have been discussing are incorrect we
may have been wasting time.

AUGUST 1, 1931
Han. Mr.. WILLOUGHBY: Aanendanenta
have been coming over since the other House
met.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Information bas
been received indicating that section 2 of Bill1
143 has been amended in another place to
read:
The Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power
Company, Limited, its successors or assigna, in
so far as it may be within the competence of
Parliament, in hereby granted the right to
divert fromn Lake St. Francis up to but not
exceeding 53,072 cubic second feet of water of
the flow of the River St. Lawrence, to be
returned to Lake St. Louis and to be used for
the development of hydro-electrjc power between the two eaid points, in such manner,
upon such terms and conditions and with sucli
limitations and reservations as may be prescribed by Order of the Governor in Counci].
SAnd the first word of section 3, the word
"ino," is strieken out, as well as the worde
"efhal be made by said oompany," and nome
words are added. Thiat section now reade:
The Governor in Council shall not consent
to any further or additional diversion by the
said company of water of the River St.
Lawrence except with the express approval of
Parliainent.
These amendments seem. to be in accordance with rny right honourable friend's
suggestions.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
It la unfortunate that we did nlot have the Bis as
s.mended. Evidently ervery peint "bhtI have
taken lias been reognized.
Hon. Mr. BELCOTJRT: Honourable members, I have no brie£f for the company, and
amn nat concernedi about it at ail. It can
look after its own riglits. WithI regard ta the
rights of the Province of Quebec, I amn not
entiirely of the maine opinion as my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). I
do not think that section 3 of Bill 144 ini any
way affects the rights of the Province of
Quebec in this undertaking. That section
confers upon the Governor i
Couneil
the authority to acquire by purchase or
otherwise such lands and works as may be
deenied neoessary. That is merely autJiority
to acquire. The Bill declares the works to be
for the generah advantage of Canada. I suppose the Province of Quebec will be deait
with properly. The Governor ini Coun-ciýl may
be authorized to exercise certain powers, but
that does not confer any riglit in the property.
In the saine way a company rnay be given
authority to build a railway, but the company
would not tlhereby acquire the title to lands;
suci title could be aoaquired only froim the
owners. I arn nolt a.pprehensive that section 3
of Bull 144 will in any way affect the i'ighte
22112-Sa

M47

-of the Province of Quebec. They will rernain
as they are. But I du tbink we ouglit to
protect the rights of third parties who have
had deafings with tVi conipany and may be
concerned by the fact "hi the agreement
between the comrpany and the authorities at
Ottawa will be cancelied by this legisiation.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAREAM: As the Bill
.originally read, it raised the quest;ion whether
Quebec haëd any rights.
Hon. Mir. ROBERTSON: It may be interesting for my honourable friend the senior
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
to know that I heard it announced ini the
other House this afternoon that an eminent
lawyer, wha ha been 'iookring after the interests of the Quebec Governnient, assisted in
the draf tîng of these two Bills. Lt is ta be
aissurned that they are satisfactory ta the
Quebec Govieriment, whose riglits it in initended ta preerve in their entirety.
Hon. Mir. BELOOURT:

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Attorney
General of Quebec asked for the amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Lt miglit be
further observed, by reference ta the committee's report, that it very clearly indicates
that the work is not ta lie interfered with
any more than is absolutely necessary. Lt
;q ta be carried on by the present company
if they are able ta finance it, or by sucli other
financial arrangements as rnay be necessary,
either by way of public ownership or by way
of corporation ownership. I do not remember
the exact words of the report, but they can be
referred ta. Further, it seems evident that
the rights of the people who are carrying on
the construction are te be preserved if they
are able ta do their part ta complete it, and
the committee seemed ta make it abundantly
clear by its recommendations that in any case
the riglits of investors who have purchased
the bonds that have been sold are ta be amply
pratected. This legisiation was based on the
committee&s report, which was adopted in
another place without division.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I know I am
out of order. We ahI are. I should infer thal
this may he government ownership or it may
not he.

That is it.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

After whieh the Right Honourable the
Deputy Governor General was pleased to close

the Second Session of the Seventeenth Parliament of the Dominion of Canada with the
following Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I desire to thank you for the diligence and
efficiency with which yeu have discharged your
luties during the present session of Parliament.
The development of Canadian industry and
agriculture has been further promoted through
the measures you have enacted.
A Tariff Board has been created, one of the

funetions of

which will be to aid in the stahiliz-

ation of trade and the establishment of an
equitable relationship between the costs of production and consumption.
The changes provi-ded for in the system of
government accounting will, it is believed, make
for greater simplicity and more effective control over the finances of the country.
The measures granting assistance te the wheat
producer, and for the distribution of coal will
do much to assist those industries.
Among other important measures enacted
were Bills respecting: Copyright; Canadian
National Railway Company; Pensions; Soldiers
Settlement; Consolidated Revenue and Audit;
Vocational Education; The Royal Canadian
Mint; 0Wd Age Pensions.
Approval has been given the proposed meaaure of the Parliament of the United Kingdom
to be known as the Statute of Westminster,
and His Majesty The King has been humbly
petitioned to cause it te be laid before that
Parliament.
Prier to such approval heing
given, delegates of my Government and of ahl
the Provinces of Canada, at the invitation of
my Prime Minister, met at Ottawa and approved for insertion in the proposed measure
a clause defining the rights of the Dominion
and Provinces ln respect to its provisions.
The commercial agreement negotiated with
the Commonwealth of Australia andi ratified by
Parliament will, I confldently believe, be of
advantage to both our countries. This agreemuent manifests the desire of my Government
to enter into similar trade agreements with
other parts of the Empire.
The Iniperial Economic Conference, adjourned
last November to reassemble at Ottawa during
the latter part of the current year, has been
poetponed because of cireumstaîjces which prevented the representation at the conference of
aIl the dominions of the Empire. It is confidently believed that when this conference
reasscmbles, an Empire trade agreement of advantage to ail its parts may be consummated.
The Conversion Loan of 1931, through which
tîjere was reinvested in securitiee of the Dominion of Canada a sum of approximately six
hundred and forty million dollars, affords
striking proof of the confidence of the general
public in the financial strength of the country.
As a result of the Parliamentary inquiry into
the operations of the Beauharnois Power Corporations, measures have been enacted te secure
the public interest against haxrmful exploitation
of our natural resources and te safeguard the
rights of bona fide investors.

AUGUST 3, 1931
8&nce you entereci upon 1he duties of the session, the world-wide depression in economic
conditions has grown more acute, and the consequent state of unemployment and distress iu
many partis of 1he country has been intensifieci
through the pairtial failure of th. wheat crop
of Western CJana-da. To augment exiîting relief
meaeures, the Governor in Council has been empowered ta take the necessary action ta provide
the maximum of employpment and to aid, by
such means as may b. deemed expedient, 1he
recovery from the adverse conditions arising
primarily f rom 1he crop failure.
The great powers of Europe and America,
following the generous and constructive action
of the President of the Unitedi States of
America, which Canada whole-heartedly endorses, are unitedly striving for the re-establishment of better world conditions. Towardu
this purpose w. may now effectively contribute,
by steadfastly bendin4g ourselves 10 th. task cf
freeing Canada from 1h. consequences of this
universal satate of economic depression and cf

ô

the particular miafortune which hai befallen
the West; no that this country may be ready
to take ita place in the forefront of the world's
recovery.
Members of the Roues of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you have made
for the publie service.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the Hous af Commons:
1 join with you in sympathy for those upon
whom the prisent conditIions bear mail heavily.
Ai our burden is leos than that of other countries, io have we, as a Nation, the greater duty
to aid the unfortunate among our citizens. I
coxnmend your zeal for the common good. Il is
the crowning proof of the unassailable unity
of the Canadian people. These troubled times
will pais, for adversity is powerless againit
the wilI of Canada 10 regain the happinesa
and prosperity which are ils birlhrighl. May
Divine Providence bless and guide you ini al
your labours.
